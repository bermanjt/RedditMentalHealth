0,"Hi, I’m having a really tough time with life right now. Not sure what to do - any advice would be appreciated. I recently moved to a new city (for a new job), where I don’t have many friends and my boyfriend and I are now doing long-distance. I’ve found out that I’m really not the type of person who can do long-distance; I just feel really sad and lonely all of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, one month ago, a drunk neighbor walked into my apartment late at night (not sure how, possibly I left the door unlocked). I was asleep at the time and woke up to strange noises coming from the living room. I was very scared and immediately called 911. I thought it was some intruder who wanted to potentially hurt me. Ever since then, I’ve felt really unsafe, paranoid, and anxious and can’t sleep alone anymore. I’ve resorted to crashing at friends’ or coworkers’ apt and I’ve been feeling extremely exhausted and have had a tough time at work ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve also been traveling back and forth between cities due to long-distance and it’s been really tough and stressful. I value physical companionship a lot so it’s been super hard. I think due to the above things, I’m starting to get depressed - I tried seeing a therapist but it doesn’t seem to be that helpful. I’m unable to change my job due to visa issues. Really in a bad place right now and I don't feel like I can live like this, and I don't know what to do.. I know there's probably no magical solution for my problems but if anyone has any advice that could be helpful, I could really use it.",03May2019,1
1,"I've been with my boyfriend for a year and it's going really well. We decided a few months back we want to move in together. It's been kind of hard to plan because my lease isn't up until November, whereas his is up in August. 

&amp;#x200B;

He lives with another couple and the initial plan was for me to try to get out of my lease early (I live by myself) and find a place that can suit all four of us, primarily for financial reasons (rent is extremely high in my city). For a while this was an idea I was comfortable with because 1) I pay a lot in rent by myself and it's been very draining financially, so I would welcome cheaper rent and 2) my bf wasn't making very much.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, due to circumstances I am no longer comfortable with this arrangement. For one, my landlord is a bit of a slumlord and has recently done some very shady things (tried to say I never paid a pet deposit for my cat and threatened to evict me if I didn't pay him $400 within the week, until I showed proof of me paying said deposit) and I don't think I am comfortable even attempting to get out of my lease out of fear of him pulling some shady stuff. Also, one of my bf's roommates has been less than pleasant to me at times to the point I never feel comfortable around her. I sense she feels a sense of jealousy toward me because, prior to me being in the picture, she relied on my bf for emotional support in ways her partner couldn't...and he's not done that as much since he met me and she clearly resents me for it. He has talked to her numerous times about it and she will be nice to me for, like, a week and then go back to being how she always is. So, I've kinda given up.  And, finally, my bf recently scored a job with great pay and I don't trust his roommates to not try to get him to cover for them. Just this month they were on social media begging for rent money...and if the four of us were to get a place together, their rent amount (which is not very much, it is less than half of what I pay for my place) would likely be the same as what they're paying now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked it over with my bf and, while he is sad to no longer live with his best friend (the bf of the roommate who isn't great to me), he has agreed that it would not be fair on me to have to live with the problematic roommate/risk my credit and renter history. So, he and I decided that he is going to move in to my place in August (which will save me so much money and the both of us will be able to save for a few months) and find a better apartment for us to move in to (with, hopefully, a less sketchy landlord!!) when the lease is up in November.

&amp;#x200B;

We, however, have not brought this up to his roommates. He has been spending more and more time at my place (it is an easier commute to his new job from my place than from his) and we have experienced some snarky comments about it. I am admittedly a little avoidant at times and tried to hint at it by mentioning to the problematic roommate that I no longer felt comfortable trying to break my lease, to which she responded ""oh we can maybe go month to month or extend our lease by 6 months!"" and has suddenly started treating me in a super sweet, kind way since I mentioned that.

&amp;#x200B;

So I need advice. I don't know how to break this to his roommates. I worry that if I am the one to tell them, I'll seem like the evil succubus girlfriend taking him away from them. I don't know if it's even my job to talk to them given I'm not currently sharing a lease with them, but rather my bf's. My bf plans to talk to the problematic roommate about her treatment of me (again) and perhaps will break it to her then but, again, I'm worried she will lash out at me for it in the long run. I'm worried about the next few months being really bad because we no longer want to live with them, and I will feel incredibly guilty if my bf loses his best friend over this. I also feel guilty because the two of them already seem to struggle financially and I don't know if the two of them can afford an apartment together. How can I (or we, or he) go about this in a way that does the least amount of damage? What would be the best course of action here?",03May2019,1
2,"* Might be uncomfortable for some people.

During my childhood (early 2000’s) I was friends with this girl who really enjoyed making home videos. Usually it was just parodies and comedy, but eventually it turned into music videos and then more explicit(?) music videos. Long story short; she started to film us (me and two other girls) in the nude while dancing. Most of the time we would wear a skirt with no underwear and lift it up in front of the camera. I never went fully nude, but my friends did. One of my friends really went all out, and I remember that it made me super uncomfortable. The girl who filmed was 10 at the time (same as me) and the two other girls were 8.  After a  while my friend who «went all out» started to undress on a regular during filming. She’d wear see-through tutu skirts with no underwear and my filming-friend (this is kinda fckd up) would give her candy as a reward for doing so. It seemed like she was really into seeing us nude and I’m just wondering WHY? 

What causes this behavior in children? And is it normal? I always thought it was weird, but didn’t say anything because she was the leader of the group. Could it be that she was just trying to mimic what she saw on TV? She loved music videos, especially Christina aguilera’s «dirty», she liked the sexy stuff. Is this normal behaviour for a ten year old? Btw she’s not really weird or anything, and she stopped this behaviour pretty quickly, but I’m just wondering what caused it. Was it just curiosity? 

* Also the videos are long gone, I’m sure of it. This was beyond ages ago and we only had one roll to film on so we’d usually have to tape over our already existing films.",03May2019,1

I know he won't like it because my boyfriend and I aren't married. My family are all very traditional Christians so I know almost no one in my family will approve, I'm just concerned about my dad's feelings about it because I need him to help me move my stuff.
There are many reasons why I want to move out, but the main reason is because there are better resources where he lives that I could get to without driving (he lives in a city, I live in a small rural town).
I struggle with clinical depression and general anxiety disorder so I need easy access to therapy and things like that, but living in a very small town in an extremely rural area doesn't give me the access to the resources I need, and the nearest resources are minimum half an hour away (there are some in town but I live outside of town so I can't access those easily either).
Being able to get around without driving is so important to me because I have a terrible fear of it due to various traumatic experiences and nightmares due to the trauma.
A big reason I can't stay at home is because i experienced alot of trauma in this house due to growing up with an abusive mother.

6,"So for some backstory (TLDR at bottom). I work in a fabrication shop that is kinda small. We have about 25 people that work there at the most and most of us have been there 3+ years. We're all pretty close in the shop. Now I'm a white dude and our shop is predominantly black. Everyone gets along. We know each other's families, go to birthday parties for each other, know each other's children etc. We're tight knit since we've seen each other every day for 40+ hours a week for years. Recently there was a job bid put up for a temporary welding position at my job. Being a welder for the better part of 5 years I put my name on the bid and so did one of the guys who is accusing me of being racist. Well call him D. So D and I take the weld test and I finished mine everything looked good. Unfortunately D got started forgot to turn his gas on, got angry and didn't take it. D had weeks to prepare for this and he made it seem like he was a certified welder but the weld test proved different. He got mad and started saying that the lead guy should have set his machine up for him and he didn't because we both don't like black people. He said that I'm racist and that I got the job because I'm white not because I know what I'm doing. D and his cousin who also works there have told 3 separate black people that I was racist when they got hired and I got asked 3 different times if I was because of them. Most recently they told a Co-worker that I didn't want to work with him because he was black and he brought it up to me and told me that he didn't believe them anyways. I called them out on it and they both denied it and acted like they were telling people ""I wasn't racist"" because ""other"" people said i was and I know that wasn't true. I know that D is mad that I got the welding job over him and him and his cousin are trying to screw me over in my job. Everyone in there knows that I'm not racist (otherwise they wouldn't hang out with me or associate with me) I'm just worried that they're going to go to the boss and accuse me of saying / doing something racist and I'll get fired for it. What can I do about this? Or what can do to protect myself incase something like this does happen? 

TLDR: A person at my job is a accusing me of being racist because I got a welding job ""he deserved"" even though we both took the same weld test that I passed and he failed and I'm worried he's going to try to use that to get me fired. What do?",03May2019,3
7,"So, being the immature dumb freshman boy I am, I was short on money so I went to my parents to get some. But not to ask. I went into their safe and took 500 dollars. Cash. Now, my parents save a lot, and both have middle class jobs, so 500 dollars isn't exactly a make or break/life or death/ kind of money (especially cause the envelope was titled ""boys birthdays""). I've had a guilty conscience ever since I took it, however the bad part is, I already spent it all. Now, I've been looking for ways to repay it, but not being of age to legally get a job yet as well as not knowing where to look to get {500 dollars}, I havent really achieved or gotten anything done. Now, this is all bad, but if I had the summer to pay it off, I would easily do it and not write this. HOWEVER, my birthday is this month. Parents are already asking what I want. I've tried to say ""no cash"" ""nothing really"", but I know that will only save me for so long. I need advice on how to get 500 dollars as a 14 year old boy. And no, going to my parents isn't exaclty an option.

8,"So i have a couple friends, and although we share some common values, there are certain ones that I just cannot ignore. For one, in terms of politics, they fall on the other side of the scale. For me, its not a matter of left or right. But a matter of working people vs the elite and rich.

Every now and then we argue. A recent argument was about climate change and global warming. My friends deny this, and even after i provide them with evidence they brush it off and equate weather with global warming and climate change. For example, if climate change/global warming is real, how come we’ve had record cold temperature the past several days?

Even after i explain to them the difference between weather and global temperature and climate change, they still argue im wrong, and that im stupid.

It frustrates me extremely and makes me think about how i could continue being friends with people that fundamentally are arrogant and want to stay ignorant on a topic i hold dear to my heart and that everyone should hold dear to their hearts.

9,"So I became friends with a guy in uni, week after week he keeps calling me every time I finish classes, texts me about uni or assignments if I did them just to strike up a convo, on snapchat he comments on every pic I post, and if its a selfie he always sends hearts and compliments my looks. 

It’s really becoming annoying because he’d always call the wrong times. I started to ignore his calls, reply his texts with one words yet he’s relentless.

12,"I applied to a job here in California (you definitely know of it...run by the Mouse himself 😬) after losing my job in February.

However recently I got nervous they’d forget about me, called about possibly starting that process early and was informed that they’d given that position to someone else who could fill it sooner and the  position has been removed from their hiring website. I’m not mad about this I get it and I know they could still call once my availability opens up and offer me a different position but I’m nervous...what if that doesn’t happen? There’s obvious pros and cons to this position, it’s a long drive through bad traffic but it’s fun and pay would be good.

He was yelling at the servers from across the restaurant to come wipe down a table, as I was wringing out a rag to go do that very thing. I held the rag up in the air and said “I’m getting it right now.” A few minutes later he got all close to me and started saying how he wasn’t even talking to me and how I need to chill out and how he’s sick of my attitude. So, I got pretty aggravated when he did this, and I told him to stop telling me what to do because I know what I’m supposed to do (and I do his job for him countless times a shift).

My mom knew how bad that I wanted to go so she said that she was willing to bring me and my friends and pick us up afterwards…

my uncle, who is into the same bands as I, and is younger than my mother, was going to bring us but he has work. My mom had told me earlier today that she wanted to come into the concert with me. I listed off a bunch of reasons why she shouldn’t like 1) she isn’t into metal of any sort , 2) she gets anxious very easily and has extreme panic attacks in large social situations 3) there are mosh pits [her and i have talked about before how she can’t stand them] 4) people go crazy [especially at the one i’m going to] and 5) just the pure fact that i know she’d be uncomfortable

I eventually ended up yelling at her saying “ mom I know you’re going to freak out just don’t go you can literally drive around town for the three hours the concert is” .  I could tell that she was hurt and I tried very hard to fix the situation by saying “mom i’m not trying to be mean you’re like my bestfriend but i know the things that make you uncomfortable and you’ll end up having an anxiety attack i just love you too much to have to watch you do that.” &gt;&gt;

20,"I work for a company that has a few adult foster care homes for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. I started as a regular staff member at an unsecured, meaning the residents at the home tend to have less serious behaviors and are pretty independent. That position allowed me to pick up a lot of overtime as it wasn’t a very physically or mentally demanding position at the time. All that overtime provided lots of learning experiences, and they offered me a team leader position in one of the secured homes. Our secured homes are for those with more serious mental health issues or need to stay in a locked house with a fence so they cannot get into the community without staff. As a team leader, I have a lot more responsibility. I supervise all staff regularly assigned to the home, take the 6 residents of the home to all their appointments, and still complete regular day to day staff tasks. My home also houses 2 residents who can only be taken out in the community with me, as I received special training and clearances to take the position at that home. So anytime those two need to go get something from the store, see a doctor or anything that can’t be done from home, I have to fit taking them out into my work schedule. The residents at my new home are great individuals, but it is more mentally challenging to work with them versus my old residents because my new residents often become violent or try to run away due to their mental health issues. When I accepted the position, I told my chief of operations I wanted to go down to 5 shifts a week and maybe occasionally pick up one or two. He agreed and I did that for about two weeks, but then I was having trouble fitting everything in and switched to one double (16 hour shift) a week. After a while, I felt one specific task that needed to be done Friday nights, the night I work an extra shift, could be done by other staff members and not just me, so I asked the CFO if we could put someone else on that night, and I could go back to 5. He said he’d work on it, I said no rush as I had agreed to work the shift previously. Four months later, we haven’t assigned anyone to the shift. The owner’s niece got an HR position there, and asked me if I would work a Sunday afternoon (I’m off Saturdays and Sundays) until they hired someone to fill that spot. I didn’t really want to, as the increase in job responsibilities had me really looking forward to my weekend every week, but said yes because I’m a people pleaser. Today, she asked me if I would work a Sunday morning shift next week too (a 16 hour shift on what’s supposed to be my day off). I haven’t responded yet, but I’m feeling frustrated and unappreciated like they don’t think I’m doing enough for them already. Yes, I worked a lot as a staff member, but with my change in responsibility I am already feeling overwhelmed at just the thought of all those hours. I can’t really trade any of my other shifts either, as I am scheduled for appointments or tasks only I can do almost every day Monday-Friday. I really don’t want to work those and feel like I’m already giving 110%, but I feel obligated to say yes as it’s the owner’s niece and I want them to have a high opinion of me.",03May2019,1

I want to go back and study cs because I feel it is much more relaxed and not as much “thinking on your toes.” 

And to clarify, I’m talking about things like driving machinery that can cause millions of dollars of damage in 2 seconds.

Some people are telling me to just stick it out and be happy with 80k but I feel like I just can’t.

Is it me or am I just in the wrong field?",03May2019,1
28,"I’ve been seeing this guy for 9 months. Just got out of a relationship and I wanted a fuck buddy. We both love to drink and pot. We hangout on weekends at my place and drink. That’s how we hit it off. I was clear from the beginning that it was just sex. And he told me it was more than that and see how it goes. Saturday’s was our “routine”. Sometimes we would hook up on weekdays too. 

9 months has pass and I’m starting to think about him lot. We started hooking up at his place instead. I’m getting to know him deeper. I stare at him a lot. Sex is starting to be passionate. 

I’ve been day dreaming of him a lot and sometimes I wonder. Are these feelings just fed by my imagination or I’m really falling for him. 

I really get nervous in front of him and it doesn’t help that English is not my first language. I get intimated talking so I’m usually quiet around him unless I’m buzzed. 

I’m starting to have intense feelings but I’m not sure if I’m falling or just love the idea of falling in love. Or is this lust perhaps.",03May2019,1

So, I went over there and I really didn’t want to get out of the car to go knock on the front door. I was so hesitant, but I did, cuz I knew it had to be done. Serenity opened the door with her mom right there to greet me. She introduced herself and I did the same. The conversation lasted but a couple minutes. She told me it was nice to finally meet me, and asked me questions she seemingly knew the answers to(she’s talked with Serenity about me)? as verification questions I’m assuming, just to break the ice. Like “So you go to this school and you live near here” and similar talk. I asked her if I could take her daughter to prom (as prom is this Saturday) out of respect. She said of course and asked how we were getting there, and I answered, along with a few last questions and a bit of small talk. I’d say it went pretty well, other than the fact I was shaking and nervous the whole time!
Serenity later texted me how her mom was ‘impressed’ and liked me very much, one reason being I drove almost 30 miles from my house to hers just for a two minute talk with her. 
All in all, she was very nice and pleasant to talk to. I’m very pleased I went there today.

And thank you to the commenters on my previous post giving me your advice! ❤️

32,"I’m going to keep people’s names and the site the server is on anonymous, but gender and basic ideas of age are important factors here.

So I (Female adult) run a server for a video game I enjoy. Since the video game is family friendly, the server is 13+ (which follows the site’s guidelines). In that server are three main active members involved. Bob (Male minor), Steve (Male adult) and Jim (Male adult). Jim is basically second in command on the server and has done so much for the place, especially since I’m not really knowledgeable in a lot of the stuff. I somewhat depend on him in a friendly way for a lot of the server’s breakthroughs and owe a lot to him. Bob and Steve are normal members, but became really good friends.

Well it’s been brought to my attention by Steve and some people on Twitter that Jim did a sexual online role play with a minor. I’m not sure if this happened multiple times or just once and I’m not really knowledgeable on RP, but it’s still disgusting regardless. Jim has gotten himself banned from servers and at one point in the server’s life had to make a new account for the server since his previous one got banned. I didn’t know the real reason until now.

After finding this out, shit hit the fan a little. Jim kicked Steve out of the server minutes after me finding out everything because he felt uncomfortable. Jim admitted to it but says that it was months ago, realised that he’s in the wrong and has changed but hasn’t said anything else to me except that it was an accident and that he forgot to ask for the minor’s age first. The part that freaks me out the most is that Bob (who is the minor out of the four of us) forgives Jim. I’m still in contact with Steve and will invite him back, but after 

Of course my main course of action is to remove Jim or do something about him, even if it means that my server will go three steps back in breakthroughs. What matters most to me is that the members of my server are safe. 

But how should I go about this? This is the first bad thing that’s happened on the server and I’ve been running for for five months.",03May2019,1
33,"My mother and father are leaving to another country for God know’s how many months. 
In a way, they are moving there and will make visits here. Not to sure what they’re plans for the future are but they are getting older. They might move back if they find a place they are comfortable. They are both 72 years old age. I am 28. I can’t leave the country now because I am under an immigration process that does not allow me to leave, and I really don’t know how long it will last for me to get a decision. 

I didn’t know about this move, which will be on May 14th, until yesterday. May 2nd. She said she is planning for all of us (her 5 adult children, we all live mo more than 2 hours away from eachother ) to get together on Mothers day, may 10th. Not knowing she was going to make this big move, I had scheduled a trip 3 months ago, asked for vacation at work, prepared and shopped for it up until this moment. My partner and I have together actually. The trip is from May 8 - May 12. It is a camping, retreat, yoga, workshops, music, festival event, "" Lighting in a Bottle"" for those who are familiar. And no I am not going to party and do drugs, I enjoy the spiritual, disconnected from work and technology, retreat aspect to it.  It is a yearly event. 

I spoke with my mom and she said she understands, that I should keep my plans. That I can be with her any other day. If I went with that option, I would spend a day with her and my father this weekend. I would also shorten the trip a day so I can spend time with them on Monday the 13, the day before they leave, as well as taking them to the airport to say goodbye. Am I a bad daughter for keeping the trip plans ? Will I likely regret this ? Is it important for a mother to have all her kids in one place at once, or does she really understand as she says she does.",03May2019,1
34,"Hey, so a little background.

I’m a 16 year old girl, and my junior prom is in 9 days. I’ve been really excited these past few months, as most teenage girls are. Only problem is, I still don’t have a dress and I don’t think I’ll be getting one anytime soon.

My parents, mostly my mom, because my dad doesn’t invest time or efforts into things I like unless it benefits him as well, agreed to pay for my dress. I would’ve paid for it myself if I could, but I take 3 AP classes, hold officer positions in several clubs I’m involved in, play a sport and have been gone virtually every Saturday these past few months for competitions in something I’m involved in (I’m avoiding being specific just in case someone I know finds this.) a job is 100% out of the question until summer, unless I want to have a mental breakdown, which I’ve already had several this year due to stress. 

Anyways, my mom gave me a budget of under 100$ dollars which I found reasonable because I didn’t want anything extravagant, and my school has only like 1400 something students so prom is not a huge spectacle. I found a dress I liked about 4 weeks ago that was 20+ dollars under the budget, and my mom liked it as well. I thought I would be fine because my mom agreed to buy it. I thought that was the end of it, but I checked in a week later to see if she brought it. She didn’t. The same happened for a good 2 weeks afterwards, until last weekend when I finally had time to properly confront her. She never gave me a specific reason but basically said “I don’t think I need to spend that much on a dress for your junior prom.” 
First, the dress was 80 dollars, and I had an account on the website that would qualify me for a discount so it’d be even cheaper. Moneys definitely not a problem as I live a very fortunate lifestyle. And just two weeks ago, my parents ditched me to go to an amusement park, overnight, after I’d finished up at a stressful competition in the aforementioned event I compete in, but I digress. Also, the whole “it’s only junior prom” argument doesn’t work because since my school is fairly small, there’s no difference between going to prom junior and senior year. We don’t even have a venue or a dinner with all our classmates like bigger schools. Plus, she paid for my older siblings prom outfits their senior year when they were more than eligible to get jobs themselves (neither of them were super involved in school and spent most weekends out with friends.) 

I keep pestering her about getting a dress and have literally lowered my price about 40+ dollars, on dresses I barely even like, just so I’ll finally have a dress but she keeps ignoring me, changing the subject or telling me “we’ll talk about this later.” I’m worried because this what she normally does when she plans on not doing something she said she would do.

For example:

- she said she would take me to a concert. Day before concert rolls around, I ask if she’s giving me a ride, she says no. I ask if someone else could give me a ride, she says no. Day of concert comes around, turns out, she could’ve taken me, but decided I didn’t deserve to go.

- they got a puppy, supposedly “only” for my little brother, but I’ve been stuck being the only one taking care of him these past few months while managing everything else in my life. My mom decides she’s sick of the dog and wants to sell it, after making me do basically raise it for the bulk of my junior year.

- almost made me miss my SAT while they were out of town. They eventually found me a method of transportation, but the fact that they were even considering making me miss it is messed up enough. 

- homecoming, freshman year, my mom and I excitedly discuss dresses. Week after week passes by and eventually I don’t have a dress, shoes, makeup, or accessories  while all my friends’ parents provided the following for them. I ask my mom to take me to a cheap store, the day of homecoming since she neglected my request weeks before, so I can hopefully browse the racks for something cheap and simple, but she refuses. I consider not even going but find some random dress in my closet and wore Tiek flats, and some old eyeshadow. (To those of you who don’t know what they are, they’re basically orthopedic shoes. Imagine 14 year old me, already insecure, showing up to a raunchy homecoming dance in those while all of my friends are in cute dresses, nicely done makeup and cute, mini heels.) sophomore year, I also wore a random dress from my closet. Didn’t even bother going this year, though I suppose I could’ve looked how I wanted to because I still had money left from my summer job and birthday.

- I’ve been trying to get my permit for a year. When we’re all finally free on weekends, I ask if they can take me and they’re like sure, but never actually do. 

The weird thing is, she’s offered to do my hair and take me to get my nails done, and frequently follows through with those things, but both of those things are irrelevant to me without a dress. I’d honestly rather skimp out on those two things if it meant I’d have a dress. 
 
Should I even bother trying to get her to get my prom dress? I don’t wanna set myself up for disappointment, as per usual. Any advice is helpful, please avoid being harsh. I know it’s kind of a silly problem, but it’s the result of a much larger issue I have with my parents.",03May2019,1

36,"I ordered sushi on skip the dishes for lunch instead of buying lunch from school today. We ordered about $40 worth of sushi and was expecting it to come at 1:30pm. (An hour after ordering) I checked my phone every 10 minuted but there was no progress in someone picking up my order.

So school ends( 2 and a half hour of waiting) and the food never comes. I spoke to 10 different chat agents to help me, and they are all USELESS! 

By now its 4:30, and I talk to one guy on skip support and he said he woulf reimburse me for the whole cost of my order once it arrives. So I wasnt as fustrated, but still a bit. I also called the restaurant that I ordered from, and they said they made it, but no one is coming! Theyve trief calling skip the dishes multiple times too! So I keep waiting at school with my friends until 5, still nothing. 

And now, at 6pm, thid lady calls from skip headquarters or something and tells me they are going to cancel my order and she only can give me $10 worth of skip credits! 

So I lose my free meal that I was offered and I only get $10 from them for waiting more than 5 hours!!!

This is unacceptable service from Skip. If they were to tell me sooner, I could have gone home right afterschool, but I waited! I wasted my time and I was hungry just to be given $10 worth of credits??? 

IM NEVER GOING TO USE SKIP THE DISHES AGAIN! RIDICULOUS!

37,"My boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me about a week and  a half ago. We are both almost 21 and have been together since we were 16. I am trying to put the pieces together to why he feels the way he does.  
This all came very suddenly. Not even a few days before the breakup he was speaking confidently about buying new furniture for the new place we were going to rent. He gave me no indication that he didn't love me or intended to not be with me in the future. A week before we had serious conversations about moving to another state after we've saved the money. 

The landlords to the new place finished cleaning it early and  said that we can start moving in on the first after we signed the lease.  After I told him this, He got up from his seat and claimed that he need to speak to our roommate about the move. They go for a long walk. After they come back, I ask my roommate what the conversation was about and he told me not to press it. I then asked if we were still moving and he said that he didn't know. I knew something was wrong. I pressed him to tell me what was wrong and he wouldn't. he said he needed time to think and get his words straight before he told me. But as the night went on, I became more anxious. Finally he told me his feelings that he felt like he loved me very much and that I was his best friend but he wasn't in love with me. He skirted around the subject often.  
When he finally tells me the truth that he wants to separate, I am in hysterics. I'm losing the love of my life and my companion of 5 years. He calls my mom to come pick me up and my family packs my things while he is at work and I am moved out by the end of the night to stay at my parents in the next city away.

  
we talked about a week later so we can get closure. He tells me that after his mom died something changed inside of him, but he didn't know what. And very very soon after her death he claims that he fell out of love with me. and he attributes it all to this change. He says he loves and cares for me incredibly, he's just not in love with me. He tells me he wants to figure himself out.  
7 months ago is when his mom died and we both went through many hardships. For my own many personal reasons I was incredibly depressed, the most depressed I had ever been was since October until the break up. Obviously depression changed me. it made me irrational and irritable and awful. depression had me deep in its grips. I feel that because of my character change because of my depression is a reason why he began to fall out of love.

My wonderful fiance who I love very much is self-proclaimed ""vanilla"" sexually. And he has more or less proved this time and time again. He gets very shy and embarassed when we talk about sex at all. Especially lingerie for some reason. I'm his first partner so that's understandable. He gets very jumpy when I'm around his computer, and admittedly says hes ashamed of the porn he looks at. 

However, due to the stigma that he is so shy about this, it means he is actually a closeted freak... I have other reasons for my suspicions, however. One of which being he has admitted a sexual attractions to dragons and when he gets drunk he's a lot more.. *Ahem* ... Dominant. He also enjoys raunchy sexual jokes. But they're funny so what does that mean lol.

I love him and enjoy making love with him. But i want him to be more comfortable and for me to be able to give him what really wants.

50,"Hey Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a standard 21 year old dude has a 9-5 job, plays videogames, goes partying on the weekend and who lives with his grandparents and 1 junkie uncle. I used to live with my mom however moved in with my grandparents when I was young as she did not have time to look after me due to work now that I'm working it's way more convienent to stay where I am at the moment. I also get more freedom living here since its more accessible to central town as well as my mom being a tiger mom.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandparents went on holiday 2 months ago and will be returning in another 1-2 months. Everyone in my family was aware of their holiday, including my mom, so she offered for me to move back in with her but I declined since I'm so comfortable here. Leaving my uncle and I to look after ourselves as well as the house. My uncle doesn't work and stays home in his room all day - not only is he unemployed, he is also an alcoholic and takes drugs (not as often as drinking, but he'd smoke a joint every other day). He has been like this for a few years now, however a year or so ago something happened to him or mustve taken a strong ass drug that's caused him to lose his marbles. He doesn't talk normally and would repeat himself a lot when trying to get a sentence out or would finish the sentence but just say it again. He hasn't taken a shower or washed his clothes in god knows how long. He does go outside but only to buy beer or groceries or sometimes see his friends (i guess?). Before he got crazy he rented an apartment which he now has rented out to someone which is some form of income for him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So given the background of my situation, you can probably guess that the house is in a shitty state. The bins don't get taken out as often so there's flies everywhere. Same with the dishes that sit in the sink for a day or two. The worst thing is that my uncle would get super drunk and I guess there's something wrong with his bladder that he just shits himself whilst rushing to the toilet. As sometimes late at night I hear loud and fast walking, bumping into the walls and stairs, but wouldn't be bothered or too tired to check what is happening outside my room. However in the morning I find that there's faeces on the stairs, toilet floor and toilet seat.

Believe it or not, this has happened multiple times. The first time it happened was probably 1 year ago with my grandparents still home, he got a massive grilling for it. The next time it happened was 2 weeks into my grandparents holiday, so it was just me to find out wtf happened and had to clean it up. I thought let me just clean it up and nevermind it since the last time it happened was 1 year ago. However the offer of moving back with my mom became a consideration. The 2nd time there was a lot more faeces left outside of the toilet so this got me pissed which I banged on his door to come clean it up, which he did not admit to doing but he ended cleaning it up albeit not a good job as there was still skidmarks and leftover soo I cleaned up the rest. This happened another 2 times and everytime this happens I get 1 step closer to accepting my moms offer of moving back.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm writing this now as I'm basically on my last straw but not sure how I can bring it up with my mom since it is still her brother, she is aware that he has gone cuckoo, or why I'm suddenly accepting the offer, and if I tell her what's been happening how is she gonna react.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving back with my mom would mean:

Pros:

 \- away from shitty uncle

 \- yummy home cooked food

 \- I was recently ill and it was a ball ache doing everything by myself

 \- more likely to look after myself better

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: 

 \- Helicopter mom - though, with her new bf he is convincing her that she doesn't need to babysit me 24/7

 \- Waaay slower internet (im a huge PC gamer - atleast 5 hours a day)

 \- Less privacy and freedom",03May2019,1
51,"I am currently sitting on two job offers **for an internship**, so they aren't particularly binding as they end when summer does.  As a preface, let's call them job A and B.  I'm in computer engineering.

Job A is with a company I interned for in 2017.  Relatively nice place, close to my school, and pays very very well (~24 USD/hr).  The work challenges me a bit like any job would, but it's not something beyond my skill level.  However, it's a relatively boring workplace.  Everyone is a boomer and I get a strong feeling that chances for upward growth there are very small.  That being said I don't mind working there again as an intern.  They asked me to come back last year, but I declined since I had found a new job in a foreign country.  

The problem has to do with this country since I've fallen in love with it.  The people are great, the work culture there is something I like, made tons of friends there last year (was there for 7 months).  In my time there I worked for a great company, very nice to me, covered food and travel, brought me all around the country for business trips and just generally fun work environment.  With this company I met tons of people professionally as well, so my network there is surprisingly bigger than mine in the U.S.  Through this company I met the president of a small company offering Job B, and he's a very nice guy and we got along well.  2018 company is not offering work again this year though.

The problem being that co-operative work in that country isn't much of a concept like in the U.S., so pay is less than half of Job A if even that.  Moreover, I hadn't heard from Job B on whether or not they could take me after almost a month, so I asked Job A if they'd take me in again this year.  Of course, as luck would have it, they both emailed me on the same day saying they'd take me.

I'm really having difficulty deciding which one to go with, and I've been agonizing over it for days (time is running out too).

**Job A**

+Pays well

+Close to school, so I can find cheaper one year lease housing for myself from now to May 2020 and get out of temporary crappy school housing with nasty roommates who I can't pick

+Know what the work is like there, and it's not a problem at all

-Future seems dim for post-grad opportunities with this company

-Very very boring town, would likely not do much after work/on weekends

-saying no after just asking for a job makes me look really bad

**Job B**

+Nice boss, likely many paid for business trips/company dinners

+Extremely fun country, tons to do, last year was time of my life

=Unknown work environment (different company from what I worked at last year, but affiliated closely with last year's company, 
would meet often)

-Expensive country, low pay for interns, will need to take out loan (plane cost, low pay, likely spending more on fun stuff)

-Finding place to live back in U.S. from September-May not as easy/cheap if not randomly assigned by my school

Any advice as to even how to look at this would be appreciated",03May2019,1
52,"Not really sure where to start as everything is still so fresh. It will probably be long, jumbled mess so bare with me. 

For the past week or so my college had been sending out alerts regarding a man who’d been breaking into houses (some of which were down the street from my complex) and committing sexual assault. Before, me and my roommates weren’t the best at remembering to lock the doors, especially while at class. But, ever since hearing about this man, we became really diligent about remembering to lock the door. Obviously, our efforts didn’t work. 

That same man that had been in all of the alerts broke into my house today and raped 2 out of my 3 roommates. The two that were raped are my absolute best friends in the entire world. I’ve known them we were 5 years old. We’ve literally done everything together. I’m devastated. Without going into too much detail, this man not only raped them, but also physically harmed them. 

I haven’t been allowed in my house all day (I came home after it happened) as it’s still an active crime scene, and I haven’t been allowed to speak to either of them. The only reason I know exactly what happened is because my 3rd roommate was there during the entire incident and told me everything. 

I wish I could be there for my friends right now, but I’m not allowed to see or speak to them. I know they’ll probably want space when everything calms down, but what (ANYTHING AT ALL) can I do to let them know I’m here for them? To show them I love them, and I’m so sorry this happened to them. That they don’t deserve it. 

Please let me know.",03May2019,1

Now fast forward to six months later and I am still worried something will happen to him. I constantly think about milestones. I find myself wondering if he will be happy? will he get teased in high school? Does he have a sore throat? Will he do well in school, is he getting enough milk? Is he cold? Will he stop breathing??? Will the person holding him drop him? Honestly I worry about everything...

She said she was just covering up her sadness and she just knows she can be sad by me because I won't judge.

Also she says she really likes me. Like a lot and she's in a slump, but I've been kinda sorta stalking her on the snap map and it says that she opens snap but doesn't really reply to me and that's been giving me anxiety. And she claims that she isn't texting anyone, but I don't know...

58,"Hello! 

TL;DR: I ignored a friend cause my now ex told me lies, should I double text her apologizing for what Ive done?

Main Story: 
About 4 weeks ago I broke up with my abusive girlfriend after 7 years. She had moved to a student area before all this and her behavior changed to the worse. She always told me how bad my best friend from 7 years ago (female bf) talked behind my back about me. I used to believe it and thought the best thing to do was to brake loose any contact with her. 

Now after a harsh break ups she told me that she(my now ex)  lied about everything and I am now stuck in guilt about it. I feel worse every day and have no clue what to do. 

I texted my bf from 7y ago now asking how she is and whats going on in her live and after 2 texts she asked me if I have broken up with my gf. My answer: „Yea I broke up with her long ago. Also I am not writing you because I have no one else, I am writing you because I wanted to hear from you again.“ ... Its been a week and she hasn’t replied and I don’t know if I should double text her stating how sorry I am and that I believed in lies.

More Backstory if anyone is i interested:
My mother is a teacher and gave private lessons at my home where she would help out anyone with learning disabilities. One time this girl came in and she was the same age as me that time (12years). I didn’t remember her as she wasn’t often at my moms to learn, but we used to play some games together.

After 3 1/2 years a good friend of mine re-introduced me to her at a festival and we both remembered the good time we had. Instant best friends, we went out to many festivals and bars etc. together and I always had a little thing for her but was to shy at this point of time. We talked about everything and even had a little double date because a friend of mine was in love with a friend of hers. 

One day I met a cute girl at a bar where I was meeting up with my bf, I fell in love instantly and started dating this girl. After she found out about my best friend she startet to tell me that she(my bf) was telling others how stupid and lame I am. Basically lying about what really happend. And my stupid a** broke loose all contact to her. 

5 years later I met my bf at a club randomly and we started chatting, I told her what I’ve heard and she instantly told me that she would never talk bad about me. After a few minutes drunk chatting at the club she tomd me she never wanted to hear again from me and walked off. I followed her and asked her to let me explain my side but she had to leave so she gave me her number. 

We texted the next day and updated both of us of our current life. And then broke loose of contact again because I was scared my ex would find out I wrote her. 

Now 2 years later I am stuck on a no reply treatment, devastated because I cannot explain how mad I am for believing this bs. 

She was my life back then and I thought about her once a week at least all this years. I love(d) her as a friend, she was like family and this breaks my heart.

60,"So the title is a bit strange I know, but there's a lot to this story.

I recently made friends with a MtF girl. she hasn't started transition yet. Her mother is verbally abusive, refusing to let her transition, screaming obscenities, isolating her from her friends. She's already got to Children's Aide Service, and they haven't helped, so she refuses to go again. 

She texts me a lot, saying she's going to slit her wrists, that she's going to kill herself, that there's no point in living anymore. Every time she texts me, I panic and have to answer immediately, or else I feel like I'm a terrible friend. This goes on for hours, and I keep suggesting she go to guidance, that she calls children's help phone, 911, anything, but she refuses. She states that she doesn't deserve help, and keeps texting me. 

I've given her some of my clothes, makeup, face products, nail polish, shoes, coats, and other things so that she can feel more feminine, but she's not happy with them. Says that she doesn't like them and that they're ugly or smtg.

I can't keep doing this. I'm getting more and more drained, I'm losing so much sleep I'm resembling a raccoon, I'm getting more and more sick from the stress, I'm cranky and bitter, but I'm afraid to walk away. I tried before, but then it got worse and she reached out again.

We, my fella our two dogs and two cats, and myself all live in a church that was built in 1845 and then converted into a house in the 1970s. We have been here for 3 months and some things have started to happen that I am unable to explain. 
The first might we were here the laundry room light that's by our bedroom turned on and the door opened. It's an old squeaky door so I woke up. 
Several nights later a set of deer antlers was moved from a shelf a good 13ft up to a spot in the hallway perched on a plate rack. 
I smell inscence randomly. 
Children who sleep in our home wake up with nightmares almost every time. Our dogs hunt things we dont see.

65,"Hello!  Firstly, Mom might come across as controlling.  She has to be due to family reasons.  As you know, Mother's Day is approaching.  I would really like to get my mom something good this year, because she deserves it but I'm having some trouble.  I don't know how to go out and get one without raising suspicion.  I have to buy it in person, no Amazon or online shopping.  Mom runs the family's Amazon account and would get suspicious of packages.

67,"My dad left when I was 6 and my brother was 4. We didn’t see him much at all after that, he moved interstate. 
My brother died in 2015 and in the week he was in ICU we were making contact with each other. He came down for the funeral and all that stuff. 
He kind of reeled me a little, making me think he was sorry and wanted me around - eg  invited me to go see him, apart from forgetting to get me from the airport all went well. said he wanted me to move there with him. 
This back and fourth stuff happened for a bit. But he was really up and down. Would call me saying sorry but also say heaps of shit about my mum and make uncomfortable. Say it was my mum and step dads fault my brother died when it definitely wasn’t. Just really really cruel things. But he would apologise about it later and be all nice. Really confusing. I didn’t think he was a drinker until he started calling me and texting me making no sense and sounding under the influence of something. 
He moved back to Melbourne in 2017. Wanted to be the proud Dad when I become extremely close to kicking off a professional sporting career but got angry when it didn’t happen. He wanted to meet and catch up - he insisted on the pub, I felt uncomfortable but it’s in public, what’s the worst that can happen? Out in the dark car park he pushed me against the fence of the neighbouring property and threatened me. 
Months went by... 
“Bumped into” me at training one night. 
Said he just wanted to chat, but got the vibe he was hanging on to me so he can be the proud dad if my professional sporting career kicked off. It didn’t btw.
Sure, so we met up a few days later, went for lunch and then the shops. Bought me every piece of clothing, surf gear, shoes that I had my eye on. Naively I thought, great he is so nice getting me everything I wanted. 
Went back to his house, and he had kept the receipts. He said if I didn’t do or say these things to Mum he would return everything he bought me. Then he tried to stop me from leaving by standing in my way, when I pushed him he hit me. 

Months went by and I thought we’ll try one last time. He insisted we meet at the pub. I thought it was a bit weird but public place right? Nope, this time he got me in the car park. 

We haven’t seen each other since, only contact on phone and he has seemed nice enough. Disclosed to me the reason, well his reason, that he left. 
It’s been a while since we have seen each other face to face. Was pretty close to putting an order on him when it started getting bad. Was supposed to meet with him to tell him my gf and I are having a baby and he never bothered to show up. 
So I had to tell via text. 

He’s so up and down. But is it mean to let him meet the baby but not actually be a part of their life? Or is it mean to do the opposite, not let them meet at all? 
Should I wait until he asks? 

I’m just confused! And he’s the only information I have surrounding my family history, so if I permanently block him out I lose that too.

He just exuded this confidence and was so sexy, even though I would consider my boyfriend more physically attractive (my boyfriend is a 10 of 10). I was supposed to wait on the customer’s table but asked another server to take him instead. I stayed away because I knew what I was feeling was wrong. A couple days later and I am still thinking of that guy. Upon reflection, I think maybe some of the things my boyfriend says/does in regards to sex turn me off. He talks about being “small” and gets really insecure about it. He finishes very quickly and often says “sorry, that was really lame” “sorry, that was embarrassing” after sex. If ever I am not in the mood, he gets sad or frustrated and then says really insecure things. It’s a problem that feeds itself because then I don’t want to have sex with him the next time! When he gets upset about me not being in the mood, it makes me feel like I have to have sex with him even when I don’t want to in order to avoid tension or bickering. I’ve told him that I don’t like when he gets frustrated about me not being in the mood but I am just now realizing that his lack of confidence is the biggest turn off. Please help me figure out what to say or do to help him be more confident. Should I bring up that I want him to be more confident about sex or just try things to make him feel that way?

72,"I'm a 24 year old male and living with my family. I didn't do well in college, so now I am currently working at a grocery store. I've been living at home for a little under a year now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a ""friendship"" with my ex girlfriend. We dated for about a year and a half, broke up 5 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple months ago we were skyping. She told me she hooked up with someone. She's a good girl, religious, very close to her parents. She always told me she would never touch another man until marriage. I was in shock. Acted normal and cool at first, but eventually flipped the switch after 2 days. I haven't been the same since. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was completely unaware that I still had feelings for her. Like wtf 

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately my life was dark. I was having the worst thoughts I have ever thought up. My entire personality changed. I started to treat people differently. I couldn't even communicate properly to my friends and family. I started to go out a lot more. Partying, drugs, vodka. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was two months ago. Since then I've realized that not only was I harboring feelings for her, I was also immature. I've neglected my personal growth for a long time. I never took it seriously. 

&amp;#x200B;

All these ""life lessons"" flooded my thoughts. It was all hitting me at once. Every mistake I made that I was unaware of. I began to understand where I went wrong with all the women I've been with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Days felt like weeks. My mood was constantly changing. Every couple days I become a different person. All these realizations, molding my personality.  

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest lesson though is that I need to be more positive. Everyday is a struggle forcing myself to do and think positive things. No matter what, I always try to be engaged in a positive task/activity, like reading or working out. I am also trying to be more positive with people. I realized that I judge people harshly, and often discredit them simply based off of their appearance. Man like, its the point where even if I disapprove of them across all boards  (appearance, the way they treat me, their mood, what they choose to say, what they choose to share), and I have absolutely nothing kind to say about them, I force myself myself to think ""I love them. They have goodness in their heart. They are beautiful."". Working in a grocery store, you meet a lot of people. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the more I grow up, the younger I feel. &amp; I've experienced social anxiety because of it. The people I work with are nice and haven't said anything, but l feel like a weirdo sometimes.  Although as of recently (last couple weeks) the days are slowly becoming brighter. 

&amp;#x200B;

My interactions with people are normalizing. Its not nearly as awkward. Like now I feel more confident about where i'm going. I know that if I keep at it, it's only going to get better. Shit will always happen, I just have to let go and move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm waking up to a lot about life and love and how it works. I understand women a lot more, but I feel like there is a lot more I need to catch up on. I am going through this on my own, my close friends don't really know what's going on. But I do feel like I've reached a point where it's okay to relate to somebody.

I made a good friend when I moved here, then he just never talked to me again, and I never saw him again.  I had a best friend next door to me, we did everything together, then he became a disinterested asshole so I broke that off.  I had another really good friend in my neighborhood, we would ride our bikes around and be rebellious teens, you know doing stupid shit, then he moved away.  I had another BEST friend, he liked everything I liked, including my obscure music taste, the type of movies I like, and video games.  We saw almost every movie that came out for at least a year.  I really enjoyed his company.  But hen he moved 348 miles away and I barely see him.  Whenever I have a good friend, they seem to find a way out of my life.

76,"I recently left a job that I loved, and I am so lost without it. If I’m not crying, I feel like crying. I am truly deeply sad all the time, and 2 months later I feel worse and worse. It’s all getting too much. 

I left for two reasons:

1. My senior managers didn’t know what they were doing, didn’t prioritise safety in an environment that catered for young families etc.  I worked 60 hours a week for a crap salary and it was a toxic environment.
2. I had fallen for one of my employees, we were really close outside of work as friends, and believed pretty concretely that she shared those feelings, but we were both respectful of the boundaries. I didn’t like the job anyway, so it seemed like I could at least get something great out of it (though this wouldn’t have been the sole reason for leaving).

What I didn’t realise was just how much purpose that job gave me. I loved being the go to guy for the staff, I loved how valued and appreciated it made me feel. And my friend decided she ultimately didn’t feel comfortable dating someone who was her boss (which I respect and understand).

Now I have nothing. I don’t really have friends outside of those people from work - who I still see occasionally but it just reminds me of how I am not part of that group anymore. I threw away something that made my life feel worthwhile. I’m so lonely and I didn’t have to be. *I* made this decision. I don’t know what to do, and I just wish I could go back in time and undo my mistakes.

Has anyone ever been in a similar position? How did it work out? How do people cope with just being sad all the time?

80,"Hey reddit, this is going to maybe seem silly to some of you but I just really need advice because I’m completely at loss and really hurting. 

My (27f) partner (32m) moved in together a year ago and I brought with me a lovely, sweet baby girl cat (8f) and we’ve been very content. We both have jobs that take us out of town for days at a time and I’d always wanted to get another cat to join my baby girl and we had decided on adopting another cat, preferably a male kitten, after a year living together. 

So the year comes up and I’m pretty insistent that I would like to buy the same breed as my cat because I just love her so much and have seen such great things about this breed of cat. I was lucky enough to get mine for free and they are quite expensive but it was an investment I was willing to make. My partner on the other hand felt we should adopt. He was very stead fast on this belief so I sort of accepted it. 

About a month ago I’m volunteering at the local animal shelter and fall in love with this little, perfect baby boy and that was it. My partner came to meet him and we took him home. This cat is so perfect and cuddly, but after 7pm and before 12pm he’s just a psycho tornado and wants to play non stop and we just couldn’t take it. And me being me became obsessed that this issue would not be had we bought the cat I wanted originally. 

Finally we were at our wits end and my poor baby girl was really not down to play 24/7 and was clearly getting quite annoyed sometimes too. But low and behold a good friend of mine who has a year old cat had actually been looking for a cat to play with her cat, so we talked and she was actually quite excited and said she’d take him no problem. So we dropped him off last night and she has a massive cat tree and all the toys he could dream of so I think he’ll be quite happy there. 

Unbeknownst to my partner and everyone else, I went ahead and put a deposit down on a kitten that’s not even born yet and haven’t told anyone but was and still am I guess so excited about it. I then got home and had a break down because I miss the little guy so much. I can’t stop crying and now I feel even more awful because I miss him so and I feel like my partner is going to be really upset with me about the kitten. 

Which bring us to the part I really need help with. I just don’t know what to do. I can’t stop crying and I just really need someone to help me. I’ve had a slew of mental health problems my entire life and have been treating them with medication and therapy and for the most part I do pretty good, but this just seems like it’s completely gotten out of hand and I just don’t know where to turn to

I plan on majoring in international studies with a Chinese concentration and possibly minoring in biology. I’m thinking of getting into the medical field, a forensic pathologist. My problem is that lately I have been feeling a lot of pressure to become really successful for my mom and dad. I know success does not automatically equal to being rich but money is definitely something I worry about. My oldest sister is a travel nurse and makes a decent amount of money. Maybe 2 months ago she received money from a car crash she was in a while ago and promised to give my mom some money to help us out, especially since my mom and dad take care of my niece and nephew along with my brother, another sister, and I. My sister who I will call A texted our oldest sister, B, talking about how she doesn’t act like a big sister and how she never helps out or checks in on her younger siblings or her parents but is always ready to ask our parents for money when she spends it all on things that aren’t necessities such as bills and stuff. B texted my mom about it and told her that she hopes I go to a college very far away and get away from the family because they only want money. This is not true at all. My mother only asks when she really needs help. Only my father works and my mom stays home to take care of us. It takes a lot for her to ask for help, let alone money. So now I just feel the need to get a really good job and make a lot of money so my parents won’t ever have to worry about not being about to pay bills or get something for my little brother and niece and nephew. I know people say don’t get into medical field for money but I think I am pretty interested in it. I plan on trying to find internships and shadow different doctors to see what I like and whether I only like the idea of it from like tv and such. I just want to make my parents happy and live a comfortable life. My mom and dad really miss the house they had in Texas but we had to move because of my second oldest sister but that’s a different story.

90,"Don't look to my previous Reddit comments (or this one) as examples, because most of them are drunken ramblings, but...

When I do set out to write something (or, maybe more accurately, ""use words""), I find it to be 1 of 2 things that I'm actually good at. And I think I have a knack for it. But I'm not sure how to use it to make money, but I think I could legitimately make money with the way I can put words together. 


I'm not trying to sound smart at all. I've done so, so many dumb things in my life. But 1 of the 2 things I'm good at is packing words together densely in a clever, multi-layered, double-entendre (though not necessarily sexual) fashion. 

I would probably be a good poet, but only technically. I'm not good at being creative, painting pictures, or eliciting emotions...and no one would pay me for it. I would probably be a good comedian, but I'm not one to be the center of attention. I could write novels and blogs and be successful...if only I knew what to write about...

I'm good at taking a ""theme"" a writing strings of words with double or even triple meanings all the while staying coherently meaningful with the initial ""theme"". I can just pack a lot substance into a few sentences (when I try).

In summary...I have a talent with words somehow in some way.. but I don't know the best way for me to materialize that talent...that a lone would probably help me feel more satisfied with life and my existence here....but, on top of that, making some money from it would be great too. 


I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how best to materialize my (one of very few) abilities to craft words together....and also maybe find a way to make money doing it.


Ninja edit: There are so, so many more intelligent people who are much better with words than I am.

Then one game, our starting center back got a red card and couldn’t play the next game. The practice after he got the red card, the coach decides to throw Carl on in defense to see how he does. He doesn’t do good enough to get the starting center back spot but I guess he did do  good enough to become the go-to defensive substitute. Carl isn’t even very good at defense and I have heard from many people that he should not be playing defense.

 at this point, im heartbroken and have a pretty clear idea of what they're doing. after like an hour or so, they go to sleep i guess. i saw the guy dressing up in bed later and that just confirmed my suspicions, and then he leaves after some time. i really wanted to jump out of bed and catch them red-handed, but i was really shocked, i can't believe my mom would do something like this. what else could he be doing naked in bed??

104,"   So a while back I lost my job (this consisted of all of my best friends who i lost after getting “let go”), my best friend, and a few other friends along the way. I also have a very rough background that is not helping the situation. This, at the moment leaves me with one friend and my boyfriend. My only friend lives far so I don’t see him that often leaving me to only hang out with my boyfriend, which y’all might know causes lots of relationship issues (not that we have too many problems just worried.) 
   Prior to all the gradual things I’ve been put through, I am now suddenly realizing it. It’s seriously hit me like a truck, I had previously been at the happiest place of my life and now it’s all gone. Just like that. Now this isn’t new for me, I’ve lost every single friend I’ve ever had due to rumors and my life long best friend committed suicide. Although I’ve never had depression before and now being diagnosed my mind is bouncing off the wall with worry. But weirdly enough I’m also not very worried.
   I see myself not really caring about my well being as
much. I can’t seem to care if more people decide to exit my life, if my applications for other jobs get accepted or denied, or if I’m not doing so well on my class work. I don’t want new friends, I don’t want a new job, or just new anything, I want my old life back. It’s all I ever think about and it is absolutely consuming. It doesn’t matter how many times I rant about it to people I can NOT stop crying/worrying about it. I’m getting to the point where I don’t even want to go outside anymore because I feel I have no purpose in life. 
   I’ve been going to therapy and her advice isn’t seeming to work, don’t get me wrong she’s a great therapist but she tells me to do things I’m already doing that just don’t help. She suggests finding a hobby but trust me I’ve tried everything you can possibly think of and I’m also very poor so not everything is accessible, along with that my favorite hobby is working it makes me feel like I belong. Possibly spending time with the people I do
talk to will help, but when I’m with my boyfriend it’s like there’s nothing left to say lately and I just lash out on the one friend I have because of all the things I’m going through (I know that that doesn’t help.) 
   I want to just feel something again. I’m sorry if this story was a mess, my head still can’t process the situation. But if anyone has any ideas I’d love to hear them.
TLDR; I lost my job, lost my work friends (best people I’ve ever met in my life), friends from school, and am left with one person who lives too far and my boyfriend who things aren’t going so well with. Therapy is recommending things that don’t work out for me and my concern/feelings for myself and others is nearly gone.",03May2019,1

112,"AITA for not paying all the rent and bills while my boyfriend goes back to school?

Backstory, I (27F) have a good job and get paid very well and I worked really hard to get to where I am. While my friends were partying in university I was busting my ass in a very tough program. I then worked a shit job for a while related to my field and then I found this awesome job I have now. I still have a massive student loan as I couldn’t work during the school year due to my workload that I am still paying off and have barely made a dent in it. 

While my SO (27M) went back to school, I covered the majority of the rent and he contributed very little (we were living in a bit of a shithole so rent wasn’t crazy high). I did make him pay some towards the rent and half the groceries and also made him pay all his bills (his car loan, insurance, cellphone, gas, etc). But I paid for the majority of our outings. He now is out of school and working and makes decent money, not nearly as much as me but still makes good money. We ended up getting a rent to buy house. He had little money to contribute to this so I ended up paying for most of it and everything we needed for it. I had a big chunk of money saved up for a house as rent here is crazy high and wanted to buy young. We agreed that he was would start paying me back when he started working but so far he hasn’t. He owes me over 10,000 dollars already. Now he wants to quit his job and completely change careers which will involve him going back to school for 2-4 years. 

I put my foot down at this point and told him if that is what he wants he will need to take a huge student loan to pay half of ALL the bills and for his schooling as I will not be paying for him to live whatsoever. I do not think it’s fair that he gets to save another 15,000 or more a year on rent, bills, and food out of MY MONEY that could be going toward my massive debt (80,000) while he gets to lower his? He doesn’t see it like that. He thinks that since I make really good money that I should be able to cover the rent, bills, and groceries. We have been together for 4 years now. While he didn’t ask me to get married he has mentioned it many times but I have always told him absolutely not and that I don’t want to for a long time but it’s mainly because I don’t want to pay for it. I love him and we get along great besides this but I am not okay will this arrangement. 

Sorry but I took a huge loan out while I was in school and had no one supporting me and I was like 18. He’s 27, he’s an adult and I think he should do the same and not expect to scrounge off of someone else. Plus if we were to break up and he says screw you I will be out 25,000-70,000. We only ever fight over money though and he swears up and down that he will pay me back but so far I’ve not seen a cent and I still pay more for the bills. I have no clue what he does with his money. He makes it seem like he doesn’t have any money leftover and is spending it all on food and gas. I’ve questioned him on it and made him add everything up so that I’m not getting screwed and it did add up. I can’t say for certain but I think he might be paying off (some like 200-300) a month on his debt.

I’ve spoken to my parents about it and my mom says I should support him because my dad supported her while she was going back to school, although they had young kids (me and my brother) under the age of 2 while my mom was going back to school so I think that’s completely different. She was also taking care of us during the day and going to school in the evenings and they were together for 12 years and married for 8. My dad says I should help out some but only a little. While my friends all say fuck him and he should figure it out.

After the initial thought of ""wow! this sounds familiar "" I did a little more digging. And sure as shit it was about me!

114,"I know this sounds selfish but when I used to go out with my friend[23F] before she had a boyfriend and it was fun. We would go out, dance, flirt with guys, then uber home together. We would get food and talk about the night and she would stay at my apartment and it was fun.

Anyway recently my friend found a guy and she has been going out with him alone a lot and spending a lot of time together. My friend and I only go out once a week but everytime she meets up with the guy and goes home with him, which I know isnt a bad thing but it makes me feel a little abandoned. 

I feel like I have to find a guy to go home with(which is dangerous) and when I don't find someone I feel unlovable and unwanted. 2 weeks ago a guy picked me up off the side of the road and (thankfully) drove me home. I barely remember it. Then last weekend i ended up just leaving early and going home crying and feeling a tad suicidal. 

I have a fwb but he doesnt message me much anymore. I also just got out of this short lived relationship with this guy who I liked so much but he couldnt get past how many guys I'd slept with. My confidence is shattered and I'm hurting a lot. So lately i have been feeling like I'm never going to find anyone and all my relationships have fallen apart which I'm going to therapy for. I know it makes me a horrible friend but I'm so jealous that she has found this super attractive, sweet, amazing guy who takes her to breakfast in the morning while I'm taking home one-night-stands.

It just isnt fun for me anymore and I know shes upset that I dont want to go out with her anymore. It isnt fair of me to ask her to not meet up and go home with her guy at the end of the night but my drunk ass gets too emotional. I've always felt jealous of her but I move past it. Whenever we go out guys hit on her over me, and it hurts because I dont want to feel in competition with her, shes my best friend. But I just feel these things and they're overwhelming and like I said, last time I felt suicidal over it.

I was thinking lately of picking up a second job. After all if I did, my income would go up to meet the threshold of paying for at least a small apartment.  At this point I'd take anything.

120,"So I'm gonna give some background on my situation first, I'm 20 years old and I moved almost 2 years ago down south with my boyfriend. He got offered a job in Texas and his family also lives here so for him it was a great opportunity. We were dating for over a year and we are very serious in our relationship so he asked if I wanted to move with him. I was living with my grandma at the time because I was going through a lot of family issues. My grandma had to go to a nursing home shortly after I moved down to Texas because of her health and she was really my only support system. A few weeks into moving down south I got a job in retail that paid pretty good and got commission.  I had to get a full time job because my boyfriend doesnt make enough to pay all the bills himself, we live in a pretty expensive city. I also help pay all the bills we have, car payments, groceries, house supplies like furniture pieces, etc. So we split the costs on mostly everything. My job schedule is crazy, I never have a steady schedule. One day I'm working 8am to 5, the next day I'm working from 2pm to 11, and around the holidays the store I work at stays open late so I have to work til like 12 or 1 in the morning. I also work around 45 hours a week, maybe even more around holidays. Now here's my problem, I want to go to school, mainly to become a dental hygienist. I spoke to my manager to see if there's any way we can work around my schedule, and she said the only option is if I wanted to go down to part time. But that wouldn't pay enough for all the expenses I have to pay. I also don't have any financial support, my father isn't in my life and my mom said she would help me out if she could but she doesn't have money to give in her situation and she doesn't have a job herself.
I really would appreciate any advice I can get, I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff and I have no guidance. Would you recommend I quit this job I'm at now and find another one that will work around my schedule? Find a better paying job with no college degree?

My wife and I had put out wedding two years out because we had to pay for it ourselves. When I came out as a lesbian when I was a teenager, my mom disowned me, and my wife doesn't have a good relationship with her mom (our dads are out of the picture). We're both living paycheck to paycheck but trying to better our lives... but we wanted to get married. We had a budget of $5000. We found an inexpensive venue, but the food was the most important for us, we want to feed our friends! For our guest list of 50, it cost $2800 for catering. But, we fond a great caterer at the wedding expo in town. They had amazing reviews online, they'd been part of the expo for years... and we taste tested with them and it was INCREDIBLE.  


I had already put our downpayment down last year, and with our tax refund I planned on making another payment on it, so I contacted them. Days passed and I didn't get a response. So, I went online to look up their number... only to find their reviews had tanked, and a news article and video segment online. The owner filed bankruptcy and said he didn't have the money to pay anyone back. This was in February. I hadn't received any notice about this at all... in fact, in February, they asked for another payment, but my return hadn't come in yet so I didn't make one!  


I made my payment half on credit card and half debit card... I'm just assuming I've lost the debit card money because I had closed the account I made the payment with. Maybe I could ask for the money from the card back from the company, but... yeah. What do I do? Is there a way we can get the money back? And now we have to find another caterer. I'm just super upset, we didn't have a lot of money to begin with and now we've lost a small chunk of it.",03May2019,1

I went out for a few drinks with a colleague and my boss. I work in bars and after a couple of drinks I advised my boss to move his car as he was parked in place he would be fined for in the morning. 

He moved around the corner and a we carried on drinking for a few more rounds. When we decided to go home I went with my colleague to pick our bags up from his car and call a taxi to go home. As soon as we get to the car he very casually offers to drive us both home. I straight away refuse and say we need to call a taxi. He very obviously then tries to get us to call a taxi while he would wait for us to leave, then drive off.  I clocked on to this straight away and called him out for it. After about 20/30 mins of this back and forth of him trying to call taxis home he finally agrees (and admits that he was going to drive home as soon as we left) to get a taxi home. We all get in taxis and go our separate ways. 

I really respect this man as a boss and he's done loads for me in the past. He's helped me incredibly in my career and has taught me a huge amount in terms of professionalism. Before this incident he was truly a man to be respected and has far and away been the best person I've ever worked for. 

I know I wasn't in the wrong for calling him out, but I just need some advice/ guidance on what to do? I'm not ever going to stand for drink driving but I also still respect this person and I don't have a close enough personal relationship with him to be able to confront him directly.

I've only been invited to events that encompass both genders (such as a potluck etc etc) but I also want to go with the guys when they hang out with each other. Last time they were going to a dinner together and were talking about it while we were in a club meeting and they all left while I went to the washroom. I was with the girls and they started talking about their dinner then noticed I was there then quickly changed the topic. 

During the dinner, I guess the girls felt pity and so asked me if I wanted to watch a movie with them (which I did because I didn't want to feel left out) - this is after they were talking about the dinner then noticed I was the only guy who didn't go. I guess that's what I'm trying to say, I'm feeling very left out by all the guys in this club and sometimes even the girls too. We have a group chat on WhatsApp for socializing (unrelated to the club) and I always feel like I'm ignored in that too. I want to leave the group chat but I also don't want to cause any drama or concern about my health or whatever.

This isn't the only incident as today they also organized a basketball game but without me - which isn't the first time either.


Just to add the cherry on top even during these potluck sort of events I always feel ignored :( and I don't want to feel like that way anymore so I want to leave the group (not the club - just the group chat for socializing unrelated to club matters).

145,"Hello everyone, and thanks for taking the time to read this post. I don't know who to ask or where to post this since I don't often use reddit, so I've had to come to r/advice as a last resort.

As of the past few months, I've been having nagging suspicion that I've been tracked on my technology- specifically by my parents. I know that sounds paranoid, but trust me, I'm not just going insane.

My profile picture on messaging clients like whatsapp, which is usually a goofy-ass image I take on the spot, keeps changing to sappy and disgusting group shots of me and my parents- pictures which I've never taken, never had on my phone or my laptop or would never even post as my profile.

My parents keep making jokes about my sleeping schedule- something they should have no idea about, considering I live across the country and make sure to call them on time every day to inform them that I'm going to bed. Yet somehow they make jokes about me watching youtube videos or playing games till late in the night, and always getting it bang on depending on what I was doing the night before (a bad habit, I understand, but I'm trying to work on it!).'

I constantly have a deluge of 'read' emails on Microsoft Outlook. For the longest time I just thought that 'ah, i probably absently opened it and just forgot' but with the frequency with which it's happening alongside the rest of these things, I'm starting to have my doubts.

I recently got a new phone after saving up my tiny college allowance for a good two years, having bought it through my parents. I thought it would be delivered directly to me, and for some time, I thought it was- until a day 2 months in, I saw a security notification pop up with my \*father's\* email address on it- a notification that, when I instinctive swiped away, I've never gotten again and never been able to find again. 

There's a bunch of additional minor incidents, but I won't bother you all with those- I think it's a long enough post already. I welcome your advice in any way, shape or form- please help me however you can.

I always loved beauty, the medical field, and animals and knew that I want a career involving one of these things.  My dream is to become a vet, but looking at the slim chances of staying at a school in my state and passing the chemistry classes would be an issue so I gave that up a long time ago. I won't consider vet tech because the pay is probably never going to be above $20. 

I went to college for 2 years and took all the prereqs for nursing but didn't pass the exam to apply for nursing school. the next exam was a year from the date I took it. I started to realize that nursing is not what I want to do, even though it was supposed to be a stepping stone only before I set out to apply for physician assistant school. 

I decided in the meantime I would work to pay for beauty school to take a shot at becoming a makeup artist. I dropped a good amount of cash on this school and yet to have a career or even a single paid gig. I advertise on my pages like fb and ig, but it doesn't even grow over 200 followers.  So now I have the title, makeup, tools, etc. but no customers.     

A month after starting beauty school, I got all these bizarre symptoms that were typically seen in MS. I spent the whole year seeing doctors trying to receive a diagnosis, freelancing to get by in the meantime. I found out I have a rare brain condition that causes a lot of symptoms for me. Managing all of this is new to me and trying to figure out how to not let it affect my life. 

Everyone is telling me I should look into going back to school, but I really don't wanna go back for more than 3 years. I'm thinking about singing up for an AA in radiology or something like that just so I can get my life back on track.  My real goal is to get a career, move out of my parents house to get an apartment with the bf until I can afford a house someday, and to just be happy.  I thought about radiology because it's still in the medical field, won't take long in school, and I'll be able to find a job soon after graduating and make decent money. Sometimes I dream about owning a bakery or having a popular cosmetics line, but I know these are long term goals that require lots of money.

149,"So I've been seeing this girl since August and her and I had hit it off pretty well at first, spent alot of time together, went and did things together etc. Her and I had gotten intimate and we're doing good for a kind of friends with benefits thing. Around the end of October she slept with this other guy on a drunk camping trip.

This kinda complicated things between all of us, he started coming around and eventually was saying he had fallen in love with her. Fast forward a little bit and now he's saying he can't go without seeing her and she says that he tells her he might kill himself if she ever left so she feels trapped.

This guy went out of the picture for a couple weeks and it seemed like she was warming up to me again (we were still really good friends) but then a couple weeks ago she just stopped answering my texts after Easter, I don't know what I did or what happened because she won't talk to me.

153,"Pretty much just as the title says, but I’ll go into a little more detail.

When I was around 11, my stepfather molested me (I’m a girl) on several different occasions. It was just touching, but it still severely messed with me, and I’m just now coming to terms with it at 21. It was repressed for so long that I actually wondered if it had even happened at all. But I know it did. During the time of the molestation, I had told my mom, and all my stepfather did was present to me a bunch of toys and a sheepish apology, and it was all that was ever mentioned about the situation until now, 10 years later. 

I absolutely cannot stand when he touches me. It repulses me and makes me feel disgusting. He will hug me when he first sees me for the day, and before he goes to bed. Sometimes a kiss on the head. And just to say, he is this way with everyone. I just happen to loathe any touching from him, for obvious reasons. 

I want to confront him and ask him to not touch me, ever, for any reason. Is this too much? He recently got diagnosed with ptsd, and has been going through a slew of his own issues, so I’m not sure I want to confront him because it seems like a bad time, but I’m not sure when there will ever be a good time. 

Is asking him to never touch me again too harsh of a boundary? How would I even go about asking this? Any suggestions or advice, even a kind word, would be so appreciated. Thank you!

154,"I want to keep this as short and sweet as possible, so here it goes. My dad has a great job right now, and his boss told him he’d have the chance of getting a promotion soon. This would cause us to move to Nashville, which is about eight hours from where we live now. My parents don’t bring stuff up to me (16f) very often, so when they mentioned this, I knew it was important. There’s a ton of pros. We all love the city (we’ve been on a vacation there). Vanderbilt is one of my favorite colleges. It’s a large city, but has state parks nearby for hiking (I’m used to rural Kansas and Missouri, so those two things are amazing to me). It gets a bit more complicated, though. I’m incredibly introverted, and I have nerdy interests, so finding people I enjoy to be around is hard. At my current school, I have an amazing group of friends who I play DnD with every week and watch stupid movies with. They are my dream group of friends, so it genuinely hurts my heart to imagine not spending more time and not graduating with them. Because of this, and other attachments (my sister goes to college nearby our current home), my mom offered to stay for the year and a half I have left, and my dad be the only one to move for a while. This was the worst thing to happen. My parents are not lovey dovey at all, and they’ve been having troubles for the last few years. It got to the point where I thought they would divorce or separate, but it eventually got a lot better. I’m worried that if they do separate, though, their marriage would basically collapse. So, this wasn’t short and sweet, but I can’t talk to anyone about this situation. I think moving to Nashville is the best thing for us, but I would be saying goodbye to people who I love with my whole heart, my amazing art class, and what I consider home. I haven’t always lived here, so I don’t think my parents understand how attached I am, but I don’t want to be the person who stops something so potentially amazing for us.

160,"Hey, I just wanted to get other people’s opinions on this idea cause I’m having a major dilemma over whether I should follow through or not. Basically, a few of my friends are going to a party on Saturday night. And naturally as you do at a party, they are going to have a few drinks. The issue is that one of my friends is going to drive the others out there, but since he is going to be drinking, doesn’t want to drive home (which is a good idea instead of getting a DUI). He has his driving permit, so if he gets pulled over he’s basically screwed for most of his life. I’m thinking about offering to go out there with them, but not have anything to drink and be a Designated Driver. I have my full junior license and have completed drivers ed, but my license only goes into effect fully in June. My logic is that I obviously know how to drive, and if I don’t have anything to drink, I should be fine to drive home. The only other issue in this is that I’m not sure if my parents will be ok with me going to this party. I still have to ask them, and I’m not sure what to do if they say no.

165,"**A little background on me:**

My parents got divorced when I was 10 and ever since then they have had split custody of me. Basically, I stay with my Dad for a week and then I stay with my Mom for a week and it switches off every other week. The divorce and relationship between my parents is very messy. As a matter of fact, I am pretty they would have killed each other by now if it wasn't illegal. Anyway, My parents have never been very good at working with each other and it always results with me being stuck in the middle of the conflicts they have. For example, during the divorce my parents had an agreement that they would each pay half of all expenses for me (medical bills, school bills, etc). The only problem is my Mom has been going through financial struggles and has a hard time paying these expenses. My Dad refuses to pay his half of the expenses until she pays her half first. Basically, that leaves me to pay whatever expenses I have myself. Both of my parents act the same way about stupid petty shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned before, I am going to be graduating soon and my Mom and her side of the family wanted to take me out to dinner, The only problem is that the time she wanted to go makes it hard to work with my Dad and his side of the family. I tried getting her to push back the time for the dinner but she is far too stubborn. This is how that convo went:

&amp;#x200B;

* ME:  Is there anyway we can push the graduation dinner  back to like 6:30?
* HER:  No, I already told everyone. Why? 
* ME:  I'm trying to make time for Dad's side of the family 
* HER:  They can push theirs back. I'm sick of having to make concessions for them. 
* ME:  What time are we supposed to do though?
* HER:  I would think by 7 at least. 
* ME:  ehh I doubt Dad's going to go for that 
* HER:  That's the point. we are always needing to schedule around him and it just isn't going to happen this time. He can do a breakfast thing or deal with it. People on our side of the family actually have to go to work the next day. 

That's basically how the convo. It seems no matter what I do, someone is always not pleased. My parents make stuff like this so difficult and stressful to the point that it is not even worth it. I am half tempted to say screw the graduation ceremony and just picked up my diploma later. I'd like to enjoy this big milestone in my life but I guess there isn't much I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the actual point of this post. After I graduate, preferably before college starts I'd like to move in with just one of my parents. There are a list of pros and cons to living with each parent but not only am I having a hard time deciding which parent to stay with, I am also afraid of the backlash I am going to receive from which ever side of the family I don't choose.",03May2019,1

168,"So my BIL and his gf got engaged the other day. I was not ecstatic. Here’s why:

* my wife and I (lesbian couple) got married last July. Big wedding and it was a blast. During the year of planning/engagement my BIL literally through a tantrum that he and his gf couldn’t get engaged bc we “would get mad at stealing our thunder). We truly didn’t care and told them please get engaged bc if they wait then we’ll probably be getting pregnant at that time and didn’t want them to think we were stealing *their* thunder. Low and behold they didn’t even get engaged until 10 months after our wedding. Why even get upset with us? And we are trying for our baby this fall so we will either be pregnant or have a baby at the time of the wedding. 
* my BIL got very, very drunk at our wedding. All night he kept saying to me “I know we hate each other and sorry for thinking your bitch”. He said this to me about 15 times. So all night he pretty much told me he hated me and thought I was a bitch
* he grabbed a bunch of peoples butts at our “after party”. My male cousin had to leave bc he was so uncomfortable about it. 2 other people mentioned he did this too.
* his gf literally locked him out of the room that night. My sister found him sleeping between the cats of the parking lot (of a very upscale resort) and she brought him to our room. He literally slept in our room on our wedding night. My sister did too but I mentioned to my wife “I wonder how &amp;lt;BIL gf&amp;gt; would feel if you slept in their room on their wedding night”. She told me don’t be petty. 
* also all night at the “after party” BIL went on and on about how he is going to propose in September. And even propositioned our photographer to hire her for the pics of the engagement. When I mentioned this was inappropriate my MIL excused and said well we all know he’s just excited. And it’s not that inappropriate. But he proposed like 9 months after that. So why even talk about that at someone else’s wedding?

I’m excited for a wedding. But I’m not super ecstatic for them - mostly my BIL. Im happy for the gf and they’ve been together 7 years so it’s great for them.

Part of me feels like the reason why my in laws were okay with him sleeping for our room was maybe bc it wasn’t a real wedding? I know that’s not true bc they helped us a lot financially for it but I feel like this would never fly for them bc it’s their wedding with a bride AND a groom. My wife said to be the bigger person but I don’t want people to forget how full of himself he was. But I guarantee if my wife got as drunk as he did and pulled the same shit he would freak out for months about it (they both very similar when heavily intoxicated). 

Am I being petty for having all of these feelings flood back after hearing about their engagement? I want to talk about and vent to remind my in laws of all of this but I get that that’s petty. But I feel like we should forget how big of an asshole he was. Any advice on how to handle?

In March, a new MRI found that blood clots in her brain were not reacting to the blood thinners she was on; also, they found a benign tumor on her cerebellum. They had to do emergency surgery in April. 

She had the surgery last Friday, and there were complications. The surgeons said the blood clots were larger than anticipated, and that the brain was already swelling even before the surgery. She has still not awoken after the surgery. 

Today, her sister told me that the MRI yesterday shows that she will almost assuredly have permanent, serious brain damage affecting her cognition, potentially her eyesight, her memory, everything. She will not be able to be ""normal"" again, and any damage is most likely permanent.

181,"I'm a socially awkward/anxious person with a lot of issues that works from home and am not currently in school. For those reason it makes it incredibly difficult for me to meet new people and make friends with them. Last year I moved to a new city with my family (partner and son) and somehow managed to make the first and only (literally) friend I've had in 7 years and up until that point I hadn't even spoken to anyone that wasnt my immediate family that entire time...   


With that said, I think I don't really know how to actually be a friend to someone. I'm nice, but maybe too nice and I got so excited about finally having a friend that I'm pretty sure I scared them away. We talked pretty much every single day for months. Mostly online (Even though we're basically neighbours) and then one day the messages just stopped. They said they needed a break from the community (we met in a local activity) because of work but I didn't realize that meant they wouldn't talk to me or my family again either (they would often come to our sports nights and was good friends with my partner, son and other family members as well).   


I've pretty much spent every day since then wondering if I had been a bad friend and what I might have done wrong. I was honestly pretty broken about the entire thing and only recently decided to accept that I've probably lost the friendship for good.   


Out of nowhere they contacted me today and we talked for a little bit just like we used to and I honestly don't even know what to do. Part of me is so excited and happy about it, but another part of me is anxious. Of course I'm glad to have my friend back but I want to learn how to be as cool as a cucumber and learn to be a ""normal"" friend rather than the slightly manic, anxious, eerily nice, overly talkative, mess of a person that I usually am.   


If something I did was the reason they disappeared, I don't want to mess up this second chance and also, if they end up doing the same thing again, I don't want to take it to heart like I did before. From my understanding, a lot of regular friends don't talk all the time and sometimes do go periods of time without hanging out but because It's the first friend I have had in so long, I took it a lot harder than I probably should have.

Say I have work at 4pm-8:30pm (which I do today), I spend all the time till 4pm just procrastinating/counting down my time to work. I can't seem to do anything productive because work will interrupt it eventually so I don't.. Or some weird logic like that.

This is the same in reverse aswell.. for example say I plan on going to the gym, it has to be straight away in the morning or else I can't go, like in my mind I've missed it.

OR say I need to write an essay for university, but I don't feel like doing it. I can't do anything else productive or else its pointless if I'm not doing the original productive thing I intend to do.

  
This is a real time killer. leading to constant procrastination or nothingness that in my mind is justified, I only recently started realizing this weird pattern, haven't seen others complain about.  

Any advice on how to stop this weird pattern I got going on? Or just how to focus on a current moment rather than looking back or forward. Thanks",03May2019,1
186,"the past two and a half years my life has been in a standstill.

After grade 12 I started going to University here in Germany. However around that time I started getting way more depressed then I ever used to before. My first semester of Computer Science I realized how much I sucked at it.

I didn't write a single exam, my second semester I told myself that I would be getting help for my mental issues. I started going to therapy and taking meds, I tried at Uni however I couldn't catch up and again didn't write a single exam. I changed Universities after that (didn't change the degree, only the university, the one I'm going to know is closer to my home) and at that point I was so depressed that I skipped nearly everything. As you can guess, I didn't write a single exam yet again.

The skipped the entire semester after that and only now have started going to University again this semester. However my bad habits have started immediatly again.

The third week of University has ended just now and I think I've gone to Uni only around 5-7 times. I'm behind on everything yet again.

I feel like such a disgusting, worthless, pathetic loser. I just don't know anymore. There is no one to blame but myself. I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't get myself to sit down and study,  I can't get myself to go into my classes, I can't get myself to think about my future and actual expect to live long enough so that I can convince myself that all the effort now would be worth it.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to turn 22 this year and I've wasted all of those 22 years.",03May2019,1

189,"Appreciate you looking &amp; reading...

So about a month ago I confessed my feelings to my only friend. It wasn't something I had necessarily planned. I'm a workaholic with no friends and a phobia of people...but I had this one person in my life that tried to be my friend in the best way possible. 

He has his own issues, battles with depression, and I was in some what of a shoulder position. I battled being in this position because I find him very attractive, funny, I think we have great conversation. But I knew he didn't like me the same, so a few months ago I started pushing him away. While we could normally talk forever, I'd have short responses, avoid him.

I one day deleted him off social media...while drunk a week after I had done the deed, he asked me, did you delete snapchat? I lied, said yes I was going on a social media cleanse. I wasn't looking for a response...I just think I wanted to stop seeing his name. I don't like to lie to people that I respect, so I ended up sending a gift basket when he had a health issue as a way to probably selfishly compensate for the fact I had lied.

When he felt better...he insisted we meet for lunch. I denied, denied, but he insisted. Part of me worried he was not doing well, so that's why I finally said yes. At lunch he brought up ""were you on snap when I posted my vacation pictures""

I felt guilty...I lied and said, no I don't think so. When I got home I texted and confessed I had lied about deleting the snapchat, and I just deleted him. Confused he asked why, and I basically said I like you more than I should. I received no response.

It's been a month, and I still struggle with if I should apologize, or if I should forever let it go. Apart of me feels guilty I couldn't have been a less selfish friend, apart of me wants to apologize for the discomfort I've created, but also apart of me feels I should just let it be because I've done enough",03May2019,7

I have zero debt and about $23K in savings. I am often frustrated at my job and think I will want something new in a few years, but by all measures it is going well. They are happy with me and I am happy with them.

A lot of my life has been feeling like I've been missing out. It makes me feel super vulnerable (even anonymously, online) to admit, but my high school life sucked. I was not bullied at all, but I wasn't really on the inside circle at all. University was pretty good, but I still didn't really have the stereotypical experience. I lived at home and just studied pretty hard. I just hit my first anniversary at my job. I've lived at home and haven't spent too much over the past few years.

I am now thinking of moving out. I've looked at some pretty nice places! My budget is around 1280 tops, or 1/3 of my take-home. I visited a pretty nice place tonight for $1100, and it includes wifi and in-suite laundry! The building itself is pretty outdated, but I feel like it would be a great starting point. I looked at another one yesterday that was $1150, but parking was an extra $100 and no wifi.

However, I'm just really afraid to pull the trigger. Signing a one year lease scares the hell out of me. What if the building management is terrible? Or the neighbours are drug addicts! Or if I just get super lonely living on my own! Ahhhh! 

Also, I feel like I'd be spending way too much living on my own. I really want to live with a buddy or something, but they've all acted pretty flaky when I've asked.

Can anybody kindly share me some advice?",03May2019,1

200,"So bear with me here: I worked a student job in uni that I had to quit when I graduated back in August 2018. My plans for grad school changed and suddenly I needed 3000 hours of work experience to even be able to apply to do my masters. I thought I could just get a job in the field but it has taken me until now to get a job offer, I've burnt through my savings, mainly from paying off student loans, so I need work and preferably work that fulfills grad school application requirements, and I sort of need it ASAP. After not having work for months I find myself in a weird position because I've been offered two jobs back-to-back. I'd like to work both but don't know how I would.

On Thursday last week Job A asked me to attend a meeting Tuesday for what I thought was a third round of interviews. On Monday I got a call from Job B asking me to come in for an interview on Wednesday, I accepted because making it to third round interviews is no guarantee that you have the job, I could also theoretically work both jobs. Well turns out the meeting Tuesday wasn't another interview, it was a job offer, they had me fill out all the paperwork and put me on their payroll and in their system right then and there (I suppose I could have refused the job or asked for time to think it over but I've been jobless for 8 months and it sounds like a good job so I accepted their offer). I still went to the interview on Wednesday because I had already told them I'd be there and because I thought I could work both jobs. I didn't really think I had a chance at Job B because they asked for 5 years experience and a business degree, neither of which I have, but they told me I have the job so long as my references check out and that they'd contact me before the weekend is over. 

So here's the problem: The start date for Job B is ASAP and it's Mon-Fri 9-5, but Job A requires that I complete training shifts and the trainers only work Mon-Fri 9-5 so even though I've been hired to work weekends I have to do weekday training shifts until June (about one shift a week), I already signed up for several shifts when I met with them on Tuesday. I didn't get a chance to bring this up during the interview for Job B because they never actually asked for my availability or when I'd be able to start (probably because this was asked on the application that I completed weeks ago which obviously no longer holds true). My mother says I should accept Job B when they call and just tell them that I have prior commitments on certain days but I fear that will cause them to revoke their offer.

To make matters worse Job A and Job B are in different cities, I don't currently have a car (because I don't have an income and my savings are gone) so I can't commute. I'd planned to stay with my grandparents (temporarily, until I bought a car or my own place) if I got Job B because their house is within walking distance but if I take/keep both jobs I'm not sure how I'd get back and forth between cities for these training sessions, assuming Job B gave me the days off, as I wouldn't have a way to commute. 

Should I try to accept both jobs, ask Job B for these training days off and just splurge on a taxi between cities? Do you think asking for these days off mean they'll revoke their offer? How would I even ask them about potentially getting these days off?

Or should I choose one of these jobs and turn down the other? If so which do I pick?

Job A is part-time, weekend shifts are the only guaranteed hours but they say that I could pick up shifts and easily get 30 hours a week. They also said there's a lot of opportunities for advancement, they offer all kinds of free training too. Pay would be $17.50/hr. The job sounds intrinsically motivating although emotionally and physically challenging. It would definitely count towards my grad school applications. The people there seem really nice (I've met all the full-time staff). I've also already accepted this job and have signed up for training shifts (I have a first-come first-serve mentality after working customer service for so long so I feel like the fact that I've already accepted this position is important to consider).

Job B is full time, no clue what the pay is, they said it's Level C but that's meaningless to me (and apparently to Google too because I tried asking it). It sounds rather easy, potentially boring, and it sounds rather dead end. I'm not sure if this one would count towards my grad school applications, it really depends on the actual tasks assigned to me and if I can highlight said duties properly on the application. The people at this job also seemed really nice but I was interviewed at their main office which isn't where I'd be working so I can really only say that my potential manager seems nice. 

I'll likely work multiple jobs even if I have to turn one of these down. Obviously it sounds like Job A won't offer enough hours so I'd need more hours both for money and for application purposes. Job B has more hours but I'd like to be able to get back to school in 2020 which means I'll need to work those 3000 hours before March 2020 and one full-time job won't get me enough hours before then.

I'm really sick of job hunting and would love to be able to start working both of these, if Job B just started a month later I'd probably be able to pull it off, training would be done, I could afford a car, I could work 9-5 Mon-Fri for Job B and weekends at Job A while also picking up evening shifts at Job A to get my 3000 hours. But because these jobs start at the same time the schedules and geographic locations conflict. 

Can anyone offer me insight into what I should do? Is there an obvious solution that I'm missing here? I'm afraid that turning down either job will mean blowing my chances of ever working for that company and as there are so few jobs in my field I feel that I need to keep my options open (even after I get my masters/PhD both of these companies are the kind I'd end up working for).

202,"First time posting on here sorry if too long or mistakes. So I (19M) have a friend (19M) that introduced me to a girl (18F) that, he sort of had/has feelings for. To get to know her better I asked her to get Dutch bros. not thinking anything romantic of the situation and wanting nothing more than to just become good friends and try to get my boy an in on getting her favor. Long story short we get the Dutch bros. and we had what seemed like the best conversation I’ve had with anyone! In the middle of the convo she brought up my friend and how she knew he liked her, and that she didn’t reciprocate the feelings and just found him to be a good friend. I realized I was catching feelings for this girl, before even she had mentioned how she felt about my friend. After I drop her off, she thanks me for taking her out and we talk about working out together through text. I realize then that she thought it was a date. I tell my friend a few days later about it and am completely honest, saying in the nicest way possible that she doesn’t like him in a romantic sense, and that I think I’m catching feelings. I tell him though that I won’t pursue her at all if he’s not comfortable with it considering how he felt about her. (Because of brocode obvi) He seems to take it well and just says that he’d like to talk to her about it to see how she feels about the whole situation for whatever reason, but I don’t mind, I’m just trying to be the best friend possible. So a week passes and the girl tells me that she doesn’t want a relationship, and would like to just stay friends, which is fine, kind of a bummer, but fine. I tell my friend and he seems surprised she ended things. A month passes and she hits me up asking to hang because she “misses” me, I take the bait like an idiot, because I still sort of had feelings for her. While we’re hanging out she tells me that the reason she ended things before they started was because my friend told her that it “would hurt him” therefore he essentially lied to me, I felt a little betrayed by this thinking we were “brothers.” I understand that it must have been awkward for him to tell me to stop seeing her, but we’re fairly close.

After two years of medication and help from a wonderful psych doc, I have been able to lead a moderately normal life for the past year; including a great full-time job, supportive friends and family, and a caring SO. I have hobbies such as instruments, exercise regularly and eat well. The last time I had panic attacks was a year ago.

From April, it's all come back with no trigger whatsoever. Crippling anxiety, the feeling that I'm going to imminently die, extreme weakness and fatigue (but can't bloody sleep)being on the verge of crying constantly, constant headache and stomach pain, lack of appetite and loss of interest in everything. I've tried to work through it by taking additional benzos such as Ativan, but my psych doctor doesn't know what's wrong, and my blood tests come back as perfectly healthy. I handed in my letter of resignation yesterday; I absolutely literally cannot work.

207,"Where do I begin?

Maybe with some context so I don’t sound like a spoilt brat: I used to be the top 30% of my school through 16. Then, things got weird and I went into a bad school and was in a bad class. I had hopes of applying to an American University (I’m from Asia), but only got into a very safe safety school that I didn’t want. So I stuck local, did it for a year, applied for a transfer and got into an Ivy League University.

I thought life would look up from there. On the surface, it was - I was a straight A student, a president for my club and I even did my internship at a prestigious consulting firm. BUT, the truth was that I was struggling the whole time.

While my Friends seemed to be getting investment banking offers and consulting firm offers, I only got two interviews - one that finished recruiting before I was done interviewing and the other that didn’t pass me to the second. I kept persevering, applying, interviewing, and kept broadening my search. I had decided to move to Los Angeles after graduation because my Boyfriend and Brother would be there. Even though I worked hard to network, send out emails, write cover letters, I graduated with no offers on the table.

I spent my summer doing the same thing. Waking up in the morning, applying to jobs, interviewing when I could. I had a handful of firms interested to interview me, but as I was in Asia, they decided not to proceed until I returned. (I did reach out upon returning, but slots were either gone, or they weren’t interested anymore)

I move to LA in August and did the recruitment dance all over again. When I failed to get interviews, I decided to start working at a juice store at the mall across my home. I spent my time there networking with customers, getting emails, reaching out for referrals and getting interviews. My top two leads was an interview with a major investment bank and an interview with a media agency. I chose the latter because I didn’t want to do 90 hour work weeks, and felt like media would be more exciting.

I kept following up, but only had an interview in February this year. I did the interview, didn’t like anything about the job, but accepted the offer because it was the only one I had. I had negotiated for a month before starting, and almost managed to get two jobs before starting but I didn’t. The first just started ghosting me (Private Equity firm) and the second interviewed me three times. On the final day for the company, I did well in all the interviews, only to be rejected because I didn’t have a “polished presence.” 

The day of my final round, I left with an email inviting me to interview with a TOP MBB firm. So, I started my job with the media agency a few days later, with the decision to get an income while applying for other things. Unfortunately, I was staffed on the busiest and most disorganised team, because everyone had just joined the company and were new to the team and company. In the three weeks before my MBB interview, I prepped for cases during my lunch break and came home to more casing. I did my interview, only to be told I had a strong foundation but lacked practice. This was fair because I was working till 7pm every day and having little time to prep (I did 35 cases in 3 weeks, on TOP of learning consulting concepts and other related things.)

With nothing in the pipelines, I tried to do my job. But I hated it. I had come in with an open mind, but with the realisation that my job not only wasn’t what I wanted, but would also disadvantage me from getting the jobs I wanted, I was disillusioned. Just to substantiate this, the HR of MBB said that I could reapply in a year but didnt think media planning would be a strong background to come from, and the skills I learned on this job was so specific to the role that I didn’t believe it to be transferable. I was even told by people in the company that people stay in the industry and move from agency to agency, which made me panic because those who left became insurance agents. If I had wanted to be an Insurance Agent, I would have started a Long time ago.

All of a sudden, I had an interview with a TOP 10 consulting firm. I wanted it so badly, but my boss wouldn’t let me take leave for the following week. So during a company dinner, I hinted to her quietly (and drunk) that I was unsure if this industry was for me. More specifically, I told her I didn’t understand the work but believed there would be a 3 month learning curve that I could get over. The next day, she fired me. I felt happy because I didn’t have the job anymore, had 2 weeks paid, and could do my interview.

I did my interview, solved both cases but didn’t click as well as I would’ve liked with my interviewers. But I definitely thought I did well enough to get to the final round. Wrong. I got rejected a couple hours ago. So I’m lost once again, and I need your advice.

I can’t even begin to share how exhausting this journey has been for me. I’ve been consistently recruiting, looking for jobs, writing cover letters, doing interviews and getting rejections since I was a Sophomore in college (4 years!!!) and to no avail.  I’m exhausted. Exhausted. Really just tired of this whole thing all together, so I value all advice.

To make matters worse, nobody understands. I talk to my classmates with their dank ass jobs and they just tell me to be patient because something good will come. I talk to my friends and family back home and they just insist that with my Pedigree degree and 3.9 GPA, id definitely get something. So I can’t even get proper advice.

In addition, I may sound like a hermit with no social skills, but that’s never been the case. I’m always the center of attention, have always been into public speaking, and usually nail the interview. I’m starting to think that I suck and that everyone hates me, and that this is all there will be. 


1. What am I doing wrong?
2. What jobs should I be looking at (Poli Sci graduate) 
3. Should I just give up and move home?
4. Any advice at all

My brother is known to have taken money from us in the past and my mom just found out that the money she had is all gone (about a good $500).

Now, I am concerned because of some symptoms I have been receiving as of the beginning of this year. Things such as being nauseous, getting random headaches, feeling as though I need to pass out, and random stomach aches. These symptoms are starting to become more noticeable as of this year. 


Should I be worried that I may have caught cancer or anything of the sort?  I looked into it a little, but the only thing that came up was an illness usually found in overweight people. I am not overweight, I am at the average weight and height for someone of my age.

I have told my mother of the symptoms, though we haven't acted on them yet. I am going to the doctor at the end of this month. Should I wait until then, or ask my mom to get me checked out as soon as possible.

224,"Hi, Reddit.
As the title says, I (26/F) got a new puppy.

But what the title doesn’t tell you is:
I’ve been battling an autoimmune disease and depression (the two often walk hand-in-hand). Lately, I’ve felt a deep sadness and dissatisfaction over my life, and it’s made it really difficult for me to function. I’ve even had suicidal thoughts because of it.

After several conversations with my Fiancé about how I’ve been feeling lately, I decided to take a huge leap and get a furry companion. My Fiancé was on board with it under one condition: I’d be the sole financial provider for the little one. This wasn’t a problem for me... until now.

I lost my job today unexpectedly.

Money is now going to be tighter than ever, there’s a large question mark over what the future holds, and I honestly don’t feel mentally or physically well enough to go looking for another job right now.

It feels like the only thing holding me together is my new baby. She’s so calm, cuddly, and sweet - she’s been an absolute dream and is definitely attached to me just as much as I am to her (my Fiancé says she’s a “mama’s girl”). She’s the reason I get out of bed in the morning, she’s the reason I smile, and she’s the light of my life.

But now I am in a really heartbreaking position where I may have to re-home her. 

She’s 9 weeks old and still needs her first vet visit/shots, but I don’t think with my job loss and mental health I can swing the cost. Before this happened, it wasn’t an issue. Was it tight? Sure! But it was manageable, and I looked at it as medicine for my soul that was necessary. Now, I don’t know what to do. If I can just get past the few rounds of shots she needs, I can take care of everything else. But I don’t see how it’ll be possible.

My Fiancé says selling her would be the wisest decision financially, because he did research online and I guess people sell this breed for $1200+ (I got her for $200 from a nice family).

While I know I/we need the money, I can’t imagine myself giving her away to someone else. She chose me just as much as I chose her, and I am not the kind of person to do that to another sentient being. My heart can’t stand the thought, but my options are limited.

What would you do in my situation?

Note: Before people ask if my Fiancé can help me, he can’t. I don’t want to air his business on the internet, but he has medical reasons of his own for why he can’t.

Also, I’m NOT asking for money. This isn’t a “woe is me” post for donations; I’m really seeking advice.

Thank you in advance!",03May2019,2

226,"I’ll try and keep this as short as possible. I recently lost my summer job as a wild land firefighter because of an error on someone’s part with my paperwork and rehire from last year. My wife and I are both in college and we used the summer money to help support us through college without accumulating any student loans. I was initially pretty upset and told my old boss to look if there were any positions available anywhere. A few weeks go by and I find a job as a call center representative. Definitely not as exciting or as lucrative as all the overtime firefighting got me but it would put bread on the table and we may avoid student loans if we cut back on a lot of things. In those few weeks I notice my wife has acted a little strange, and she tells me today that her old habit of bulimia has come back, and while I’m at work she occasionally makes herself get sick. I am instantly  concerned and we spend a few hours talking it through. Not to long ago I got a text from my old boss and he said he found a position that opened up in a different location than where I was last year, and I may need to live in government housing since it is around 1.5 hours from my house. He also said he told other people to hold off hiring until he speaks with me and I need my answer by tomorrow. I told her I don’t think I’m goin to take it  because I’m worried about her. I was just trying to be a good husband honestly but she got offended and said that she is independent and can take care of herself. I am not trying to control her whatsoever, I am trig to be a good husband and take care of her if she is relapsing or something. The call center job is also far less exciting than firefighting, and I kinda take pride in having a hard job like firefighting. The money will make our situation a LOT better too. I honestly am not sure if I should stay in case my wife is going through a dark time, or take advantage of this job...

TLDR: wife started making herself sick, tries to tell me it’s nothing. Got offered a killer summer job but worried leaving wife if this is a mistake if this is worse than I think",03May2019,1

It feels like my whole body is trapped in skintight plastic and I can only move my limbs alittle bit before they get back. I write this after I just had one. Now these things have been happening lately never experienced them before they happen at the exact verge of falling asleep and often when I'm paranoid or I got an scary image in my head. I  hallucinate anything during these things so that's a blessing. They only thing I can really control is my eyelids and even those are hard to move They don't last for long maybe for like 20-30 seconds so I usually don't freak out that much. But this one got me tripping It lasted for I dare to guess maybe 2-3 minutes wich maybe doesn't sound long but it was for me in that state.
I tried to desperately get out of it and it was horrible I'm still shaking a bit so sorry for the typos and stuff.
The image I got in my head was nothing more than a old woman smiling but it still tripped it off and then I heard the beeping and I knew why would happen.
I'm not sure if the paranoia and scary images has anything to do with this but I thought I should just put it here in case of it being something mental. Lol.

236,"So I met this guy at work and we immediately had this very strong connection and so much in common. But he is on and off with his baby momma. And when we started talking he has just gotten back with her so I was whatever about it and had given him space and stopped talking to him so much at work tbh. But then I confessed to him that I had a crush on him but that it's fine I respect his relationship with his baby momma. And he was like oh okay. But then like two days later he walks up to me at work and says he felt the connection too and liked me a lot and that he is sad because hes with his baby momma and I said that's fine. Things happen for a reason I was chill it was just a crush tbh. 
One Monday night we hang out at a park together and talk a lot. We talk about life and everything and then we start talking about his baby and baby momma a little and he told me she has cheated on him and physically and emotionally abused him and I believe it but then again I haven't heard her side of the story. And it did cross my mind he might be telling a better side to the story just to make it seem hes not too bad of a guy which at this point I'm seeing him as a victim. 
Something about this seems fishy honestly but it was whatever, we have a good conversation and he goes home back to his baby momma and I go to sleep. I wake up to him texting me saying he left his baby momma and is now staying with his dad and I was very shocked. Immediately went to go see him and talk to him to see if everything's okay and yeah he just said he was tired of being in a toxic relationship. And I was like okay but what about your baby and stuff like that and he was chilling. So this is when we first spend two weeks together seeing each other every day and hanging out and going to eat and the beach it was cool.
 After the two weeks he told me he has another baby on the way and I felt like shit and cried and I felt like he knew the whole time but he said he didn't that he had just found out but she is about two months sooo I dont know what to believe. I drop him off at work and I'm very upset, he left his phone in my car when I dropped him off and honestly I went through it. (Side note: he told me he hadn't spoken one word to his baby momma since the night he had left her which I also found hard to believe) and sure enough looking at his phone he was talking to her pretty much every day. Begging to see his daughter, he had told her ""I love you"" and that he just hung out with me a few times that I'm just some girl at work who had a crush on him like that lmao okay. At this point I'm pissed I go back to work to end things and just toss his phone at him but he wasn't there he went drinking to a bar close to work because he was too ""emotionally upset"" that I said I didn't wanna be with him because he has another baby on the way. Mind you I'm 21 and have no babies and honestly I had never seen anyone with kids before and tbh this shit seems too fucking complicated anyways I wish that was that but it continues. 
At the very end of the day we talk and we say how much we like each other, we end up messaging on Facebook and end up saying I love you to each other. I said that I forgive him for everything because I honestly had never felt so connected to someone ever in my life. I just told him that he better not ever lie to me ever again. I say that I'm getting sleepy and go to sleep and then wake up and I'm trying to message him. But hes not answering and I'm worried and then he blocks me. I go and find him cuz he had an interview I was supposed to take him to so I went and was like wtf and wth and he said he went back to his baby momma and I'm honestly like laughing at this point like he is saying shes basically satan and goes back to her lmao this is the stupidest shit in the world. I tell him off a bit and say to never fucking talk to me again but to be chill at work cuz its work. And after a week we end up working a shift together and honestly works chilling but I ended up crying. Because I felt dumb and used and lied to and played. I kept asking myself why am I so gullible and just stupid. I liked him honestly so much and was willing to put up with anything but then he lies to me blocks me and everything I felt dumb af. 
Then later that night he tells me he really does wanna be with me but that he cant just leave his baby momma, he needs like two weeks at the most and honestly i didnt understand that at all. But I was okay with that. 
I eventually get fed up I'm not even allowed to text him or see him only at work and its fucking annoying. I think this is hella immature for him and his baby momma being 2 years older than me too. I think to myself my god if I had a child with someone I didnt love or fell out of love with I'm sorry but bye. Child support and ya. Keep a friendly relationship and that's it. Especially if someone is hitting me and cheating on me and telling me I can't speak to anyone of the opposite gender and then giving me a curfew like hell nah. But wtv. In my mind hes choosing that life and I honestly cant really put myself in their shoes because I dont have children but I just cannot imagine it being that complicated or toxic af. Anyways, I got fed up with him telling me it's two weeks and blah blah, I say no. That if he really wanted to be with me that he would just tell her so and that would be that. So I'm not really one for ultimatums and plus it seemed like he really didnt even wanna leave her and when I think about it I didn't do shit with anyone meanwhile he went back to her, sleeping in the same bed as her and kissing her and supposedly nothing else than that happened but honestly now I have trust issues with him. And everytime I try telling him like I dont like this or can we fix this he always says ""but I left my baby for you I choose you at 4 am and blah blah"" when in reality we went back to his place and since he snuck out to see me his baby momma had already packed his stuff and put it outside tbh. And honestly I dont wanna move in with him so soon we have barely known each other for a month and it all seems so complicated like I feel like hes immature unless I'm seeing things any differently but I'm trying so hard to stay positive because we have a lot in common and I do enjoy his company. But I dunno. He said no more secrets but just the other day he deleted his whole conversation with his baby momma before I got a chance to see what he talked with her about. I wanna be happy with him but I feel like it's too much for me. I'm just tryna work and finish school tbh. 
I guess what I'm asking is how do I try to cope with this baby momma drama because I feel like I cant trust him especially since hes always questioning me and who I talk to. I've been cheated on before and one bad tell about cheaters is they always think you're cheating because they're the ones doing shit behind your back and get all worried and stuff. Which I think is hella annoying cuz I toss him my phone like nothing because I have nothing to hide. I dunno. What should I do. I kinda wanna just ghost him like what he did to me but I think that's fucked up I know if I tell him how I really feel then he will never forgive me. I just dont know what's good for me at this point. H. E. L. P.",03May2019,3
237,"Throwaway so this doesn't get back to me and out them

My friend recently told me that they'd rather use they/them pronouns, and I'm positive that I'm the only one who knows.
In addition to this, my friend has begun binding. I'm really excited for them because I can see how much it helps they're self esteem.

On the other hand, they're binding for almost 13 hours a day while most websites say one should bind for at most 8 hours. I checked to see if my friend knew this, and they said they were ok taking that big of a risk.

I'm worried not only for their health due to the binding, but also to their nonchalance towards the dangers. Being trans can increase chances of depression, self-harm, and even suicide, and I hope my friend isn't going down that path.

They agreed to talk to me about health stuff tomorrow, and I was just hoping for advice on how to handle the conversation. Where are my responsibilities drawn?

239,"Last night my girlfriend and I had a friend over, we had a few drinks and chatted for a few hours about various things.  Eventually I got tired and went to sleep while they stayed up.  While I was sleeping (as I found out the next morning from her, through tears and my own interpretation of what she told me) he plied her with drinks to the point where she couldn’t think straight (she had difficulty remembering what happened at first, it came back to her over the course of a few hours), then lured her off to the bathroom where he proceeded to strip her down and attempt to anally rape her.  She eventually got away from him and they apparently just went back to hanging out after that (??  This part I may not have full info on but he was still here when I woke up in the morning and they were both pretending like nothing happened, she may well have blocked it out by then.  Depending on how the next day or two plays out I may edit updates to this).  My main dilemma here is that getting a bunch of people together and just dealing with it through a beatdown isn’t enough for me.  My main way to get back at him is to simply tell his girlfriend what happened.  They’ve been together 5 years and have 2 kids together, and I know she would absolutely leave him and he’d never see any of them again.  The reason I haven’t done so yet is that I don’t know if that’s too harsh, it was one mistake after all and we’re talking about tearing a father away from 2 children that have done nothing to deserve that.  I need the internet’s help on this one, we may spend most of our time here cracking jokes and playing games but we’re still people capable of serious thought, that’s what I need from anyone who has taken the time to read this from start to finish.",03May2019,2

A bit of backstory- I'm a 19 yr old Hindu girl who's dating a 20 yr old Christian guy. My parents are unaware of me dating as i'm the daughter of a super orthodox Indian family. My boyfriends parents knew about us dating and were/are completely against it. They let him date under conditions such as, no kissing, no holding hands, no commitment, etc. and overall hoped that I was just a fling. Unfortunately for his parents, we both fell in love and decided to not really care about those rules. All was going fine until recently my dumbass boyfriend swore at his mum which led to his phone being confiscated for a week and him getting grounded. During this week his mum proceeded to go through all his chats and social media accounts. Bf deleted almost all evidence of us breaking any of her rules except a tiny chat on whatsapp which revealed that we had a pregnancy scare (we are sexually active).  Now his parents are upset as they believe that sleeping with a person of a different religion is a sin and he's going to ""hell"". They want to call my parents and inform them about all this so that I get severely punished (which means a good ass whooping and being sent to India) and I definitely don't wanna be shipped off.

They plan on calling my parents after my exams are over (May 16th) and i need some ideas to make sure my parents won't get to talk to them.

My best friend recently transferred to a different college ***far, far away*** and we've been keeping in touch through e-mails and letters. I tried  asking him once if he ever wants to video chat or talk on the phone, but  he told me that he'd rather not since those things make him anxious. I  don't have anxiety myself, so I know I can't fully understand it, and I  don't ever want to force him to do anything that makes him feel  uncomfortable.

***But I miss hearing his voice and seeing his face so much***. I visited him for 3 days last month and it made me realize how much I miss *actually*  talking to him. He just has the sweetest voice and the best smile and when I talk about video games with him, I want both of us to just ramble and word vomit and laugh and not just type out our thoughts like we're  writing Metacritic reviews.

My father passed away in December and during that time this friend really was the only person who I had and i truly trusted her more than i have anyone in a while (i have huge trust issues and this was personally pretty big for me) and its not that i dont still trust her, this might just be my trust issues but it could be me trying to justify something....

Point is we became roommates after my father passed, we work together so i knew she could afford to do this and the fact that she became my bestfriend and I truly felt like I could trust in her, its only been 3 months and most of the time things are good.

She fights alot with her boyfriend who doesn't have a job but stay here and watches their kid, we agreed i would pay 30% on utilitys and she would pay the rest and we would split rent considering there's 3 of them, and like i said we are bestfriends and im a very understanding person but im starting to feel a bit used..

I told her up front im not gonna freak if she needs a little extra time with rent and bills and stuff because i know how it is and im good with my money so she can pay me a little late if it what she need because I know how it can be, however.......

here we are in may and she owes me lets just say over $1000.... I'm just frustrated and Im starting to worry about my finances.... her boyfriend's parents are now tented out in the back yard for the next month (probably longer) which they asked about, and his brother has been sleeping on our couch since they moved in and they didn't even tell me about that... i literally asked if he was staying here.... but i let it go its small potatoes....

With all of this stuff together... plus she never asks how I'm doing or how my day was she just cares abouther stuff.... but won't actually talk to me about it if that makes sense... im just feeling down and a little stupid.... i want someone to tell me im not an idiot and that i didn't make a bad choice.... justify my friend for me...

I just dont know what the hell to do and i wanna cry... i have been crying all night actually i just really love and care about this person and i don't want to say anything because she's opened up about needing help in the passed and people lashing out because they feel like she's using them..... idk i just feel like i should just tell her how I'm feeling but im scared its gonna fuck up our friendship....im just tired of trying so hard and it feeling so one sided.... im just.... stupid and have way to high of expectations in people... thats my fault sorry....",03May2019,1

257,"There is this guy that I don’t even know if I necessarily like but I am a kind of person that just needs to know if someone likes me eventho I could know from the start that emotions aren’t mutual. It’s just a way that I am I guess. Wondering around in the dark frustrates the living shit out of me.

So basically, back to the main, juicy (?) point. He’s 2 years younger than me (I’m almost 18) and a family friend. We don’t hang out that much but this time we are, I guess you could say, trapped together in a house for the holidays (a week in total) which means it’s impossible for us not to interact.

I’m a very outgoing, loud and joyful person. I like to talk a lot and will never leave someone just sitting alone in the corner, especially if they are our guests. It’s also important to point out that my sense of humor is very dirty, open and overall without a shame. Me and my friends “flirt” with each other non stop, so that’s nothing new to me but when it comes to other people that I don’t know so well, I’m lost.

This is getting pretty long so let me give you some examples:

-me, him and my best friend were sitting around a fireplace and previous to that he had already made some comments about my arm being hot, due to hot fire (I was resting my head on his legs, facing my best friend, not seeing his facial expression) but this time he said “you are so hot” and instantly I responded (in a jokey way) with “Oh i know, I’m always hot”. He blushed and shook his head, while smiling ofc.

-while lying next to the fireplace he kept “punching” me with plushies and touching my arms. Whenever I told he to stop, cause he was distracting me from reading, he just smiled and continued. He kept doing this till we had to move elsewhere.

-Let me add that he has a “girl” that he’s talking to constantly (that meaning him being on his phone most of the time replying to her, whenever I’ve asked him about her he simply put his phone away, by which I’m not really bothered because after all we aren’t that close) and today he also said (it was in a context of a conversation we were having) that to him it doesn’t 
feel right to flirt with more than one girl at a time...

-We were swimming in a pool and for 2 or more days he didn’t dare to splash me or do anything with me in that joke-ish childish manner but today I guess he got super brave or something and pushed me into water multiple times. He also allowed me to be all over him while trying to “drown” him (that sounds really bad, but English isn’t my 1st language so i don’t t know better)

-whenever I look at him he smiles back

-our parents keep making weird comments and giving us weird looks. That is, let me say, nothing unusual for our parents (they are very open minded and love to joke around). But still it gets me wondering if they know something I don’t.

-he also had multiple “guy conversations” with my step dad (which I am very close to) about god knows what (probably girls) but personally I believe they were talking about me. I know that’s reaching but oh well...

I guess that were my main points. The last thing I would like to add is that yes I am I guess “flirting” with him back but that’s a part of my humor and I’m like that with everyone...I am aware that he maybe doesn’t know that and that is the reason why he is “playing along” you could say but I really don’t know.

260,"I’m a 19 female who’s taking Cymbalta for pain that stems from my fibromyalgia.

This medication is great besides a few side effect such as slight nausea and sleep problems, as it IS a strong anti-depressant.

Before saying I should switch meds, I want to point out that I’ve been on dozens of meds since I was 14, and this has been the best fit by far for me. 

But I have almost NO sexual desire when on it. It’s literally as if my boyfriend could be completely physically affectionate but I just don’t respond like I do when i’m off them. I can’t (sorry, NSFW) climax almost ever when on them, so it makes intimacy difficult for us sometimes. We got together in January and have a very loving relationship. I do believe I’m in love, and i’m his first real love.

I’ve gone off the meds a few times solely for the purpose of being able to be turned on when getting intimate with him. That way, it’s better for both of us. 

Honestly, sexual situations aren’t a big deal to me and I don’t care if we have them or not very often. I just love being with him. 

He’s never stopped me when I said i’m not taking my pills for a few days, because he knows i’m doing it for him. 

But my issue is that these meds are VERY strong, and not something you can just casually stop whenever. Am I stupid for stopping them just so we can enjoy ourselves? Should I feel kinda upset that he doesn’t seem to mind that stopping my meds messes with me really badly? I’ve expressed to him the negative effects that stopping my meds has, but he usually just doesn’t really say anything. He never objects when I say i’m stopping them for,.well you know the reason. 

He’s into whatever and doesn’t get upset when I stop him and say I don’t want to go any further, but i’m scared of losing him if I don’t live up to his needs or whatever. Lmao that sounds so stupid, my bad. 

I know that it’s an asshole thing for him to do, if he breaks up with me bc i’m on medication that doesn’t really let me get turned on. But also, I completely understand that some people view sex as an important part of a relationship, so if he were to leave me for that reason, I’d get it. Yeah, I’d be sad, but I don’t think i’d take it too personally, otherwise that would be sort of selfish. 

So basically, should I just stay on the meds and risk losing him? He’s never hinted at leaving me for that reason, but he’s a 20 year old guy and I know how you guys are, haha. Should I feel uncomfortable that he’s never objected me stopping the meds suddenly for a few days for his sake, despite this causing really bad side effect for my mental and physical health? Any advice would really be appreciated. Thanks.",03May2019,1

We are in the same friend group and everyone makes jokes about the 2 of us getting together and we would just laugh it off. Everywhere we go people assume we are a couple and would complement us on how good we are together and we used to tell them we're not together but we kind of just roll with it now and play along. As you can see in the title, there's a problem. We agreed to get together when her and her boyfriend breaks up but I don't think I can wait any longer. She tells me she likes me more than she likes him. Here's the bigger problem- They live together. Before you guys attack me and tell me I'm a home wrecker or a bad person, let me explain. I know I shouldn't do anything about it so when I started to develop feeling for her, I tried cutting her off but she would keep showing up to my job at the supermarket and we would ALWAYS have so much fun together that she would stay for my whole shift and I'll take her home afterwards or we would hang out with just the 2 of us. They've broken up 3 times before just because he felt like it and she only moved in with him because she got into a huge argument with her dad and sister and had nowhere to go. He would always go out with his friends and leave her at home bored and they don't go on dates and on the rare occasion they do, it's because she threatens to break up with him and he'll make her pay for it. I really don't know what to do because I'm pretty sure she likes me too but I'm friends with her boyfriend and recently these feeling I had for her are amplified out of proportion.  My co-workers just recently asked me why the hell aren't we together and I told them what's been going on and let's just say they don't like her. They think what she's doing is very unfair to me because she wants to do everything with me but isn't with me (They're a lot older than me and they're just looking out for me because they think i'm a good kid).

When I finished high school I vowed not to let my anxiety rule my social life and I actually managed to have a very fun 5 years at university (I dropped out twice).

I discovered Valium 5 years ago just after uni and that helped me despite the fact I was getting it illegally off the dark web. It helped me gain and keep some decent jobs and also conquer my most powerful fear - not being able to attract women.

When I started taking Valium at 25 (I was a virgin) I went on a bit of an online dating spree and ended up sleeping with about 20 girls in that 4-5 year period between then and now although none more than 3 times. The valium abuse allowed me to sleep walk through these dates and give off a 'cool' casual vibe which I think some women found attractive on the first couple of dates but I've never had a girlfriend or meaningful female friendship.

Now I've just been fired from my last job as I was taking 2 Xanax's daily to cope with my anxiety and although I got away with it socially (people at worked seemed to like me, if not thinking I was a bit stupid), my attention to detail was terrible.

Now I am 29 years old, have not made any steps towards any respectable career with a decent income (one of my priorities in life) nor have I ever had a meaningful relationship with a girl (another priority in life).

In terms of platonic friendships and random life experiences I have zero complaints but career-wise and in terms of my love life I am over a decade behind what I think is an acceptable level. I live at home with my parents and have no money.

I have been truthful about everything else in my life, its just instead of me being a guy I am a girl. At the beginning I just didn't want to be slightly embarrassed by saying ""by the way I'm actually a guy"". Had no idea it would turn into this one day, it is a huge regret.

I have never ever used this for some kind of benefit to myself, it has always been a platonic give and take friendship. He's had shitty girlfriends and depression, I've always tried my best to help him through bad times. He now lives with a girl he loves and has been for about 5 years. He has also always been there for me in my depression, being cheated on, lots of bad times for me as well. He is my best friend and I treasure his friendship greatly, and through him I am friends with his friends now as well. I currently have no friends in real life, it is just these guys online.

I said I would think about it. The guilt has weighed on me for some time but that was absolutely crushing. I've joined on group calls with them sometimes for video games when they push it, but I've always said I don't have a mic or webcam. Or that voice calls give me anxiety (which is true, I don't like talking on phones). Bob and his friends really seem to want to see what I look like and sound like, which admittedly is fair because I know what they look and sound like.

I would love to just drop this and show them who I am, and for them to just forget it ever happened or not care and be like ""What, that's it?"". But I think they will care. They will be hurt, and will not want to be my friend anymore. How can you trust someone who does this? I continue this because if they decide to not be my friend anymore, I will be truly alone.

Okay so.. I just..

There’s been a lot of people online where I like them when they type and how they act online. 

Like this guy that made me want to rant about this right now. 

He seemed fine through text, and honestly, had an amazing foreskinned cock, and I had fun talking to him and texting him whenever I was supposed to be doing other things.

During all of this not once had I asked for a face pic. And then last night I was like, huh. And I thought he’d probably be adorable.

I ask him for one and he sends one without hesitation.....

And that’s when I’m completely shut down. Hes 19, I’m 18. 

And, at least to me, he’s really ugly. And it doesn’t make any sense to me! He had an amazing body in his vids and pics, he acted pretty great and seemed great from that...


But he went from “this guy seems really cool. I kinda like him” to “holy shit this guy is a creep weirdo” after just sending two pictures.


Okay, and let me explain. 

The first one he sends, he has long(just.. ew on guys) brown hair, and I don’t find his face attractive at all.

(Then there’s another thing I’ll mention later..)


Then the second, is a picture of him smoking a cigarette... With circular rim glasses on, and his... unattractive face.



I am completely turned off, not only as possibly more than friends and sharing pictures like our bodies but also even talking to him.. thankfully I said to him I was going to bed right before he sent them..

But I honestly didn’t know what to say.. I just said after a minute “...You’re cute.”

Like, am I supposed to say “you’re ugly”? “I don’t like how you look”? “I’m turned off, sorry”? “I don’t want to talk to you anymore”?


Also, let me mention the other thing in the first photo. I noticed on the right side of the photo behind him that there’s a CREEPY ass doll face and eye showing or something. I’m pretty sure that’s what it is too.

Like, WTF? And who would take a photo of themselves and not notice that or realise how creepy it is? 

And why would he not realises how ugly he is? 

And then after all of that, and me saying “oh... you’re cute”
He then sends a video of a golf cart driving up to him while he’s recording... Wtfff???

Again, he went from “Really cool guy, he seems really great, and kind and cool” to “This guy is a really creepy ugly troll...”


And here’s a thing..

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. I’ve met a guy from Hawaii before on a game, and talks to him cause he was nice and then he sent a pic and was UGLY as fuck, and I didn’t want to talk to him anymore. And then he like fell in love with me or something after just a bit of us talking and like 2 years later is asking me on the same site why I stopped talking to him, what did he do? He’s so sorry, etc.

But how do I just say that he’s ugly?

Eventually I did tell him that I don’t find him physically attractive. Like, at all. 

I think I said “Honestly.. you’re just really ugly to me..” I think I might’ve also said like once he sent me the picture I was just... turned off.


But what I’m trying to say is, this isn’t the first time this has happened, and I don’t understand WHAT SHOULD I DO? It’s like no choice would be right. I’m not gonna keep talking to them and suffer with the fact that they’re ugly and creepy looking behind the screen. I don’t want to send pics to him after knowing that. 

Someone, anyone, please give me your opinion on what I should do. Even if it’s harsh criticism, ill take it. 


Also.. I think I’m gonna post the photos. You wouldn’t completely understand without me doing so.

273,"I met this girl almost a year ago and it took a minute but we got close and became bestfriends honestly, she's the bestfriend I have ever had... but im looking back and im starting to question myself in this friendship... i think i might have fucked up. 

My father passed away in December and during that time this friend really was the only person who I had and i truly trusted her more than i have anyone in a while (i have huge trust issues and this was personally pretty big for me) and its not that i dont still trust her, this might just be my trust issues but it could be me trying to justify something....

Point is we became roommates after my father passed, we work together so i knew she could afford to do this and the fact that she became my bestfriend and I truly felt like I could trust in her, its only been 3 months and most of the time things are good.

She fights alot with her boyfriend who doesn't have a job but stay here and watches their kid, we agreed i would pay 30% on utilitys and she would pay the rest and we would split rent considering there's 3 of them, and like i said we are bestfriends and im a very understanding person but im starting to feel a bit used..

I told her up front im not gonna freak if she needs a little extra time with rent and bills and stuff because i know how it is and im good with my money so she can pay me a little late if it what she need because I know how it can be, however.......

here we are in may and she owes me lets just say over $1000.... I'm just frustrated and Im starting to worry about my finances.... her boyfriend's parents are now tented out in the back yard for the next month (probably longer) which they asked about, and his brother has been sleeping on our couch since they moved in and they didn't even tell me about that... i literally asked if he was staying here.... but i let it go its small potatoes....

With all of this stuff together... plus she never asks how I'm doing or how my day was she just cares abouther stuff.... but won't actually talk to me about it if that makes sense... im just feeling down and a little stupid.... i want someone to tell me im not an idiot and that i didn't make a bad choice.... justify my friend for me...

I just dont know what the hell to do and i wanna cry... i have been crying all night actually i just really love and care about this person and i don't want to say anything because she's opened up about needing help in the passed and people lashing out because they feel like she's using them..... idk i just feel like i should just tell her how I'm feeling but im scared its gonna fuck up our friendship....im just tired of trying so hard and it feeling so one sided.... im just.... stupid and have way to high of expectations in people... thats my fault sorry....",03May2019,1
275,"so I have a boyfriend and he is completely fine with me being friends with other males as I am completely fine with him being friends with other females, we have a respect and trust with one another. But sometimes random guys will message me with the intent to possibly start talking more than friends and usually they don’t know I have a boyfriend because i’m not one to post about our relationship all over or only talk about him, and I tell the guys that I have a boyfriend and some are respectful of my relationship but others will completely stop talking to me because the know I won’t do more with them and it upsets me, i’ll what to do, any advice.?",03May2019,1
276,"If anyone here will be kind enough to help me figure out what is going on and what to do about my family situation, please bear in mind that I (31F) am living in a small country in Eastern Europe, with high unemployment rates, almost no welfare support, a declining medical system, no vocational programs, basically a shithole and we survive here by leaning onto family and inner social circles. This will be a long post, so bear with me. I am partially writing this as a way to vent as well.

My brother was born when I was 5yo. I noticed when he was a baby that something was different about him, mostly because he barely maintained eye contact. He would wet his bed until 4yo and was obsessed with cranes from age 3 to 7yo, drawing them on papers, family photos, and magazines. 

My parents were in denial about anything being wrong with him until he started doing poorly in school. He was  diagnosed with ADHD in first grade. My mother decided not to put him on medication or any special program, and my brother struggled academically and socially throughout his school years. He was severely bullied in high school and became extremely withdrawn as a result. Because he was interested in video games and computers at this time, my father saw this as a great opportunity to get him to develop IT skills, which was inspired by a friend of my father who did the same with his geek son. So, he bought him a computer. But unlike that geek son who grew to become a CEO of a successful IT firm, my brother went on to develop a gaming and Internet addiction. 

Ever since my brother had finished high school, he has been spending his days on the computer from 5PM to 6AM and sleeping throughout the day. He does absolutely nothing to help around the house and has no friends and does not socialize. This has been going on for 9 years. Recently, a family friend who is an owner of a bakery offered to give my brother training and the possibility of employment. Given that my brother has no work ethics or social skills, he has been complaining about work incessantly even though he went to work for only 3 days and is in training. 

Now here's the thing, my mother has been working abroad since my brother was 10 and I was 14yo. Since that time, my father pressured me to take on almost all housework that would take up a lot of my time and energy during my adolescence and youth, while my brother was never obliged to do anything. Because of this ""Cinderella"" type of situation, I moved as soon as I finished college and am now living with my SO. 

I would complain to my mother about the lack of disciplining of my brother and over-disciplining of myself at the hands of my father, but she either keeps quite or says, ""oh well."" If I talk to any of them about my brother needing structure, discipline, boundaries, less enabling, therapy, and medical assistance, they get offended and the shift the blame onto me as not doing anything to help my brother. I want to help re-socialize my brother and get him to see a doctor for his mental health. But I cannot do this while he is under the care of my parents who've essentially given up on him since he was 10yo and left him to his own devices. 

My brother does not listen to me and he is comfortable with his situation. Asking him to do anything results in him having anger outburst, slam doors, and make up excuses. I want to go with him to a doctor and take him out of the house to socialize, one step at a time. But how can I do this with my passive, enabling parents who won't take part in any of this? By the way, both parents are 58yo. Father has been on disability retirement for all this time, mother is working. They are uneducated about mental illness and their argument is that only you can help yourself and no doctor can help you (mind above matter). They are also in the habit of blaming the country for my brother's issues and ignore advice given by friends and family. They spend their free time shopping, going to art exhibitions, spas, and gardening while my brother is rotting in his room.",03May2019,1
277,"Okay so I know im very young into my job and I don't know alot but I need help for saving up.

So I'm currently 16, graduated and looking to save up for a car. I work at a local Starbucks for $12 flat, I have been putting overtime and been working 80+ hours for my next paycheck. I've been anticipating the amount I was getting and was for sure gonna get at least $800 subtracting at least %15 from taxes due to having 0 dependents. (Keep in mind taxes are raised in Hawaii right now due to the sky train that is being built.) 

I worked a double shift on Easter (13.5 hrs) which was time and a half. The rest of the week I worked 74.1 hrs. Overall it was supposed to be $892.5 to be payed out to me. But I only got $680.12 maybe it's due to me having usaa so they take some money during the transfer but idk. Im not sure where to get my paystub either (gonna check with my boss tomorrow).

I got approved for overtime as well so that it's out there.

If you guys have any advice for me so that I can see where all the excess money is going please help.

Anything helps thanks.",03May2019,1
278,"My dad has been fully supporting my aunt and her son since 2006 financially, sending them 1000s of Euros every month for education and life expenditures. My aunt has not been working since then due to mild hypertension, and always 'feeling sick'. When my cousin finished with school, my dad managed to get him into good university because he recommended him. When my cousin finished his study, my dad took all expenses to find a job at his workplace in EU (mind that cousin lived outside EU, in a poor place), in a highly prestigious company. He accommodated him and his wife in our house, payed all expenses (insurance, etc.), entertained him, and spent tonn of energy and effort because he considered him as his son and best friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

After my cousin managed to gain some money, get his own house and assets, his attitude changed to absolute jerk. Not going into details, my cousin turned all my family against my dad who hate him now (they do not even talk to him), tried to manipulate their boss to fire my dad, tried to file a false accusation, and constantly 'bullies' him at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has been absolutely devastated after this. His health is deteriorating on my eyes, he constantly complaints if headaches, stress, and weakness. I think he is becoming depressed. Now that he is not doing financially well, all the family that he was helping, turned their backs on him. I am really scared for his well being, but I am only 18 so I do not know how to help him.

Okay so I've been applying to jobs like crazy for the last maybe 4 months, I've applied to over 60 a month, this includes applying through online websites (like indeed) and walking from store to store, I've rewritten my resume many times, and I've had my dad (a successful business man) go through it line by line and he thinks it's good so I trust him, especially since I'm not applying for anything special, I have no experience and I'm applying to jobs that need no experience..

Is there any alternative to going to work at some store since I clearly can't get a job, are there online jobs I can apply to that pay decent money? I'm not looking for things like surveys, or the UserTesting website, those websites don't make good money, I just need to do something.. thank you!

281,"So I’m in love with someone who I get along very well with. We’ve been together for about a year and a half. We met through tinder, were supposed to be 1 night stands, but fell in love.

He is so incredibly sweet. He loves me so much. He bends backwards for me. But there’s some problems.

Firstly, my parents really dislike him. They think he’s unmotivated, a loser, and rude. I don’t think my parents are out to get him or biased in anyway; they genuinely care about me. It’s just that they never gave him a chance, and when they form these judgments they usually stick and they get incredibly pushy.

They think he’s rude because of an incident on Christmas, but I feel there was miscommunication on both sides. My sisters also dislike him because they think he’s rude, but he’s just rough around the edges.

My family and I are incredibly sensitive and we feel very entitled to act a certain way. We’ve grown to have a pretty privileged life due to my parents sacrifices, and I guess it makes us view the world differently.

Secondly, he is in a really tough financial situation. As someone who’s never had to struggle because of my family, it took me a long time to understand and realize that life is really hard. 

He lives in his car. He doesn’t go to school. He can’t replace his license after he lost it so he’s in danger of getting pulled over and fined. Because he lives in his car, he has no address and that prevents him from those two things.

He works a part time job at little Cesar’s because work is hard to come by in his area apparently. 

However, he doesn’t have anyone to fall back on. He’s literally doing everything by himself. His dad was abusive and his mom abandoned him a long time ago. He no longer has any friends who can help him out. So he’s living off of his own wage.

It’s incredibly hard to be able to keep yourself afloat when there’s no one there to help. I have my parents and two siblings who have the ability to help me financially, who do help me financially. So I honestly can see why he’s struggling. I wouldn’t have anything if I didn’t have anyone either.

My family keeps saying that his situation should force him to be more motivated, but that’s just not how life works. Not everyone can keep pushing themselves until they’re just done.

A lot of people that I’ve met, who’ve gone without basic necessities like a home and food, don’t sweat the small stuff anymore because they’ve felt with worse things. Because they know things will get better because it did. 

I want to believe he’ll get into a better spot, but I just don’t understand how he can. Everything is against him. He can’t get a better job to get more money without an education or connections. He doesn’t know anyone and he can’t go to school without a stable home and address. So he’s stuck with no home and no money!

But all of this pressure with my family is really freaking me out. His situation worries me. I’m scared he won’t be able to get out of this crap hole that he’s stuck in. And because he can’t get out, my parents will never accept him and will never like him. So I’ll just be stuck being judged and looked down on unless we break up or his situation dramatically changes.

We fight so often, I judge him so harshly, and he still asks me to stay. I don’t understand why he’s even giving me the light of day when I basically shit all over his life.

I’m really stressing out man. I want to be with him because he makes me feel a way that I’ve never felt before. But I can’t because there’s so much pressure and stress from being together.

Should I just move on and hope I can find someone who makes me feel the same way? Do I fight it out even if it’s wearing down my mental health? 

TLDR; our relationship is difficult to be in. Should I end it?",03May2019,0

284,"I was scheduled to do a group work with 3 other people at Uni. The presentation is today. I have not replied to them in over a week on Whatsapp, although I am guessing they can see I have been online. The last thing I told them was that I maybe would give up on the group work, finish the course by final exam and send the teacher an email regarding the situation. I have done none of those things and never said anything back to them and did not show up to the group meeting. Somehow I went to bed every night thinking tomorrow morning I will tell them and apologize. Last night while I was in bed (\~23h30) I got a text telling me to go on Whatsapp urgently. Without clicking on the group chat I could see they were wondering where I was and if I would show up and what they should to today regarding the presentation. I was too ashamed to answer them.

  
While I realize this is not and cannot be an excuse to treat people badly, I have been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for several years now. I am doing much better now compared to a few years ago and am on medication, and started doing a bunch more things recently. However, I still have these bouts and one of my biggest struggles is accountability and time management. I know I am not a reliable partner and hate that I am not; people always wondering if I will deliver or not. I have been doing better this semester but this set me back a lot and I have a lot of shame around it, specially because I'm older, I work part-time and I always have a lot of excuses for people during the past 1-2 years. I don't know how to explain myself or apologize properly when all I can say is ""I was in bed and did not return anyone's messages"". I went to school twice for 2 other things this week. It's very unprofessional and does not cut it, I know, and they obviously deserve better. And I struggle to say I will not do anything like this again because 1. the harm to them is already done 2. I am not sure it will never happen again although I have been doing better. I don't won't to be spiriling again on this stort of ""guilt-shame-I fucked up-they hate me-I can't go to class now-they are all taling about me"" again, I have done this for years at another place where I was quite miserable.  
How should I apologize to my colleagues and teacher? This is a rather small technical University setting, with 2 small classes per degree, so I struggle admitting my problem in this context where everyone almost knows everyone else. Any help would be apreciated. Thank you.  


PS. I know I should be on therapy to cope with some bad repeting behaviours but I cannot afford it at the moment besides the occasional psych consult to check on medication.

285,"When I was about 14 some new neighbours moved in to the attached house next to mine. They had one daughter, who at the time of moving here was 7 or 8. Her parents were slowly separating so she’d come into our garden and house most days to have some lunch, play some games, and just be able to be a kid without the stress of her parents. I basically raised her like a little sister for the 2 years they stayed here and it was nice to be able to help.

So they moved away after 2 years of staying here and we never really heard from them again. I’m now 24, and that 8 year old girl is 18. Long story short, she came up on my social media mutual friends so I added her. One normal catch-up conversation later and she sends me some fully nude videos.

And drunk as hell me thought if he shows up he must feel the same way! 
(He doesnt i am fully aware he is as hetero as one can be)
So he shows up and immediatly knows something is wrong.

He ask: is everything okay?
Me: yeah idk i want to tell you something..
Him: what is it? Tell me.
Me: i dont know how to
Him: Dont worry just tell me!
Me: well i, i think i might've fallen in Love with you.

Him:*laughs* you're joking right?
In Love ? like really in Love ?
F*ck dude
Me: yup..

My question now is what the Hell am i supposed to do? How can i ever look in his eyes again?
I dont love him i was really drunk out of my mind, i do have strange feelings for him yeah but i dont love love him.

288,"Here's the story. Our company has three company mobile phones, these are used for quick/easy access to our social media profiles to upload content (images and bulletins) one individual, lets call him Gary, has a habit of keeping himself logged into his personal profile when using one of the phones that is designated our Facebook page phone. In order to upload content, he logs into his personal profile where he is a Moderator.

So, last week I found out from a person in an high enough ranking role that management (2 women and 1 man, with the 2 women apparently being instigators) that they sat down and went through Gary's messages with other colleagues.

Gary's messages included things such as, Louise is lazy, does nothing in the office, Mike is a loser and always will be, Anna hates her manager because she did A, B and C, she also apparently slept with Mike. You get the idea. He's a gossip, he's a social butterfly who walks to talk to everyone, even people who he dislikes, but he's extremely charming and gets people to open up to him.

Now a lot of peoples lives are being made hell, management are treating certain individuals badly (getting thrown under the bus for doing things that other individuals do with no issue, being spoken down to ""you're as useless as a chocolate teapot"" and so on, and only a handful of us know why. No-one has the guts to tell Gary, because we know that he'll get asked who told him, and that puts whoever said in a whole world of trouble.

289,"I am a college student that got an interview for an internship in my field of study, however they will likely require a drug test as this is standard for their full time employees (however I am unsure about interns).  

The issue is that one of my parents works in this company and probably played a role in getting me an interview.    As a result, it's very possible they are connected to the people hiring me.  I smoke semi frequently and would likely need to take a urine test in a couple of weeks if I get past these interviews.  My parents are very anti drugs and would be furious if they knew I lost the internship because of a failed drug test.  Since I would be living with them during this period, I am quite sure it would be a mess and am afraid of them taking even further drastic measures.  I am even afraid of them stopping to help pay for my college as they have held this threat above me before.

So I am wondering if I should intentionally do poor on these interviews to prevent having to take and fail a drug test.  Thanks!",03May2019,9

291,"So at my class at school we were told to get in groups of 2 or 3 to work on an assignment. The teacher assigned a random subject to each group to prepare a report on. I paired up with a friend. 

When the teacher came over to us, she asked if us and this kid sitting next to us were all in a group. Put on the spot, I mistakenly said ""yes"" because he was the only one without a group right then and I didn't want to seem a jerk. 

So, the teacher gave all 3 of us the same subject to report on, and then did the same for the rest of the groups in class. So now Idk if it's too late to kick the guy out and if she still has any other subjects left to give out. 

This guy has a ""black sheep"" reputation (for good reason). He's into drugs, always gets into trouble, and makes everyone uncomfortable. Not only do I not want classmates to see us with him, I know he'll make 0 contribution towards the assignment and just weigh us down.

I need advice in this I have almost every important even in my life (because I am unmedicated for my ADHD rn so I can't keep on track) if anyone can help me figure out what the fuck to do i would be so grateful.

Idk what is wrong with me 

I just need to explode

My name is \*redacted\*

Son of \*redacted\*  and \*redacted\*

Idk where my problems started

I feel like one day I was a kid who had to put up with toxic friends just to have any 

And now I am dealing with movie level romanse for my best friend who does not share these feelings

Her name is \*redacted\*

And wow she is awesome

I feel like I found the most awesome girl on the planet

And I don't feel like I can ever achieve a relationship with her 

She is just so awesome

We have plans to go kayaking next month just the two of us 

Unfortunately she only thinks of me as a friend

I love her drive and ferocity

My nickname for her is La Tigra

We were best friends in elementary school

I remember playing under the jungle gym and pretending to cast spells

I even remember digging in the sand and making bridges out of sand and meeting our hands under it

Then she just kinda disappeared in middle school

I kinda never realized I never saw her again she just kinda faded 

So I went on with my life 

In middle school I had the opportunity to learn spanish (I feel is important)

As I did in elementary school and high school

Then in middle school my childhood friend \*redacted\* ghosted me

I was left with no friends and I was a very awkward kid

All I wanted was a friend

I had opportunities but I always messed it up and pushed them away

I was also bullied a lot too physically and otherwise

I never was brave enough to fight back 

In 4th grade I had my first fight 

The kid was a 5th grader and we were in a after school program

He took my ball and held it over my head 

His name was \*redacted\* 

I don't remember what happened next until my fingers were wrapped around his neck

I got up not wanting to continue and saw the looks on other kids faces 

It did not bother me in the moment 

I am drinking rum and orange juice

I next thing I remember the counsellor comes running out 

My dad come to pick me up from the office 

I am crying

They give me a lolly pop

The rest is extremely fuzzy

Idk why I had to write all of that 

Anyways the next thing of note is near the end of middle school

My dad starts dropping me off at school every day

Btw there is more to the bullying I just don't feel like it right now

On his way to dropping me off he tells me about the military 

I am fascinated

Years before I wanted  to be a engineer

But after I saw a coast guard documentary I looked into the navy

I must of found out about seals cuz I said no thank you and then looked in to the coast guard

After my dad told me about the navy I decided that would be me 

I kinda forgot about that

I remember back in my after school program talking about joining the military 

And saying I will join

I am listening to spanish music rn and bothered I can't understand what is being said 

I started freshman year of highschool

I run into a friend I vaguely remember from middle school

I remember playing with nerf guns in the park by my house

His name is \*redacted\*

He was in a NJROTC uniform and telling me about it

I switch in during the second quarter 

I ran into a old kinda friend from middle school band 

His name is \*redacted\*

His gf was talking to me about my favorite band Bowling For Soup

I told her my favorite song was Almost 

Hers too

Over the next 2 years I developed a huge crush on her

Her bf was abusive

In sophomore year I met this kid named \*redacted\*

I finally had a friend

Back track

In 7th grade i kinda dated this girl \*redacted\*

She was my first kiss

We met in bible class

We kissed for the first time at the church party 

In the bushes

Then again in front of our friend that just came out as bi that night

Then we did more stuff the next week in the playground during class

I don't think I believed in god back then 

Still dont 

She had chin length curly hair

I can still picture her face perfectly 

I never saw her again after that night 

I asked to switch churches

Back to highschool

By jr year I had (and still have) two amazing friends that I am very close with to this day 

After a while me and \*redacted\* (miguel's now x gf) started dating 

And it was really good at first

At first we were a perfect match 

But by the time Ibecame a sr and she graduated we were too different 

She broke up with me the day before easter 2018

Before that I had already reacquainted tigra

We would walk together after school

We started hanging out after my ex broke up with me 

I am tipsy now 

Anyways tigra invites me to her birthday party we go to the beach just the two of us

After we hang at my house and her other friends show up 

We take two cars to miami

Me and tigra in one and her other friends in the other 

Her friends got lost and went home 

It was just me and tigra 

We got tacos in south beach

We drove around downtown

We hung out on the beach 

Her friend \*redacted\* shows up

She insinuates she wants one on one time with \*redacted\*

I go home by myself in the rain 

Some of the worst rain I have ever seen 

I am on the bridge and terrified as waves hit it 

I go home 

As soon as i get there i tell my parents that I dropped her off

I was embarrassed that she sent me home 

Months go by until prom

We hangout a couple more times but not much

She tells my friend that she knows I like her 

I tell her she is wrong

I lied

We slowly become better friends 

Prom rolls around 

I get my ticket just to hang with her 

I maybe hang with her 25 minutes that night 

I get wasted at my friends house after 

I think I called her or my friend did

I say some stupid shit and hang up

I am now sad

At graduation I am almost over her

She basically ignores me (not in a rude way more like i am doing 5,000,000 things at once way)

I kinda say whatever

We start talking again

My feeling double

We slowly start hanging out more

Eventually she starts school and work and I start work 

We don't get to hang out often  

We become best friends 

We talk everyday

I feel like I am in love with her

We hangout at least once a week 

I decide fuck the military I want to become a commercial pilot 

We have weekly spanish lessons 

After we play guitar together

Then watch movies

I have made it clear I just see her as a friend 

I am a FUCKING LIAR

I feel like shit about lying

We tell eachother everything 

We go and see avengers endgame

After she shows me a picture of a ripped guy and says thats what she likes

I feel angry and UGHHHHHHHHHH

Later that week we chat online for 3+ hours straight

I open up to her about my emotions 

She tells me it is ok and lets me be emotional

She tells me how awesome I am

I cry tears of happiness for the first time in my life

I am late to work the next day 

Boss tells me to go home and rest for tomorrow 

I call her up 

We go get food and chill at her house watching tv the whole time

She is the only person I can jerk off to at this point  

As far as I can tell she has no feeling for me in the same way

We just sit on her couch and watch anime

I leave at 2 am

I go for a long drive that involves me pulling over on the highway at 3am on the verge of crying 

I go home and write this 

I need help

299,"In a nut shell, my partner and I have been together for a year although we broke up briefly for a few weeks about six months ago. Things are good and we have a great relationship.
However, the girl whom he dated previously is still very much in his group of friends. She has never shown any respect for our relationship ie trying to continue contact when we were dating, trying to undermine our relationship when in public and throwing herself at my ex the second we broke up.
It’s fine in the sense that my partner and I have discussed it and how I’d feel comfortable acting around her socially but the problem is I don’t know how to act.
I recently ran into her and she was all smiles and nice (she’s one of those people everyone likes and thinks is “nice”)
I was polite but curt. (Last time I ran into her all I got was dirty looks) 
I don’t want to be petty and rude but I also don’t want to give off the appearance that I’m cool with her behaviour towards our relationship.

300,"I'm sixteen years old and I have not been to school in three years. I decided to be homeschooled due to not being able to understand what is being taught to me and feeling worried to go to school. My parents agreed to home school me but they haven't taught me a thing. They don't buy me textbooks and workbooks because they're costly and a waste of money because I am too dumb to do the work provided in them. My parents don't even try and teach me using free resources like Khan Academy, they get mad at me when I ask for help and expect me to be able to teach myself with very little resources. I try and learn what I can for free on the internet but I am not understanding anything.   


I struggle with all subjects, especially math and English. I can hardly do arithhmetic and find myself counting on my fingers for basic math,  I can't do pre-algebra and I need to learn how to do that before I move on to algebra. I have been trying to learn pre-algebra and algebra for years but still can't.  


I'm below grade level and don't seem to be progessing in school.  I am starting to lose motivation in school because no matter how hard I try I don't seem to be good enough.  


I would like to get a GED but I don't have the proper documentation in order to obtain a GED, you need a photo ID in order to get one.  I don't even own a birth certicate and you need money in order to get one.

I would like to make myself some money but I don't have the documents needed to work. My parents are either not willing or not responsible enough to save enough money to pay for my documents.

301,"I have a boyfriend of 2 years. 

This December I learned he owed a debt amounting to 17,335.86  USD (almost a million of money's worth in our currency)  to his Japanese step dad since he had access to their funds here and is the one managing it for their transfer to their new home (condominium near work) next year. His sister was furious. I was surprised that it accumulated that much. I only know he borrows money but i never thought it already amounted to that much. I always asked him if he has a tracker or spreadsheet of his expenses or amount borrowed from that account, but i don't get a proper answer whenever he does. He told me it started way before he entered our company. I was surprised and taken aback. 2 years into the relationship and he only told me now. :( I wish we could have prevented it from blowing up that big. 

Months after, I saw he got a new bag -- different from the branded that we got this Christmas for him. I asked him about it and he told me his mom got him that bag as a gift. At the back of my mind though I was thinking it was him who purchased it. 

Another incident was of lately, when i noticed he got a new phone. I told him about it and he told me that it was his mom's gift to him (again) but they're splitting on the monthly fees to pay up for it. I felt sad. It only buried him further in his debt. I'm silently panicking deep inside until i got him to tell me the status of his debt--- which is now  28,890.60 USD (1.5m in our currency). I felt angry- lost and sad deep inside. I couldn't show how angry I was. The only thing i can say was advice him to at least cut his expenses because this is really absurd. Definitely can create a rift too in their family. 

Both of us are in the age of marriage though I don't really expect him to propose or anything but at this rate, we're supposed to at least start saving for the future. I admit i'm not exactly the saving type either and gets debts too but my debts are payable by if not 1 week then at least 1 month max. :( 

Seeing how he's supposed to pay that off, it'll take him 3-5 years or more and if he was to save money for himself, it'll take him 2 years or more as well---- with me far from the future plans.

I just wanna know... if its selfish of me to leave? Because I'm trying my best to communicate myself-- my insights and all and try not to get mad (i tend to cuss a lot but i chose not to this time) and help him but how long should i hold on?   
Its starting to affect my health and with how i treat him already... I wish anyone could give me insight. 

My mind's bordering on that breakup because i don't wanna add up to his expenses plus i'm starting to show that anger slowly through my actions. Its scary.  But also I feel like breaking up with him will cause repercussions on me and him.

I chose him long ago and wooed him because I believe he's responsible and mature.He's a really nice and generous guy. But I never thought its going to be like this. :(",03May2019,1

309,"Oh boy, here we go.

Backstory: 

My dad owns two houses next to each other on the same (quite sizable for the area) property. In one house my dad and stepmom live, the other house is inhabitated by my brother, his wife and their son, and a couple living in their upstairs apartment.

My dad rents the house out to my brother, charging him $1200 a month, which is a super cheap rate for the size of the house and the property. On the free market it would fetch around $2000+/month. My brother then sublets the upstairs appartment for $800, effectively paying $400 in rent himself.

I live in a city apartment, 30 minutes away from them in a very, very expensive city.


The problem:

With their second baby now planned, my brother and his wife want to ""overtake"" the whole house, since the couple living upstairs is also moving out. They already remodeled their apparment and created a new room for the baby. So they are investing money into the house.

It is becoming apparent that they might settle there forever, paying $1200 in rent and effectively treating the place like it is their own (remodeling, renovating, etc. the house).

I on the other hand am stuck in my appartment in the city, living with my girlfriend. I earn quite well, but it is absolutely out of question for me to buy property of my own. Renting a bigger place is possible but would financially completely exhaust me, while they can comfortably live in a nice house and a great garden (honestly, a garden is what I miss most)

I feel like I should also be able to benefit from this property just as much as my brother. How can I approach this subject? We are meeting for a talk about it soon, but so far I feel isolated with my ""problem"" and a situation that everybody else seems to be completely fine with.

My initial suggestion was to evaluate a market rate rent for the place (~$2000) and make my brother pay me half of the rent reduction my dad offers him. That would be about $400 a month. This idea was met with the answer ""I can't afford that"". And it is true, the $1200 in rent is already financially exhausting my brother and his new family.

What can I do? I feel stuck in my small flat with no way out (except relocating far away) while my brother can live for cheap in the nice family property. How can this be sensibly approached? Am I maybe even in the wrong? Thank you for any words of advice.",03May2019,1

314,"So, I've been in uni for a few years now, jumping between different majors, mostly within the social sciences. I realise now that the main reason I went to uni was because I didn't know what I would do if I didn't, and because I felt pressured and like I wouldn't be able to get a decent job without a degree. I'm coming to the end of my semester, and I thought that I would finish this semester, go study what I've realised I love doing and could make a career out of (beauty therapy/salon management), and if I ever decide to go back to uni, just pick up where I left off in the future. 

However, I applied for a scholarship for a semester abroad doing fieldwork, not thinking I would get it, but wanting to try anyway. Turns out, I got it! I've studied anthropology for the last year (I'm approaching my final year of undergrad study), and while I really love it and have actually been getting great marks in it, I don't think I want to continue onto postgrad, which I feel like I'd have to do to land a job related to the field as I've been told a BA in Anthropology doesn't yield a lot of career prospects.

I'm unsure of whether to accept it or not. One one hand, I don't want this opportunity to be wasted. I don't want to regret not taking this experience. On the other hand, I feel pretty certain that I don't want to continue uni at this stage of my life, and just go into beauty therapy. I don't know if I want to continue studying for something I'm not certain I will properly commit to, and the scholarship might be better off going to somebody else who knows they want to pursue this. Uni has me really burnt out. I'm just wondering what people's thoughts are and if anyone has any advice. Thanks!",03May2019,1

317,"I've had 4 jobs in my life dealing with restaurant or customer service. My first job I left for a better career opportunity and then the second job I had I got reprimanded due to a lot of no call no shows but that was due to a lot of life issues so bad timing. I got rehired at that second job and once I did I was around 17. I think after taking some time to go through self growth for a year without work I came back and started noticing how cliquey everyone was and how rude team members would be towards me because I wasn't like them or I wouldn't bother to conform to their likes because I liked my stuff and they liked theirs. So eventually I found another job. Once I put in my two weeks my boss at that job was shitting on my for leaving saying I didn't wanna be like them. I'm glad I left that job because they closed down months later. Even when I told others how I felt like I was being treated differently they would turn their backs on me and tell the manager and start saying I was being stupid or what not even though it was clear there was too much favoritism and cliquey behavior and drama that it felt like high school. (Which was the reason why I became homeschooled because I didn't want to have to deal with things like that) I ended up going for the new job and I was excited since there wasn't much hard labor but I realized It made me feel a lot fatter and the people I were hanging around were the kinds of people I dreaded in high school and they were a bunch of high school to college freshman doing the job but they were all their own clique as well. I was a newbie and newbies had the audacity to tell me what to do just because they were being favorited. All I do is do my job and be told what to do and I don't want to cause trouble at all. I was quiet at that job and kept to myself but even when I was quiet someone always had something to say. I never understood it. So eventually I left that job and I have a new one now and I just realized that i basically signed up for the same thing with this new job. Cliqueyness and unprofessionalism. What I do as well requires barely anything which is fine but I get very bored easily so now I'm not only bored of my job but I dislike the work environment as well. I've gotten mocked and such for just trying to do the right thing or try being a team leader for all of the new recruits such as myself. I know I shouldn't care or let it get to me but I strive for so much more than having to work in environments like these.

Any suggestions on work places where I wouldn't have to deal with this too much? At least at a lesser extent? I'm currently looking for a new job again. I also apologize for the long post. I've been told to report to the manager about some of this stuff but I don't want to cause trouble as there is already too much drama roaming around the work place with the originals there.",03May2019,3

I am wary of telling upper management; if it got back to him that I reported that, he would know exactly which employee told me he said it. I don’t want to start this new position off in a heap of drama. We is also really well liked by upper management. 25% of his position is spent working right under the director, so I imagine he would never ever be reprimanded. We have only ever fired one person, and it was because she showed up high as a kite not once, not twice, but three times. And if anyone is going to get away with insubordination, it would be him. 

He also refuses to do specific job duties (trying to be vague for privacy). He has decided he doesn’t like them and so he won’t do them. That would be alright if he did other duties in its place, but he doesn’t. He disappears for 10-15 minutes at a time. Sometimes he disappears with another coworker, sometimes alone. It’s always to get coffee or something, but that’s not far from our offices.

I don’t want to start off on the wrong foot with him. I don’t have the option of writing up or suspending (that’s upper management, which again, wouldn’t do either of those things). I’m concerned about starting my first management job with an employee who is already dedicated to making my life hell.

I graduated highschool last year (I should clarify, schoolyears end in november where I live) and after that I had this plan of going to study in Germany, because at this particular school you graduate with the Abitur, which is valid for german universities, unlike the traditional title of highschool in my country. I had som clue of what to study, it was teaching. But I was never convinced and later on became less sure. One particular reason is going away for 5 years and leaving my friends and the most special girl in my life behind and not knowing if I'll be able to reconnect with them when I'm back. 

But there's more things that worry me, like not being as capable as I thought. I just can't find the motivation to even start applying to unis there. Right now I'm still living with my parents and have a job as a tour guide but I really don't want to stay this way, my brother is almost 21 and hasn't even finished his first year in university here because he's been a real fuck up, just like my sister was before him, I don't want to end up a leech.

So I'm looking for alternatives, I don't want to stay and study here even though it would be easier than any other option because if that's what I go for then I should already have been studying any carreer for 4 months, or at least that's how my parents will see it.

I don't know if anyone who reads this has gone through something this specific but anything helps

I've been considering getting a better paying job so I can sustain myself and do that until I know what I want to do but with my experience, which is virtually none, other than highschool and speaking german and spanish, I don't think I can convince my parents to let me do that, plus I don't know if a university wil still accept me so much longer after highschool.",03May2019,1
327,"So basically i spent most of my formative years growing up in NYC, a place where i didnt have to drive at all and it was easy to get around. On top of that driving always kind of terrified me.

Now at 28 i still dont have a license. Im getting married in august and im on the brink of getting a fairly large promotion at work.

The issue has arisen where not having a license and a car might put a damper on the likelihood of me getting the promotion. Its at the same place i work, about 15 minutes from my house, but the hours make it a little harder to get in. I was carpooling with a co worker (whos leaving and whos job i will possibly be obtaining) so im kind of in a crunch period here. 

I have been slowly taking lessons with a friend, and have gotten a bit more comfortable with driving, but im nervous i wont be able to get it in time.

The advice im looking for is basically what can i do to get more comfortable with driving? Im going to try to just get more hours in but is that all i can do?

328,"So the last few month has been a great time at my new job. I met lots of good people and we have a great bond.

Now there is that girl in my office who happens to be my co-worker. Although I wasn't attracted to her first, things have really changed in the last couple of months, mainly because of her.

I noticed she began to want me to be around more while working. Also every time we talked, or where sitting in a meeting she continued to touch me as if by chance, though it felt to me that she had done it deliberately.

Last week I had launch with her and another co-worker, and she said to her that maybe we can match (me and the other co-worker).
But then she said right away that she believes it may be not a good idea to date your close co-workers. 

That got me a bit confused.

329,"I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years now. We moved in together a year ago because my ex my son's father kept harassing us. To the point where I had to file a restraining order on him.  Anyways he purchased a home and we moved in together.  At the time I was working overnight because I didn't have anyone to help me with my 6 year old duringthe day if I worked days.  Before my boyfriend I had to beg my mother to watch him.  I literally had to fight for her to help.  

So now about 2 months ago I moved out with my son because my bf and I have been constantly fighting.  He's always breaking up with me and kicking me. After I had just gotten a new job working days making less while he helped me with my son. 

Now I moved out and I can't seem to find anywhere that works around my son's schedule. I can't afford my rent this month and I need the extra income.

330,"I have been underweight as far as I can remember. Not necessarily that I wanted to, but to describe myself: 

1. I am a picky either. My horizon isn't so broad in terms of foods that I actually like. Sounds childish, but I have tried many different foods many times and I just can't stomache to eat some of them. I do stil like some vegetables, chicken, rice, etc. It is not like I only prefere hamburgers and fries.

2. I do not have a big appetite. I get satisfied/full on a decent rate and can stay like that for a couple of hours. I tried to get myself into the habbit of eating every 2 hours/a lot of snacking to increase it, but with no success so far. If I over-stuff myself I get nauseated and even a possibility to barf. I never really checked my caloric intake per-day, but I do not have to to already say I  never really reach my goal (even with my unhealthy snacking of chips and what not).

I do not gain weight, of course, but neither do I lose weight. I have reached a certain treshhold that I never got over. Currently I weigh 68 KGs, compared to my tallness: 1m 93cm.

&amp;#x200B;

So as spring classes come to an end all the people around my college campus are rushing to sublease their apartments so that they can go home xyz etc etc... 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I prematurely had a verbal agreement with my friend who has already moved out of his apartment (he moved out because of his family or whatnot) that I'm down to sublease his single room from him after the lease at my place ends - may 7th 

&amp;#x200B;

however, he is expecting me to pay the rent for all of may before i even move in PLUS (even though I told him I'm not moving in til like may 7th, he's already asking me for rent) I just did some research in the FB group for my school and found that I could find a single room for around $500 when his place is $900

&amp;#x200B;

what should I do reddit? should i just renege on the deal? or should i try to renegotiate? what is the right thing to do? because I honestly feel like he should be more fair about the price but I don't know how to bring it up because honestly I could just find a new place for $400 cheaper but since I'm his friend I don't really know how to approach this.

tldr; told friend i would take his lease for a single room for $900, he is a bit pushy, a little too pushy, i can find a place of similar value for $500, don't want to be a bad friend but also don't want to overspend, what do",03May2019,1

336,"Hey guys, first of all: thanks for clicking this post. Although my problem may sound a bit silly, I’ve been stressing hard about this and could really use some advice. 

I have been playing sports for pretty much whole my life (currently 25 year old) at our local sports club. I play korfbal, which is a team sport similar to basketball I guess? Anyways, things are not going well there for a couple of seasons now. We are tight on players, and some of our most talentful youthful players are leaving after a conflict with the board. This season we relegated as well (both our second and first team). We practice twice in a week and play on saturdays, but most of the players are not motivated anymore, which makes practice horrible pretty much everytime. Its clear that I haven’t had fun in a while, and that this is causing me stress even more than I have with university and work. Which is ridiculous.

The thing is, I feel obligated to stay. If I leave, the club will be even more in trouble. Plus I know these guys since I was young, and they are part of my social life, so I am afraid what they are going to think and say. Furthermore, I have had a conversation with our few coach for next season and he wants me to be captain of the first squad. Although I’m a vocal, team-orientated guy, im not even close to being the best player of the squad. As of now, I dont even play in the first squad under our current coach. Im afraid that ppl won’t accept me as captain, and that I can’t handle the pressure.

I want to leave, but I feel stuck. Any advice?

TL;DR: Playing at my local sports club for pretty much my entire life. Players are part of my social life. But things are not going well for us, and I am not enjoying myself. I want to quit, but I feel stuck and pressured to stay.",03May2019,1

The whole bed shakes a bit when he does this and it wakes me up somewhere around 40 times a night. Even when we had the mattress on the floor in an attempt to stop the bed shaking, it still woke me up. Recently we've had to sleep separately so that I don't lose my mind, and he is making a doctor's appointment so I'm not looking for medical advice. 

What I'm looking for is advice on whether or not anyone has dealt with this issue and if you've found a good mattress/topper that stops you from feeling the movement of the person sleeping next to you? These things can be 500-1,000 US dollars so I don't want to just jump in and buy one without advice. 

It isn't sustainable (not going to split up over this, I just know its causing us stress) for us to sleep separately every night, and from my research it doesn't look like there's much of a cure for what he has so I'll need to think of other ways to get us sleeping in the same bed again.

Also, I can't rely on my parents to assist me with this as they both only barely make ends meet at the moment.

While booking this trip, I made sure to search for the cheapest flights, accommodation, etc. possible so that I would be able to afford it without going into crippling debt before I can even work a full time job. However, these 'friends' have just told me that they have booked and prepaid for different (and far more expensive) options, for which they're using 'daddy's credit card' and expect me to pay up my portion of the down-payment. They booked all of this without telling me beforehand.

Although our planned time to leave is quite far away, I don't think I could pay the debt off to my friends before then, even with an extremely strict budget.

348,"Last night, I went to hang out with 2 good friends of mine who are in a relationship with each other for a while now. Bit of a Marshall-Lily-Ted situation where I am a female Ted. We even applied for an appartment for the three of us to rent together. We had a great time, 'ate a couple of sandwiches', and then I missed the last bus, forcing me to stay till the morning. I felt a bit weird sleeping with a couple in their bed, and it just got more awkward when he stripped almost entirely naked and asked me whether I wasn't gonna take anything off. I told him I'd rather keep my clothes on. His girlfriend was almost asleep at this point by the way, laying at the far end of the bed. After a few minutes I felt this tingling sensation across my upper leg, but didn't think much of it as we had eaten some 'sandwiches', so I figured it were just my senses still screwing with  me. After a few moments however, I realized it was his hand going up and down, now moving towards the inside of my legs, and I startled and just kept staring ahead of me with my eyes wide open. This made him pull away and I just kept my back turned towards them untill morning.

You have to understand however, that they are an amazing couple. It's crazy how much they seem to love each other, which is why I am having a lot of trouble accepting that this actually happened. I hope that maybe he thought I was his girlfriend for some reason, but then he should have said something, right? I love both my friends a lot, and I don't want either of them to get hurt. Part of me wants to ask him about what happened, but I don't know whether I even want to know the answer.

Lazy started as a server the same time I started as a manager, we almost feel like co-workers. I was getting to know the ropes of the business and the people so she witnessed my fair share of trials and tribulations. Let's just say she got away with alot of shit because I was still in training. Awhile ago when we worked an event, she complained to one of the owners that I was being ""too demanding."" I talked to the owners, whom I'm pretty close with, and they backed me up. They know I'm a very hard worker. She doesn't know that I know what she said. So I backed off but kept a close eye on her.

Trying to get Lazy to do anything is like pulling teeth. I've done everything I can ; leading by example, asking nicely, being assertive... nothing seems to work. If I tell her to do something, she moves at a glacier's pace. If she sees my clean her table, she stands there and watches me. She is constantly on her phone or snacking in the back, I've got a whole laundry list!

Once I was written up because I was sick and called and said I will be an hour late and that I needed to take something. Another time I was written up for calling out because a family member was dying and then I called out for the funeral. I was not told at those times that I would be written up. I was shown the write ups weeks later. Anyways now I have a new problem there. I was being harassed by this man on and off for about a decade now. He physically sexually assaulted me when I was about 21 and finally now the law enforcement decided to tell him he has to leave me alone. The judge told me that he has to stay away from my work and he is banned when I am there. I go to my job and tell them this and they said he can come in if he wants because they're not banning him. They said if I want him gone I need to fill out corporate paperwork and get all of the information from the courts and send that. Then corporate makes the decision on his banishment. 

Then on top of this recently we receive a prize from corporate for doing a good job as a store and got commemorative hats. The management placed all of the hats in the break room with our name tags and some Easter candy. Well when I get to work that weekend I see some hats and candy in the break room and I asked where mine was.

354,"I'm in the process of moving far away from where I am right now, too far to bring any furniture, big appliances and general small spacious items (I'm moving by airplane, so that gives you an idea of what I can take with me). 

It just so happens that a longtime, very close friend of mine is moving into a new apartment from their college dorm, and has basically nothing. So i figured it would be great to give them a lot of my furniture, appliances, cleaning supplies, food, etc. Basically anything that I can't take with me but would be great use for them. 

In the past few days, I've given them tons of stuff already and have been making plans to give even more. In total, I'm going to be giving them hundreds of dollars worth of things, almost a thousand. But, I'm feeling totally under appreciated for it and haven't even heard a single ""thanks"" for any of it. 

Don't get me wrong. I know that I'm OFFERING my stuff for free. But it would be nice to not only feel like my generosity is appreciated, but also to feel like there is a mutual effort to get my shit to their new place. I've had to buy my own ubers to transport some stuff, which is fine because end goal is to just get rid of it all, but I'm just thinking, maybe they should be the one to come pick this stuff up? Not to mention the fact that I worked hard to buy all this stuff for myself and now I'm just giving it all to them (Yes, it is mostly Ikea and Walmart stuff, but it still adds up.)

Also, so far there has never been any offer for compensating me on their part. I know I'm not asking for anything, but the gesture would mean a lot and shows me that they actual care about the fact that I'm basically furnishing their apartment with for free. 

I don't know where I'm going with this, but I'm wondering what you would do in this position. We've been best friends for years and I honestly feel a bit walked on right now. I called them last night asking if they could come pick up the microwave, storage bins, and school supplies I offered, and they were just kind of like ""yeah, sure, whatever"" about getting all this free stuff (which, might I add, is GOOD condition/Newish free stuff. I moved into this apartment 8 months ago and purchased all new appliances.)

Anyways. Are my feelings rational? Is it okay to feel like my generosity is maybe being taken for granted? Should I say anything? Or should I just drop the stuff off and move on? I'm feeling like I would be more satisfied if I had just donated it all to charity, knowing it went to someone who would have needed it more, but it's too late and I just feel shitty about it all.",03May2019,1

Im a 19 year old guy who is going to have his last days in secondary school next week and graduate.

There is one unversity where they dont care about your study performance therefore their enterance examination starts way before the others.
I got an email from them 2 weeks ago about what will the examination look like and what kind of things ill need to send them.

Everything is looking good half of my portfolio is ready and i have one month to finish the other half but they want a motivational letter.

And i dont have a clue what should i write in that letter, my lack of social skills aint helping me either.

So could u guys give me some help about this? I never wrote a motivational letter in my life.

They pointed one thing out and that is i should write in the letter about my portfolio and my coursework.

Shall i write about my past? That i liked drawing since i was a child? My family and the lack of support i received? My past achievements in competitions and my past/upcoming exhibitions?

And more importantly how could i give a solid answer to the question “why did u apply for our uni?” When my only reason is because they dont give a f about what grades ill get on my graduation tests :/",03May2019,1

He said that I already knew how he had felt with her and that I should do whatever I want but it won’t be the same. Obviously I don’t want to lose someone that’s like a brother to me and I want to be respectful but I reallyyy like this girl and I haven’t liked a girl like this in a long time and I don’t want to lose the opportunity since I’m so close to asking her out somewhere or telling her how I feel. Any advice would help please and thank you....",03May2019,1
366,"Backstory: about a month ago, my biology teacher divided the class into two teams: the girls team and the boys team. I was the boys team's captain.
The two teams would have to compete with one another to see which can give a better presentation about a topic the teacher selected. 

The night before the presentations, I thought it'd be a good idea to diss the girls in order to instill some motivation in the boys.
I sent a text to the boys-only group, reminding the boys that our performance will be compared to the girls and graded accordingly.
I told them not to worry however, because those dumb bitches can't even pronounce the words in the textbook, let alone explain a topic to us.  
""I have no doubt we'll come out on top,"" I told them.
The shit I said to that group sounds a lot worse in my language, I promise you. 

The girls found out that I called them illiterate bitches.

The next morning, those girls made sure I knew that they knew about what I said. They stared at me the entire hour before class began, and they 'whispered' insults every time I walked past their tables. 
It was then I realized I fucked up.

When class began, the presentations began. The girls first. Then the boys.
After each presentation was a Q&amp;A session. None of the boys asked a question when it was the girls' session. But when it was the girls' turn to ask, they didn't hold back. They bombarded us with question after question, pretending not to understand the topic when they themselves have literally just given a presentation about the exact same topic. 
When we answered all their questions correctly, they tried a different approach: straight up spitting insults at us. We spit back. Shit was about to get real when the teacher finally caught on and ended the roast battle.

She took a moment to grade our presentations, then she announced the scores.

 All the shit I talked in the group... those girls ended up getting a 95/100 and the boys a 94/100.

The girls celebrated like they'd just won a million dollars, high fiving each other and laughing and sneaking in a few insults about me and clapping.

When they'd finished celebrating, I used the split second silence to loudly say that ""I accept my defeat and I am sorry.""

""No one cares,"" one of them immediately said back to me.

---

Welp, there goes my friendship with them. 
I said the shit I said to the group with intention of motivating my teammates, not to be taken as actual insults. I had nothing against them.

I apologized, albeit a half-ass apology, because of this. I expected them to remind themselves that I had apologized, and I expected them to just pretend I didn't exist and move on.

I guess that wasn't a reasonable expectation.

They never quit with the whispers,
and every time a teacher tasked one of them to hand out some lesson papers or books, they made sure to hand it out to everyone normally and politely-- everyone except me, of course. 
My lesson papers, my homework books, my quiz papers, all magically turn into frisbees when in their hands.
Sometimes they would throw my book at me from half a meter away, other times they would drop my books on my table as loud as possible.

All of us being southeast asians, those girls knew that it would piss me off. And I was pissed off,
but I reminded myself that I caused this. So I chose to exercise the Buddha's teachings. I chose to forgive. I told myself that at least she transported my book from the teacher's desk to mine, so she was doing me a favour.

But yesterday it was different.
One of the girls (intentionally or unintentionally) threw my notebook in a way that it landed on the edge of the table, then fall to the ground. 
That's a new level of disrespect.
Again, I pretended nothing happened. I thought that if I'd let this slide, maybe she'd go tell her friends to move on, maybe she'd tell her friends that the shit I said I didn't really mean. 

I was wrong. My forgiveness was mistaken for weakness.

When I asked the math teacher a pretty dumb question today the same girl who dropped my book to the ground asked loudly her group friends, ""I pity him. He's born with a brain but can't think.""
None of her friends responded. Maybe they realize that she's fighting a one-sided battle, maybe they were occupied with the classwork.

Tell me, reading Redditor, should I quit forgiving and stand up for myself? An eye for an eye?
Should I apologize once more?
Should I ignore and wait six weeks until the semester is over? 

What should I do? What would you do?",03May2019,0
367,"I was recently diagnosed with NPD and I am trying to read up on it but most books, articles, subreddits or whatever there is either cater to people negatively affected by narcissists — often villainizing them — or are not written for laypeople, e.g. textbooks or medical journals.

371,"TRIGGER WARNING. 
Sexual assault. 

About two years ago. I was seeing this guy. It was my first real out of high school kind of relationship. 


Everything was great as you would expect he respected boundaries and he was patient with me at the start despite the fact that I have ADHD at the start he saw me beyond that. 

About three months into the relationship 
we were having some issues getting it up but nothing a bit of low dose of viagra can’t fix. 

The night before his penis had swelled up to the size of a ballon as a side effect of taking viagra, it was painful to look at. I told him no sex until the swelling goes down I didn’t want to further risk causing damage. 

It was our first Octoberfest together we spent the day among friends drinking in the sun eating pretzels and just really basking in the wonderful vibes of German culture. 

Our drunk train ride home he asked me so I am I getting lucky tonight. I told him it’s not happening and you know why. 😔 
We came home latter that night of course we were intoxicated to the point where I could hardly stand up stumbling around and what not, we playing around being dumb on the bed but nothing frisky I still had my wits about me despite the fact that I was so heavily intoxicated after being asked four times on the train ride home I knew sex with off the cards. 

This is the part where it gets hard for me to type. “Deep breathe” 

I’ve never spoken to anybody about this before nor have I ever typed it out on an iPhone note without having to stop and backspace it out. 😔

We started to make out a little but by then I was tired. He asked me baby can I go down on you?
I said no babe I’m tired and I want to go to bed. He kept saying please baby? I said no I’m sleeping. Please just let me go down there, again with the no. Baby open your legs at that point he pulled my knees apart and pulled my underwear to the side. Again I’m still saying no. He stats going down on me I’m telling him no by then my voice was shaking there was absolutely no feeling coming down there it was a fear I’ve never felt before I wasn’t wet I wasn’t relaxed it hurt I wasn’t at all enjoying it fear ran through my body my instincts kick in what if he tries to put it in I’m drunk but I’m again still saying no I grabbed him by he shoulders and I pushed him away and I gove him a no but it was louder this time. 

I backed myself into the corner and I just looked at him with a fear in my eyes.
He asked me did you think I was going to rape you? I said I just want to go to bed babe. He give me a Fine whatever fuck you. And turned off the light, we spoke a little bit in bed after he calmed down. But we never spoke about it, it was never brought up in the relationship in the almost two years we were together. It always sat at the back of my mind but of course with so much happening in life we just continued on the relationship. Until last year. 

I’m not sure if it was sexual assault, I’ve come to the realisation that the last 3 times I’ve been drunk I’ve cried myself to sleep over it. I only ever cry about it when I’m drunk tho? Is that normal with this sort of thing. I don’t want this to keep happening and I’m scared I’ll get drunk and dwell on it again and I’ll tell somebody under the influence. Could alcohol be bringing up something from my past that I have not dealt with yet.",03May2019,3
373,So I am a part of a committee that is using a survey to see what is wrong with our department. In short we have a lot of turn over with tenured people leaving. So a coworker ( let's call him jack) went to upper level management to start the committee to get employee feedback on what is going wrong. I was brought in to handle the online survey and some of the responses specifically calling out jack for doing unethical things to get ahead. We work with clients and surveys are what we live or die by so a good review can be a big booster and a bad one can hurt us a lot. So according to a response they say jack is using a remote support tool to help clients fill out the survey by looking through their junk folder or explaining in detail how the survey effects him. Should I address this directly with jack or just kinda let him read it himself and let other committee members eventually read it as well. Jack is a nice guy but a little overly competitive.

374,"TL;DR - 

- Seizable amount of friends going to travel through Europe in July. Can’t go to all locations as they but would meet up in Amsterdam. 

- Person I’m interested in is staying. Says we should hang out. 


So my situation is as follows: 

I live in Portugal. Virtually all my old highschool classmates are going to travel through Europe in July. Most are going to some iconic places, including Amsterdam. I’d be staying there for 1-2 weeks if I went, able to meet and hang out with my friends, many of which I might (and probably will) never see again because I’m moving to the US shortly afterwards. 

This person I’m interested in told me she’d be in my hometown during that time period, unspecified what days as of now. She lives in a nearby town so we see each other seldom. Last time we met, however, she cold-shouldered me and we broke contact for a while until I reached out. We reconnected and she expressed interest in seeing me as well as her friends while she spends time here. She’s moving to the US close to next year. 


My conflict lies in:

- She rebuffed me once, but apologised and seems to be happy we reconnected. 

- I may never have an opportunity like this to see my friends together again. I was explicitly asked to go see them, which makes me feel extremely valued. 

Should I stay or should I go? Is the chance of seeing the person I’m interested in more worth than a wild stay in Ams? I’ve always pursued love interests with passion, but this time I feel like missing out on either option would make me regret it. Which one should I prioritise, in your opinions?",03May2019,2

I do not mess around at my job and work really hard but I just feel like it gets me nowhere. 

I have tried to stop being lazy and work on myself but every time I try to teach myself new stuff I just lose interest so quickly.

379,"In case this is triggering to someone, I want to clarify that ""disgusting remarks"" means sexual/crude comments or questions.

A few months ago, I had met this guy through a friend of mine, we can call him Mike for the sake of making my life easier.

Mike seemed cool, we talked for a few days and he was overall a funny guy (talked about video games and music I liked). I eventually gave him my discord so we could talk outside of our 30 minute lunch in school.

It just so happened that the night I gave him my account I was busy, so I couldn't respond to his messages fast. It ended up with me coming home to ""I love you"" messages and spammed heart emojis. I blocked him after that and didn't see him again for a while.

Just yesterday at lunch I came to see he was sitting with my usual crowd (of like 2 people) so I was kind of uncomfortable as is. After a bit he spoke to me, which was casual, so I loosened up.

It didn't take long, but Mike turned our conversation into one about sex and relationships. He proceeded to say things like ""Take my virginity"" and BEGGED for me to, asked me to take up his ""14 day free trial"" of a relationship, asked me about my masturbation habits, kept saying there was ""another guy"" and tried to guilt trip me by saying that I wanted to be with that guy instead of him (there's no one else), and a bunch of other things. He even tried to take my phone from me when I was using it as a crutch to keep my panicking to a minimum, which was completely uncalled for.

The point I'm trying to make is seeing as these are verbal comments and the part of the cafeteria we sit in isn't covered by the security cameras (at least to my knowledge, not one is pointing towards it) I don't know what to do. I've went to staff about crude comments and things before but they weren't able to do anything other than in school suspension gor a day or two as there was ""no definitive proof.""

It started with me laying on my bed doing something on my laptop (weird dream,  makes no sense stuff) I could hear my mom arguing with my step dad, It's strange because they usually don't, they really love each other. It got louder and louder before I heard my mom scream and yell that Sam is going to kill you when she sees this. (I'm weak, but in my mind, if you hurt my mom I'm going to kill you) I look out my window,  we're they were arguing and I saw a massive bruise on my moms face and my step dad strangling her,  it was so real. My mom told me to ring 911. He killed her and dragged her to the boot of the car.

391,"My friend has done a *lot* to help me out. We've recently been butting heads a lot more, but he's definitely a good guy and I really value that friendship.

When him and his wife were looking to buy a new house, they asked me to move in with them, because it was the only way to make it work. I agreed to $1000/month, which is definitely more than the going rate, but A) it was helping them out, and B) his wife agreed to include me when she cooked meals for them. Also, all utilities are included in that.

Well, in living there almost a year, she's cooked maybe five meals I was included in. I've not been keeping track, but I can say with absolute certainly I've bought *them* way more dinners (if I'm ordering out for myself, I just always ask if anyone else wants anything; not a big deal).

Now, they're looking to rent out another room to her sister, probably 3-6 months until she gets on her feet. Aside from some *slight* awkardness, I don't have any issue there.

I've been going over my own finances, though, and I *REALLY* need to start socking some money back. I didn't even fully realize just *how* bad my string of luck this past year has been, as I've had one major expense after the other. I *should* be saving roughly $800 a month (that's after my own expenses), but I'm currently sitting with less than that in the bank right now (and a $240 ticket waiting to be paid).

So...

I'm thinking about approaching them, and trying to say I think $800 would be a fair agreement for rent (down from $1000).

If I was able to put $12,000 into savings (or *potentially* my 401k, as my company for a 50% match uncapped), that would be *huge* towards building my future. And $800/month with utilities included is pretty much the going-rate for a really nice bedroom.

But, obviously, there's the worry of if this is going to feel like be putting the screws to them? And I'll say, they *have* been pretty good about being flexible with me (for example, when I had some major car repairs recently, I was able to pay them later in the month, and he let me use his car to get to work while they were on vacation). So maybe that extra $200 is worth just having that added leniency? It's not like I'm *desperate*.

Just to provide a bit of context, I don't think his wife really likes me that much. Also, my toilet has been broken pretty much since we moved in (it seems to just ""clog"" sometimes, even if you literally flush it with only water). We've kind of just been in  a mexican-standoff about the think, because I think it's *their* responsibility to deal with it (barring some sort of proof it *was* something to do with me, which seems unlikely), whereas they're convinced I must have done something to it and it's my responsibility. So we basically just stopped talking about it, and I started using the bathroom down the hall (my shower and sink work perfectly fine, fortunately).

I dunno. What do you guys think? Is it worth approaching them, and if so, what would the best way to do that?",03May2019,7

In 2012 ( I was about 10 ) and my older brother died and he was the closest family member to me. When he died my family went through a hard time. Then later the same year another death happened. My older brother ( one that’s still alive ) father died from sickness and he was basically like my dad ( my actual father is in prison ). When he died the financial situation was a lot worse, we had to move out of our house and my mom struggled. We can jump farther in time to when I’m older in middle school during 7th grade. During 7th grade one of my older brothers died and I didn’t know how to respond but I still went to school.

396,"To keep it short my (25m) girlfriend (21f) has an issue with a close female friend of mine, (Lilith we’ll say). Lillith called my girlfriend my exes name. Said ex, she actually was our friend beforehand, everything ended well and mutually about two years ago so we’ll all still hang out as a group, rarely. So Lilith is off to Vegas for her birthday and said ex will be there along with about 8 others. I was invited but told not to bring gf in fear of drama between the two girls. I told gf and she no longer wants to go so I declined going as well. Then lillith says later on to come down it won’t be an issue no one cares. 
I would only be able to go for about half a day, the afternoon until 7am the next day

Question is, should I go with gf and risk someone’s inner pettiness coming out and starting issues? Should I just stay home with gf? Is the trip even worth it if it’ll only be for half a day?

TL;DR.  Gf and friend have issues. Should we bother even going on short trip with her.",03May2019,2
397,"I’ve posted this before but I updated it with more details 

It’s really long but here is it all summed up
All of this was over a 2 month period 

Sorry for the wall of text
——————————————————————————
So me and this girl are fairly good friends. I really like her but I don’t know if she does as well. She has told me “I literally love you” and also called me a full course meal and a snack on separate occasions. She stares at me sometimes during school and we are BFFs on Snapchat. We talk on FT a lot as well. She will never talk about boys around me either. She will smile and blush and send me kissy faces too. She also has social anxiety. She laughs at everything I say. Half the time she will send a ton of selfies but the other half she will send pictures of random stuff on Snapchat, I don’t know if it has to do with her makeup being on or not. She keeps reminding me that she is single. She sent me a picture of her in her bra.
——————————————————————————
However a couple weeks ago she tried to set me up with her friend. I don’t know why she would do that, I don’t know if she is serious or if it’s a test. After I refused she questioned me about if I like anyone but I didn’t answer. I felt like she was trying to get answers from me. She is also shy or something and doesn’t talk to me in person but will snap me during school. She will talk about other boys that are obsessed with her but she doesn’t like, but has not complained about me
——————————————————————————
So after presuming the set up thing was a test which I think it was, I tried asking her to go to the zoo with me. She asked me if I had a ride and I said I didn’t. Then she said maybe but we didn’t go. Fast forward two weeks and I asked her if she wanted to go bowling. She said she it depended on if she had to go to her workout or not She said she would keep me updated but the next day she fell ill and had to go to the ER. She didn’t update me.
——————————————————————————
And recently I kind of stopped showing interest. IE not glancing over at her during school or approaching her during track meets. I am not sure if this is why I am being left on opened lately or not but she definitely hasn’t been talking as much. I mean I usually leave all my other friends on open but not her so maybe I’m overthinking it. We aren’t besties on Snapchat anymore and are now just BFs. However a few days ago her eyes were all over me during track. Also at the track meet I saw her talking to one of her friends while they were looking at me.  Friday she took a double take to look at me and  we started snapping more but she didn’t show her face for some reason. Is she insecure? Also recently she has been glancing at me but doing it in secret so I won’t know. At track she was walking away and I had my back turned to her but I saw her look over at me. We’re both shy around each other. But she is very social with her girlfriends but not with me.
——————————————————————————
by the way she has social anxiety (or at least claims to)

What should I do? Does she like me? What’s with her sudden change in attitude.

I’m planning on asking her out soon

TLDR: She was super flirty but now is acting strange. She said she loves me but is really confusing me. I am getting unclear answers and mixed signals.

400,"I am a 3rd year cs student. Around 2.5 years worth of credits cause of failed classes. I , uh...really don't know if CS is for me and often times have an existential crisis thinking about how I'm supposed to ""make something out of nothing"" in the future if I were to stick this one out. I can finish most of my programming projects but usually need a decent amount of guidance and find many of the classes im taking uninteresting and really do not enjoy any cs classes. I still need to think, but I feel like I would not be fit as a developer.

 I was thinking about 3 things to change to:


1. I work at a, uh, well known amusement park and they have apprenticeship programs for their maintenance program for working on the rides and I hear after working for a few years they make ~40 an hour and they're usually inside working on the rides aside from outside. Also it's all paid for by the company


2. Trade school. My dad is an electrican and would probably not be happy if I were to do that because his favorite phrase is ""I bust my ass all day blah blah"" about that and probably wouldnt want me doing exactly what he does. He makes good money though, ~45 an hour and ~1500 a week with saturday overtime pay.

3. Dental Hygienist. There are few shcools in most only require 2.5 or 3.0 gpa in the pre-requisites, which I haven't taken because they're biology, chemistry, anatomy, etc. So I could leave my uni, go to the 2 year cc, take the pre-reqs and then apply there. From what I see, in my area( SoCal) They make pretty good money ~70-80k and I wouldn't have to worry about ""making something out of nothing"" as the tasks are procedural I assume. Also, one of my best friends sisters is a dental hygienist and I could maybe get some connections through her.


Am I being dumb for wanting to throw away an opportunity to obtain one of the brightest outlook majors like CS?

401,"So I was asked to be the best man in my buddies wedding! Which is awesome we grew up together  and visited eachother in college. Post college he ended up moving out of state as did I but the wedding is back in our home state. 

I work for the Forest Service and will be stationed in Idaho this summer. His wedding is on a Saturday I have mandatory training all that week 7am-5pm so I could fly out Saturday AM the only flight that allows me to have enough time to get my tux and ""clean up"" in time for photos is $700, tux rental ~$300.  

But putting $ issue aside I'm one delay or equipment issue with the airline away from missing the photos and the wedding it's self. So it could be all for nothing. 

I've warned him a month ago that while I'm flattered to be chosen logistically I might not be the best pick (at the time I warned him I did not know my training schedule and thus couldn't commit to airfare) he kinda brushed it off as I'm sure he has numerous other things on his mind.

1k wouldn't put me in the red but it would take a nice chunk out of my savings, especially if I get delayed it would be tough not to be salty at the situation.

405,"So a few months ago word started spreading around school that someone had found the new wifi password, this was at the time no suprise to anyone, as this happens frequently. What few people know is that these so-called ""wifi passwords"" are actually users on the system who are simply registered to double as wifi authetication (username and password can be used to log onto the wifi). So it came to me as a shocker when this photo started spreading of what seems to be the authetication being accessed from Active Directory (if not directly then locally from files generated by AD). I immediently that evening sat down to write an email to the school district agency about this, and how I was worried there might be a security flaw in the system.

Sure enough, I got a message the following day from my School's IT manager wanting to see me as soon as possible. This happened to be on a Friday, I went up to his office but he wasn't there, and I had some important stuff to do after school, so I had to wait after the weekend. I spent that weekend researching weaknesses in the AD architecture and combining it with exploits I already knew in Windows, eventually discovering an exploit which could pontentially give someone access to domain admin users (and whoever else who happen to have logged on to your computer) who's authentication had been stored locally in LSA.

The following Monday I rushed up to the IT guy's office in the break, and explained to him the exploit. He wrote it down on a note and thanked me as well as telling me he'd look into it and keep me updated, two hours later the IT advisor in the school district agency sent me a mail thanking me as well.

Well, fast forward to today, I have yet to hear another word about it, I haven't checked if the hole is still there, though we did get a mandatory policy update just a few weeks ago, not sure if it's even related to my findings, my brother advices me I contact the media about it, but I'm unsure, I just feel really stressed out about the whole situation, and I have the feeling this will blow up in a shitstorm of a controversy if I say anything. Which bring me here, what in the world should I do? My guts tell me to contact the media, but I'm really anxious and can't bring myself to do it.

TL;DR

I reported an exploit to the school district agency a few months ago and have yet to get a reply. My brother thinks I should contact the media about it, by I'm nervous and don't know what to do.

413,"3 years ago, during my last year of university, I screwed up big time. I was struggling during a final and I knew about a group of kids that used to store exam answers in a specific toilet stall near the classroom where the final was taking place. I was panicked and not thinking straight so I decided to cheat for the first time ever. Just my luck I ended up getting caught and was expelled from the university along with 6 other students. 

I was devastated and didn’t tell any of my family. Prior to my last year of university I had done an internship at a massive company and had done quite well during my time there so they called me and offered me a job, two days after I had been expelled. I had no idea what to do, they were under the impression that I had completed my degree when I technically hadn’t. Heres my first mistake and I know that it was selfish, but I took the job. I essentially had no other future and fun fact, once you’ve been expelled from a university for cheating. Not a single university will even take a chance on you and admit you. My plan was to take the job, work my butt off and either find a way to get back into university with a lawyer or find a school in a different country (US) to take me and complete my degree. 

I kept working at this company, got amazing performance reviews and tried to resolve my degree situation in parallel. I finally was admitted to an online US degree program last year that was willing to take a chance on me and let me complete my degree there. They have a different structured program, so I am required to take 8,classes to get my full degree. Ive completed 2/8 classes and scheduled to complete the remainder by next year. 

Fast forward to this past week, and I’m offered a promotion at work. Except the HR processing my application realizes that they never did a background check when I was originally hired on and has asked me to do one now through HireRight.

HireRight confirms and verifies all your past education and work history. The problem is I still don’t have my degree...and HireRight will definitely find out. 

I honestly have no idea what to do. I know that coming clean is the best and most ethical solution. But coming clean would essentially ruin the careers of the amazing people that gave me the chance to work there and are giving me this promotion, and have supported me the last 3 years. 

Some of the ideas that have been floating through my head have been to hire a hacker to change the HireRight report, which is insane because I don’t even know how the heck someone would hire a hacker. Or paying off a HireRight employee to fake the results of my background check, which is also insane because I have no idea how I’d even do that. 

I know that I screwed up huge and this is entirely my fault. But my heart is completely broken, having all my coworkers and supporters find out what I did is causing me a level of anxiety that I’ve never experienced. I haven’t slept all week, I’ve cried uncontrollably, and barely ate. This will truly end my life and I have no idea what to do. I’ve received the top year end reviews every year and been looked at as one of the top employees in my field. I know that if I come clean it will be immediate grounds for dismissal and my entire reputation in the industry will be ruined. 

I honestly have no idea what to do. I know that the right thing to do is to come clean but I honestly don’t know if I’ll be able to deal with the shame of disappointing my leaders at work and my family.",03May2019,97

416,"I’ve been working at my current company for 3 years now and started right out of college. The first two and a half years were on a team that I adored doing challenging and rewarding work. Recently, as a result of a restructure, I was moved onto another team. The new role was a lateral move with no change in salary or title but it has significantly less challenging work and (in my opinion) fewer opportunities to advance. I love my colleagues on the new team though and this is the first time in my career that I’ve had peers my age. 

My manager and I have spoken about my career progression. Their advice is that I’ve done everything asked of me and more but that I just need to be patient and wait for career progression. Now, that sounds simple but I’ve been stuck at my current title level for 3 years. The expected experience for this level is 1-2 years, and I’m not the only one on this new team who is delayed in advancing. Im also the only remaining former intern at the company who has not yet been promoted past my level. I would’ve been considered for promotion this year if not for the forced team transition. Honestly I am frustrated, depressed, and at a tipping point in my ability to be patient. 

Another role similar to my current one but at the title level right above mine opened up recently on another team. I discussed my interest with my manager who was surprisingly offended (they constantly say that they want us to explore growth opportunities) and dismissive of my interest. 

So now my conflict is do I tough it out in my current role and deal with the frustrations of unclear responsibilities and administrative work in the hopes of a promotion next year OR do I risk offending my manager/colleagues and apply for a job (that I may not even get) that would be only somewhat more satisfying but likely comes with a title promotion and salary increase?

420,"I'm just trying to get some secondary opinions on this. Some things seem very indicative, but I could be wrong. He was raised in a baptist and Mormon household, with a very abuse father and very nurturing but kind mother. Continues to go to church.

I noticed from the beginning of our friendship, he was very private. Especially about his relationships and his sexuality. He is still very uncomfortable about the only relationship he had, which lasted month, and ended 5 years ago. He refuses to even say her name. Whenever I would bring up porn, as I have tried to quit for years now, he was very private, and wouldn't tell me much. He didn't even know a popular pornstar like Sasha Grey, yet claims to watch it. Whenever I would bring up (jokingly) the oedipus complex, he would become very uncomfortable, nearly offended, that I implied that he would be attracted to someone like his mother. Just in general, sexuality and romance seem to be very distant topics for him, peculiar as compared to my other male friends. 

There are also various behaviors that display deep seeded insecurities. He is uncomfortable talking to girls, or even people for that matter, but most especially women. Only really talks to people at work, and other than that spends time alone. He gets sad if I don't text him for a few days, which made me uncomfortable honestly. Commonly refers to me as ""the first person who truly accepted him.""

Those aren't the worst insecurities either. These are the ones that started to bug me, which made me consider the possibility. He HATES women. Despises them. Randomly will go on rants about how inferior and stupid they are, which bugs me because I disagree entirely, and tell him that. He is very judgey. In fact, his first inclination on a new person who walks by or meets, is to judge their hair, face, but especially their clothes. Anything regarding ""aesthetics"" is a field in which he is somehow ""the master of."" It bugs me, because he can't just accept different styles, tastes, or just the fact that someone doesn't really care. Why does how someone dresses mean anything? It's almost superficial, and in particular a seemingly obvious insecurity. 

The strangest judgement he has are on men with high voices. He has a naturally very deep voice, but dare a man have a remotely high voice he instantly has to say how much he hates it. It's strange because he almost hates them. And he doesn't really like mid range either, but not as bad.

There is also this insatiable need to prove himself. Any sort of social goal is reliant on him proving himself at something first. For example, our band. He said the other day ""I will get a girlfriend when we make it big."" He always talks about making it big, fame, and people obsessing over his art. Yet, he dreads people. And he doesn't tell anyone about the band, doesn't promote it, and is very shy about it. He didn't even tell his mother he wrote poetry until this year. Add that he can hardly make friends to save his life because he's always judging people. to be famous you have to get people to like you, or notice you. He desires that, yet never does anything about it. 

The moment I was concerned, and not just considered, is when I got a girlfriend. He definitely changed. He started putting on a machismo like front more frequently. Always making gay jokes, even in moments that make zero sense, and honestly would just fall flat. Started talking about rating women more often, and their physical attractiveness. Judges people way more often now too. 

He's a bit of a bore to be around due to it. Yet, never talks about actually being WITH a girl. It almost feels like, and has always felt like there are some deep seeded insecurities that are so cryptic that a friend like myself can't really put together the puzzle.

He always, always told me how much he loved me, I kind of questioned it right then.

To top it off he is also addicted to stimulants, so his delusions get worse when he gets high. He has a notebook filled with ""government secrets"" and everytime a helicopter fly's overhead he says it's the government spying on him. Last night he got high and told my friend that he wanted to stab him and that he was his ""handler""? This was all out of the blue as my friend hadnt talked to him all night. He likes to watch violent content, and it's not the first time he's acted like this. We have contacted the campus police and they said they can't do anything because nothing's happened.

She’s getting old, 17 years, and she is going through what cats usually go through when they get older. He’s told me he can’t live without this cat and even said he’d sell his brand new car if it meant to keep her alive for another week. 

I had a similar experience when I was 16, I had a cat who I’ve known since birth and he was 17 when he died. I accepted it because he was old and lived a happy life. Of course I was upset, he would sleep on my face every night, but when he passed it took me weeks to sleep normally. 

I really love my boyfriend, I care about him a lot and I wanna be there for him. What can I say that’ll help? What can I do to comfort him?

424,"At the beginning of this school year I split from my friend group for a multitude of reasons, being pressured to do drugs, not getting as much as i put in, and several other little things that built to bigger issues. 

While I can admit that I probably had something to do with it, I still don’t like any of them at all, except one. She was my best friend in the group and I keep seeing my snapchat memories of her along with old pictures. Also, she never pressured me about the drugs, even sharing how much she didn’t like them with me during a conversation. 

Lately I’ve been realizing that I should’ve handled the entire situation at the beginning of the year differently (I’m not great at communication/expressing how I feel but it was a very messy situation all around). 

I don’t want to randomly reach out because the rest of the group will hear about it in around 10 seconds flat but I miss her. Something else I want to add is that I did try reaching out earlier in the year, but our relationship had become so muddled that it didn’t work out. 

What I want to know is do you think reconnecting with her is worth pursuing, and if so how should I go about it, or is it a lost cause?",03May2019,4
426," I received a random Snapchat from an old friend who I did have a sexual relationship with.  It said, “drunk and horny” I responded back with a sly joke but nothing serious. We got to talking and we laughed about old memories and I invited her over to my place and told her no funny business and I’ll sleep on the couch. She agreed and came over. She gave me big hug and jumped into my arms and said how much she missed me and our good times we had together. She then sat on my lap and got very close to me and whispered into my ear and kissed my neck and I asked what she was doing, to which she replied, “don’t you miss this?” I said aren’t you still with blank? She dodged the question but I finally got it out of her and she was. She said she isn’t going to get married so it’s not that serious. From there on, she made advances on me and I still was hesitant but my biological need finally gave and we had sex. I’m disappointed in my self for doing it I feel guilt. But can someone please shed some light on this? Am I still the one to blame for all of this because I’m the man?",03May2019,0

Now I feel like this is a sign that I don’t actually need therapy. But I’m unsure about that. I’m genuinely anxious about calling her.

So I have been depressed once but it’s nothing compared to what I’m dealing with now. It all started in the first/second semester (freshman btw) and I’ve been friends with this girl for a long couple of years but just started being attracted to her, she was/is the most beautiful girl I’ve ever met. She’s sassy, cute yet sexy at the same time, and has the cutest laugh I’ve ever heard. I remember it was Halloween when I told her I liked her, she told me she liked me, and then we where dating, we only went somewhere once because she was always busy, and when she wasn’t I was. But we still talked all night every night. FFW a good couple of months and something happened, I had a bruise and she asked about it and i lied, I said I fell skateboarding, she called bullshit and I told her what really happened, was that I got in a fight, she got pissed that I lied, and even more pissed that I was fighting, I lied because I didn’t want her to worry. I didn’t come out of my room for a straight week and only ate like 1 piece of turkey. FFW a couple months I thought I was over her but tonight along with many other sleepless nights I have been crying for hours straight,one night I took a bunch of Adderall and texted her that I still love her, she was the best thing to happen in my miserable, shitty life, and the fucked up thing was, is that a week after the breakup she was perfectly normal. I am a wreck, I should be exited for tomorrow cuz we are signing year books all day but I just wanna stay in bed listening to X. Help please, I am so close to just going in the bathroom and downing every pill bottle in sight (&amp; I have a fuck ton of old meds that I stopped taking) please guys help, what do I do?

429,"Im currently engaged to my SO and have been with her for 3 years. Life can be hard sometimes but she is my rock and we've had nothing but love. The only problem is her mother. When I met my SO she told me many stories about her mother and her controlling ways. Apparently she made all of her exes feel unwelcome. I've tried hard to go over often and hold my tongue and deal with it for my SO's sake and our relationship but it's really making me sad.

About 3 months into dating my SO was graduating and told me that wont be able to come to her graduation since her mum didn't want me ruining the photos if we broke up. I was upset but dealt with it and considered that it might have made sense. In the end I was allowed to attend as I was going to be sat in a cafe on my own waiting for them to come out. Her mum can be depressive and has days where shes really nasty and rude. A few months ago on the phone she said something along the lines of 'you need to look at the people around you and what they're doing to you'. The line was targeted at me. I was upset by this and spoke to my SO who was upset too and rang up again later and told her the comment was inappropriate. She never apologised and explained that its because I don't drive yet and don't have a job. I'm currently finishing up my final year at University and my degree is intensive and I have little spare time. It hit me hard because I often wonder if I am not successful enough. For the sake of our relationship and to not upset my SO I sucked it up and continued to go round. It was never mentioned again.

It has recently happened again as my SO is currently out of employment and seeking a job so we've had a hard time with money. Her mother is extremely controlling and loves to dig her claws into everything and run my SO's life basically. It's only since we moved out into a small flat that my SO has found her voice more and is making her own decisions and standing up for herself. Whilst at home her mother was ruling the roost, and whenever she would say something out of line and my SO wanted to fight back her dad just told her to drop it as she wouldn't let it go and it was easiest for everyone. It extends to things like sitting us down for an hour or two long lecture where she belittles my SO for not having a job currently even though we know both she is extensively looking and trying her best. She also found a way somehow to check my SO's bank account about 2 years ago without permission and confronted her about her spending habits.

I really love my SO and want a long future with her but her mother is the most negative influence in my life and makes me feel unworthy. My parents are both extremely welcoming to my SO and treat her as part of the family and whilst I've had nice moments with her family her mother often only brings negativity to my life. I don't want to solely be valued as someone who has a car and a job and can financially provide for my partner at 21.",03May2019,3
430,"After work today I am going to be submitting my two-week notice to the owners of the business I work for via email. I am having trouble deciding what to put in my resignation letter.

The owners of my work are two old white men. They’re very conservative politically and don’t have any sympathy for things like mental health. We have no health insurance through work. 

Am I required to give them a reason for my resignation? Should I say I am leaving for medical reasons (which is the truth)? My doctor has told me continuing to work here would be harmful to my health and well-being. I’ve worked here almost nine years and I just can’t do it any longer – physically or mentally. 

I expect them to put a lot of pressure on me not to leave once I submit my resignation. But my gp and psychologist both say I need to leave.

432,"I’m worried that my mom is not doing well financially and I don’t know how to talk to her about it. Just to build a bit of a picture, my parents separated about 12 years ago and ever since then my mom has sorta spiralled. She’s never been good with her money (I used to have to hide bills from my dad and she’d often borrow money hundreds of dollars from me and later my sister). Over the last few years she’s continued to spend her money poorly. Buying a house she didn’t need, spending her money on booze and cigarettes, and retiring early which means she doesn’t get her full pension. She’s also filed for bankruptcy in the past. She’s also stolen money from my sister while she was attending an exchange program, but that’s a whole other can of worms. 

Fast forward to now, and my mom has a flood damaged basement she can’t repair (it was flooded before and she used the insurance money to buy furniture she didn’t need); car-less as she doesn’t have the money to lease a new car; my sister has told me there’s hardly any food in the fridge and my mom was delaying in getting dog food for the dogs, feeding them PB sandwiches... (my sister recently moved out, but has offered to pay my mom rent when she was living there). Im also unsure if she’s taken a second mortgage out on the house (not sure if she do this if she’s filed for bankruptcy, but for some reason I think she does). I’m worried. I need to talk to my mom and come up with some sort of plan, but I am at a loss of how to talk to her about this. She is incredibly stubborn and proud, she keeps a lot from me. She doesn’t like being treated like a child and gets incredibly defensive. How can I have this adult conversation with her?

438,"Let's make this short. I currently work as a Resident Assistant (RA)  at my university, this job has helped me tremendously with paying for school. I only pay 1k a year for housing and get a 7.8k stipend. I'm a computer science major (junior) and had been looking for an internship all year, but failed to find one that was really related to CS (I found some for IT). Anyways, I found out that in order to graduate in 4 years I have to take a few summer classes so I'm not loaded with coursework over the fall and spring. I'm taking 3 classes all that go on at the same time but one ends earlier. I was worried because I didn't have a place to stay to take these classes until I was blessed with the summer RA position (which is a different application within the regular RA application/renewal). I met up and basically got hired by a web developer who's hired through the school and hires students to work with him. The thing is even though the RA job is extremely flexible I am unable to work more than 5 hours on campus with the RA job. Meaning I would have to leave the offer and stay an RA (which includes duty nights, desk shifts once a week) OR leave the summer RA job and work for the ITS department and gain real experience for my field. The dude said that they find employees on campus housing (for free or discounted cant remember). I rarely take risks, and i'm afraid I might end up homeless if I quit my RA job. Can I do 3 classes and 20 hours a week at this new job, that also will pay more? Or should I just say no and stick to the original play, have no work experience, and no job when I graduate (employers love experience)?!!?!!?! Thank you!",03May2019,2

He has a good job and doesn’t *need* the money back but it’s more to do with me being independent and not wanting to borrow it. He says I owe him nothing and even when I transferred money into his account he sent it straight back. How can I repay if he won’t take my money?",03May2019,2
440,"I recently reconnected with a high school friend who goes to college in a city about 4 hours from me. I will be going to that area for my studies starting next school year. We have shared a lot with each other and she recently has been battling a lot of depression because her father was very sick and just passed away this month. She also had some boy issues that we talked about and seemingly got through, but she is still feeling torn apart by a lot of the things and of course is still grieving over her father's passing.

She normally will text me late at night because she is a party girl and I'm usually awake because I get anxious at night and find it hard to sleep. The first time I was able to talk with her about her self harm temptation and even though I couldn't stop her from self harming I was an outlet for her until her friend made it to her apartment to be with her and make sure she was safe.

Last night she text me at 3 am and I was asleep because I have had a lot of important things this weekend and have been busy. I'm staying with my parents and they go to bed early so I don't stay up late so that I can respect them wanting to sleep. I woke up this morning to texts from her saying she was going to cut and that she was hiding. I don't know what to do. I'm a psych major who just finished getting my degree but I know I'm not equipped to handle someone self harming, especially my own friend, without getting my higher education and my certification as an LPC. Her mother is very strict and so she has been very free and party heavy since she got out of the nest. The alcohol doesn't help of course, as it is a depressant. I don't know how to make sure she is okay because I live so far away and I can't be sure that I will be awake Everytime she needs an outlet. I would not be able to live with myself if one of these times she cuts too much and takes her own life. 

How do I get her help? I know she is grieving and I don't want to put pressure on her to go see a counselor or a doctor but I am afraid for her life with her self harming at night when her roommate is probably asleep and I have no way of being there if she needs someone to save her. I don't know what to even do but I know I need to do something or one day she might go too far and I will feel like I did nothing to save her.",03May2019,4

442,"I'm really not sure what I should be doing right now, so I'm sorry if this is a little rambley.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 3 years now. Been living together for about half that time. We live in a metropolitan area, where she had moved to for a school program before we met. Early last year she quit her job due to panic attacks that were preventing her from going into work. I went back to covering rent until she had a job again (which I had been doing before she moved in with me anyway, so it wasn't a big deal) but she still payed for her own groceries and stuff. But it took a really long time for her to find anything, in large part due to her depression/anxiety. She eventually got a position, but was routinely getting panic attacks before going into work and couldn't even make it through training before they just stopped calling her in.

She started going to therapy, and has started to suspect that she has undiagnosed asperger's in addition to diagnosed PTSD due to parental abuse. These have caused the aforementioned anxiety, fear of transitions, sensory overload, as well as 'zoning out' and forgetting what she needed to do.

I want to help her, and I've been trying for as long as we've lived together, but it's starting to become too much for me. She worked through all of her savings and is now needing to rely on me for groceries and her phone service. I'm starting to build up an uncomfortably sized credit card bill.

Emotionally speaking, I don't know how to help at all. We're seeing a therapist, but that's not fixing the panic attacks or the inability to keep a job. Now when she has an episode, her crying and venting is starting to overload me, and I end up not being able to much more that sit quietly and listen, as I have no advice. She wants me to talk to her though, and she starts getting frustrated that I'm not talking and it occasionally turns into a fight.

I know that this dynamic isn't healthy for either of us, but I'm not sure what to do. I wish we could take a break from each other for a while, but she has nowhere else to go, and no money, and I'm worried about her being suicidal. If we broke up, she would be homeless, and it would be another rejection by someone close to her. I would be even more worried about her being suicidal, and I care about her too much to just let that happen.

I'm really at a loss for how to help her. Financially, this can't continue. Given enough time of status quo, I'm not going to be able to afford rent. Emotionally, this is wearing me down as well, and the more she learns on me for support the less I am able to provide it. I feel that I am already fraying, and making things worse for her rather than better due to my own frustration.

Any advice or perspective would be nice... I can answer questions if I left anything out. Thank you for reading.",03May2019,1
443,"So, 16M here. I have saved over the last year roughly $1500 in American dollars on a credit card. (I am not from the states though)

Now, I assumed it was time to buy me some things with this money, right? Well, here comes the problem.

I have had two things in mind that I really, really wanted to buy. I will talk about them separately and let you know my parents' response to it.

1. A Playstation 4. A year back , my dad actually said he'd let me buy a Playstation, because we are moving houses. At the time, I said ehh leave it, but now that I think about it... I really want to play a game that I can't play on my PC because it won't run it.(Cities Skylines) so the best option would be a PS4. My dad's response now when I asked him about it: ""Too late, the offer has expired"".
2. An electric scooter. I already have a non-electric scooter, but to be honest, I get no enjoyment out of riding it. My leg will hurt after I keep on riding it and it really is notthat fun for me.  I asked my dad if I could get one and his response was: ""Those things are stupid. You are supposed to move around when you're outside. Save your money for something else"".

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what is there to do? These two things are something I would really like to have, I would still have around $750 if Iwere to buy them and I haven't bought something for myself since my last birthday which was in July. But my dad simply won't let me buy them. Am I actually ungrateful or something?",03May2019,7

They are good people and fairly open but their flaw is that they treat me like an infant or a accessory. It’s hard to explain. For example if there is a slightly sexual scene my dad will rush to turn off the tv and tell me something else was happening, often acting like I wouldn’t know what sex is. I am fine with it being turned off because it’s awkward but his reasoning is what makes me upset. There’s a lot of other things like this. I find it very difficult to feel independent or like my own person while here.
How can I get them to understand I’m growing older and that I am my own person? I just want to be treated differently. I’ve drank since 14 but at times wish I could just share a beer with my family like all my friends do, or atleast not need to lie. I know these points are odd and may seem small but it brings me lots of unhappy feelings. Sick of being treated twelve!!

454,"Hello, I think the title is self-explanatory. But yeah, I'm in college a bit away from my mother (my only financial support) I've been *a bit* pushed to go here and it may sound dumb but I'm shitless afraid of her to die or have a heart attack as she has heart issues and she's the kind of person that will completely lose her mind if you're not on her side, so I agree with her most of the time for her to stay calm. So, of course, the first time (after high school) I told her that I wanted to go to art school went extremely wrong and I've been scared to talk to her about this ever again.

I know that being a doctor ensure a lot of money, but also a lot of studies I'm not interested in. I'm going every day to classes, worked a lot the first 5 months but my grades stayed the same, so I don't listen anymore in class, I stopped trying two months ago. And my mother is paying for this. Not only I feel like an absolute piece of crap for making her pay for something I don't do but also for wanting to be something she doesn't dream of (and this is a euphemism, she absolutely loathes art). I learned recently that the college doesn't want to keep me anymore as I lower their stats, which is understandable.

But I know that when my mother will be aware of it, she will be very saddened and will wonder why as I constantly tell her that everything is ok, then will be worried and extremely mad, I'm really afraid for her mental health.

But I know that my friend has always been a jerk towards her, cheated, lies very often, and is just a really bad boyfriend but they ”love” each other so whatever I don’t question it anymore. 

And his girlfriend is literally the sweetest girl I’ve met. She’s actually funny and is very attractive, way out of his league, but I’m sure she doesn’t know it herself. I think he’s putting her down so she doesn’t realise how good she is but that’s just a theory, and I’ve been right before.

Me and her really never had any friend relationship until very recently, I never really felt I wanted to meet her and me friend and her had sort of a ”break” and didnt see each other for a while. Now after this break they are closer and see each other almost every day, and since I meet my friend I also meet her. 

And it’s now that I realise how beautiful she is, as a person not only looks. And I’d be lying if I said she doesn’t find me attractive either, both me and her boyfriend would be considered attractive guys but I’m more of the classy style, while he’s more ”street”. And she also dresses classy. I’ve caught her staring many times, and I know she gets nervous around me, but I guess the most obvious sign I had recently when we were out after drinking and waiting for an uber to pick us up. Her boyfriend was being an ass that night, and we talked about it in private without him. And I’ll never forget the eye contact that I had with her that night.

Anyway, I probably sound like an asshole myself but I can’t stop feeling she deserves better. Lol nice guy. But I’m serious, I usually don’t give a f about other people’s relationship and Im usually against them since in my experience they’ve been a waste of time. Maybe that’s why I feel for her, because she’s wasting her time. 
 
All I know is I’m about to fall for her pretty hard, I wouldn’t do anything to fuck up my friendship with any of them but I honestly don’t mind the looks and stares, it makes me feel good.

What are your thoughts, Reddit? What can I do about this that I don’t already do?",03May2019,2
456,"So I have a situation... so 2 days ago, I got a ticket for speeding 74 in a 55. Today i got pulled for 87 in a 55 (reckless driving ticket). What are the chances of me getting jail time or a fine over $350. I am in the state of Virginia with no other driving offense. Before the first ticket I had +5 on my license. The first ticket I understood cause i wasn't paying attention. Second ticket, same officer, I was and wasn't paying attention.

459,"I'm in an internship in a office. Doing simple and repetitive tasks, but I loved to spend time there and what I learnt looking at what the others do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having serious back pain since I work there due to the chair they gave me. I complained a bit but they told me they had no more chairs and they weren't buying one for the intern. The chair is broken, full beyond repair. It's so bad that I prefer to use one from the canteen than this office one.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago one of my coworkers left, and I asked permission to get his chair. Ok, nice, since then I've been having no pain at all. Everything was wonderfull. Until today: a new coworker has entered the office and my boss tells me 'hey intern, we took your chair, here is your old one'. I was shocked and didn't respond anything. Also I'm in the middle of a cold so I feel my body weak .

&amp;#x200B;

I sarted to work again with my old char and pain is back. A few hours later I said to myself this can't be, you must say something. I told my boss if I could go to the warehouse  or storage room we have (company is hella big, it's a shame they don't wanna buy a new chair) and check if tere were any free chairs to use. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then happened, she started yelling at me about how could I bother her about something like this and why did I complain now and not before (which I did). First I engaged and said to her I don't use to complain and I thought I couln't improve my actual comfort, but seen others do I though I might too. Now she went full rage mode and while the others (whom I thought were 'friends' with me) were looking at the scene I couldn't do more than say nothing and low my head in submission. 

&amp;#x200B;

I depend on this internship to end well my degree, so I can't have serious arguments right now. I had to swallow all my pride, rage and physical pain in order to not get engaged in an argument. Worst, who I thought were nice to me before didn't tell me a word about what happened. Not a single 'hey I'm sorry you have the shitty chair again' or a 'hey what a boss ha? so shouty haha'.

&amp;#x200B;

I know, I'm just an intern and the new coworker isn't. He deserves the chair, yes. And It's kinda childish what I'm doing for a chair, but it's not the chair what matters to me, it's the pain that keeps along with me the whole day, hours later I leave the office.

Dunno, just needed to take this out of me. Thanks for reading. Love.",03May2019,2
460,"Hello reddit,
First time writing a post at all, Im currently on a break with my girlfriend for at least a year if not forever. We had gown apart because of our families and wanted a chance to explore how we feel. We are still very cuvil though and been not too too painful. I’m still not really used to it at all. But my old Best Friend from high school is coming back to town. I used to have feelings for her a lot  and our friendship suffered and  then she had to move away for life at around 19.  Since I’ve been with no friends since relationships can make them hard to maintain I decided to talk to her just to have a friend. She says she misses me a lot and wants to hang and is coming to my area. She’s very pretty but also kind of a bad influence. I’ve only ever had sex with my ex as well so I feel really conflicted about this (not that we will for sure but she’s been coming onto me a lot). What do any of you think of this?? Similar situations?",03May2019,1
461,"My(24m) post is long. Just a heads up.

  
To begin, this specific matter is currently on-going. Basically, I met someone on a hook-up app, called Grindr, we met up, did our thing, and split ways (this was literally a year ago from this month). Fast forward to December, this same guy texts me from an internet number, asking to hook up again, and I agree to it. Turns out it was all just a set up so he could seek revenge upon me, because he claims he's lost his ex-fiancee due to our hook up, but nothing was forced and we both agreed to the one night stand. I don't know this guy's real issue but I'm going to make a list of everything that's been going on from the day we met up until today...

* *May of last year:* We talked on Grindr, we met up that same night, hooked up at his house, and then we split ways.
* *December of last year:* I get a text from that same guy, randomly. He asks me how I am doing and offers for us to hook up again at his place. I agree, but it turns out it was just all a big setup to seek revenge and make me look like shit because he randomly stopped replying *after* harassing me via texts.
* *Later that night in December:* Papers of our conversation are found by both of my parents, and my younger brother, on all of their windshields... The conversation we had at the time was NSFW and I felt like shit having my parents and sibling read through those papers.
* *Later in December:* My car was vandalized. Turns out someone put sugar into my gas tank and I had to get that repaired immediately, and the repair costs were not pretty.
* *January 2019:* My car was vandalized *again* and this time there was even more sugar forced into my gas tank... Took a few months, but I finally got it repaired for another heart-breaking amount.
* *Good Friday(April) 2019:* My car was vandalized *again.* This time my car was spray painted with gold paint with the words *Fag, Faggot, and whore* written on my passenger and back side of my vehicle. I also receive a text from an unsaved number saying *""I like the new paint job on your car.""* 
* *Last night/Early this morning:* My parents are calling me to review the surveillance video and checkout what they've pulled from our mailbox and our neighbors' mailboxes. *5 manila envelopes* with with NSFW content of my pictures and conversations from Grindr. The video shows a random person, with an umbrella covering their face, going to my mailbox and my neighbors' mailbox, placing these paper items inside and walking away.

I've reported **EVERY** incident to the local sheriffs dept and the city's police dept. The detective on the Sheriff's side is *no help at all.* He created a case for me when this originally took place, but he told me to come back with some *hard evidence.* Fast forward to today, I go to the Sheriff's dept, speak with the same detective, tell him what has happened, show him the hard evidence that I have, and he talks down on me and makes me feel like i'm the one in the wrong here...

&amp;#x200B;

I walk in upset, I ask for the detective, he comes out and asks *'Now whats going on?""* I vividly explain the most recent two situations, show him the video, and pictures of my car, and he says to me *""What am I supposed to do with this?""* We got into a small argument about how this is the content he told me to bring back so he could search further, blah blah blah... Long story short with the detective, he tells me that I need to call a deputy out to my house to dust my mailbox and spray  the letters with some random chemical that *only the deputy has* to find fingerprints because there's absolutely nothing he can do on his behalf and he told me word for word *""Coming to the police dept and reporting these incidents are worthless if you don't call a deputy to your house as soon as something happens.""*

I left the police department, unsatisfied, but i immediately got on the phone to call the Sheriff's hotline and dispatch a deputy to my house. *TURNS OUT,* since this guy has gone into my mailbox, I have to call USPS (US postal Service) to file a case for a crime because tampering with one's mailbox is considered a federal offense, and the local Sheriff's dept cannot do anything (told to me by the operator on the line at the Sheriff's dept). I actually did call USPS and file the crime, but that specific operator told me that I will get a call from a detective, but he doesn't know exactly when because he's not in control of how fast cases are viewed and resolved, and depending on the severity it could take a few days... this is only done through the Post Master and whoever else handles the cases on the federal side.

So here I am now, on Reddit, and unhappy with the outcome of today. Is there anything more I should be doing on my part to get this case moving faster or to just catch the guy immediately? Let me throw in some quick details about the person by the way...

* I don't have his *real number*. I tried to retrieve a text message report from Sprint so I could get our original conversation from May of last year, but since I'm not the account holder (my mom is), I can't request/view the files that Sprint is able to send of *my phone number history*. Sprint is little to no help here. And the number this guy keeps texting me and harassing me from is an internet/Google based number, so he's definitely not using his real number.
* I only know the guys **first name,** and that's it. No last name or anything else.
* The house he used to live in, I don't believe he even lives there anymore because he is a back forward resident from what he told me(FL--&gt;NY). ***But I haven't gone to check yet.*** This neighborhood is also a gated community so I would have to get through a guard in order to get in...
* These crimes keep happening when they're least expected. *X amount of weeks* after the next one(basically when I don't expect anything) , so they are all planned for sure!

Is there anything more I can do to try and catch this guy without the help of the Sheriff's dept, because they're not helping me **at-all**. And at this point I feel as if the detective I'm dealing with is taking this as a joke when its really not. I plan on purchasing a dashboard camera, since most of the criminal offenses have to do with my car being vandalized. I was considering fingerprint dust so I can dust the envelopes and content inside for prints, but would that even help me at all?

Please if anyone has some well needed or great advice, I will take it! I don't wan to have to deal with this issue any longer. I'm honestly doing nothing wrong, and I've done nothing wrong. I've explained this to everyone who knows or has seen what's going on... Even the lousy detective.",03May2019,1
462,"Hi, so I have a problem and need an advice. 
I moved from my parents a few days ago and now live with my brother (we’re both students) so it’s easier. Ever since I’ve moved, well kinda even before that I have started to push people I know and care about the most away. 
I rarely call my parents and when they call I never feel like talking. Even they have noticed that and I don’t know why anymore. It’s not intentionally but I just can’t make myself share anything important going on in my life with them. Don’t get me wrong I’ve shared a good healthy bond with both of them and I really care about them. 
It’s not just them that’s scaring me. My brother and I have pretty busy lives so we see each other during weekends but even then we don’t like interact deeply if u get it. I’ve been feeling like I want to be by myself a lot more and I have friends but I’m also pushing them away. I have a bunch of friends but now I logged out of Snapchat and Instagram so nobody disturbs me. Like I can go for days honestly without talking to people I know. It drains me mentally to have a conversation with them. Now the weird thing is that I like talking to random people about random topics. I don’t like talking about myself or having to share important things about my life. I don’t know why and I really do value advice they may give me but I can’t get myself to open up anymore. My parents just think I’m being rebellious and stuff but honestly they don’t know that I don’t talk to anyone. 

That was a lot. Phew thanks for reading it all. 

so question is why is this happening? What should I do? How should I start becoming myself again? 

Thanks again.",03May2019,1

I’m 18 (m) and I’m living with my friend and her mom after they opened their doors for me to live there after leaving child placement. I moved in in August of 2018 and everything was going good until a couple weeks ago. My friend, A, and I have been having problems with each other. She is just constantly rude to me and always treats me like shit and is a terrible friend. I’ve had talks with her before about how I felt and they were mature, level headed talks but she never changed how she treated me. 

I had enough of her shit sometime last week and called her out for how she treats me and I told her that she needed to stop being rude to me. She told me not to tell her how to act. She had also gotten into a fight with her mom the day before, and after talking to her mom we all had a meeting with each other to talk things over. They’re basically told me she was stressed and that I was gonna have to deal with her while she tries to find a therapist. Cool.

After not really talking to A for the week, last night I got woken up from my sleep by a knock on my door. A bunch of the mom’s friends where there (no one else) and they told me that A told her mom that I was selling drugs. I am. They told me that she was gonna call the police and that they convinced her not to and that they would get me to leave. I grabbed a weeks worth of clothes and a pillow and blanket, got all of my drugs and my shotgun out of the house, and put it all in my car and left. They told me to call the mom the next day (which is today) and talk to her. 

I went to a good friend of mines house and she told me that A told her at school earlier that day that she had told her mom I sell drugs, and that she was tired of living with me. She told me that she felt like she’s just doing this to get rid of me. A has known I’ve been selling drugs for about a month or so now. She never told me that she had a problem with it, and that she wasn’t scared or anything. I’m pretty sure she was just being petty. She blocked my number and blocked me on all socials. 

I know what I was doing was wrong and that I could’ve put their lives in danger by selling drugs. But all I did was sell some weed to people I knew, I wasn’t slangin dope or something like that. I just quit my job Wednesday too, but I can get it back if I need to. I don’t have anywhere to stay and I slept in my car last night.

When I call my friends mom, what should I say? Is there any chance of me being able to come back? Should I even try?",03May2019,1

I've also tried creating contacts with the names ""Unknown"" and ""Anonymous"" with the numbers 000-000-0000 to see if my phone would then block them, but that didn't work either.

473,"So, this guy is outside sales (OS) for one of the companies I work for. I’ve been doing a lot of redesigning for their website, and we’ve had several meetings regarding what we’d like to do. 

The OS is constantly saying that the website isn’t performing well, that it doesn’t have the content it needs, etc.

The issue is, he is supposed to be the person getting this content to me. We had a meeting with the entire sales team and he was tasked with putting together content that I would edit and upload. He has yet to get this content to me. He called me out in an open office area today in front of everyone and basically said I wasn’t doing my job, when it’s actually HIM who isn’t get his work done for the site. 

The site is also performing well, contrary to what he states. I pulled Google Analytics reports as proof.

He claims (and tells anyone when given the opportunity) that all the project photos on the website are stock photos, except I took them all myself or had them taken. 

He basically puts me down and condescends me in front of other coworkers constantly. Mind you, I do not work for this person, and he has zero authority over me. 

We are a large company with no HR. I went to our chief revenue officer and expressed my concerns but I have no faith that anything will be done about it.

474,"I have worked in the Audio Visual industry for the last 10 years. I have a BA degree in lighting design. I've designed for theatre, corporate, concert, and many places in between. 

6 months ago I was let go from a company that I thought of as family. I was reassured it was budgetary and it wasn't something they wanted to do, but they still did it. They still wanted me to freelance with the company but it wasn't going to be consistent enough to support me and my wife.  

So I found a new job with a much larger company. I received a significant raise, better benefits, less stress, and more flexibility. Almost over night every complaint I had about my old job this company fixed. Effectively a dream job. 

Then about a week ago, I was on a show, everything had gone smoothly, client was thrilled, and then a mental switch went off and I was done. I didn't want my career anymore. I felt like I had achieved everything I wanted from lighting and didn't want to go further/longer. I struggle to even think of a new goal.

So now I'm trying to figure out a new career life plan.

I'm interested in going back to school for mechanical engineering. I don't know anyone in this field or even have a strong grasp on everything the job entails but it just feels like the ""right thing"". I guess you could describe it as a eureka or if you're spiritual a message from the universe or God. 

As I've been looking more and more into Mechanical Engineering it seems to be perfect for me. 

Strong Design Focus
Problem Solving
Team goals and personal goals
CAD drawings
Math 
Hands on Work
Project driven
Tangible Achievements

So here's my Plan:
Stay full time with current company for nest egg/security
Go back to community college for AA mathematics
Online classes, slower paced 
Switch to freelance/part time
Transfer to a state School for Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering hit full time fast
Figure out new career

TLDR
I'm done with my career as a Lighting Designer

And (excuse me for being blunt) his bathroom habits didn't used to smell so terrible... meaning, after he used the restroom, it wasn't as rancid as it smells today. She describes it as spoiled meat. He uses the restroom more often. He's only 58. My sister has not really noticed a difference in his weight, but my grandfather called me right after my father left his home on his way to mine. I have never heard my grandfather cry, but he begged me to talk to my father about his health. Anytime my mother or sister would ask him to go to the doctor, he would get sensitive and defensive. I am the oldest daughter, and apparently his favorite so my whole family has put the pressure on me to talk to him about it. My question is, HOW do you convince an alcoholic to get help. Mind you, his life hasn't always been the greatest. My mother put our family in debt and bankruptcy from gambling debt and divorced him and won the house in the settlement. He lost his job more than 10 years ago and has been relying on Uber/Lyft for income (Let's be honest, the salary is nothing), he lives in California, he has barely anything in savings. He is a conspiracy theory nut, and no health insurance. I love my father very much. My mother, even though she has divorced him, has allowed him to stay in the house and when she leaves for work, he says things like ""I think it's almost time. I'm dying."" He never tells me these things and I think that he's just focusing on the time that he spends with me and tries not to think about it, but when he showed up yesterday, I noticed his muscle mass has gone down tremendously and he does not look well. I'm blunt and asked him about his legs and he says he's always been this skinny, but for his father (my grandfather) and me to notice it since we don't see him often, I can definitely tell he's lost a TON of weight.

I already know there's something serious going on, but he may just tell me that he knows he's dying. What's going to the hospital going to do? Give him options that he can't afford to somewhat prolong his life and then charge him up the ass for tests? I'm in a bit of a pickle because I already know what his stubborn butt is going to say. He has 2 grandchildren from my sister, and none from me. I was unable to have kids and have decided that I don't want them. I'm 33 now.

483,"I’m new to reddit and on a phone so excuse my lack of knowledge on how it works/my grammar. However, I go to a really good (small) university in Canada and have a scholarship valued at $5000 a year to go here. (Tuition is around $9000 a year for reference.) I come from a lower class family and fully support myself independently financially so money is a big stress always and the scholarship allows me to be in less debt by taking less out in loans. I just finished my first year there and it was wonderful. I absolutely love everything about the school. However, I’ve been a competitive athlete my entire life and track and field has been such a passion I would say it is a part of my identity. My school is so small that we do not have varsity U-sport athletics. Only college league which does not include t&amp;f. Not being able to be involved in an organized sport has definitely impacted me and my sense of self. There always felt like there was something missing this year and I believe that something was athletics. I go to the gym regularly but it’s not the same. 

I reached out to the neighbouring (much larger) universities athletic department for more information on their t&amp;f program and was surprisingly met with enthusiasm and a readiness on the head coach’s behalf to have me sign an athletic contract to join for high jump upon our very first meeting. This particular school has been the top track and field school in my part of Canada for the last 30 years and I was told that once back in shape it would be likely for me to be competing at the national level. 

The issue is, I would have to give up the scholarship at my other school in order to do what I love. Alternatively, I am very prone to ankle injury and although I would have access to proper physio and training for the first time in my life, it’s a worry that I would hurt myself and be out for a season I’m essentially paying $5000 to compete in.

I finally went to the ER Wednesday, they did a CT Scan, and said the disks looked good, the only thing they saw was lots of arthritis. They sent me home with a prednisone pack and som Valium as a muscle relaxant. Yesterday I woke up feeling better, then went and picked up the prescriptions. Took my first 2 doses of prednisone at lunch, since I didn’t get them until then. About a couple hours after, I feel like complete crap. Everything hurts, and I even had a headache. Dinner came, took the other dose then, and still felt like complete garbage. Then I test my blood sugars and they skyrocketed. I go to sleep, and I am out for pretty much the whole night. Wake up, and I still feel awful. I do my fasting blood sugar, and it’s still super high. By this time, I’m stressed beyond belief and in pain. I literally break down and start crying. I’m not sure if it’s the prednisone, the stress, the pain, I have no clue. Basically I need advice on what to do to relax myself, and deal with the pain. I have not taken the Valium, because I don’t need to throw another pill into the mix. If you have more questions, I’ll gladly answer then.",03May2019,1
485,"CC=Crazy chick
FM=Friend that Moved
B=my Bestfriend

Back in grade 10 my bestfriend since grade 7, was close with a girl and she moved halfway through the year. Later he started to date another girl. Who is badshit crazy. She told everyone she was extremely mentally ill and was taking meds, and going for checkups (probably for attention). Throughout the rest of the year she eventually got so absorbed with him, she made sure he was with her at all times. During and after school. We used to hangout almost everyday, but in the first 6 months of the new year, we hung out maybe 7 or 8 times. Me and another close friend tried our best to get him with us at all, almost like a divorced couple fighting over their kid. Idk what kind of things she told him, but CC basically ""brainwashed"" B for a little over 2 years. My friends mental health deteriorated quickly, and it didn't help he lost 90% of his friends. Almost me as well.

Remember the girl that left back in grade 10? My friend and her were so close they almost dated, but drifted apart after CC used HIS account pretending to be B, and said the nastiest shit which led to her telling FM to kill herself. After a lot of drama and falling outs in 2 years, CC and B finally break up. We are now in grade 12.

After FM moved I talked to her more so I was kinda close with her. I told her that everything that happened with my friend wasnt him, and was the crazy girl all along. Recently FM was in town and I got the two (B and FM) to meet up at the mall with me. They saw each other and hugged. Great reunion after 2 years. We go back to my house and they talk it out. (Im leaving a LOT out of this story with all the fucked stuff she did because its a lot to remember) FM was understanding of what happened yadda yadda, but when B broke up with CC, he stayed friends with her and never changed his snap chat or Instagram passwords. And today CC texts FM this ALL THE WHILE PRETENDING TO BE B!! (word for word btw):
""Wanted to let you know that I never actually cared about you. And that (crazy girls name) and I made that up as a joke about us breaking up to see how you wanted to react. Just wanted to break your little heart again. 😂 oh and want to come to our wedding? 😂""

I want to get back at her so bad, doesn't matter if its public or not. Any suggestions would be great.",03May2019,0
486,"I’m 21f. On a throwaway because this is all pretty hard to come to terms with.

Just before I turned 19, I dropped out of university to go ‘travelling’ around Iceland. Except I wasn’t travelling, I was searching for my true love.

I don’t know when the entire fantasy started, but I had a series of very vivid dreams in which I essentially found my soulmate somewhere in Iceland. It felt so real, there were so many places in the dream that lined up to actual places in Iceland, I was so spooked and had never felt more like something was calling out for me. This was just about the time it started getting incredibly commercial - so obviously all the images I’d seen in my dreams were from what I’d seen on TV, and I can recognise that now. Places like Gullfoss, Skoga River and all the rest of the Golden Circle locations. As an 18 year old, I truly believed that I was MEANT to go there and find this man from my dreams. So I did. 

I spent the first year essentially backpacking, hitchhiking and camping around the West and South. In my second year I explored most of the North and some of the East, I bought a van and slept out of that most of the time with the occasional hotel/couchsurf. I was financially supported by my parents, but the other money came from my student loan, savings and payment from doing odd jobs for locals. I’d also like to add that I never told anyone my true intentions, I just said I was going travelling so my parents/friends at home had no idea. Please don’t pin any blame on them for not telling me I was delusional. 

I talked to everyone I met in hopes that when they’d turn around, I’d recognise their face from my dreams and they’d recognise me and it’d be this big, lovely happy ending. But when I wasn’t talking to people or visiting new places to find this dream man, I’d feel so terribly lonely. I just locked myself in this van and would drive to the next place or sleep or wait until I could go out and explore.

At the start of last year I almost realised how stupid the entire thing was but actually met a man who I was convinced was the one (he turned out to be married, so you can imagine how well that went over with me).

Even now I feel so lonely. When I started becoming a bit more self aware, I decided to sell my van and buy a smaller car just to quell the ability to search a bit. I’ve ended up just outside of Kópavogur. I’ve only got a part time job at a restaurant, don’t really get on with many co-workers although I talk to a lot of tourists at my job. I hate the winter months because there’s less people and it gets even lonelier. 

It’s coming up on 3 years since I’ve been out here (3yrs in October) and I think I’m finally fully awake. I’m aware that it was stupid of me to throw away so much money and time to try and fulfil something that happened in an unconscious state. I’m convinced I’ve damaged both my social and romantic life as I really don’t think I’ll ever be able to drop my standards from this dream guy - even now I’m self aware I don’t think I can. Trust me when I say that there’s nobody that thinks this was more stupid, senseless and delusional than me. I have no drive or passion to learn skills or find a career for myself anymore because the only motivation I had was to feed the cycle for this stupid fantasy.

I know it must seem so pathetic and childish of me. But I desperately need help on finding what to do next and where to go. Do I go back home (England)? How do I find out what career I want? Should I go back to uni? Etc etc. I feel like I’ve missed out on the things people explore in university and feel so lost. If I go back to England I can’t help but feel I’d seem like an alien. It’s as if I fell asleep for 3 years. I just haven’t done anything to help my future.

487,"Dear fellow redditors, 

Thank you for your time, ill try to keep it as short as possible.

I moved to a big city in Germany right after college, as i liked the city a lot and had even a few close friends there. Since day one it was a struggle. First i move to a commune, with 2 other nice people. After 3 month I got my first job in accounting. My plan was to look for another job after like 6 month so i didnt pay attention to all the red signs. moving forward, the place is horroble. My boss was litteraly screaming at me, and nobody cared. My living situation was also rly bad, as i lived with a girl, which i dont get along pretty good, because at my place there were mise running around at night. 

So after about 9 Month (6month into the job), and looking for a new place for like 3 month, I coudnt handle the pressure anymore. I got really depressed and had anciety. So i called in sick and flew to the town my family lives in. After 2 weeks, still rly depressed i was checked into the psychiatry. They gave me pills and told me that i had a pretty severe  compulsive disorders, depressens and anciety. They tell me i need to go to the hospital for like 6-8 weeks. Also to take antidepressants, which i am taking since the morning. 

Here comes the problem. A week ago, a real estade agency calls me, and tells me i can move into the flat, i really really wanted. 

My parents tell me i should move to the town close to the smaller town where they live. Also my 3 siblings are all living in the town. its at the other part of the country. 

I rly like my freedom all by myself and i want to follow my dream and get the place, rent it out for 2 month and move in afterwards. 

But another part of me tells me to get the help from my family, since my mental health is really bad right now. they could help me finding a flat in the town close by. And also support me, i guess.

I really dont know what to do and the time is running. i need to make a decision by end of the week.

488,"So I just finished my final year of a chemistry degree and I am going on to do a masters this fall. I have recently come to the realization that I am terrible at reading comprehension/recalling information that I have read, which is an issue especially considering the amount of scientific literature I need to read to perform well in my field. 

I used to read novels quite often as a kid and was always considered “above average” at reading in grade school. More recently, I have been told that I am an excellent writer by a couple of my professors. That said, for some reason when I’m trying to read something (even something that genuinely interests me) I find it incredibly hard to stay focussed. My mind is constantly wandering and I keep having to go back and re-read whole paragraphs or sentences if I am to have any hope of actually retaining anything. Even then, I find I struggle to recall information that I have very recently read. So far the only thing I’ve been able to do to get around this is to take lots of notes while I’m reading, however this is not very time efficient. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I could improve my reading skills/keep myself more focussed while trying to read?",03May2019,1
489,"For context, this is a friend I've known for about a year, and in that time I know they've struggled with mental abuse, self harm and stuff in that field. I've tried my best to be there for them and be as supportive as possible throughout all this, but now over the last week they've told me they have someone else in their head. 

This kinda threw me for a loop since it has literally came out of nowhere with no mentions of anything like it before, but apparently they we're talking with some friends and now identify as being ""plural"". I tried telling them to see a therapist as to me it sounds like a mental disorder but they grew very angry saying stuff like ""Don't call her a disorder! She helps me!"" and I was kinda left just stunned over the whole thing. 

This person literally went from seeming completely ok one day and having a split personality they talk and act as over messages and Twitter the next and honestly I don't know how to handle it at all. It sounds possible to me they've self diagnosed, or maybe this second personality is like personified survival instinct from when they self harmed, or I guess it could just be a genuine. 

Regardless, I have no clue how to handle this and they are very defensive over the whole thing, so any advice on how to handle the situation would be much appreciated.",03May2019,1

He kept getting closer knowing I was uncomfortable so I told him in a stern voice to move he responded ‘why babe’ after some asking I started to threaten him that if he didn’t let me sit someone else I would get violent, still he didn’t listen and I started to panic.

So 2 days ago after I pick up my sister from school we get home and moms been drinking, she was acting weird and I asked her how much she had (not in a condescending way), she got upset that I asked and my sister got upset she drinks at all (I'm of the mindset that if she can control herself it's not a problem, but my sister gets very angry if she even touches 1 drop) things escalated to a blow up where it was mostly my sister in the wrong this time (says she hates her, shes not her mom, tells her to quit playing mommy, and while we were outside she told me privately that she just doesn't care anymore even about whether mom lives or dies), mom grounds her. 2 days and no drinks later sister is still cold and distant. Today as I was getting ready for work mom told me we need to get the house super clean because ""people might be coming"" and that shes just gonna hold it together till sister finishes the school year, I ask her what she means and at first she says she might check into a ""loony bin"", then backpedaling and says I might need to move with my dad and sister with hers cause she ""might not be around anymore"" in a few months, I asked her what she means and she wont elaborate. We've had suicide scares before so I straight up asked her after about 10 minutes of her skirting around the subject if she was suicidal again, she just said ""I need time to think"" and that she just needs to find a way out, and wouldn't give an answer any further.

So In my school to celebrate the last year of school before going to the next step (middle school, high school etc.) We make a exhibition showing everything that we've learnt through our time there. We started working on it before January, and presented it on may 3rd. We skipped multiple lessons of other topics to work on the exhibition and I spent multiple hours after school working on it. Before the exhibition we all have to give a speech about our exhibition. I got a little bit nervous so I forgot about the thank you part of my speech,not a big deal since I thanked everybody in person after and gave them flowers. My mom was at my booth for 2 minutes max and then never came back up. Then at the end when I was helping others tidy up she kept nagging me and being annoying. I didn't take it to heart but told her it would soon be over and we could go home. I was still in a good mood since I finally got to show all of my work. Then in my car she starts telling me that I did so many things wrong in exhibition and I shouldn't do everything myself. The whole point of exhibition is that you do it individually. Then she said that I was the only girl in my class that was wearing a dress for the occasion and that i was being too dramatic. One of the girls is not even a girl, a trans boy and the other one told me that all their dresses were not their size. I tried to tell my mom that I wore a dress because my teacher had advised the girls to do so, and the others didn't wear dresses because of these reasons, and she wouldn't even listen. Then later that day I hear her telling my step dad about the exhibition and she said I was disrespectful to her in the car and that I didn't thank my mentors.

504,"Hello reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I come in need of advice.

I am in my mid-twenties, from Western Europe. I was hired over a year ago for a job in the US because of my very specific skill set, and worked in my home country for a few months, while the company was figuring out the visa situation. The company is originally from the same country that I am, but they have a subsidiary in the US. Last summer, I finally got my visa: they applied for a very specific visa, which means that my visa and my job are related: if I lose my job, I lose my visa. Originally, I was promised a green card. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have always wanted to move to the US, for as long as I can possibly remember. In the recent years, what prompted me to seriously try and move to the US was my need to get away from a toxic and harmful relationship, from which I needed to put as much distance as possible. I would like to add that I suffer from severe clinical depression, anxiety, and C-PTSD. I see a psychiatrist and a therapist for it.

Unfortunately, as soon as I got to the US, the job turned sour pretty quickly. I found myself trapped in an abusive work relationship, with increasing micro management, gaslighting, etc. It's not just happening to me, other employees are feeling it too. The difference is, I kinda have to stick with it if I don't want to lose my visa.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I made a silly mistake, that was both harmless and innocent. It was work related, but did not impact my work, or anyone's work, in any way. Somehow, this is just resurfacing now, under circumstances I'm not entirely clear about, and things are looking grim for me. 

One of the big bosses (who also is one of my managers) is going to come see me soon to discuss the situation. 

I'm 90% certain that I'm about to get fired. Which means that I'll lose my visa, and thus have to leave the country. I can't do that. I can't go back to where I'm from.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should try and apply for grad school to get a student visa, which I had always intended on doing, but originally not for a couple of years. I don't know if I should try to look for another job. 

And even if I don't get fired, what should I do? 

I'm in a very bad place right now. Both physically and mentally. I got hit with a violent mixed tension migraine, almost as soon as my boss called me about the situation, that should have sent me to the hospital. The only reason I didn't actually go was that I was in no shape to even make the phone call to 911. I haven't been able to eat since it's happened, because I can't keep anything in down.

So here I am, 16 years old from Germany barely having any close friends because I have social anxiety. But lets begin where it all started.
I want to begin from the complete beginning.
LONG TEXT INCOMING

When I was in elementary school I was a pretty popular kid. I had contact with everyone from my class and I had some really close friends that I spend almost all my time with. My grades were really good and I got voted as the class speaker. I had a really close friend then, lets call him Paul. Other than that I had close contact with a girl that lived in my neighbourhood and we talked a lot, spend time together but we weren‘t in love, it was more like a friendship.

However when I went to Gymnasium (high school) things started to change. The first 2 years were great, I still had close friends and the girl, lets call her Sophia, and my best friend Paul were in my class too. However in grade 7 I got addicted to gaming. I spend my whole time playing League of Legends and Minecraft. At that time when my friends asked me to do something with them I refused. Added to that I got bullied in school. One day I went to the toilet and i was standing at one of these toilets were you do what you have to do while standing (sry, dont know what they are called) and a classmate pushed me so that I peed on my pants. All my class mates saw it and it was one of my most awful day. The girl, Sophia, defended me tho. Things didnt changed in class 8. I got really introverted because I thought that everyone dislikes me and that Im the „stupid guy“ that just „plays computer games all the time and doesnt want to talk.“ However my grades were still really good.
I didnt talk much to my „best friend“ paul even tho we still went to school together. I wasnt meeting with any people after school and my life just was „Getting to school, survive school, play games“.

However things changed in grade 9.
I made new friends that were 1 grade above me because they also played league of legends. At that time I played with them for hours, it was really fun and I forgot about my old friends. I dont even know when I talked with Sophia more than one sentence and we are still in the same class, but more information about that later.
So the guys one grade above me...
They were really nice but I only talked with them while gaming, not at all in school because I was afraid of them disliking me. The year went on and in my class I was known as the smart silent guy that doesnt want to talk.

Now its getting fucked up.
In grade 10 I got invited to a party from my old best friend Paul(9months ago). It was the best night of my life because with enough alcohol I was able to be like 4-5years ago because I was able to talk to my old friends, to Sophia, to Paul... I had a lot of fun but it was only because of the alcohol.
Thats when I started to begin with changing my life. I started caring about how I was looking and when I went to school again, meeting all the people, i actually thought that I would be a whole different person. 
BUT nothing changed because I was to afraid to talk to them, its not like I wouldnt want to talk.
The months went on and I got invited to the next party like 3 months after that. Sophia, Paul, and a girl that is in my class that I fell in love with were also there. Like again, the first hour there I didnt say much until the alcohol kicked in. Again it was one of my best nights again, it was so much fun!! I even felt like there was something magical(?) with the girl im in love since grade 5 but I couldnt and still cant tell her.
But the next day in school, all the same...

Then Sophia and the girl I love celebrated their birthday but I wasnt invited but most of my friends were. I dont know why because at previous parties we had a lot of fun together but I was too afraid to ask. So I thought that they dont like me and because of that I still didnt talk much with them. But then the girl I love started to talk with my in class. Im really good at maths and whenever she needs help she asks me (she sits behind me) even tough she could ask a friend of her that sits besides me.
So I started to think that she likes me because she always was very friendly and we used to write whats app a lot in grade 5-7.

So at the moment im still known as the smart guy that doesnt want to talk and its pissing me off. Thats why im writing, I WANT TO CHANGE MY LIFE BUT IM TOO AFRAID

On monday im going on a school trip to berlin with my class.
One problem that seems like a small one but its huge for me:
We will drive from a bus station thats 30km away from here.
Im used to drive together with my friend Paul but Sophia, the girl from my neighbourhood, already asked him so he, sophia and a friend of her will get driven to the bus station but they have a seat left in the car. We are all from the same town btw. But she didnt asked me even tough Im living next to her. My mum will ask me if Paul will drive with us but I will need to tell her that he already drives with Sophia. Them my mum will tell me that I should ask Sophia if I can drive with them so she doesnt need to drive me.
Thats what Im afraid of... Asking sophia if I can drive with her. Like I said, I havent talked much with her nor have I wrote with her on whats app the past 2 years and she thinks that I dont want to talk with her even tough I would really like to.

Then there is the girl I love... And I think she likes me too but Im too afraid to tell her because, again, im known as the smart silent guy that plays computer games all day and I think that im not good enough for her. All people would be confused why she would go out with someone like me and even worse, what if she would tell her friends about me loving her? My life could be ruined but holy shit I love her so fcking much, so fucking much...

I started solving my problems. I havent played any computer games for 1 week now and I want to stop it completely, because it ruined my life.
I also want to talk more with the girls from my class(I have a problem talking to girls) and especially to Sophia and the Girl I love.
However I dont know where to start because I cant just go to school and talk with them like I would be doing every day because it would be really weird.
At the moment it feels like im invisible for them and I want to change it. PLEASE HELP ME",03May2019,1

513,"So a little backstory, I went out to the movies with a group of friends. And some of those friends were my guy friends, which I did not mention when I ask my parents for permission to go to the movies. They now, (mostly my mom) are accusing me of having a boyfriend and lecturing me about it. I do not have a boyfriend and they were all guy friends of mines. I can see how me not mentioning that there would be guys would make them suspicious. They both agree that I'm getting too ""wild"" and how I shouldn't go out anymore.  They also see me on my phone a lot and assume that I'm contacting my ""boyfriend"" when In reality most of the times I'm watching Netflix. They are also kind of racist and when my dad picked me up from the movies he saw my mixed and black friend, and that just made them both furious. I really don't see a problem with me hanging out with my friends.  They keep on assuming things and its getting really frustrating for me. (my dad is mixed/black so I really don't see why he's being so racist, he thinks that all black guys are bad when in reality thats not true) I think they're overdoing it and being unfair. They keep bringing it up and bashing me about having a ""boyfriend"" calling me a ""disgrace etc (my mom did)"" and now they're both agreeing to take my phone away. I know that if they do take it away I have a small- no chance of getting it back. How can I convince/ finally believe me and that I don't have a boyfriend?",03May2019,1
514,"Hi everyone! Made a throwaway but I need some advice on some friends at work. 

I (24F) moved to a new city last year with my partner. I've really struggled to make friends, and made 2 female friends in my coworkers, lemme call them C1 and C2. C1 got moved onto the same team as C2 but still in the same division, and they became really quick friends. We all started taking lunch together, etc. They became quite close, but we were all good friends.

I then noticed C1&amp;2 were taking lunch without me every once in a while, and leaving me to sit at my desk (not even 10m away). That upset me, but  whatever. We went on a girls weekend trip together, and I thought everything was cool. I've noticed they have a lot of chats/coffee dates/get togethers where I feel very unwanted, but I chalked it up to insecurity.

Last week, they ditched me at lunch again. This one upset me because I had been talking to C1 immediately before, and I had been consoling her through her upset having to participate in &lt;voluntary corporate thing&gt;, where she had cried at messing up words. I went back to my desk, then went to do some kind of task and found C1 and C2 leaving. C1 told me to tell our boss that she was going on lunch, and left.

I spent the weekend very upset and wondering if I had done something wrong, and messaged to say I was hurt. They assured they did not mean to leave me out, C1 was upset and wanted to get out. I accepted the apology, but it had opened my eyes to a lot of rude and exclusionary things they had done (pawning me off to C2s friend on our girl trip, the coffee dates I was not invited to and if I walked past they went quiet and stared at me, things like that)


Today, I heard C1 and C2 planning ways for C1 to exclude her childhood friend from her outing with her 2 childhood friends this weekend. (another group of 3 C1 is part of). They were planning for C1 to not invite the friend and just keep the outing off social media, as C1 does not agree with her friends choices.

So advice reddit my question is just kinda, what do I do with C1 and C2? They're a lot more malicious than I thought this time last week and they obviously know full well when they exclude someone. I feel like a third wheel, but not even on a tricycle. I'm a flat spare wheel in the back of a beat up car to a bike. I just wanna make some friends.",03May2019,1
515,"My girlfriend and I often have tickle fights to be fun and playful. During the tickle fights, we often tickle each other’s feet. I always have bare feet while she is always wearing socks. We are often at her house where I do not have socks to put on, and removing socks is easier than getting socks to put on. I asked my girlfriend to remove her socks during the tickle fights but she did not and she got annoyed. Was it wrong for me to ask my girlfriend to remove her socks during the tickle fights?",03May2019,0
516,"I'm gonna add a little bit of backstory here, I'm a fourteen year old bisexual female, I figured out my sexuality not too long ago and it's been hard on me, I live in my grandmother's house with my mother.  I have a mom and a stepdad which their marriage on the brink of divorce, along with a stepbrother, and no real dad since he died about a year ago because of a Hurricane.

My mom is kind of a hard person to explain, she has a bad temper and I found out a few months ago that she has a bipolar disorder, she gets angry easily, but I know she gets that from my grandmother, she gets mad even FASTER, and over stupid shit too, once she kicked me and my stepbrother out because my stepbrother was in the house and she didn't want any trace of my stepfather in the house, she HATES him, but I can't blame her, I hate him too.

I think this all started because I didn't 'come out' properly, I was sort of forced to? I know that sounds bad but I mean like- I didn't do it in my own time, I didn't knock on my parents door, sit them down and tell them about it, my 'coming out story' If you could call it that was different.


Once about possibly a year ago I was dating this girl, let's call her Lizzy, I met her at school, but she moved away, we exchanged numbers so we could still keep in touch. For a time I wasn't allowed on my phone for a few months, I can't exactly remember why, but it wasn't anything horrendous, I think it had to do with my grades.

I secretly used to use my phone sometimes once my mother went to sleep or was out of the house, I know I know, not a very smart or good thing to do, but sometimes I just needed the relief of being on my phone, my mom had also banned me from drawing along with my phone, and drawing was one of my main ways to ease up, and calm down, and I was going through a hard time due to the death of my dad being pretty recent. I was a very anxious teenager with barely any friends around me, since where I live everyone around me speaks Spanish and ONLY Spanish or prefers Spanish and it's rare to find people who LIKE to speak English. I know Spanish, but I just get self conscious over my lisp which gets even more noticable when I speak Spanish and my accent with the language even though I've lived here my entire life, I just speak better in English, period.

So one night, around 1AM, it was a weekend if I remember, I figured out where my mom had been hiding my phone, so I hid behind the door and used it for hours until I heard my mothers car pull up, it's easy to know when it's HER car because it always goes 'beep' when she parks, I quickly turned off the phone all the way and put it back and pretend to be asleep, but I think either she must have heard me or saw something different with where she had put the phone and checked it, it was warm, my mistake.

My mom grabbed me by my hair and dragged me over to her room and threw me to the ground, screaming at me to explain why the phone was warm, studdered out some bullshit lie that I hadn't been using the phone, but she knows was lying and smacked me and yelled at me to show her what I had been doing, so I nervously unlocked my phone, by then my grandmother had walked into the room and asked what was going on, My mother made me open the text app and look through texts, I wasn't texting at the time though, I was just watching YouTube videos and drawing secretly in a drawing app with a stylus, but she stumbled upon my best friends and I, who we shall remain nameless, chats.

As she scrolled up, in one of his messages, directed to be read 
""So how's your girlfriend?""

I knew I had fucked up.

My mom stared at the message with a cold stare, then asked about it, which I tried to lie again that he meant ""girlfriend"" as in best friend that's a girl, that he was gay (he actually was) and he said things like that (she sometimes believes in stereotypes, she can't look at a girl with short hair without saying ""she's totally a lesbian."")

But my mom knew I was lying, and made me tell her the truth, so now I had to come out to my mother and grandmother, at the moment a shaking and crying mess, that I was bisexual.

My mom stood there for a moment and replied with.
""So you're a lesbian?""
I thought that she didn't know what bisexuality was, so I tried to explain her what bisexuality was, that it was when a person likes woman and men, but it seemed like she just wouldn't accept it and asked me if I liked guys OR girls, that I could only pick one.

I kept telling her over and over that I liked both equally, and she made me show her what my girlfriend looked like, so I did, I told her that she was a very nice person and very funny, and she understood me and actually liked me for me.
But she just scolded me for dating a girl behind her back and that I was just going through a phase, but then after I told her that I wasn't, she got really angry and began saying things to me that I can't even type out.
So I cried myself to sleep that night, knowing that my mother hated me for who I was.

For weeks my mom said terrible things about my sexuality and Lizzy, she said things like how I was a dirty lesbian, and that Lizzy was an ugly whore, and that really hurt me, and so after a while I got sick of the insults and broke up with Lizzy to try and stop them, which they did for a little bit before she started using my sexuality as something to be used against me when she got mad.

Example; about a couple weeks ago actually, my mother had gotten mad at me for not dressing fast enough (even though I still had to wait half an hour in the living room while she put on three dresses before she finally fucking chose one) and she had just went on rambling in the car about how much of a dissapointment I was to the family, about how I was going to live in the streets or work in McDonalds, how I was a, and I'm straight up fucking quoting her.
""A slutty lesbian who liked dykes and wanted to lick their cunt, oh I love their cunt, just lick lick lick""
She said even worse things I can't even type without feeling angry or wanting to cry, I was so angry at the moment I wanted to punch her right in her face, but she was my mother, and three times stronger than I am, so I was quiet the entire ride to school even if she kept bothering me to speak up, then talked over me when I tried to speak.

She's done that so many times to me now, nothing physical like abuse, but she HAS hit me, telling me terrible and hurtful things about my sexuality and making fun of the girls around me. (which are just friends)

But one of the things that pisses me off most is that she's never done any of these things to my stepbrother, who is gay.
She's never shamed him for who he was or how he acts, she's never hit him, she's never said anything hurtful to him, she seems to like him more than me, and I just don't understand why. And not to be offensive or anything,but he's the...flamboyant type of gay, the one with the sort or high-pitched voice and uses their hands alot to express themselves, like, if you see him, you instantly know he's gay.

This just really ticks me off though, my brother can wear a shirt with a rainbow and it's FINE, But I can't wear a rainbow bracelet because ""It tells everyone you're lesbian?"" I'm not a lesbian! And I only wore it that one day because I didn't have my watch and I feel uncomfortable without something on my wrist.

My BROTHER can buy LGBTQ+ pins with pins like ""STRAIGHT out of the closet"" because he's QUIRKY like that with HER money, but I can't buy a bisexual pin with my OWN?
My mom doesn't allow me to buy anything that has LGBTQ+ because it ""tells people I'm gay"" 
I just can't fucking believe it sometimes 

I'm leaving a lot more things she's said and done out of this because I don't want this to be hideously long, but honestly, what kind of hypocrisy is THIS?! Why can my stepbrother be himself around anyone, but I can't tell the rest of my family that I'm bisexual?

TDLR; My mom accepts my brothers sexuality, but not mine.

What do I do to make her understand and not say these terrible things to me? How can I convince her to let me be myself?",03May2019,0
517,I had this teacher in my previous school year and I did horrible in her class mostly due to lack of effort and care. I’m in my senior year of high school now and I’ve been trying my best to pick up my game. We were given a recent assignment where we had to take notes on a series of documentary videos each 1 hour long. After the notes we had to answer questions regarding the video. I honestly could care less about this class and if I’m not passionate about something I’ll have trouble recalling learnt information. I completed and handed in an assignment and my answers were written as I was watching the video and taking strips of information and placing them in my answers. After she marked mine she called me up and had tried quizzing me on my work (she’s done this before). She’s suspicious I’m copying off someone and getting answers. So I give some of my written information but I can’t remember it all which I don’t think is too unreasonable to believe since not everyone has a strong memory. She tells me how it’s recent and I should remember. She keeps fuelling this suspicion of hers and it’s pissing me off have to justify it every time what should I do?,03May2019,5

524,"I started working there 6 months ago, I quit to go traveling for a few months. I came back 3 months ago and have been working there since. My manager liked me and I did good (it’s a sales job), so he hired me again. I am doing better than I did before now, and out of 6 people who work there, I am about in the middle. (The location I work at is among the top in the company most months, so being 50% at my store is still a good thing) out of the part timers, I am on the top. It pays WELL. I am in college and am saving up a lot of money and need to in order to do what I want in life, no other job around me pays as good as this one does, so getting another job is an option but I don’t want to do that unless it comes down to it. 

When I first started, I was not full time. I was working around 20-30 hrs a week and I never asked to be full time, my manager even told me he was going to make me full time but I said I don’t want to because I’m starting school. I start school in a few days and now I check the schedule and I have 40 hours on the new schedules. I talk to my manager and ask him if I can get less hours, like 30 or so. He gets angry when I ask that and says yep you will definitely get less hours don’t worry about that, don’t worry about getting too little hours. On the next schedule I have 18, which is ok but still not enough, but I didnt complain because I did ask for it, not that little, but I did as for less. 

Today we were working together, and I feel like he started the conversation out of pettiness, he said “you know everyone works full time and goes to college full time?” And said I will get the hours of the lowest performer when he was still working here (14 or so hours). WTF! I hit all my quotas and am in the top 25% in the company, while my other part time coworkers are in the bottom 50-75%, and on the new schedule where I have 18 hours they have 40! 

My manager is very competitive and we used to get along until I brought it up. I tried to talk to him and ask him why he’s mad at me but he just got very passive aggressive. How do you talk to someone like this? I feel like he’s being unfair.

       We had been together for over a year and he had previously cheated but I forgave him (I’m young and dumb i know). This lead to constant insecurity/jealousy and it had turned toxic. I was never vocal about these things until the final week of our relationship. That was wrong, I should have ended the relationship when I had first found out a few months before. We never fought, it was completely internal self-hatred for not feeling good enough. At the end of our relationship, I got suspicious for about a week and Sunday night I had saw a picture of him kissing another girl on social media. (What the fuck cover your tracks better). He broke up with me because I was “toxic” for getting mad. I was going to end it anyways, but whatever act like you did nothing wrong. I never berated him or lashed out. I said he was inconsiderate and just wished him the best. 
In my classes that week, a girl, (let’s call her M) comes up to me and says that i “have some serious problems and need help,” and proceeded to tell me I was abusive. M claimed my ex had been telling everyone he had only been staying with me because he didn’t want me to kill myself. I opened up once about not seeing a way out of different personal situations to him long ago. I never ever said I’d kill myself if he left, not once, never even said I was suicidal. He told everyone I have texted him non-stop since Monday(4 days ago) calling him names and being threatening. I have not contacted or even spoke to him. I continued to have other people share a similar story about what he had said about me through the day. I’ve never talked or even thought about suicide and I definitely never said anything bad about him. 
This has caused several people to say hurtful comments and I lost friends. Very quickly. My friends and family say to do nothing because I graduate in a few weeks but we are going to the same college for the same degree. If I’m not acting out of anger or saying anything bad about him to others, they say people will see the truth. I don’t see it that way. People have quickly took his side over something that just shouldn’t be this way. I did not ever want to hurt him or make him feel trapped within that relationship. When he broke it off, I had said I wished him the best. I haven’t even told anyone he cheated. 
It’s serious and I’m afraid it could take to social media. Suicide is not taken as a joke in my community and I do not want to deal with that backlash either. What can I do to prevent this? I’m at such a loss.

My former boss/firm owner has given me two amazing references that land me the job. Just yesterday he gave me the second or third one. 

He used to ask me to visit them, he’s asked me a couple times and I never went. Last time he asked me to visit was in October. I called him yesterday to thank him for the reference and we had a 3 minute conversation. It went great, kinda awkward, and we didn’t know what to say but we both said we’re doing great. 

Side note: we always had an intense relationship like we were attracted to each other but we were in relationships, but this doesn’t really matter but maybe it adds to why I’m nervous. 

I just want to know that it’s totally normal to stop bye and say hello. When I worked there they had weekly visitors so I know it’s not a huge interruption because they loved having their friends/people they work with visit. I’m all worried about what I should even say.

529,"College student here. This semester was really rough on me and I have my last final of the semester (online) due today. However, given my current grade and what I need bare minimum to pass I would need a 104% on the test. 

Given this information I have been debating just not even stressing myself over it because whether I get a 0% or a 100% I still won't pass. I plan on retaking it next semester (given that the program I am in doesn't kick me for a low GPA but that is a whole other issue).

I understand the material now but I struggled all semester which is why I have such a low grade to begin with. I just finally caught on too late but I know going into this class again I will be just fine.

531,"What to do when your spouse doesn't take your medical problems seriously? I'm legally blind and can't drive, but my husband often won't take me to the doctor.  I have serious medical issues, which require medication, regular labs, and seeing my doctor every few months. Sometimes, I run out of my medication and can't get refills until I get seen, and this can be dangerous. 

My husband acts like my medical issues are no big deal, even acts competitive and jealous, often bringing up some minor medical issue he had long ago. Sometimes, he'll even develop the same medical problem. I don't understand this. Perhaps Munchausen syndrome?

Every time we get my prescriptions, he complains about the cost though we have insurance and my medications are relatively inexpensive.

Last year, I had a bad fall down some stairs, and he wouldn't take me to the ER. It turned out that I had a cracked sternum, a cut to the bone on my knee, and a really messed up foot that turned partially black. All through it, he kept talking about a minor fall he'd had on the same stairs as if he couldn't understand that my fall was much more serious.

I told him two weeks ago that I needed to get seen as I had a bad lung infection with shortness of breath and wheezing, and he wouldn't take me. Yesterday, all morning while he was working on a house project, I gasped for air. It got so bad that I could barely breathe, and he finally took me to an urgent care clinic--but not until he was finished with the project. I was diagnosed with pneumonia.  The doctor was angry, and wanted to know why I hadn't gotten seen sooner. I made up some excuse as I was embarrassed. He wanted to admit me, but agreed to let me go home with some mega-antibiotics and steroids, following a breathing treatment.

This are just two examples of many, but I can't quit thinking about how that morning I was wheezing and struggling to breathe, and my husband really didn't seem concerned about me or how serious my condition was.",03May2019,1

But this dude says the most brutal shit to me that it honestly hurts my feelings... as much of a pussy thing that may sound like. I’m insecure and have social anxiety so any time some one says shit to me like that, it doesn’t feel great.

He basically makes fun of my appearance, saying shit like I’ll never get laid and how ugly I am. Today it got worse when he found out my parents are divorced. He just laughed and said “I’m so sorry, I’d divorce my wife if I had you.” That honestly really... it really didn’t sink well with me :(

I dont know how I’ll tell him to shut up without him being like “What, did I hurt your feelings?” Or some shit like that. I also don’t think making fun of him will work because he has the “You’re ugly” advantage over me.

Any advice?",03May2019,15

536,"So, I'm having a hard time finding something I am passionate about. 
I've found I like gaming, but I just don't get excited and invested like everyone else. I mean, i play a ton of games, but I rarely fond anything interesting enough to delve into fully, and truly understand and get into.
But this also applies to everything else I do... not just gaming.
I find somwthing I like, or enjoy doing, and after a while, the fun and novelty wears off. 
I think this may stem from the fact that i need a lot of variety in my life. I can't stand doing the same thing over and over again. I lose interest after a while. 
But I try to push myself to keep with it, which helps me stay with whatever it is a bit longer, but that only lasts a month at most.
I want something that makes me feel alive and sparks something inside. But I have no clue what it is. Even a hobby, or something outside of work, ANYTHING... i'm 22, and I've never had something like this.

I usually end up eventually drifting off at somewhere between 4-6 in the morning, and sleeping until 10-12, and taking a nap sometime during the day. My first year in college just ended a month ago, so I don't really have much to do all day (my classes were all in the afternoon last term, which surely contributed to my sleep habits), but it's honestly annoying and it really interferes with my drive to do anything other than lie in my bed. I've tried staying awake for over 24 hours and trying to go to sleep at the right time afterward, but that hasn't been very effective for me. I know using my laptop before bed doesn't help, but honestly even after I put it away I lie awake for hours, so I don't think it really makes much of a difference. What I really want is to be able to consistently fall asleep at a normal time (10-12 at night) and wake up at a normal time (6-8 in the morning).

544,"I got him last November to help me with my anxiety and the manic ups and downs of my bipolar. My therapist said I qualified for a service animal, but wrote me the letter for an ESA because “people bring them everywhere anyways” which completely dodging my request to be evaluated for a service animal. Trying to start the process, but it’s not really going anywhere. My fear comes from the fact that he isn’t really trained out side of basic commands and he has a huge issue with barking. He barks at anyone at the door until they come in, when he hears people doing yard work, people playing outside, and he like to rip apart toys (mostly if he thinks they’re his). It feels like he’s causing me more anxiety that what I had originally. My mom gets mad about him and yells at me for it making things way worse. If I move to a dorm I just don’t want to feel like I’m inconveniencing my roommate(s) with a dog and all his dog stuff while I’m there and while I’m at my classes. I still have the summer to figure things out, but I really don’t know what to do. I’ve grown attached to him, but he causes me so much stress. It feels like every option just hurts me in a different way. I was told if I was approved for a service animal then he could train to be one, but that’s all still up in the air so I’m not seeing that as an option at the moment. If it does happen I just hope the training will help him with his barking and general not listening... I just feel like none of this would even be an issue if I was taken seriously when I first got the letter. A medically prescribed dog (that isn’t trained to help) can’t help me with these mental issues, but the therapist just saw it as a “I want to bring a dog with me everywhere” sort of thing, making everything worse in the process.",03May2019,0

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

548,I’m currently a freshman student in high school and everyone in my school is choosing their schedules for the next year today.

However I’m not sure if I should take Algebra 2/Trig Honors or just stick to Algebra 2. I’ve gotten all A’s for my last two trimesters of Algebra 1 Honors but I feel like Algebra 2/Trig is gonna be pretty tough. I asked my friend about it who takes Algebra 2 Honors and he said it was hell for him (and he’s a pretty smart guy). I also asked my Algebra 1 Honors teacher and he said that I should take Algebra 2/Trig Honors but I’m worried I won’t be able to handle it on top of all my other honors classes. I enjoy math but I’m not extremely confident in Algebra. Oh yea I forgot to mention but I’m planning to go into the medical field so yea I have to double up in math but I’m just not sure if Honors would be beneficial for me or not.

551,"That title is a mouthful, but I want to make sure I don’t miss anything out because this situation is nuts.   I’m typing on my phone on my way to work so please excuse any typos or formatting.   
I’ll try to keep it relatively short but there is a lot to unpack. I posted in r/relationships before but it didn’t get a lot of responses and things have kind of escalated.   
Basically, I was helping “William” (43?) do his diving courses and reading the textbooks to him as he has trouble reading. It was all fine and dandy, but throughout the weeks he started to get clingy and said I (28F) was his best friend. To be clear, I am not a full-time dive instructor, the dive shop hired me so I could get experience.   
William told me that he had been looking for a dive buddy for almost two years, and I felt bad for him because I assumed it was due to his learning disabilities no one wanted to dive with him.   
I continued to help him and although he did things occasionally that would annoy me (for example, going into the dive shop when we didn’t have plans to meet and I wasn’t there, then expecting me to come in). He would message me via Facebook everyday wanting to get together, to do things other than diving such as swimming or getting coffee. I don’t mind occasionally getting coffee with him but I knew pretty quickly that I had to plant firmer boundaries. I explained to him that  I want a professional relationship, and that I am not available all the time because I work another job.   
I asked him to stop messaging me every morning. I told him to stop messaging me every morning. I was patient, then polite, then firm.   
After lessons, he would follow me to the store or get the same bus as me even though he lives the opposite way of me.   
When I was too busy to talk or it was the morning (or if I just didn’t want to talk because I don’t have to) he would say he is upset/hurt/ask why he doesn’t have any friends who care about him.    
It got increasingly difficult because at first I responded that we are friends but I’m busy, and that we can see each other for classes. That didn’t help things because I think me saying we are friends made him even clingier.   
I told the dive shop I need to take a step back from assisting on courses as I need to make money. I have been stressed from my living situation, and the issue with William didn’t help things. Some of the advice I got when I posted about this before said to tell the dive shop, which I didn’t do until last night because I am an awkward person and this is a new situation.   
After I told him I wouldn’t be assisting on courses except for SOMETIMES helping him with reading when I have time, he told me that he isn’t comfortable around men because he was sexually assaulted 5 times by one man. Obviously, that revelation was uncomfortable to hear and shocking because I don’t know him well at all. He said he was upset and asked what he did wrong, even though I told him I was leaving the dive shop because I needed to make real money.   
After some thought, I agreed to help him as time permitted. We were supposed to be going diving on Saturday. Originally he wanted to go today but I am working.  
Anyway, to the **the tea** if you made it this far: he showed up my work yesterday. Now, my work is outside by ships and sometimes people go there to check out the boats which was his excuse. It would have been believable except he came to my work, stood around when I said I was busy, then left. Then, when I looked “less busy” he came back. Needless to say, I was peeved. It was first full day back and I was there with someone on her first day. I had to explain who William was, luckily she is my bosses girlfriend so I don’t think it’ll be an issue.  
I sent William a message saying that showing at my work was UNACCEPTABLE and that I will not be helping him on courses any more. He tried saying he was just there to see the ships, but as I said he came back after customers were gone.   
He then went onto say that no one cares about him, that he has no friends etc etc and that he was going to “end his life at 7pm” (he didn’t, thankfully). I told him I’d call the police since he’s threatening suicide. Mostly the messages were just him being dramatic and in my opinion, manipulative.   
My coworker messaged me and told me that HE CAME BACK when I wasn’t there later in the evening. So obviously that made me think, hmm maybe this situation is worse than I realized.   
I told my sister what was going on and she told me he sent her a friend request a few days ago. I have her listed as my sister.   
This morning, he messaged me saying he is going to talk to my boss and city hall (?) and that his sister (whom I’ve never met) is mad at me and is going to message me.  
I have him blocked on Facebook now. Now I’m stressed that he’s going to show up today at my work again or talk to my boss (which I don’t think will be mad or anything so long as it doesn’t affect sales). I’m working alone today but there are heaps of people around always. Like, I don’t know if I should be worried that he’s a stalker.    
What should I do? How do I navigate this? Am I the asshole here? I’m sure I forgot to add some information but hopefully from what I wrote, you can see why this has been an ongoing issue. My sister and mum have said to call the police if he shows up again today, which will honestly suck because that won’t look good. The advice I really need is how to deal with this so that he understands I am not his friend, I am not going be teaching him diving, and that he can’t threaten to kill himself because of it. I was way too lenient and ignored red flags because I wanted to be kind and to give him a chance to further his ability as a diver.  i ^^am ^^an ^^^idiot

This top choice was one I was relying on because it was basically the only program I wanted to apply to. It was an one of a kind program that's hard to find in the neighboring cities. Because of this competition was high for it and it was very limited enrollment. I got into my backups but to be honest I'm not happy because it's not something I would enjoy doing.

But for my sakes I have little to no friends in high school since my other friends dipped the year prior so I have to fend for myself.

A week before College starts I'll be having an orientation week to get to know where classes are and all of that.

I'm not that social per say, I'm the kid where I just sit under a basement and just hop on the computer and hang out with online friends and rarely come out of my so called ""Man cave"" my social life at this point for meeting new people is just a mess. I rarely go out and after seeing all the guys having a date and getting the ""Movie ending"" unlike me. My love life is complicated it'll take me another post just explaining it but long story short I'm stuck in the friend zone and my ex is currently dating another guy which I am completely fine with. I moved on, but now I believe that it's time for me to get my social life back on track.

The Trainer (he's Chinese, around 25 years old, if that matters) got really mad at me because i talked with others while we waited to train (it was after the main training where every group trains for themselves whilst going in circles, so every group has time and room to train) suddenly the trainer comes up to me, he looks really mad and told us how he never was so angry in two years. I was really scared, because i never saw him that mad (usually he's really friendly, kind and nice). He asked if we had understood, we said yes and he went away. I felt really guilty for being disrespectfull and went quiet instantly, i told myself to never talk outside of official breaks, when the trainer comes back and tells us, that this behaviour doesnt belong here and we have to leave. In the changing room we discuss on how to say sorry and decide to change clothes and go to him to do just that. I excuse myself, he turns around and looks still really mad, i tell him that im really sorry for interrupting the training and being disrespectful and that it wont happen again. After that he just looks away and goes somewhere else.

559,"For a long time, probably 8 months, I chased this one girl. She never ended up liking me back, and eventually she did something that caused us not to talk for a while and it wasn't what she did, it was the fact she did nothing to make up for it. It made me dislike her so much. A complete 180 from my previous feelings towards her. I sat right next to her in a class, and she'd talk to my other guy friend sitting on the other side of her (he has a girlfriend) even though I'm the guy who does all this stuff for her. We were close too. She told her best friend, who became my friend, that she wanted to go to prom with me senior year. No one is there for me when I felt down, and I wasn't making it painfully obvious, but even I could tell that I didn't feel right. No one else could? No one ever asked me ""are you okay?"" besides this one girl who sat behind me in that one class who I'm only decent friends with. My friend that this girl always talks to literally doesn't even say hi to me when he walks into class anymore. He just talks to this girl I was obsessed with (again, this guy has a girlfriend). They don't stop talking. This was even before me and the girl stopped talking. We eventually started talking again, but it didn't feel the same to me so I basically just started giving one word answers to conversations we tried having, and now we are back to not talking. Before we stopped talking for the second time, she even told me that she was in between two colleges because if she went to this one college she would room with the guy she talks to all class (WHO AGAIN, HAS A GIRLFRIEND)! I don't understand how cold someone can be. I'm over it really, but everyone's sort of gone. As of the last few months, I haven't wanted any human interaction. I just want to be left alone, but I didn't verbally state that to anyone until yesterday when I was catching up with someone. My guy friend she always talks to? Never texted me once asking if I'm okay. Sorry if this is really confusing. Basically this girl turned out to be a fucking dick, and I always used to think ""damn, whoever ends up with this girl is going to be one lucky guy"" but now all I think is ""I will feel so sorry for whoever dates this shitty ass human."" So yeah, I don't even have a solid friend group anymore. She sorta kept it together to be honest but I still sort of talk to a few of them. I really wanted to go to prom, but who would I take now? I know I stated earlier that I just wanted to be alone, but I really think I'm just afraid to be close to anyone. I feel like it's my fault. Deep down I'd love a girl who liked the same things as me, and I'm not trying to make this sound like I'm a hopeless romantic. Life goes on, I'm 18 haha. I can't go to prom with any of her friends either because she will be there. I don't want to see her face ever again, and as soon as schools out I'm blocking her on literally everything lmao.

But I made new friends too, other friends that (despite the short amount of time) I have also very much confided in. Other friends became very close friends. For her, it hasn’t been that easy to reach out and have the same close friendships with other people. I understand her side of things though, because her parents are helicopters, meanwhile I have my freedom. Point is, the two of us are at very different stages in our lives. I love her all the same yes, but when I compare the friendship I have with the ones in my city, to my friendship with her, I find myself more mature with my newest friends. She’s still great to be around, but it’s just not the same. 

Anyways, I’m asking for advice because last night we called and she shared a lot of things. I’d already know she was depressed, and I was there to encourage her going to the doctor - which she finally did. But even back then, I’d felt so exhausted because every time she’d call me in distress, I’d tell her the exact same things, but then she’d still keep wallowing in despair. Don’t get me wrong, I understand where she’s coming from. I was depressed too, and she knows that. But I never relied on others to make me happy. I had to kick my ass to the curb and beat the hell out of depression because I was sick and tired of feeling numb. With her though, she’s aware of being in a rut, but yet all she says is that it’s hard, and that she doesn’t know what to do. And I tell her that I don’t know either, because it’s her life. I tell her the things I did, and I tell her there’s hope because other people have gone through it and beat it. And yet she wallows in despair again without thinking of how to better herself. 

In addition to this, last night she told me she doesn’t know what would happen if she lost me. And that I’m the only she has left. And that she doesn’t know what would happen if she downward spiralled. 

Am I wrong in thinking that this is a lot of pressure to put on someone? I feel like I’m contractually bound to staying her friend because if not, then she might do something to hurt herself. 

I like being there for people, offering advice when I can, listening if that’s all I can do. But I am so fucking exhausted of having to be there every time something triggers her. Of trying to tell her the same things over and over again, only for her to continue dragging herself down. 

I’m so tired, and I don’t know what to do anymore. She’s been a great friend, and she has been there for me in times I needed too. But now it’s getting to a point where I feel like I’m not allowed to label anyone else ‘best friend’ or else that’ll trigger her too.",03May2019,3
565,"My friend got a message from a stranger the other night, and I don’t know the details as to why, but this person is suicidal. When I mean suicidal, I don’t mean “I wanna die lol” I mean he has stated multiple times, “I am going to kill myself in 2 days.” 

1. I know nothing about this person, I tried getting a phone number, or a name but nothing. 
2. Only my friend is currently aware of the situation, I only know its family issues and it’s obviously extremely stressful.
3. I have sent the dude resources, but my friend and I are both teenagers, and my friend is autistic (he has Aspergers) so we aren’t the best for this situation and we aren’t entirely sure why this person has asked him. 
4. He has said he will commit suicide in 2 days and 1 hour, that was yesterday. He will only talk to my friend. 

I have no idea what to do. I have no information to bring to the hotline or police except for his username. I am concerned, more for my friends mental health if this person does go through with it.

567,"So, I have a half-sister (we'll call her C) we've only met once when I was very young and my father tried to see C many times when she was growing up but having 3 other kids he was raising and being denied the opportunity by C's mother to visit or talk with C my father never built much of a relationship with C until recent years through facebook he finally talked to her a little bit.  


I don't know a lot about C's life growing up but I know she has had a lot of drug problems (her mother/stepfather do as well), homelessness, and her kids taken away from her because of things of that nature. C only ever contacted my father rarely and sometimes it was only for money. Her SO died of an OD 2 or so years ago and she's supposedly clean since then. Last my father heard she lived somewhere in Maryland and had a vehicle but she calls out of the blue last night apparently living in DC with her ""friend"" who was apparently trying to pimp her out, in a house with some guy and has nothing to her name. C claimed to have been paying rent to the guy but he supposedly skipped out and she was hit with an eviction notice. In desperation after being told by her family and friends in Maryland and I assume DC that she couldn't stay with them, she calls my father in tears saying she doesn't have anywhere to go and her ""friend"" kicked her out of the house they're getting evicted out of.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my father broke and told her should could come down (we live in the Carolinas) and my grandmother happened to be going to Virginia this weekend. My issue is, none of us are really comfortable with this at all. My brother who owns the house we stay in reluctantly agreed, but we don't know C at all. She is essentially a stranger my father invited out of guilt for not having been there for her when she was younger and seeing her current situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a 4 bedroom house but all 4 rooms are occupied, My brother and I use the living room for work so we honestly don't have anywhere for her to sleep. We don't know if she's still into drugs, based on her current situation I probably wouldn't be surprised. We don't have means of transportation for her unless my father drove her around and we live in a small out of the way town. My father is on a fixed disability income so he can't afford to buy her food and other necessities. I'm currently transitioning into my new job and don't have disposable income, my brother is busy paying on the house and my grandmother is keeping afloat and soon moving out.  


Aside from not being able to afford her extra expenses like I said before we really don't know C and I'll be honest I really don't think we trust her. I just don't know how to approach the situation, if she comes down I've already talked with my brother and he says he'd want her gone in under 3-4 months, which judging by the little bit I know of her history still wouldn't amount to much and would only burden us more I feel. I know we probably sound selfish but I don't know how to approach this situation here.",03May2019,1

569,"Sorry this might be a bit long. I am a second year student and recently a friend in my group confessed she had feelings for me. We both share all the same friends, have all the same courses and stay in the same student accommodation(res) . So we see each other a lot. We are always making fun of each other(mostly me making fun of her) but I do this with all my friends. About 2 weeks ago we were walking back to res together and as usual we were joking with each other. Well, we passed her room and I said ""see you later""  and proceeded to walk off to my room. About ten minutes later she knocked on my door. I was expecting some kind of joke at my expense instead, as soon as I opened the door she said ""I have feelings for you"". Like an idiot all I could say was ""oh"".

I honestly didn't see it coming(I can be a bit clueless sometimes tho). Anyway I didn't want to be an ass and just slam the door in her face so I invited her in to talk about it. This was a mistake because we didn't talk just sat in silence for 5 minutes and she left on a very awkward note. The thing is I've never thought of this girl in that light and I have no feeling for her, not like that. 

I really don't want to hurt her( or make my life unbearably awkward). I've had to reject friends before in high school and it always lead to us talking to each other less to the point where we almost never spoke. I don't want that to happen again. To make things more complicated, this year every night out our group went on this girl ended the night in tears. After a couple of nights out, I sat down with her to let her know I would be there for her. I found out that she thinks she has some form of PTSD and when she drinks sometimes she just has the feelings rushing back from a traumatic event. 

After telling her I would be a friend she could come to if she struggled with this, I don't want to turn into the guy who rejected her. 

What would be the best way to diffuse this situation. I don't expect to come out of this situation without the relationship dynamic changing a little, but what would be the best thing to do? 

TL;DR - Friend like me, I don't like her but don't want to hurt her. Pls help",03May2019,1

572,"Short introduction for guys that don't know that specific condition. 
Misophonia is the Hate of noises. 
Like chewing loudly, eating chips and crisps, loud breathing, crying babies and literally everything at certain times.
And yes it is an illness medics are aware of so I'm not making that one up. 

The reason I'm writing that here is because I'm done. My girl just ate a bowl of chips and I almost cried of pain. I tried to cover my ears, tried to ignore it but eventually she saw what I was doing. Left the room to eat her freaking terror chips somewhere else. 

In social environment I'm really good at avoiding noises that are a pain in my ass. Best noise canceling headphones for the safety of all my people around me, my little own office at the company and so on. 

In the last months my illness went from annoying to bad. Colleague of mine has the habit to lick his fingers after eating, could punch him in the face for doing it because that noise is pure cancer to my ears. Please don't misunderstand me, I've never ever hit someone, but it feels like I'm close to tripping over the edge of no return. 

Worst thing about all of this is that no one believes me. ""Hey you are eating as loud as I'm doing and I don't want to punch you.""""Keep your shit together, it's only a little bit of noice. Get used to it.""

How do you guys explain something to people that aren't aware of anything like that? How do you explain something to someone without being able to give him the same feeling? I hope that I can do better but that's so difficult and I definitely need advice before things get worse.",03May2019,5

576,"So I am currently freaking out right now and I am sorry if this is sloppy but I have no clue what to do. Yesterday my ex sent me a video of a pregnancy test that seemed to be positive (had a faint line). The thing is yes we had sex (only once), but she was on birth control and I did not finish inside of her so there is almost no chance that she is pregnant. I told her to take another one which came out negative, but she insists that she drank too much water and it messed up the test.

She also has been changing the story quite often where I asked her how many tests she took and she said she took one before the positive test so I made her take another one (this is the one that came out negative) she then said that this was only the second test she took (she now said she did not take the first test before the positive one). She is now not wanting to go get tested at a clinic and she is blaming it on being too tired. She is acting super childish and she also does not seem too concerned. She also lied about being on the birth control shot she said she had it done, but now she is saying that she was only on the pill (I dont even know if I believe that)

I have no clue what to do she is about an hour and a half away from me so its not like I could just drive over there whenever I want. We are both 18 and I may end up telling my parents about everything, but if she isn't pregnant I would rather not tell my parents because I don't want to bring them into this.",03May2019,3

579,"So, I've been working at this place as a side gig for two years now, and recently the shifts got moved around so I started to work together with this girl. I started talking to her, thinking nothing of it, but then I realized we could hold a conversation pretty well. Usually we'd chat for about ten minutes at work, seeing as it's normally pretty busy, I generally can't find more time than that to ask her how she's doing or whatnot.

Only a few weeks ago did I start develop some slight feelings for her. I wasn't head over heels for her, but I was somewhat convinced she was also slightly interested in me, with the remarks she gave me, jokes she made around me, she wasn't scared of making physical contact either, did so pretty often (albeit jokingly), like punching my arm or holding my hand. 

So, yesterday I finally built up the courage to ask her. Since she usually drives away right after work, or hangs around with a few other people, I never really have a good chance to ask her out. But yesterday was the perfect moment. We were chatting for 30 minutes or so, after everyone has already left. Realizing I probably won't get another chance like this again, I asked her the million dollar question: ""What do you say we go out for a drink sometime? We chat pretty well and I'd like to get to know you better.""

Her first response wasn't yes, or no. She just looked at me with a coy smile on her face for a second or so. Then she asked me: ""What are your intentions?"". Not ominous or afraid or anything either, it felt like she was genuinely curious. So I explained that I think she's a great girl and I would love to talk more to her, perhaps in a more comfortable environment. Just as friends, or colleagues. I didn't want anything special to happen just yet. She responded with saying: ""I think you're a really cool and stand-up guy, but I don't want to give you false hope. It's happened to me in the past..."" (She didn't elaborate on that, didn't ask.) ""...and I've always had trouble being blunt. So I'll have to think about it."" ""That's better than a no, at least."" I replied.

That seemed like an appropriate time for me to leave. We made some small chat closing out, and I went on my way. Now I'm sitting here, a day later, wondering what I should do. I've asked a couple girls out in my life, but I've never gotten a ""maybe"" as a response. I'm not sure what to do. I usually see her once a week, and now I don't know if I should raise it again, or just drop it. The way she responded to me made me feel as if she genuinely wanted to think about it. I just don't know what to expect now.

So, the question is: what have Redditors done in these situations? I've asked friends, and I'm getting very mixed signals from every source. I just don't really know what to do now. I want closure here, and just dropping it entirely seems off.",03May2019,1

I was an infant sitting on the couch and my dad said: “Wanna watch Star Wars?” 

He popped the blu-Rey in and I was dazzled by the special effects. Then I immediately fell in love when Lucas was in the Death Star cantina and met the dreaded space pirate Chewbacka the Wooky. He was not all dreadful though he was kinda cool and looked like my dog Ricardo. Anyways I watched that movie and many years later in an apple store far, far away....

I was jolted with sorrow when my Apple Watch buzzed and there was a picture of Chewkie with a RIP next to it. I downloaded the headline to my phone and skimmed the comments section of the buzzfeed article.

I’m still crying now and I’m even more upset my favorite tall doggo won’t be in any more Star Trek movies. How can you actually replace someone who wears an entire full body suit? Let me know your solution, Einstein’s of reddit. Until then I’ll be live-streaming my RIP reactions and crying a lot.

582,"I am a 17-year-old living in Northern Ireland. For a long time, I wanted to get into politics. I was never happy with how things were in this country, and wanted to make a change. With the local elections results trickling in from Wednesday, the same old parties have the majority. The same parties that caused a political stalemate resulting in us holding the record for the country going the longest time without a government (still ongoing) (Guinness doesn't recognise NI as an individual country) 

Recently, I decided fuck it. If I can't make a difference here, I will make a difference elsewhere. I would absolutely love to volunteer at home or abroad over summer to help with real issues. Problem is, anything I can find is incredibly expensive. To me, the thing organisations get from me volunteering is me volunteering. I shouldn't have to *pay* up to thousands of pounds just to go plant trees for a week. I need help finding opportunities.

A few things. Number one, I actually don't mind paying a small amount. I am 17, I can't afford to be spending hundreds, but I reckon I could scrape together £100-300 if needs be. Number two, my main passions are preserving wildlife (marine life particularly), reforestation, cleaning the environment and battling poverty. Although I am open to helping in *any* way, if it's optional I'd prefer to go with one of these areas. Number three, I am not just interested in short-term volunteering projects. I am a member of the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, and would love to get involved in more international things like this, where it's a sort of ongoing membership type thing as opposed to just a one-time project if that makes sense.

Hello,

My father-in-law is in a cult that is ostensibly peaceful. He's been in this cult for eight years or so, and primarily involves meditation in which he converses with spirits or angels. These spirits and angels have always spoken to him about not hurting other living creatures (i.e. eating vegan) and certain conspiracy theories (e.g. chem trails, fluoride brainwashing people). I believe they are called the lightworkers. He has attended conferences, bought books, etc.

I've informed the family of common advice regarding family members in a cult--be kind and accepting, etc. However, recently he has begun thinking he can detect hidden illnesses and has the power to heal people. As a result, he's told several family members they have various forms of cancer (they don't) and has begun changing his mother-in-law's medication. This is why I'm posting here now. He's becoming extremely confident and bold in his actions. For the past eight years, he would never do anything like changing a person's medication, but now he's emboldened in thinking that this will heal the person and that all he has to do is hold their hand and give them his energy.

The immediate family has reached out to me again seeking advice. I've reminded them of the same thing--if you dismiss what he believes or act confrontationally, you'll only scare him off and embolden him. However, I've also informed them that the grandmother's safety is paramount and that he needs supervised visits with her. He also needs to be told that the family has decided she needs this medication, and that although family is what's most important to him, he needs to allow the family to handle the medicine, not him.

I am concerned about the road he is traveling, though. I deeply believe that his early retirement had made him vulnerable to this cult and that his need for fulfillment/interconnectivity drew him in. My mother-in-law will be retiring soon, and I hope that this shared time will pull him back from the cult. The entire family and culture is one of extreme work ethic and he has been left alone quite a bit. Again, a contributing factor. Does anyone have any advice on how to pull him back sooner rather than later? Thanks.",03May2019,3
593,"Hi all, I wanted to make a quick post on here to determine wether im being unreasonably paranoid or if i should genuinly be extra carefle when visiting this 'uncle'. To begin with a bit of a backstory ramadhan is closing in, and my mother wants me to take a trip to london for her to pick up a whole lot of traditional foodstuffs among other things. Originally I planned to go alone pick up the stuff and return the same day via couch or train. However this morning my mum came in and said that the 'uncle' has already booked the ticket for my train, she then went on to tell me that he'd offer to take me to out to town and to see a football game, and has already booked the return ticket for the next day. I was slightly confused becasue i didnt even know the guy and hes already planning a weekend together. 

I kinda brushed it off and some time later i asked my mum does he have any kids, apparently he does not and he lives alone aswell so all that did was raise my suspicians futher. As i have been poisend before im not gonna think about taking the risk to eat there and i was wondering if i should invest in a small pocketknife of some sort, or am i overthinking things too much here. I appreciate all helpful comments and can elaborate if needed thanks.",03May2019,4
595,"For a long time I had a very clear plan in my mind, involving moving abroad to study something related to the game design. But the more I read and listen to the experiences of the people within the industry, I realize it's very toxic, ungrateful and well, it's hard to actually achieve something meaningful. I don't know if I really want that. I considered the film industry for a while, but I feel like it's the same kind of deal. All my life I linked my career with something involving art and creativity, because it's the thing I'm best at. Doesn't mean I'm good at it, mind you, I think I'm medicore at best, but I'm just worse in everything else. There's also a fact that I really, really need a high paying job and reading about salaries of the artistic jobs is not filling me with optimism.   


I struggle with the advanced maths, sometimes even the average-level mathematics is causing me problems, so a career combining these two worlds (say, an architect) is out of the picture. I'm just too stupid for any meaningful job that would satisfy my amibitions and be enjoyable.   


I would like to ask for an advice. Should I pursue the career in the game industry? If so, how should I create a plan B? Because if I don't get admitted to the university I want, I have no other plans for myself. And I don't think I will get admitted, because as I said before, I'm painfully medicore, and to be blunt, I feel like I don't deserve it. Maybe there are some career choices I didn't think of? Any advice would be very helpful.",03May2019,1

She is more than sister to me, but not in that way.

Whenever I speak at meetings and give my insights (which I know are very good) she diminishes my opinions and interrupts me every time. She tried to make my boss fire me and ended up in another of my co-workers quitting because she too was being harassed. Since her plan didn't work out, she then tried to make me quit, and since I saw through her manipulative behavior, I ignored it.

Now she's making my day to day a living hell, nitpicking every little thing I do and trying to control me. 

Talking to my boss wouldn't make much of a difference, since she got this job because she's the niece of one of the CEOs so she's kinda untouchable. I'm starting to feel really discouraged and irritated.

598,"Okay so this one’s a doozie. So my friend, who I’ll call Grace, is 15 and in a relationship with a 12 year old. Weird I know. But when I was 13 I was in a sort of relationship with a guy who was 18 that I met online, even weirder. It was never anything sexual we were more friends than even dating but Grace knows that I did that and I don’t want her to tell my parents.
Anyway she is being teased on the bus for it. It ended up getting so bad that she cut herself and got caught that same day. I know that she doesn’t have depression or anything like that (she only has adhd), she did it to more so prove a point like ‘you guys made me do this’ rather than self punishment like normal cutters. Well she lied to her parents about the real reason she did it because she isn’t even allowed to date. 
I’ve covered her ass for pretty much everything, from dating to having an Instagram. Well turns out I’m not a good liar because her parents found her insta and now if her parents find out I’m lying about her dating life too then they will tell my parents and get me in trouble.
I want to be able to take some time away from her so that I don’t get in more trouble than I already am in but I can’t just leave her because of how vulnerable she is right now. What should I do?

You might think this is a good thing, but no. My parents do not allow me to date yet, and I'm just a teenager. She is indeed a nice person, and I do love her as a friend (Yes, we became friends after she asked me out.), but I don't know what's the most polite way to tell her that we don't work out.

Her: i love you  
Me: i love you too ❤

I'm considering taking my mother to court over my house. My grandma (my mothers mum) left me everything when she died and did NOT leave anything to my mother because my mother didn't talk to her after she turned 18. When I turned 18 she promised me that if I put her on the deed that she would take out a loan to fix the house. So I put her on the deed but now it is almost 2 years later and she is not going to do it. I now have a son that I need to think about. My mother is not willing to take her name off the deed or sell the house with me which is what is needed. She has made my life miserable ever since I turned 18. The house is now VERY unsafe for me to live in let alone my son. It is a huge fire hazard and has a huge risk of flooding. I know by taking her to court she will contact CPS for no reason, she will stop talking to me, she will do EVERYTHING to make my life worse. I need some outside thoughts on if I should follow through with this. I have a lawyer on stand by to help with this. My spouse thinks this is the best option for us and our son. I think it is too but I am having second thoughts about possibly losing my mother but really want to move forward.",03May2019,1

Fast forward, we had a disagreement about something and I told him that he was fake (also it was for something important because I thought he was leading me on). Then he stopped messaging me came back a week later and said how he missed hanging out and then I told him off because of that disagreement. Then i said to myself that I’m being pretty mean so I tried to ask him how he’s doing and he takes forever to text back and I think that he tried to subtly insult me. So as any rational person would do I blocked him from all forms of social media because I thought it would be best since we both seem to be confusing one another with our feelings.

Today at work, I was changing my clothes in a stall in a change room. I didn't realize the latch on the door didn't lock and the door was open quite a bit while I was naked. Once I got a bra and underwear on, I felt like someone was watching me so I turned and saw our young male intern half behind a wall looking at me. 

He's always been nice but I think he may have a mild delay of some sort. Maybe he's just different. I'm not sure. But like I said, he's always been nice enough.

I think I asked him what he saw and closed the door. I can't really remember, I panicked. Then I started to get angry, and I sternly said WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I don't want to give too many details, but I guess there could be a reason for him WALK through the change room, but he was just standing half behind a wall and holding onto it.

I left the room as soon as I could and found my manager. I told my manager that I had no idea what his intentions were or how long he was there, but my door was accidentally open he saw me in the change room. Manager seemed upset.

Then I told some close flemale coworkers. Some made jokes that they don't blame him for watching me, they would too and that I totally made his spank bank (fucking EW). Some were really upset for me. Some said he was probably stunned when he saw me and froze. 

I think later he tried to say sorry, I'm not totally sure he because I couldn't even look at him and it's loud where we work. I was in shock. I've caught people taking pictures and videos of me before and the whole situation was a little much for me in the moment. 

Now I'm feeling guilty that I'm making a big deal out of a poor kid being shocked by my naked body. I definitely think someone needs to at least talk to him how to react in that situation... like walk away immediately? He didn't even look shocked? Just was really concentrating on me... anyway...

Am I making a mountain out of a mole hill? Was this an innocent mistake and now this poor awkward kids gonna be feel like a creep for an honest mistake? This whole thing still makes me feel sick.

611,"Ok, so this might be disjointed but I will explain it all the best I can.

&amp;#x200B;

So there's this guy at my local community, despite interacting with him I don't know his name. So I'll just call him Derrick or something. OK, so Derrick is very off. Like really, really off. Let me explain, I've only had a few interactions with Derrick but every time I've been ""graced"" by his presence he goes on these really violent rants, like once he went on this whole rant talking about how he knew about someone who tortured and tattooed on the forehead of a child rapist. He went into detail too, it was something along the lines of the said rapist getting his fingers and genitals cut off, etc.  This is a normal occurrence too, people I know who have been around him also feel extremely uncomfortable as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, yesterday was my first ever run in with the guy. I'm chilling out with some friends and he comes over, as I said earlier I don't anything about bro, I just know he's very off. So he comes over, and starts going on about how he was ""a soldier for a private security firm called The Corporation, a company that does things that the government won't even do."" He also told us that, ""he raised a wolf on an island base and his friend died for him by taking a bullet after that he left"". Naturally, I was like ""Bro, you lying"" and continued to press him. I even told him straight up that he was either lying to us or delusional. Then some bitch ass lady (sorry to swear) had to interject and be like ""He could be telling the truth"". As if we don't go to some little community college in South Louisiana.  I was superheated about it, luckily I had an exam so I had to dip. He also mentioned he was handgun trained so that made me more freaked out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I come back and my friend had been listening to him talk to someone else. He had gone on for like an hour about how this ""Corporation"" he worked for apparently had diamond bullets, cured him of asthma, was able to cure terminal diseases, and other things that were also obviously fake but I can't recall them as I write this.  He also shared a story about a woman getting brutally murdered and gutted and the said murderer jacking off over the body or something. Unsettling shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, I'm worried. This dude obviously has mental issues and what if that ""Corporation"" ever contacts him again I'm scared he's gonna shoot up the college or hurt someone. I'm mostly scared for my life because if he decides to act out I might be the main target for calling him out publically and shit getting out of hand (someone stepped in and I'm a passionate speaker so shit got louder than I wanted it to).

I've also been working on getting my Motorcycle license, but I can't afford any bikes with the money I have right now.

I am a film major. I'm alright at it. 

I want to get into Real Estate Videography. I need to spend about $1100 in order to get the equipment that I need, and that is the bare bones stuff, so I'm sure I will probably end up needing a couple hundred more in batteries and stuff. I only have about 1700 in my bank account right now, so it's a lot to me, being a broke ass college student making a quarter over minimum wage.

A real estate video can make between 1500 and 2500, if you are asking the right realtors. I could possibly make back the money I spend on a single gig. 

I don't have any connections. I don't have the equipment. I don't have a portfolio. I'm not 100% confident in my skills. I know that I know enough theory to do it. I know how to use different times of day and what direction/time to shoot. 

Should I spend over half of what I have in my bank account on this equipment? Worst case scenario, I will end up selling it and making back at least 50%. I may also just end up using it in my major.

After I get the equipment, I need to get a drone license and build a portfolio. After that I just have to find people to film for, and there are plenty of luxury listings in the local area. Most of the films I've seen a pretty basic and unimpressive to having downright horrible lighting. I think I can do better. I could be wrong, though.

616,"I am the relative of a girl who was in Christian private school and was later home schooled by Christian parents. During her upbringing, she, and her siblings, were not part of a home that was obsessed with legalistic Christian rule following. They watched mainstream movies, took educational vacations, encouraged reading, wanted the children to develop personal interests, and provided for opportunities that allowed for extra curricular activities that placed them around a variety of different people. Her parents were good parents. 

The following is where the problem started. After high school graduation, she entered a Christian gap year program. I wanted her to bypass it because I took issue with some of their positions on things. I also felt they would influence her choice of university and make her think that some personal beliefs of others were evil or wrong rather than different. I wanted her to proceed to college. Fast forward and the gap year is over. Like I feared, she has chosen a university with a strong affiliation with the gap year program. Her proposed major will be something that allows her to work in a type of ministry, although it could be used in secular circles as well. Saying this, this field is known, overall, for high stress and low pay. I have discouraged the major on all fronts. 

All of this upsets me because I feel she has had nothing but a one sided view of the world and will miss out on the typical college experience and the exposure to a wide variety of choice of major options. I have done everything I know to discourage her, but am just short of being a pest. I know people have to make their own path, but I don’t see Christian bombardment 24/7, over years, productive because it colors how the world is perceived. I think she needs experience being around a variety of people and experiencing different people and viewpoints.

620,"I know this isn't a juicy problem, but I need some input to make this little decision.

**TL;DR: Should I pay an additional $5 a month to go from no data to 1 GB data on my cell phone?**

For context: currently I have a prepaid phone with unlimited text/talk and no data (but yes, wifi). I live out in a rural area, cell coverage is poor, so I do have a landline phone and internet at my house - I wouldn't be using data regularly at home. I do have a office type job where there is reliable wifi/internet, so I don't need data on my phone there.

Currently my phone plan is $25 a month and I like to keep that low, since I'm also paying $85 a month for the landline phone/internet. It used to be a big jump in price to add data, but now I see it is only $5 more a month to add 1 GB of data. 

Do you think it's worth an additional $5 a month to have that data? It seems like there are situations that pop up where it would sure be nice to have a little data, for example Google maps works better when you are online (or during a power outage, I have no internet/wifi at home). And I can certainly afford the $5 a month. I kind of resist though, because I want to avoid creeping up into a more and more expensive phone plan. And there's no going back, as the $25 plan is no longer available unless you're already on it and stay on it.

Also, are there any weird catches or things to watch out for when you go on a limited data plan?

621,"My right to sue ended April 30th so I was just going to post this message I received containing the racial slur they called me and give a history of what happened while I was working there. This is what I typed 

“Normally I wouldn’t do something like this because I would rather it be solved behind closed doors, but I think everyone should know who they’re doing business with at Subzero Sugar Land. I started working at Subzero August 2016 and was soon promoted to shift manager October that year. I worked up until I got fired June 2018 for “missing a shift and phone usage”

Starting out, I’d also like to add that this doesn’t violate content guidelines because this does have something that affects customers too.

Attached is a message I received from one of the owners, shortly after my father had passed away. For some background, I was a little passive aggressive with them regarding the matter. I told them “my father just passed, thanks for making a hard time harder,” referring to how they fired me June 2018 knowing my father had been in the hospital for a few months. I’m assuming this was retaliation to that message.

 The “reason” that I was fired is for missing a shift and multiple write ups about phone usage. The day I missed I originally was going to trade shift with the other shift manager (there was just me and him at the moment and we could only trade shifts with each other based on the owner’s rules) and it had been communicated to the owners. They cancelled his shift and he didn’t want to work that day if he did not have to so I had no one to cover this shift, which was known because I had something family related going on that night. Like I said earlier, my father was in the hospital in critical condition. I worked a few weeks without letting the owners know until I couldn’t deal with it and needed a personal day. I told them what was going on and they seemed understanding, and I told them I might be using my phone more often to keep tabs on family and my dad’s status. Phone usage had never affected my work output at all. This was the only day I took off to deal with family matters. One more thing to add is that as a shift manager, the owners would try to contact our cell phones sometimes.

Along with this, I was treated very differently from other employees. I was heavily watched by the security cameras which are accessed from their cell phones, I was spoken to in a harsher tone than others, they did not respect my schedule and I would work many days I had blocked off weekly, and they would poorly communicate with me and if a conflict came from miscommunication they would blame me. It even got to a point where they would lie on other employees to justify writing me up, and I do have proof of this.

Something that should be brought to light for anyone who wished to visit their store between October 2016 and April 2018, your ice cream was prepared on dishes that were not cleaned properly (one weekend during April we did not even have dish sanitizer). The store did not have working hot water from October 2016- April 2018 until I called the City of Sugar Land myself and reported the issue the owners had known about from when it first stopped working. They blamed it on Hurricane Harvey, but even going by that, it’s about seven months without it.

These are some issues I had approached the corporate national headquarters, regional manager, and even spoken with the CEO about but nothing was ever done about it from their end. Funny thing about this also, when I asked for any contact related to corporate the owners refused to give me any information. I only obtained it after calling a Subzero in Dallas and explaining the situation to it’s owner.

I am just a college student and currently am unemployed, so I could not take legal action against them due to not having money to sustain a case. Who I was speaking with advised that I file for unemployment at least to have some kind of income, but it was denied for  being fired with “being absent without properly notifying” my employer as the reasoning. Which they did have complete knowledge of as I stated earlier. “[message I received ](https://imgur.com/a/EgnW03z)",03May2019,1491
622,"I’m 18 , out of high school and I found a very good paying job around 30 minutes away from my house. I go in for my interview next week and I’m confident that I will get the job but the biggest downfall is that the shifts are 12 hour swing shifts.  The schedule goes like this, you work 3 or 4 days 7am-7pm then you’re off for 3-4 days then you go back to work for 3 or 4 days 7pm-7am. For some reason, I’m very anxious about this schedule because I sometimes have trouble sleeping and I feel like bouncing back and forth from day shift to 3rd shift for is going to mess up my brain or something.  Like I stated in the title this is my first real job, how hard will this be on my body? Is it worth it?

625,"Hi,

So i work in a senior position at work with a team of 14 under me 
And during a meeting with my boss (supervision/ catch up)
It was mentioned about how she is sometimes told about other staff saying im looking tired/ ""can i help do this task to take something of his plate"".
Now tbh i always look tired i usually work a 40-60 hour week due to having to cover staff sickness. And the staff team knows that as im the one who basically fixes all the gritty stuff and gets everything working (not to say im the only one doing that). While my boss has been also working at another place so splitting her hours meaning we are basically a ship without a rudder.
But back to the main point i guess, my boss works loads more hours than me like an extra 160 hours last month. But the way she was basically telling me to watch my 'persona' around people if i am tired just seemed silly. I feel like i should be able to vent around the people i work with. As well as it almost felt slightly that she was annoyed that staff where concerned for my well being and not always hers, but im the face they see every day.

I hope my ramblings make some sort of sense just helped to put it into words tbh",03May2019,3

I'm a 26 y/o F. I've been nannying for a 6 year old girl for a year and a half now. Her parents are divorced and she is extremely spoiled and has behavioral issues. That being said, since I started to watch her I found that she loves playing pretend. We have been playing pretend almost nonstop everytime I watch her and I can't do it anymore.

I play multiple characters with multiple voices and she relies on me to create the storyline and dialogue for all the characters. I'm basically a live TV show for her. I have been doing this for at least 5 hours everytime I'm there. I've played pretend with her for over 1,000 hours since I started watching her and I have nothing left in me.

I have been trying to get her to do other things, but she refuses to leave the apartment or play anything else. The only other thing she will do is watch crappy YouTube videos of adult families playing pretend.

I'm a writer/ performer with multiple projects right now and I dont have time to go back to waitressing for money. I also am not at a place where I'm making enough money to quit. I only watch her 2 days one week and 3 days the following and get paid really well. I can't complain but I also can't keep playing pretend with her.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!",03May2019,1
631,"Please excuse the formatting errors. Basically this is where I’m at:

-In a shitty unfulfilling relationship that destroyed my self-esteem and general outlook towards the future. Relationship is 8 years so far. He’s 38M and I’m 27F. Guy himself is alright but no motivation to work towards a future together. To give an idea of the scope of problems: he didn’t have a job for roughly half the total time we’ve been together, our romantic life doesn’t exist at all, I’ve caught him watching porn next to me, and I’ve called the suicide hotline twice in the last year.  

-Came to the conclusion long ago that our relationship was beyond repair. I hate my job and have tried to leave 3 times in the 8 years I’ve been here but I was too scared of not being able to support us both that I’ve never left. I hate my hometown and came to the conclusion that I will never be able to leave. I resolved to kill myself before I turned 27 in February 2019. 

-In January, I began talking to an old friend, the guy who got me the job I still have. We had become enemies and not talked for a long time, but he was in town visiting due to a horrible tragedy. I went to see him, we mended fences, everything was cool.

-Kept talking to the guy, let’s say he’s named Troy. I have always had intense feelings for him and he’s the only person I’d ever believe is my soulmate. We live 10 hours apart but talked every day, made all these plans to get married and have kids. I began to see that life could be more than just work, go home, sleep and repeat. I saw a future finally and I threw everything into attaining it.

-I told my boyfriend I’m leaving him to pursue my career in a more metropolitan area, I couldn’t bring myself to tell the truth. I have not lied about anything in my adult life so I felt sick about it kind of. I put my notice into my job and started packing.

-I have a major fight with Troy. I panic as I begin to to realize that he’s the only person I’d know in a city of a million people. I’d leave behind my last 3 family members. I’d leave my entire life on a gamble, something I was so sure of turned into something malevolent and horrid. *He* turned malevolent.

-I told him I didn’t want to do this anymore, that my little life is enough and I was stupid to think so highly of someone who could rip me apart without caring. I cancelled everything in my name, told my job I was staying, told my boyfriend I wanted to stay and work it out.

-The next day, I woke up and cried. Everything hit me right in the face. The realization that months of hope and work were hastily torn down in a few hours. That I could never go back to living the way I had before January, just waiting to find the right time to kill myself. My boyfriend wasn’t even that happy to have me back, more glad to have my paycheck and my presence at his family’s events.

-Troy called me and I answered. I’m probably the worlds biggest sucker but Reddit, those things he said were amazing. I acted rashly and I told him what I’d done-except for telling my boyfriend I wanted to stay with him. He said he’d wait for me forever. I don’t entirely trust him- he used to cheat on his ex wife all the time, he said he’s changed, there were circumstances, this and that.

-I figure if I’m going to most likely end up killing myself anyway, I still want to get out of this life and see what it would be like to be with Troy. He doesn’t sound like a good guy I know but trust me, he’s the only one I want for the rest of my life.

-I do realize that in all this, I’m a moron and actually a garbage person. I’m a bad person and I probably don’t deserve happiness.

I need to tell my boyfriend I’m leaving still, but I can’t bring myself to commit to one or the other. I’m scared of leaving my life behind. I’m scared of being with Troy and the same stuff happening as it has with my boyfriend. I’m scared of committing but I need to make a decision and my decision is Troy.

I know how I should tell my boyfriend I’m still leaving, but I just... I don’t want to regret leaving him all alone, even though his family takes good care of him. I guess any thoughts you can give or any advice is much appreciated.

633,"hello all

as the title says I'm being accused of rape because of a girl i had consent sex with her.

sorry for the bad grammar, i'm not good with writing.

i know there are always 2 sides of the story but i'm being honest with this because i have nothing to hide and that i do not feel like am a rapist in this situation.

details are that i and the girl both live in the uk so laws are different, i'm 19m, the girl is 16f (the legal age of consent in the uk)

i'll just get to it, a girl i was talking to for around a week asked if she could come round mine and obviously i say yes and so she does, we start by just being normal by watching and playing games and chilling until we start to kiss, i asked if we can go on and she says ""you can do what you want"" and i ask again to make sure to which she says the same thing again, so from there we do, we go from kissing to foreplay pretty quick but then things calm down a bit then she see's my whiskey and asks for some which i say yes to but warn her that it's strong, i make sure i keep an eye on her so she doesn't end up drunk or sick as she is round my house, she takes a sip and then tells me to drink some of it so she can mix it with Dr pepper as it's too strong for her(she wanted to water it down pretty much) so i do and then she mixes it and then we both drink some more, from there we go to the bed where we cuddle and make out, i ask her if she is ok with having sex and she says yes, from there we start to have sex and try out different things like for example she asks me to tie her hands up to the bed which i do(this was the last thing we did) and things are normal until she asks me to stop which i do and i untie her and the sex was left unfinished, we drink some more and just have fun from there until her mum picks her up.

that's everything that happened that day that i am being accused of rape for, after that things are still normal and we keep talk like normal friends and she thanks me for it and when i asked if there where any regrets she said no, a few days later i go round hers and we are just being friends and nothing happened sexually, 2 weeks go by of us still talking and being friends things take a twist and she starts to regret what happened and i try to support her and say i'm sorry but nothing seemed to her, then she starts to say she was drunk and can't remember anything and then blocks be, she has a sister that i have spoke to before so i message her and see what's going on which she says to stay away from her and her sister which then she also blocks me and in a stupid fit of anger i delete the messages which where my only evidence that she said she didn't regret it and everything else to prove that, this is on messenger.

the same day time goes by and i remember i have her phone number so i give her a text telling her that you didn't need to block me and we could of spoke about it, she says how she is upset and her mind isn't clear and is struggling so i try to support her which i thought worked and then i don't text her again, days later she messages me and we start talking again like friends then her sister finds out she's been texting me so the sis unblocks and messages asking me to stop messaging the girl, idk why she didn't want me messaging her until i ask which then she says i raped the girl and says i got her drunk on purpose and took advantage of her, i was in complete shock because nun of what she was saying is true but she kept blaming me which then she gets the girl and both of them now say i raped her, we argue back and thought and they kept changing the story, this goes on for hours but then i just had enough and blocked them and kept the messages this time, this was just over a week ago now.

now i would normally deal with is myself if it wasn't for the fact that the officers came to my door today asking for me and what has happened, the girl that i had sex with has filed a report and has now accused me of rape, the officers asked to make a appointment to the station this Tuesday to give them my side of the story and that they strongly recommend i get a solicitor and if i'm not able to there will be one i can talk to at the station.

now i'm going to be honest with them like i have been here i don't know what the girl or her sister have said and how bad they made it out to be and because of that i really doubt i'm going to get out of this because most victims of rape false or not seem to win most of the time so even with my side of the story i don't think it would help.

TL;DR had sex with a girl and now she is accusing me of rape and i could be sent to prison.

i'm asking for real help here as i am lost on what to do.",03May2019,1

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

       Now, I’ve known my friends for awhile. Some of them even back in middle school. Despite this, I feel like every time that I’m in discord with them, or in a class with them, or when we’re hanging out, I’m always the butt of the joke. I’m the only overweight one in the group, and obviously that makes me an easy target. But, honestly, can I even call them friends? They have group chats that I’m not in. They talk shit about me behind my back. They talk shit about my family, specifically my two sisters. And, yeah, they make fun of one another occasionally, but not nearly as much, or as deep as they do on me. They all smoke weed, which I used to, (a lot), but I quit for good 8 months ago. They try to pressure me to smoke with them every time we hang out. 
   I even gave most of them jobs! My dad owns a telemarketing company, and I asked him if he could hire them, because I cared about them and it pays better than any other job they could get right now. Despite this, they constantly slag me off, insult me, or bring up stuff that really fuckin hurts. And they know it hurts. They’ve told me that they do it to piss me off sometimes.

643,"Hey guys I was hoping someone could give me some advice on my current situation. The first part is background and the second part is basically what I would like advice on. I just finished my sophomore year in college studying computer science, and I doing alright financially (not enough money to pay for rent but enough money to enjoy myself). The past two years I have been working help-desk jobs: I worked during my senior year of high school and into the summer in one job, and then this past summer I worked at a different and much more intricate MSP (managed service provider) which was a lot more work than the first job. I am pretty good with technology and most of the troubleshooting was pretty menial work, something like a Duo security clearance setup, password reset, god knows how many Outlook issues, etc. Now at these jobs I make good money, and some days I'll feel really good about the work I'm doing like I'm helping people and learning new things, but most days I just hate the monotony of the job and especially hate driving in rush hour traffic every day for my entire summer. 

The last two years I have accepted that I am going to dislike the work most days, but I justify it by saying I am getting my foot in the door in the IT field and making connections for a potential software developer role I would like to take on in the next few years. This summer however I am having second thoughts. My mom has always pushed me to work these jobs for the same justification I stated above, however more recently I have found I am very passionate about fitness and would like to get a personal training instructor certification to work at my school gym in the Fall. I was originally planning to work 4 days a week at a helpdesk job and then work on getting the certification where I had time, but recently I have been flirting with the idea of working at my local gym this summer or working some job where I could not take everything so seriously; a job where I wouldn't have to wake up at 6:45am to drive 25 miles to work and get there by 9am to work until 6pm, then depart for home, arriving around 730pm or 8, then eat, then go to the gym(?), then go to bed at like 11. Honestly the thought of it is giving me anxiety and I think I'll either hate my life and feel exhausted all the time, or get lazy going to the gym, and in both of those scenarios I will be sacrificing what is important to me just so I can work at this job to potentially make connections for a job in the future.  


So my question is: am I just being a baby about this and this is part of being an adult? Should I work this help-desk job for the money and experience and try to find a way for it to work with my schedule? Would it be foolish or lazy to get a more casual job (like I described earlier) and pursuing fitness? I just can't decide if I'm being selfish or lazy. I need help.",03May2019,1
644,"I rented a Home Depot truck for a day. When I was returning it, this idiot had his car parked in the middle of the road. I tried to manoeuvre by and get a parking spot. I thought I got by perfectly fine. I hear a guy yelling after me after I parked the car. 

I walk over, and notice that there is a slight touch of tires (my tire touched his since there is a dirt mark on his tire as it was turned outwards). There is a slight black spot on the car, but I’m not sure if it was caused by me. He tried claiming the hood was dented because of me and that there were multiple other black stains because of me (I know for a fact that it wasn’t me).

We exchanged drivers licence pictures and I took a photo of his car and a video of mine. He wanted me to pay but I know that he’s blowing the issue out of proportion and has no evidence to substantiate any claims (aside from Home Depot cameras, since he had to dashcam). 

Here’s the kicker - the truck was rented under my brother’s name but I was the one driving it and it was my licence I let the guy take a picture of. While my brother got insurance for it under his name, I’m not sure if it covers this. Again, there is no evidence to substantiate his claim and he’s trying to blow it out of proportion. He messaged me yesterday saying he went to multiple dealers and that the cost of painting the small scrape would be $400. I know this is a scam from him.

Should I just tell him to speak to his insurance? Another thing to note - as I left the parking lot on my brothers car (since we returned the truck)- I noticed he stayed back after we left, then brought his car over to where I parked the truck. Did he try to do anything to the truck? There were no stains or dents on the truck and I have evidence.",03May2019,1

655,"So this is a long story and it's constantly on my mind and it's affecting my mental well being and I just don't know what to do. So about June 2018 I liked this girl let's call her grace, for a couple of months. I eventually went on to tell grace that I like her, we hadn't known each other very well at the time other than we're in the same class at college but we started to talk to each other and that's when I started to like her. After I told her she told me that she didn't feel the same way and that I wasn't her type and all that, she couldn't have been any nicer to be honest. Come October Grace's best friend Molly starts messaging me because she liked me, I then started to go out with her in November but only for a couple of weeks. Grace and Molly have been best friends for 7 years and I thought when molly and I broke up I wouldn't be friends with either of them anymore. To this day I am still best friends with them both and they are two of the most important things in my life and they have both helped me through a lot because I'm suffering with severe social anxiety and depression. Starting about half way through March maybe beginning of April? I started to (and still do) like grace again but this time I know her a lot better and I know for definite that I like her and want to be with her. The only problem is I don't know whether to tell her or not. I don't think she likes me back but it's always worth telling right? If I tell her and some miracle she does like me, great! We can date. The only problem is with Molly. Grace said to me a few months back that she would never date one of her best friends exes, but it was only 2 weeks so wasn't serious so maybe she might?. But if she doesn't like me I think for definite I've lost molly as a friend but I don't know about grace. The last time I continued to be friends with her but I don't know if molly will try and get in her head or not to try and make her dislike me. Grace honestly is amazing, she's so funny, easy to talk to, absolutely gorgeous, so cute, and she literally puts a smile on my face just by being there. So yeah I really don't know what to do about it. Do I tell grace or not?

657,"Let me start by saying my mother and I don't get along. 

My parents divorced when I was 5, I remember crying,screaming and telling them that I would be good if they stayed together. They tried to tell me that it wasn't my fault but I have always had difficulty connecting with people and did not understand that they weren't lying. 

He cheated on her so she cheated on him. She kicked him out and it was horrible. Now, at 4-(f), I know that it must've been terribly stressful for her during that time and I was an extremely emotional child. I think this is also the time when I became invisible. It was horrible living with her for those months. Someone asked me what my name was and I said KnownCrazy Don't with all seriousness because that's all I heard her say to me whenever she spoke to me. She got a job in a different state. Daddy came back. I stayed invisible.

He is a nice man, I love him, but he's  different. He's an old school computer programmer, if that helps. He was gone most nights, I was at home with my sisters who were not really interested in having me around. When I was 11 or 12 he  remarried. She didn't seem to like me, she yelled at me often. 

This seems so long. I started hanging out with the 'wrong' crowd, doing bad things and had to move in with my mother in high school. I wanted to try and make it better, but I didn't fit in and I was invisible at home so I started doing everything I could to stand out. It didn't help, made things worse. 

Anyway, I moved out when I was 18, things were good, they got bad quick, then worse, then even worse. I had no one, I wasn't close to anyone in my family and my father told me ""you made your bed, lie in it.""

I pulled myself up, eventually went to college. Not before I went through a ton of really bad stuff, that only makes it more difficult for me to feel close to people. Over the years, I've tried to talk to her, I used to live near her and would even go visit. I was still invisible. She was asked by one of her cousin's or something for information to go in a family tree book and she left me off her list of children. 

When my step father died, I went to the funeral and she yelled at me in front of everyone. I never went to her house because I didn't know if I was welcome, I hadn't talked to her in years, maybe I shouldn't have gone. I hate that she hates me, that nothing I do will ever make her love me. 

For some reason the idea popped in my head to send her flowers for mother's day. I don't know what to say but I love her and I just always wanted her to love me and she didn't but that's okay because I'm okay now.",03May2019,1
659,"He always calls me beautiful. At the most perfect, romantic moments, when I least expect it. He just always knows exactly what to say, it's inhuman!! It comes so naturally to him and I'm jealous at how good he is at this romance thing. When it comes to me, however, I just admire him silently, sometimes only fondly looking while he does menial stuff like tidy his folder. My point is, I don't say it as much as I should and I don't know what to say without sounding awkward. I'm certainly not expressive or romantic by nature but I'm learning with him. This is my first real relationship and I'm trying to make an effort because I love him so much and I want him to know that, but I don't know where to begin. I don't know what I should compliment him on, what to say to boost his ego, etc. Should I avoid some language?? Are some words more embarrassing than others ('handsome' and 'beautiful' sound awkward to me, I can only deal with 'pretty')?? Should I avoid complimenting him on certain things??? I'm seriously clueless.

Looks don't mean more than personality to me, but goddamn he's handsome. Even before I was interested in him I knew that he was stunning. I really don't understand how someone as attractive as him can lay eyes on me without them burning, let alone make me his girlfriend, but whatever. For some reason, he can't see this and he's convinced that he's ugly. When he repeatedly calls himself ugly, what should I do? Theoretically, I can't just deny it with a simple ""no you're not"" each time, eventually he just wouldn't believe me (not to mention its a highly dry reply to, say, an entire paragraph expressing his physical insecurities).

664,"recently i got into a relationship with my co-worker ,about 1 month ago.
She came to our department about 4 or 5 month ago and she used to work with us in a same room,we used to talk normal on daily basis at the start,i mean there was no emotion included. After 1 or 2 month from the start ,one of my male co workers - who was her friend and introduced her to our department for work - came to me and told me that she is intersted in you ,so go and follow her on instagram if you like her too, he kindda wanted to force me to do that but i refused ,but two days later i followed her.

We started to meet casually about one month, once a week for e.g ,but i didnt feel so much sexual attraction and desire for her at that time,but i ignored that,so after one month we went for hollidays and started to chat more intense,after 1 week of intesive chatting she finally told me : we both know we like each other so if you want to think about the future and having a relationship ,lets be with each other,i answered :yes, but i just want to know you more and it doesnt guarrantee that we will get married (because her final target is getting married with me and i knew that at the very first point).so we started to know each other through texting in hollidays and after 2weeks we got back to the same city and went to department for starting work again.

we hangout at that day and she kissed my chick and i gave her our first kiss but it didnt feel that much,totally normal, so by the way days passed and we hangout on most days in week. she was so hotter and more into me,that it made her to be starter of kissing and making love with each other ,but i never feeled that much with her. so after 2 weeks of dating she started to talk about marriage and something like that - not in a direct way - by joking about it, but i knew what she meant.

she started to tell me if you leave me i dont know what will happen to me and something like that,calling me 3 times a day ,sending me love messages and ... after third week we fell apart because i was too busy ,and she started to call me and nagging me about why we cant go out,i missed you and ... but suddenly i came to myself and found out that i dont think about this girl through the day,i dont have much desire to call her,i dont know if i really want her, i dont feel honeymoon phase ,and i dont know if im really in love with her.

since she is too sensitve and madly in love by three weeks ,i ve got scared a little bit and told her today i want to have time and think about our relationship, so now ,i want to know should i continue and discover her more and i would finally fall in love or should i break up since she is too sensitive and her main reason for relationship is getting married! (She is marriage type)
I really dont want to hurt her but from other side i dont know if she is the one and i dont know if i want to get married with her,she fell too early in love,but i think if i break up with her i would never find a girl who will love me back like her,but i hate some of her behaviours too, i never missed her in 2 weeks that we were apart ,sometimes i think im gay 😂because i lost my affection and emotion for this girl too early,i dont even have desire to have sex with her!!.

TL;DR: Im in one month relationship with my co worker but i dont know if im really in love,i dont feel attraction enough and since she wants to get married and wants to secure relationship for that,i dont know should i break it off or stay and continue?but from other hand i get afraid of not finding a girl that loves me back like that in future!",03May2019,1
665,"Quick backstory, I'm 24 years old and went from making $20k-$30k a year struggling in California to making a six figure salary over the matter of a few months when my career finally kicked off.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always known the phrase money doesn't bring you happiness is somewhat true, but I was more than excited when the first few paychecks rolled in and it felt like my entire life opened up with brand new opportunities for me to explore. I was happy, but not for long. After about a month I just kind of felt empty, with like no drive or motivation to really do anything anymore. Let me say I'm not depressed or feel like harming myself in anyway but I just have this feeling I can't describe very well besides empty. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I want anymore. Now that I have the ability to pretty much get what I want the accomplishment feeling that I would get when I finally earned something is gone, and it kind of sucks. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed the time I've spent traveling to different countries due to my job (Something I thought I'd never be able to do in my life.) but it didn't really feel genuine. My parents are telling me that I should feel accomplished because I was able to come up from nothing to this, and its not like it was all handed to me, but I'm just not sure how to feel that. Even the things I used to enjoy doing don't give me as much entertainment or value to my life anymore and I don't understand why. A lot of my friends are still in, or just finishing up college and they all say I'm just having ""First world problems."" and it makes me feel like I'm complaining about being in a good situation which I'm not trying to do, and it sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just not sure how to cope with this feeling, its all new to me and I'm not even sure what to do anymore. There's still plenty of things I want to do, places I want to go, and things I want to buy but I don't really have the desire to do it anymore and I'm just not sure why...The whole having money and not having to worry feeling is extremely new to me.

666,"I’m not sure how to start this so here’s a little context. 

I’ve been homeschooled since the 6th grade. However, during the summer before my freshman year I convinced my parents to let me go to public high school (because I wanted to try to make friends in my area, and I just generally was sick of homeschooling). 

I only went to public high school for 4 months before having to be pulled out because of the general harassment I was receiving from other students. During those 4 months I had briefly hung out with/talked to a guy who we’ll call Erin (not his real name, btw). Erin was a junior when I was a freshman, which means he’s already been out of high school for a year at this point, since I am now a junior. 

The first interaction I had with him was when he asked me out, and I said no because I had no idea who he was. After that we didn’t talk much. He would follow me around school which worried me a bit but I brushed it off.

So flash forward about a year or so later, he adds me on Snapchat and Instagram because he somehow got my username. He starts getting sorta creepy, and when I turn down his offer to be his girlfriend, he goes full rage, telling me he was going to hack me, dox me, etc. I obviously was a little worried but was pretty sure he wouldn’t follow through so I blocked him.

He’s since tried to add me over and over and I always decline and block the accounts. And for about a year now he’s gone silent and I hadn’t heard from him. Until this morning. I opened Instagram to see a follow request (all my accounts are on private) from him. I could tell it was him because his name was in the bio. I removed it and kept on with my day. So far today he’s sent 3 follow requests and idk what to do. If I block that account he will make more accounts to try and follow me. 

What should I do about this?

Basically, ever since my ex-girlfriend [17F] broke up with me - about 5 months ago, I’ve had incredibly low self-esteem and think of myself as pathetic.

I constantly compare myself with her - for some reason. For example, she worked multiple jobs, I don’t have any - so I feel like crap. She was athletic and sporty, I’m not - so I feel like crap. She was beautiful and funny, I’m lonely - so I feel like crap.

I’ve seen a therapist for a while now who diagnosed me with low self-esteem causing low mood and anxiety.

I genuinely don’t know what the hell to do.

I feel miserable about myself all the time and I feel like I’m just at a loss. If anyone has any advice or anything that can recommend for me, I’d appreciate it so much.

669,"TLDR: my amazing grandma is going through a hard time. She’s very stubborn and independent and won’t let anyone be there for her. How can we show her she’s not alone without crossing boundaries?

Hi, my grandma is in her mid-seventies and a number of people in her life are ill or passing away and I don’t think she’s dealing with it well. How can I be there for her? What are some tips for supporting a very independent person who is grieving?

 She’s the kindest and most loving person on the planet and she takes of everyone around her but doesn’t let anyone take care of her. The problem is that death and illness is affecting her friends and family and I don’t want her to be alone. She hasn’t gone to visit her best friend who has dementia and has been in the hospital for a year. She says she’ll get around to it but she comes with excuses not to go even though i’ve offered to accompany her. I think she’s afraid of seeing her friend that that way.

Now, her older brother is dying of cancer and doesn’t have long to live. He took care of her when she moved to a big city at age 14 and taught her to speak English so she could attend high school (at the time she couldnt study in her language here because it was outlawed). I want her to embrace her time left with him instead of ignoring it but she keeps focusing on learning the medical diagnosis instead of going to see him. I think it hurts her too much but I don’t want her to regret it... how can I lovingly support her to see her brother and best friend before they pass? And how can I be there for her once they pass? I just want her to feel as loved as she makes us all feel.

675,"  
I (21M) cheated on my girlfriend (20F) over a year ago while on “break”. I chose to tell her a few days ago, not only because she deserved to know, but because I wanted to be as open as I possibly could about myself and our relationship. We have had several issues with trust on both ends, and I love this girl more than I want myself to “feel good” as a result of having her in my life. I must mention that this is my first ever girlfriend, and it isn’t even close.

  
I went to an all-boys high school and never even talked to girls outside of social media, and once I got to college, everything was casual sex and I never had any serious feelings for anyone in my life before I met this girl. You may see here that this is where the problems might arise.We have been together for over a year and a half. The cheating happened on a visit to a college one weekend when we went on “break” because we had been arguing so much, and because I did not know how to handle conflict. I was also afraid I would miss out on partying and college nonsense.  
I had sex with a girl I didn’t know, and never saw again or spoke to, and felt disgusted after. 

It’s haunted me ever since, but I never had the courage to tell her, because I didn’t want to lose her. But I realized that cowardice was the crux of my issues, and realized she needed to know my past if I wanted a great future with her.That was the only time I physically did anything, although I have texted other girls, mainly for the “ego boost” or satisfaction of “still got it”.

  
I’m still a young guy, and have felt extremely conflicted. I love this girl, but I am frustrated at times at the fact that I am in such a serious relationship during the “prime years” of my life.The thing is, I know none of that shit actually matters. I know I love her, and I am only really happy when she is in my life. The college girls, parties, and all that is empty pleasure that I know don’t actually need.

 It’s just that stress, frustration, and even boredom at points makes me feel like I need out. That escape has manifested, unfortunately, into participating in horrible and toxic behavior that she does not deserve. I know almost all of those uncharacteristic behaviors are just a combination of all the above, and hormones etc., and that’s what I need to change. But it may be too late, as the damage has already been done. She found out about the texting months ago, and it devastated her. I told her I would change, which I have in that regard, but I knew that our relationship could never be what she deserved if I wasn’t honest about something so serious. 

So I told her all that I possibly could, and said that I’m going to work to completely change my life: my habits, my outlook, my attitude. She said she needed to work on loving herself first, because we both agreed that it was what she needed, and that I needed to be away from her for some time.

  
She broke up with me, obviously, though we talked about it a lot. I have already been laying out a serious plan to change a lot about myself, and I am sure that we can be together and happy once I learn to grow and put others totally before me, and once she loves herself first, should she choose to even consider trying again.  
This is the greatest girl I could possibly have in my life. She does EVERYTHING for me, and we are best friends. I do a lot for her, too, but she deserves more. And I want to give her that.What do I do? What does she do? What do both of us deserve? I know it isn’t about me really at all, but I need some help for the both of us.",03May2019,0
676,"I am a 20 y/o business student in uni, and I am at the end of my 3rd year. I wanted to study psychology my whole life, but found myself in a business major due to some other circumstances. I skipped a year ahead in uni to achieve my dream of a psychology master, have been grinding for a perfect GPA throughout my uni life even though I hate the major, worked on additional research projects, all so that I can apply for the master programme in my dream uni abroad (I am from an almost 3rd world country, and the country is becoming unliveable every year, so I really want to get out.)

I am also working almost full time with a company while studying, and the pay I get is very much needed for me to be able to pay for the tuition of my dream university when I finally go to master, and start the life I grinned for.

Both school and work is very demanding, and I am struggling. I live an hour away from my parents who are in their 60s due to my need to be closer to the uni campus, and I visit and stay during the weekends.

The thing is, I feel like I am not there for my mom enough. I see her during the weekend and sit with her for a little bit, do some chores to help out, but since school is so demanding I am usually trying to finish a project almost every week, and am trying to do some work, since my employer is nice enough to let me finish work on my own hours, and I usually can't find enough time during the week because I am at school every day of the week.

My mother does not seem to get better. She is usually alone, since my dad has to work to keep paying for both the life and medical bills, which makes her focus on her body more than usual. She is a fighter, don't get me wrong. She is trying to keep herself better, but the chemo is taking a huge toll on her already bad health. She has never been a healthy woman, and chemo is bringing the worse to her body. We are at the start of this journey, she already has a whole year of chemo to go, and is already getting sick constantly with fevers, and I am very much worried since she says she does not want to feel like this anymore.

As a 20 year old, I am utterly terrified because this is my mom, she is the one I turned to all my life, whenever something went wrong, she fixed it. I am very scared as an only child, because I feel like I should do more, but am not confident in my actions when something goes wrong. Since I am always so busy, I keep my mind busy and away from the situation to get things done, but this makes me feel so guilty. Even though we feel optimistic about the situation, I still feel like I should give her the attention, number one priority, rather than school or work. But when I try to do that she gets sad, feels depressed since she feels like she is preventing me from living my life, and does not understand that that's not the case.

I am a bit lost, and conflicted. What should I do? Should I just drop the school stuff for a bit? I was planning on going abroad for a very good internship this summer, should I just not do that and stay with my mom? How can I explain to her that if I did those things, that's not her /fault/ ? Also, if I do drop the school and work, how do I deal with the feeling of getting away from a dream also, because even though my mom is the love of my life and she is the most important thing, I am also a bit selfish and feel sad that a lot of my hard work will go to waste and high jeopardise the end goal I had.

tl:dr - should I take a break from school and work and focus on my sick mom?",03May2019,2
677,"I hold one of my friends quite close to heart because he was the one there through my hardships over the last year and helped a lot. However, he recently got into a long distance relationship with a girl I know. Having spoken to her about what she knows about him, it turns out he had taken my life and told her it is his own. He took my achievements, my job, grandfather passing away, mental health and more to (I assume) look more appealing. He also sent her photos of me telling her it is him (he doesn't care for his appearance so I'm guessing he sent her these to appeal to her more or something). He has also taken my music taste (literally taking my entire playlist) and starting listening to it because she likes similar music. I didn't tell her because I really don't want to upset her and I feel as though I owe him but I don't know if I can stay here with this going on. Please help. I don't know what to do.",03May2019,3

680,"About a year ago, I met an amazing person. He was great, nice, perfect in any way I could ever think of. He is far away from me tho. I'm from Asia, he's from Portugal. We eventually became a couple and was planning to meet each other in about a year, so around 2020 (we both are uni students and we both doesnt work yet, thats why we didnt plan to meet soon). But eventually we brokeup on september last year because he said I am ""suffocating"". I have anxiety disorder and it was always my biggest fear, but he always manage to remind me how long we have been together and that it will never change and that he was willing to help me out and wait until we can meetup together. He promised.

Breaking up with him gave me bigger impact than i thought it would be. I have mental issues to begin with so I guess that made stuff worse. It's been 7 months since we brokeup and idk but it gets worse, not better for me (idk for him, we stopped talking and i deleted all my social media acc, and most chat apps that i have). He did say that its better off if we dont talk and it takes a while to get used to this, being alone without him (he know i have nobody else, family isnt there for me either). I still text him in a social media that he deleted (so it wont sent) but once he start using it again and it all sent and he told me not to do that ever again or he would block me. I told him something and he respond being somewhat rude, and tell me to talk to my family instead (as i stated, my family is never really there for me and he know about it). He also said that he already forgot about me and he seem to wanna keep it that way.

In the middle of this, i've met some people, but i keep looking for him inside of every single person i met. Every single thing i do, remind me of him. I don't sleep well because i keep dreaming about him that i call a nightmare considering the situation that wont be any better. Its just getting worse everyday to the point that now i try not to sleep at all. I met a guy that doesnt mind it being there, I watched him playing stuff or watching whatever he watch until i fall asleep. I can't be by my own or i'll be this way again. Stressed out, depressed,anxious, etc. Just how do I help myself? How can I do this by my own? How to let someone that means everything to you go?",03May2019,2

682,"So long story short, my boyfriend lives with his mum (he’s 21 so it’s not too weird) and if I wanted to spend time with him i’d have to go to his house. His mum doesn’t work so she has time to make dinner like 3/4 nights a week so when I go to visit she’d fix me up a plate as well which is very nice of her as she doesn’t have to do that. 

Anyways so this lasted for about a year, I wasn’t at their house for the whole time i’d say that there was 2 months were i was there every day and all the other month i was their like 3 nights a week.... so it’s hard to quantify.

I said i’d thank her for letting me eat the food that was in their house and you know just to say thanks for fixing me up a plate of food when i came over. They’d always say that the food would just go to waste anyways so it’s not like an extra plate of food was going to cripple them.

Anyways, so they get all their food from a specific supermarket so i was just to put lots of money on a gift card from that particular store.

The reason i’m doing this is because all i “took” was food. My boyfriend pays the rent for everyone and even though i did stay over, those costs would’ve been their regardless, but the costs for food may have been a little higher because i would be there and eat food so it makes sense to pay them back in terms of “food money” and just not money money.

Is that a good idea? Would it seem shady?

Another reason that i’m doing this, is also because she might spend the money on other stuff, obviously it would be HER money but i’m giving her money for food, not for other stuff, i know that sounds soooo cheeky but this money isn’t just money, it’s money for food.

But yeah is it overly cheeky ?

Threatening to release the photos to their school, their family, that kind of stuff. Another girl has a restraining order against him and he went to court for stalking but the charges were dropped. I had never sold to him, or at least I believe I have not as he has around 120 known accounts. However, he messages me every day, 3-5 times a day from new accounts. Every single time I say “Do not contact me anymore” - take a screen shot, then block him. Today he responded with “I will continue to contact you every single day.” This is really scary, I’m not concerned about blackmail considering I only sell photos of my feet and don’t really care if my family finds out. I’m more concerned that this situation can escalate, since he has proven his ability to contact others via private social media accounts, their family, their school. If he could do that then what would stop him from finding my college and location? I believe I know the legal definition of harassment and he fits perfectly under it.

688,"Bit of a long one and I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting. 

I don’t really know if personal info matters but I am in high school and I am male for those that care. 

So about 2 weeks ago I was talking to my friend who I’ve known for about half my life and whom I have known the longest out of everyone I talk to except for my family, and I will refer to her as T,  and she told me something about one of our mutual friends who I’ll refer to as D. Now this was something that did not sound like something that D would do at all so I asked my friend M who is really good friends with D’s girlfriend J who I’m also very good friends with. T lives in a different state so M doesn’t really know her but before she moved to a different state she was friends with D and went to school with J for a long time. When I asked M about what T told me she instantly got upset at me that I told her something that she has to keep a secret from her friends and that I betrayed T’s trust. So I felt bad and I told T what I had did and she got upset at me as well, understandably. 

Now here’s where the problem kicks in. 

Even before I told M i had already been planning on telling D about it and J as well since it could potentially cause some issues later on and right now they have a really strong relationship and they have a habit of going through ups and downs very fast and the info honestly wasn’t that big of a deal anyways. After I told T that I had told M, she was upset for maybe 5 minutes then she forgave me and started to actually encourage me to drop subtle hints that I know that piece of info about D and see what he does. While T was encouraging me I was also texting M and apologizing for putting her in a spot she doesn’t like and for betraying both of their trusts. M did not respond at all so I figured she went to bed as it was around midnight at the time and tomorrow was a school day. The next day I had Spanish first period and normally me and M walk to our lockers together after class so I decided I would apologize in person as well that way she can really get that I am actually sorry and not just saying I was. Spanish ends and I see her walk out (our classes were right across from each other) and I walked over to try and talk to her and she just walks away really fast so I figured alright I’ll try later. And then I tried again next class, and after that class (we had the same class) and both times she ignored me and would not let me talk to her so I left her alone. The next day I tried again and she did the same thing so i said ok that’s fine I get it I did put her in a bad spot so I’ll take her out of that spot and do what I had been planning on doing and tell D and J. It turned out that I wasn’t able to do it that day as I forgot I had a match and had to leave school before I could tell him so I told him the next day and what do you know M had already told J and J then told D and both were fine with it, no problems whatsoever with either of them or T. Now it’s just M who has a problem with it and it has now been about 2 weeks since this all went down and the only time we have talked was on Easter when I said Happy Easter and she said thanks you too.

Now I am at a loss as to what to do because J is now barely talking and even looking at me because she is taking M’s side who is still not talking to me or even looking at me (as far as I know) and J is also trying to put D on to M’s side even though he has already said to me that he genuinely thinks that there is no reason that M should still be upset about all that since the info never caused a problem with the 2 that it concerned (D and J) nor did it cause one with T. I asked my mom what she thinks and her advice was kind of what I was thinking which was to just leave it and if M and J want to be friends again then they can come to me. 

Please advise me on how I should handle this. It’s been bothering me this whole time and I can’t think of much more that I can do.",03May2019,1

Related information: So i live in an arab country our school system is messed up it has 12 clases starting at about 5-6yo and 12tg grade 16-17yo first 10 years are purely for general knowledge then at 11th grade you chose a specific route there are like seven but the major 2 are scientific for doc and eng etc... 2nd us literary for teachers art etc... and recently added technological route and your grade at the 12th class is the only important thing about school it almost decides the route of your life onwards will be able to go to college or would have to pay 2x at it or just cant get the major you want its all decided by 12th class degree.

I am relly into tech stuf  gaming qnd reading for all of my life ii always loved fixing broken Electronics taking apart and reassembling things i would either do that game or read for my free time i have friends but i just dont like going out i love staying home doing my own things i also loved school i bult my 1st pc at 10th grade and i loved it i also had excellent grades at school like straight A's.

It all started when i told my perants at the end of the 1st semester if 10th grade i told my perants that i wanted to take the technological rout anf they wont let me and would later force me into scientific route .

 so at that time i had mild depression and it caused my A's to turn into b's or even C's and but thought i would just get throw with it and take the college major I wanted computer engineering. 

but i just hated the scientific route i just couldent get my self to study started getting far away for my Hobbies so now i no longer game and my most beloved screwdriver kit hasent been used in a year i read less and less went from 6-9 books a month to 0-1 book i even sold my pc beacuse i dont use it anymore i stopped following tech news shortly after and i picked up smoking 4 months ago.

Now im at the end of 12th grade where you will have the exams that amount to 100% of your year scoor and i baisicly didnt study anthing during school year i have a month to study evrything for finals if i  want to get a good scoor but i just lost my motive to do it i just cant study the urge to study left with my hobby and i dont know what to do after school my interest towords pc's just stooped i no longer use then unless i need to so i no longer want to study computer engineering i am depressed most of the time but i never show or talk about it to anyone i no longer know what i want or what should i do i just spend my days heavily smoking and wasting time on uslees youtube videos facebook or reddit.

I just dont know what i am doing with my life anymore my personalty also changed form active and enthusiastic with friedns and in class at school to just staying away waiting for the days to pass i rarly talk with my friends or family unless spoken to first.

I hope i can finde advice here beacuse i cant finde it in me yo talk in real life to anyone about it

Although they have been extremely helpful for the most part, and they've never really argued with me, or fallen out with me. There are times when they will randomly come out with pretty basic insults that seem serious.

I'm not a slowflake by any means, I have a sense of humour (a pretty good one, I'd like to think) and I can give and take when it comes to offensive banter. But these insults don't seem like that, they seem snarky, but I can never tell if they're meant for me to be taken seriously. So what do I do? I have briefly researched into passive-aggressive behaviour and I'm still not sure what to think.

Some things that have been said to me are some of the things I avoid saying to people even when we're ""roasting"" eachother.

This is the first girl that i’ve ever had feelings for, which had me super freaked out because i’ve only ever been into guys. (I’m a 16 y/o girl). I thought for a while that maybe she felt the same way back?? The way she giggled at my jokes or certain things she said had me wondering if there was something between us. I can 110% say that I’m in love with her. Trust me, I’ve had months to pine over her and confront my feelings.

We run track together and recently she and this really nice guy have been talking a LOT. I remember getting jealous one time because we were on the bus together and we barely even talked because the guy just chatted on and on with her. I knew he was into her however I thought that maybe she wasn’t into him back. That maybe we had something.

Yesterday, I was with her and a bunch of friends. They brought up the guy and they were telling her that he is definitely into her. She responded with “Then tell him to make a move.” Someone else said to “just think about it.” And she responded with “Oh I’ve already thought about it.”

This absolutely crushed me. I had to sit there and act like I wasn’t heartbroken. After that moment I guess I started acting distant and icy. I continued to avoid her today. 

Should I be avoiding her?? It’s not that I’m mad— I always knew deep down she would never have feelings back for me. However it hurts so much to see her and said guy flirting everyday at practice right in front of me. The way her eyes light up around him crushes me. I would do anything to make her look at me like that. Don’t get me wrong, the guy who likes her is a great guy and if she should be with anyone, it’s definitely him. I’m so heartbroken though. It’s all I could think about last night and today.

704,"Within the past few days, I found out that I more than likely have HSV.

From the information I've learned about HSV:

- 87.4% of the population have some form of HSV.
- HSV1 and HSV2 is not required within a STD screening.
- Doctors may only request screening if there is an outbreak or if there is a history of outbreaks.
- Blood tests specific for HSV-1 are not always accurate. Even after 6 months after infection, false positives and false negatives can still occur.
- The only accurate testings for HSV testing through use of culture, but they are mostly accurate when the virus is cultured from fluid filled lesions. These cultures are most accurate when a person is recently infected with the virus. 
- HSV is often asymptomatic, which means that many people who have it, are unaware that they have it.
- Use of condoms only reduce the chance of transmission by 50%. 
- Many people may still be at risk of infection even with use of condoms. 
- Due to the popularity of oral sex, oral herpes is easily transmitted as genital herpes.

Is there a point to disclosure? If it's that common, why should I risk the stigma associated with it by disclosing?

I had two of my most recent sexual partners do a full STD screening and they both (supposedly) tested negative for everything. That being said, they didnt even KNOW themselves they had it until I, myself, showed symptoms (though I'm sure they both assume I got it elsewhere, but I havent had sexual relations with anyone else for the past two months, and another month before the other, and so on and so forth). I've been with 10 people since the age of 20 (I'm now 22) and would not consider myself ""promiscuous"" at all.

707,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde said bye on their way out to me smiling. I wasn't I just felt uneasy, did they like me or mocking me?",03May2019,0
708,"So i (35m) like this girl (28f). She being s bartender , me being a daily customer as our businesses are very close in proximity.  To say it’s not a reciprocal love might be an understatement as well.  My question to you too good people of Reddit, how persistent is too persistent? At one point does one walk away.  We are very friendly and I’m almost certain she doesn’t view me as a creeper or anything like that just to give you context.  But she’s also not head over heels for me.  Can a heart be won over or should i keep it moving?  Would love advice from all ages and experiences!!",03May2019,1
709,"Hello reddit! This is my first time ever posting anything on Reddit. Also I am on mobile so sorry for any minor mistakes. I will try and go over and fix them. I really need help with this situation so of you could please help me I'd appreciate. Warning it's a long post!

So, along time ago when I was in 8th grade I had a best friend named (let's call her) J. I had known J since 1st grade, and our families sorta knew each other. Me and her had been getting very close that 8th grade year. And I loved it. We had so much fun and enjoyed each other's company. I also was very best friends at the time with a guy named A. Me and A talked everyday and had almost every class together. I had been bullied badly in 7th grade and developed some depression problems. And that year a huriccane flooded my house and one of my very close favorite relatives got serverly injured. So I was very depressed, and my depression spiralled. 

I introduced J to A. And J one day told me she had ask me if I liked A. And at the time I did not, so I said no. Well J started talking all the time to A and I noticed A talking to me less and less. And A was the only person to help me with my mental heath issues, so after A pretty much completely stoped talking to me my depression go extremely worse. 

A ended up tell J about my mental heath problems. After A stopped talking to me, so did J. And J &amp; all her close friends would treat me pretty badly. Like I wasn't even their friend anymore. It made me upset because I hadn't done anything to them. J ends up convincing A to start texting me to get information from me. So A does and I'm estatic. I didn't think it was to trick me. A tried triggering my mental heath problems and getting information out of me. And everything I said on text. Screenshotted and send to J. And J used this to exploit me as a ""A girl who tricks people into being nice to her because she is depressed and faking suicidal.""

Not a few days after A is doing this, J texts me extremely mean crap. I was so devastated. And I just gave the phone to my mom. This made J get quiet, then involve her mom too. Her mom claimed I was being depressed and acting suicidal for attention and spilled my secrets. My heart feel into pieces when I found out. J told everyone she could about me being a ""Fake depressed suicidal girl for attention."" I felt so alone.


Well now I'm a Sophmore in highschool and over it. Here's my current problem:

My boyfriend has a discord sever and invites one of J's good friends who we'll call T. T is a very nice guy and sweet. But when my boyfriend tells me T is in the server I get into a pull on panic attack. I'm so afraid J will manipulate T into finding dirt on me from the server and J will do something bad to me again. My boyfriend says I'm overreacting and T wouldn't do that. But I don't know. J is really good manipulation. I have another friend who went through a manipulation thing similar to mine with J. I've seen J get away with whatever she wants and it scares me. I want to leave the server but my boyfriend will be so upset. And I'm actaully thinking about dumping my boyfriend. It's going to be our one year in a week too. I'm thinking of dumping my boyfriend more than just the situation but this one tops is. Me and my boyfriend have been arguing a lot and I feel like he has began to love me less. I don't know maybe it's time for me to be a lone wolf again? But if I do im all alone again... I don't know.. I really love my boyfriend.. I'm stuck. Please help.

712,"Currently 50,000 in debt from undergrad (Kinesiology Degree). Also currently in a MS program as well while working full time. Am I wrong for contemplating dropping out just because I don’t want to take out anymore loans? The university offers very little opportunities when it comes to funding. The program is not hard and definitely doable, just the thought of more debt is insane. I am 24 and I always get the saying from older people saying “oh no stay in school your so young, don’t worry about the debt, that’s all good debt” But in reality I feel like debt is something that should be taken into consideration...",03May2019,1
713,"So last year I thought I'd found my dream job. I was taking photos of nature and the aurora at a remote resort, I got free dinner from the restaurant at night, and I got to meet people from all the world. But then things went really, really downhill really fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

First the GM left, then it became apparent how little organization there was. I stopped getting days off, my shifts got longer (no overtime, or even pay past my regular 10 hour shift that started becoming 12 or 13 hours). One of the owners would occasionally stop by and I'd talk to him about some of the problems I'd be having and he'd come up with solutions, but later in the day someone would tell me he was just telling me what I wanted to hear so he wouldn't have to deal with it. As more people jumped shift, the owners would hire people addicted to drugs who didn't do their jobs or went on week long benders, and my work load increased. 

&amp;#x200B;

In April the other owner had a long talk with me, and we worked out everything that would be necessary to get the place back together. I am now the only employee left. I am in charge of putting it all together, and I was really excited to try and restore it back to dream job status. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a few weeks ago (before the talk with the second owner) I applied to a job with the government, not thinking I'd get it. It has high pay, overtime, health insurance, a great adult job. I got a call this morning offering it to me. It would be highly stressful, it looks like it has a lot of turnover. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Do I stay with my old dream job and try to make it what it could be? I don't want to screw over the second owner, he's been really nice to me and I think he needs me specifically to do this work. But I also need to have health insurance, I'm tired of spending so much money on gas getting up to the resort, and there's no guarantee the dream job won't just close down from dept of labor citations and debt.",03May2019,1
714,"I'm worried that she doesn't understand the negative influence that culture can have. She says that rappers like Peep were ""sick"" and depressed, using drugs to cope with the fact that they have troubled pasts. 

Although true to an extent, at the same time she recently self diagnosed herself with depression and I'm worried she is going to use that as an excuse to start using drugs.
What should I do?",03May2019,2
715,"Ok so exams are here and I’m here studying my ass off to get those good marks .And like any normal freaking parent would be there supporting them .But mine they both left to go on a trip just for themselves . I’m here studying like a crazy sciatic bitch while they’re having some Relaxing time . I know parents want alone time away ,but the time that I need their full support they just leave . And obviously it sounds unfair but im human I want the advantages they are having . God , or someone is it wrong to be mad at them p.s I’m only 15 years so their life is baby free  so I don’t really understand why leave without me !",03May2019,2
716,"I've recently been offered a job, but it is a 40 minute drive away. Where I live 15 dollars an hour is minimum wage and he wants to pay me 17. 

I'm very torn because I have to leave at 7Am, an hour early, and most nights I won't get home until 6Pm. My vehicle is also a pig on gas and takes about 80 dollars to fill up which would last maybe 3 or 4 days of this drive. It would be like I'm getting paid 15 if you subtract the gas 

Most people are telling me to go and try it, but i also don't want to start then despise the drive and then quit and have him wasted all this time training me. I could find a job in my town if I keep looking, but I do really need a job as well. 

I keep thinking of getting off work and having a horribly long day then getting back in my car and having to drive 40 minutes just to get home. Ugh

717,"I honestly used to look at people with sex addictions and scoff in their direction. Karma is trying to get be back. 

I’ve never been super horny.. I used to masturbate maybe once every few months just for the hell of it. 

A week ago I tried putting something up me that wasn’t my fingers.. a hairbrush to be exact. It felt amazing. And now I’m obsessed with the feeling!

I’ve literally masturbated every single day MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY since then.. while my cousin was laying down on a different bed in the SAME room (didn’t know), in my mom’s bed and bathroom when that cousin was in my room.. like wtf. 

I don’t want to be this way.. it’s scaring me. Someone please help me figure out how to control the urge. I’m young, in my teens, and this really doesn’t feel right. :(",03May2019,3
718,"Exactly what the title says, I nearly got hit by a car a while ago (it was my fault, some people and I needed to jaywalk and I heard someone shout “Go” and just ran, nearly getting hit in the process) and though there was no fight about it or anything (the person who nearly hit me just drove off) I left with a heavy sense of guilt.

Ever since I always feel constantly anxious. I have no clue what brought it on but I’m thinking I’m just a bit shaken since. Of course I won’t jaywalk again anytime soon but is there any way to get rid of the unnecessary stress and anxiety? I’ve never been an anxious person so I’ve no clue what to do.

The anxiety only really hits when I’m alone- I’m not even sure if I should call it anxiety but the memory keeps crawling up on me. 

It isn’t me thinking “Oh god I almost died” either, it feels more like I need to apologize but can’t.",03May2019,2
