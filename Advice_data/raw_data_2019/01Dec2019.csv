1,"I [16M] have been playing games my dad [49M] baught me a gameboy advanced SP on my birthday, years ago.

video games have been my everything,my escape,my source of fun and even a way to meet others that have been closer to me then anyone can/ever will be.

I'm confident in my abilities to be a professional Rainbow six player but, my mom [51F] however sees this as a childish dream, moreover,my dad *wants* me to be what he is currently, a dentist.

I've been beat by my father before for telling him what I wanna be, I got called an idiot and shitstain by dad before just because I told him that wanna be a Pro R6 player.

My mom on the other hand just sees me as going through a phase and that I'll eventually choose something 'normal'.

She always uses excuses like,who would marry a ""pro cool gamer guy"" in this grimmy way and I wouldn't have a response.""I know as a mom I wouldn't let my daughter date an uneducated idiot"".

this is my dream,its everything that I want and it's what I need. 

I live in the most stereotypical country imaginable,Egypt. Where you're  retarded if you wanna be football pro until you're  mo Salah and everyone wants your money and signatures.",01Dec2019,1

So I’m up at 6 AM looking at images if you know what I mean and I click a random website to see others that I can get off to, I started looking at the tags and one of them is Lolicon and I was honestly curious to see what was on it, it can't be real right? Wrong. I was quickly bombarded with hard child porn. Kids that looked about 5-7 being entered by adults, pictures of them peeing in cups and even animals entering 3-7-month-old baby’s while they are screaming, I feel really shocked and disgusted. then I peered around the website and learned that this entire website is dedicated to child porn and bestiality. I don’t know what to do with this information, inform the authority's, I don't know who to call. My parents?

4,"I work as a manager for a major electronics repair store. We've got close to 600 locations nation wide. As of the 22nd I hit 3 years with this company, working for the same owner the entire time. Before we became a part of this company, I was with him and my boss as a small, family owned business. We pulled in so much money we were able to convert and he's since opened up 4 other locations.

Since opening up those other 4, I've been the manager of three of them. I've allowed him to uproot my wife, our 1 year old and I twice to move us to from Mississippi to Texas and then to Alabama. I work between 50 to 60 hours a week. When we were in Texas, I was working from 10am to 7pm literally every single day for 7 months. No off time whatsoever. When we got moved to Alabama I was finally starting to take one day off a week, but even then I'm still having to work from home, most days even having to come back up to the store for several hours throughout the day to help with repairs, customer issues, etc.

This isn't your typical repair store either. We work for all the major insurance companies, work for Samsung, work for Google and for several other companies like HP, Element, and the list goes on and on. Each of these companies has had me learn all of their processes and procedures, systems, software, hardware. All of it. It's A LOT to take in. I know that because I seem to be one of the only people in the company that can flow through these things without any trouble, but it's WAY stressful trying to memorize and teach these to other people and then having to go behind them and fix their mistakes.

On top of all of that, we also run a mobile repair unit, which I'm also the manager of. That all has it's separate processes and procedures, as well as managing a team of three people and helping them out in every way I can.

Then of course there's the smaller things I do as manager such as RMAing broken parts, sending off returns, doing the deposits every week, marketing runs, counting inventory several times a month and a few other small tasks.

With all of that being notated, I feel like I'm being majorly screwed over with my pay. I don't feel this way just for me, but for the guy who was originally my manager years ago and the other managers in the company that run the other stores now.

I make $35,000 a year. To me, that's a lot. I'm 23 and that's the most I've ever made. I can't tell if that's less than what I should be paid though. I feel like it is, but I also feel like maybe I'm too in my head? With all the skills I have, the knowledge of all of these companies processes and procedures, and all of the managerial duties I have to fulfill each day I'm here I feel like I should be making more. The guy who trained me makes maybe $2,000 to $3,000 more than me and he's been with the company for about 2 or 3 years more than I have. Every other manager makes a little less than both of us because they had no prior repair experience and are new to the company.

When I look up the average pay rate for a manager within the company, it's about $1,000 to $2,000 less than what I make, but of course that's just what's been reported on some website.

My wife wants me to leave here and find a different job because she feels I'm not being paid respectfully for everything I know and do up here, but like I said. I can't tell if I'm being underpaid or if I'm just getting in my head and being full of myself.

Am I being screwed over?",01Dec2019,1

the obvious answer to this is going into any like, store or restaurant to see who’s hiring. y’know, the typical part time jobs. but i’ve been there, done that. i worked as a server for a fair bit, and i loved my boss and the pay was decent! but i was getting to a point where i was dreading every shift, i just felt depressed and numb every time i had to go in. it started to effect my overall mental health outside of work, and my mental health is my first priority. plus it just plain fucking sucks to stand and walk in circles in a tiny area for hours. i always came back from work with my hips and back absolutely aching. i know it’s the norm for “unskilled” jobs like that, but i just can’t tolerate it anymore. there *has* to be something else out there. i have so much more potential than just smiling and talking nice to people while catering to their every whim. 

sorry, i don’t mean to sound spoiled or anything ;-; i just had to ask. does anyone out there think there’s another solution to this? are there any jobs out there that don’t require me to stand for hours and act like a happy, robotic servant? i’ll even show my god damn resume if it’ll help!! thanks!!!",01Dec2019,1

20,"I am estranged from my mother as she refuses to get mental help for a bunch of issues and is a toxic person with anger issues. However she continues to insert herself into what should be special occasions by crossing boundaries. 

For example, she emails my inlaws for my anniversary to congratulate them. Or on the birthday of my husband, his family will get an email from her to congratulate them. She has met my parents in law twice and has never met the rest. She sends gifts to my inlaws and their kids. I find this incredibly embarrassing. I also am concerned as she does not work and my dad earns less than I do. Eventually they will be dependent on me and my two other siblings and she continues to spend a ridiculous amount of money sending gifts to people she doesn’t know (inlaws of my brother and sister and their extended families). She sends unsolicited emails marking random days to extended family members she’s barely met. I’ve asked her numerous times to stop contacting at least my inlaws especially since she and I have no relationship but she counters by saying they write to say thanks when she sends them stuff. To me it’s clearly a sign she seeks validation from strangers as she has pushed away her own kids. How do I get her to stop. Perhaps it shouldn’t bother me but on principle she should be able to stop messaging or contacting my inlaws because I ask right? Or is that unreasonable?",01Dec2019,1

So just this past few weeks my gf suddenly became cold to me, it's just a simple mistake I believe (I added someone on Facebook because he showed up on my suggested friend).

After that things have gone south, she suddenly became cold to me to the point she's like zombieing me (term for not talking to you for a long time then comes back with a reason and then repeats it again). I've been trying to ask her if she has somebody else already but she kept saying no or if she have she'll tell me and goes on about being friends only, no commitments.

3 weeks passed which is today, I brought it up again our current status. She then told me she met somebody else and when I asked her if she already has feelings for him or does she love him already, she just said ""Maybe, maybe not."" I then lost it and go on about how I trusted her, how much I loved her, the efforts, being faithful. I asked, out of respect, to who the guy is. How did he surpass me. How is he better than me. She doesn't want to tell me. Says she don't love me anymore instead.

Conversations with different males spanning up to months from now. Turns out she was cheating months prior to this discovery. She even talks about doing stuffs that she does to me. She's super sweet, sweeter than how she even was to me. I'm devastated. I don't know what to do anymore. I've gone now 24 hours no sleep.

26,"When I was a kid, I never wanted to brush my teeth because of this, I later went on to have many cavities and eventually get two teeth pulled (the same one as an adult and baby tooth). I started out with a spacer before my adult tooth came in, hated it, and was so glad to be rid of it. Then my adult tooth cracked years ago and was pulled then. For years I just had a hole in my mouth where the tooth was with the one tooth behind it just sitting there. My spacer gave me pain and mouth issues that served to make me miserable at times.

Now, I switched dentists and was told that I needed to get another one in order to keep my tooth behind it from moving downward and eventually going back into my gum and causing me excruciating pain. So here I am, years later, with a spacer in my mouth once again, and I absolutely hate it. I was very much happy without the spacer but cannot deny that my back tooth did move downward quite a bit over the time there was nothing there. I want to get it removed and just say to hell with it, but I do care about my teeth now. The plan is that once my wisdom teeth come in the spacer will be removed and a bridge will be put in once those are likely pulled. I, however, do not want to keep my spacer ever, preferably not getting a bridge either. I have found that my cavities have gone up since I got it, my teeth sensitivity, and jaw/mouth pain.

He wanted me to get a job in his city so I’d be closer to home if anything happened and we could start a family. Fast forward 6 months and he broke up with me and sent me packing back to live with my Mom (45 mins away) but I kept my job in his area. My co workers have been such an amazing support system for me going through this break up but unfortunately the job is only 25 hours but they’ve been giving me 35. I applied for a FT job in my area and the interviews really turned me off. It was like a battle of convincing them that I’m qualified. I ended up being offered the job but the pros and cons of each job are about the same.  More money at the new one but guaranteed happiness and support at the other. The only major downside to keeping current job is that I feel it keeps me connected to my ex. We didn’t end in bad terms but it’s very hard knowing he’s so close and I can’t see him/be with him (small town) I know I have every right to be in that city as well.

As of right now, I’m 15 but I’ll be 16 in April. Should I get the tattoo then or should I wait until 17 or 18? (Idk if it’s different for other states but for MD, you can get a tattoo at 16 with parental permission).",01Dec2019,1

So my grandma came into my room earlier and had a heart to heart with me. She told me how heart broken she was learning that my sister had sex already and is taking birth control. My grandma believes that you should wait til marriage to have sex because she does not want my sister to have a baby and have the bf leave my sister and the baby or other people complaining how my sister would then be a slut; sleeping with so many guys. She also said once you graduate college and have a job, then it's a little more tolerable if i had sex (which ima graduate college in the spring). I understand why she's upset, we both cried and hugged. My grandma is not the type to cry openly and she's been through a lot (fishing town in Vietnam and escaped by boat during Vietnam war with the help of a sponsor). My mother was pregnant with me, her first child, before she graduated college. Everyone family member shamed and laughed at my grandma for being a horrible mother and how she doesn't know how to raise kids. So my grandma told me to wait when i see my bf.

This new job that I got accepted for has terrible hours-work: Monday to friday I would start from 1PM to 9PM, and on saturdays from 8AM to 4PM. Althought I said I was for sure gonna take this job to the girl who interviewed me, I didn't sign any papers nor did I provide her with my documents. I didn't quit my current job either. There is a possibility that I might be fired from my current one (based on how I have been treated lately). My vacation starts on december 18th and the new job would start in january 13th. I googled other places to work and found 2 options with better hours-work.

Also, I just wanna have free time! Is that lazy/entitled of me? I really can't tell. On monday I plan to distribute my CV to both companies I mentioned above, but of course I don't know if I'm gonna even get a chance of an interview. I also don't want to let too much time pass so then the job I got accepted for will have enough time to replace me.

39,"I’m a 16 year old female and my parents control every aspect of my life. I am not allowed to go to sleepovers, only allowed to go out 2 times a month and sometimes not even that. I feel I am isolated from all of my friends because I am unable to experience basic things like staying over at a friends house. Also, my parents seem to not care about my future at all. Whenever I bring up college, driving or even getting a job they get angry at me and insist that I am acting “grown” and their reasoning for why I can’t do these, these activities that will help me as adult, is because they “said so” ( basically have no reasoning). I also struggled with depression and suicidal thought since I have been 12 years old. My mom used to taunt me and tell me whenever I was upset, “you better not be having no suicidal thoughts”. WHENEVER I WAS SAD, or seemed to not be HAPPY CONSTANTLY. She does not do that anymore but that really sticks with me and makes me very distant. My mom forced me to be in the ap and honors magnet where my gpa is dropping because I am struggling to pay attention in class and do my work. And when bring up dropping but still taking honors level classes she refuses. My mom gets mad for anything over my younger sister. My younger sister has gotten recommended for expulsion for fighting yet she gets no punishment and gets keep her phone while I get my phone taken almost everyday because I have an “attitude”. It feels like I can never be a good enough daughter, even though I try my best. My whole situation makes me very upset and many I cry over not being my life and feeling like I have little to no control.

I (26/M) hooked up with my roommate (26/F) yesterday. We spent all day together just laying on the couch cuddling kissing and hooking up. I told her how I felt that I think I’m basically in love with her and that this was something I wanted for a little while now. She basically rejected me saying that she didn’t want to lose our friendship (were best friends been that way for years) that the whole thing is weird and she doesn’t know how to feel. She wants everything to go back to normal and act like this never happened. Before I left we talked about hooking up again in the future and she said “oh yea definitely”

I don’t think I can go back to normal, I think I’m in love with this woman but I don’t think she feels as deeply about me as I do her. I’m thinking about just moving out and basically running away from her. I’m out of town for a few days started today so I have a little bit to figure this out before I have to go home. I think I have 2 option when I get back. 

1. I go home sit her down and lay all the cards on the table. Tell her how I feel what I think we could be and that even though the timing is weird we could make this work. That I don’t do this and that I just want her to know how much I care about her and see what she says. If it doesn’t go well I’ll move out.

2.  I go home and play it cool. Casually hook up with her and hope that eventually she feels for me like I feel for her.

47,"Hello,

I met and married my husband and moved to London in 2016. I attended college there, but not University and I'm currently saving for University. I have saved roughly £10,000 but know I can never afford it in England and would have to go abroad.

It took me two years to get everything set up to where I could work, open an account, and be useful really, and I have had a job for about two years now.

I hate my job and I hate getting to in the morning. I've gotten to the point where I wouldn't mind not existing anymore.

Recently, I went home to America. I'm currently waiting to board my flight to London with my husband.

I just can't justify going back. My family is here, my friends are here, I hate my life more than anything there.

I just don't know how to move back or if I should... Mostly because I'm going to have to get a green card for my husband and for enough funds to go to uni and basically restart again, although this time with help.

I'm not sure what to do, but I can't continue the way I am much longer.",01Dec2019,2
48,"TL;DR: I’m a heterosexual female with her first ever crush on another female and I’m confused. 

So I typically identify as a heterosexual female. I’m (very!) happily married to a man, and have only ever dated/been with males. So this makes the situation even more confusing to me. 

I’d like to start of by saying I’m under no delusions that this woman has any interest in me and I have absolutely no motivation to pursue anything outside of some fun fantasies, I just need to talk this through. 

I have this wonderful female physician. She’s smart, funny, and, like, out of this world gorgeous. She and I have a lot of common interests and hobbies (she friended me on social media so I have a limited insight on her personal life). We get along really well. And this is where things get confusing for me. My usual thought process when I meet someone like this:

Brain: WOW! She’s so cool and fun and pretty!We should be her friend. 

Me: Yeah! 

My current thought process:

Brain: WOW! She’s so cool and fun and pretty! You should put your hands all over her body and kiss her and get her naked!

Me: Yeah! ...wait. What?! 

I have no clue why I’m feeling this strong attraction to her. It’s intense. I’m not necessarily freaked out that I have a crush on a woman, but my poor libido and brain are just so confused. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for. Commiseration? Advice? Could I be bisexual? Is this a one-off? I just needed a place to air my thoughts.",01Dec2019,0

53,"So I moved into my new house a few months ago, but have been so busy with college &amp; work that I barely spend any time there. It's a digs type situation - I live with the Landlady (mid 50s) and her brother (mid 40s). I am very lucky to have the accommodation, because it's so close to my college, and there is a severe housing crisis in this area. 
In the kitchen there is a large glass case full of ornaments and other little things, which I never really took too much notice of before. Just by chance, a few days ago, I was looking a little closer at some of the ornaments, and I noticed a tiny little gold chalice, with several swastikas as a pattern. I was shocked.
Here's my problem - do I mention this to the landlady? If so, how? There are so many possibilities running through my mind, like maybe she doesn't know what a swastika represents? Or maybe it's a keepsake from her late father, who she mentions often? Or, maybe she is a Nazi sympathiser after all? I'm reluctant to mention it, because if she evicts me because of it, I'll probably never find a better house, and yet I'm not quite comfortable with sharing a house with someone who shares that mindset.

59,"Hi,

So for the past few weeks I feel like I’m irritated by most things my girlfriend does and she seems to be irritated with most things I do, even the smallest of things.
After the first 3 or so months of being with her, I would feel a glowing feeling in my heart and I believed this to be the feeling of love - I haven’t felt that with her for at least 2 months.
She really broke my trust at one point when I found out she had been lying to me about something major but I did forgive her and she did seem to change after. Recently, it feels as if she has been more distant again and I’m finding it hard to believe that she’s not lying to me again but I can’t just ask her because my mind will think that somethings going on even if she says there’s nothing.
I told myself that this is what being in a relationship is like. Every adult relationship I have seen has either always ended in a divorce/break up or the two people just tolerating each other.  I tell myself that every relationship has hardships and you just have to work through it and we do communicate about how we feel but it just doesn’t seem to ever feel properly fixed. We just feel guilty about making each other upset.
She does make me happy. I love the jokes we have, I love the intimacy we have - I can’t ever imagine being as close as I am with her with anyone else. We have so much in common and we have taught each other so much. The thought of us not being together is so hard hitting I tear up just thinking about it.
I do love her but I just don’t feel the love like I used to. 
I think it’s these reasons why I feel like it’s so hard to end things. Plus the fact that it was my birthday a few days ago and it’s almost our 1 year anniversary together... and we also live with each other. We got together after being uni friends and deciding to live with some friends in uni accommodation.

I usually link with this guy everyday to so if he’s bored I understand or I don’t get why if he was busy he couldn’t just tell me he was busy when I asked him what he was doing.

For example, today my dad asked me why I didn’t like a certain college and then proceeded to ask me “Oh, is it not white enough for you?” Like, what the hell, why would you say that to me? Also, any time my mom interacts with a white person, she’s all fake smiles, but as soon as we leave their earshot, she has the nerve to say “They on some white people shit...” or just some off handed comment on how all of them are terrible. 
Literally every time I comment on their remarks, they side eye me and tell me I’m not “standing with my own people”, the fuck?? They always want to blame any and every mishap that they have on white people, whether it’s traffic, or people shopping for the holidays, any dumb fucking reason you can think of, it’s automatically their fault. They are also borderline monitoring who I talk to, and are always quick and **strongly** suggest I do not date outside of my race. 

I hate that they’re like this because their mentality is that **literally every white person ever is a bad person**. They insist they’re joking, but these comments are made every single day and their tones suggest that they are hardly joking whatsoever. I’m fed up with it.

Hello people of reddit, I need some advice. Last year I had met someone from tinder and I had a vibe about him. I haven’t had this vibe with anyone else. So anyway we met up and started dating not long after. He was very nice and sweet. We will call him Erick. Before I had met Erick I was in a very toxic relationship and Erick had helped me deal with the aftermath of it. Just by showing me how much he actually cared about me.  But things went downhill a bit too quickly. I had found out he spoken shit about me saying that I was clingy and something about me going through his phone and apparently I didn’t listen to him. But in my defence he didn’t say anything and I thought everything was okay between us and but I did have a feeling something was wrong. He had also mentioned to his person that I had asked to “keep” his Jumper I meant it as “borrow” and was going to return it. If he had given it to me. But he didn’t because his mum would ask questions on where it was and he had explain that to me. Which was understandable. Apparently people were telling him to break up with me. This was to all to a another person keep in mind so I wasn’t aware until they had told me about it. I had confronted him about it and told him if I’m doing anything wrong please tell me and his response was “well girls get up set easy and I didn’t want to hurt you” um what? Because apparently talking shit about someone. Isn’t going to hurt them and it did. 
 I haven’t mentioned this yet but Erick was 22 and I was 18. At the time of his happening. Then there was thing about his parents. Erick was 22 and owned his our house, lived with an old friend of his and both of his parents. He had never told his mum we were together because of some reason apparently she was control freak and liked starting shit with him. Because of this was wanted “space” and I gave him “space” I gave him space for about two days and asked if he was okay. No reposne. A week passed and I sent him another message “is everything okay, I hope you’re okay. You could come over if you wanted to help take your mind off things” and he got angry at me apparently he meant “break” not “space” nothing was mentioned about a “break” In the end he had broken up with me because he couldn’t handle being in a relationship and apparently he will always love me and can try again in the future.
In April of 2019 I had sent him a message we hadn’t really spoken since the break up and we started talking again. He had asked about trying things again in the future and that he hasn’t been speaking to anyone since our break up. Anyway comes around May-June. He has started seeing someone who was in her late 20s so anyway. We didn’t talk for about two weeks and then he had messaged me saying he missed me and started flirting with me and he was still with this girl. Then he started saying shit about her lifestyle and how her kids got taken away from her at 18 or something. I thought this was funny because he did the same thing to me, to someone else. The talking shit part of course. He ended up breaking up with her. In August I made a new Snapchat. Because of bad memories and stuff and I wasn’t going to add him on my new account due to him ignoring me for a good few days and stuff. Even while being on the app. But he sweet talked saying how much he missed me and stuff. I added him on the new account
 (yes I’m stupid) 
October 2019
The ignoring me for a few days thing was still happening, then he had messaged me asking me if he could come over and I replied with “I don’t know” him: “why?” 
Me: “because I’m spotting down there and I don’t want to have what happened last year happen again” basically I started bleeding while we were having sex and that was the last time I had seen him. It actually wasn’t too bad just really embarrassing plus I’m on birth control so it just happens. :/
Him: “oh yeah that was bad and was disgusting”
Me: “well woman bleed so yeah”
Him: “we will catch up when your not bleeding”
Edit: I got really pissed when he had said this. 

November: 2019 
He had asked me if we could work things out after his family problems were dealt with again and this time I said “i don’t know” “well we can work something out” two days later, so yesterday morning. I was on tinder and I found him on there in his bio it said “hope to meet new people and that special someone” I messaged him saying “I am really fucking confused, saying to me that we could work things then I find you on tinder, nothing wrong with that, but if you have family problems wouldn’t you deal with that first before meeting someone. Because if shit hits the fan you’re probably just gonna break up with them and break their heart.”

Edit he is nearly 24 and I’m nearly 20. Now I have removed him and tried to cut him out of my life many times. but we just end up talking again. Also I felt a number of times. No matter how hard I tired to be there for him while we were together. It didn’t feel like it was enough. Also he had about two or three relationships and I’ve been single since we broke up.

Should I bring it up to him? It’s I suppose “public knowledge” because the post was set to public but I don’t know if it’s appropriate because although we’re friends, we’re also co-workers. I feel like as we’ve talked quite a lot about our personal lives it wouldn’t be a problem but I’m still nervous &amp; I don’t know if I should bring it up to him first or just let him tell me. Earlier he said he was only about 50% happy in his (long term) relationship. Like I said before, it seems abusive from what he’s told me. What should I do? I’m working with him again in 5 hours.

Well, I joined the website and made an account with a fake email. One of my ""best"" friends was an owner of the website, I was telling him advice to help the server and I was going to make a detailed document of how to help the server and stuff, well in  the middle of typing it out my internet went out and I was trying to fix my internet when I made the joke to my friend who was an owner that I was getting ""DDoSed"" . well, when my internet went back up I went to the websites discord and one of the other owners was say about how he DDosed me and keep in mind the only person I told it to was the other guy. so went on to my discord server and tell all the people there not to click the link because it is an IP grabber. and The guy who DDoSed me lets call him Big guy, was saying to me on the websites discord about how I was talking ""Shit"" and is now threatening me with DDoSing me again.

84,"Alright, need help with this one.

I have a friend, very nice guy I get along well with, but I just don’t want to date him. No particular reason, just not the right fit, y’know?

So, a few weeks back, he told me he had two questions, and that the answers to each did not affect each other.

The first one was, would I go on a date with him? I told him no, that I’m not currently in a place where I’m even remotely interested in dating (which is 100% true). He accepted that answer with grace, and told me he understood.

The next question was, would I want to go on a trip with him? Now mind you, this trip would be to a country I’ve been dying to go to since I was a kid. It wouldn’t be 100% free, but he would cover airfare.

I thought about it for a while, but I told him no, because I’m about to start a new job and don’t know if I can get the time off. (Which is true).

He said okay, but let him know if anything changes. So, the offer is still open.

I’m dying to go to this country, and I know he wouldn’t pressure me in any way to do anything, but, I would still feel weird and, I guess “in debt”, in a way, going on this trip. 

So, Reddit, should I go or not?",01Dec2019,1

This thought is seriously stressing me out cause I was planning on telling her how I feel about her the next time I see her in person but if she has a BF then I don’t think there’s any point. My problem is that I can’t ask her doer two main reasons: Firstly I have no way of communicating with her except in person (which is hardly ever possible) since we don’t share any common friends that would be aware of her relationship status also we don’t have each other’s numbers or email addresses. The second problem is that even if I could find a way to communicate with her I would not be able to bring myself to ask her if she had a BF since it feels like a bit of a weird question to ask and honestly I’m too scared to even mention it. So is there any way I can find out other that the already mentioned ways that wouldn’t work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks!

88,"I don't really know where to start here, but essentially I feel I'm financially able to live by myself with my job and I want to move out of my house with my parents. My parents have been abusive and manipulative towards me since birth. I don't really know how to TLDR this whole situation too easily, but pretty much how it is now is this;  


My mom is just too lazy to get up and do anything anymore. She just sits on the couch and has me and my dad do everything for her. She claims she's constantly in pain all the time but I think that's a lie. I've seen her get up and do basic tasks all the time before. She doesn't have a job and she sits down and thinks of stuff for me and my dad to do all day until we get home from our own jobs and bombards us with demands and ultimatums. She always claims she is correct and right, and doesn't take any ounce of disagreement as something constructive. She wakes me up extremely early in the morning, every morning, ignoring whether or not it was possible at all for me to get 8 hours of sleep so I'm constantly tired all the time. She always tells me I'm doing my job poorly, or that I don't work hard enough. She tells me to keep spending money on things I don't need or want, but I think that's just because she knows I'm trying to move out.  


My dad is similar. He's lazy all the time because he is too tired to do anything because of my mom's life style and constant abuse. He is underweight and doesn't eat and is self destructive. He just wakes up every morning and does what he is told to do my my mom like a robot. He makes me do stupid unnecessary things I don't want to do, or deem worthy of doing, to keep my mom happy. He never tells her no to anything and is a general pushover to everyone in life. He never cleans. He is an aggressive hoarder and drops trash in his room all over.  


We live with my mom's dad as well, but he also doesn't do anything all day. He just yells at us for not doing things the way he wants things to be done and doesn't pay rent. I personally don't respect him at all, but I'm told I should and I don't agree with it. He's called me useless because I don't like doing all the extra things around the house that he thinks is what needs to be done. He purposefully does things to mess up our own activities or schedules. I've even had to move my hair gel and toothbrush out of my own bathroom because he would use it the entire time before I would have to leave for work, which has caused issues numerous times.  


We have two dogs and a cat and... One of the dogs, or well both of them, I really care about. I care about them enough to want to take them to where I want to move too, but not enough to... Really enact upon it. I don't want the responsibility of the animals being owned by me, either.   


It's just... I feel so tired all the time. I'll work 8-9 hour shifts and come home and my mom will be telling me to vacuum or do my laundry or that I'm a failure because I didn't do something correctly before I left for work. I just want to sit down on my days off and truly relax instead of having to do all these extra unnecessary things she wants done. I wish she would just relax and leave me and my dad alone as opposed to making us clean the entire house every other day. Is this how normal people live? Is this how I'm supposed to live? Is it wrong to just want to live in an apartment with my friend apart from my family I don't care about? I don't know what else to do because I don't want to live here anymore. I want to advance in my life. I want to have the confidence and ability to be able to bring friends or coworkers to my house and hang out with them. Instead I'm forced to worry about the homeostasis of a house of people able to do things but just won't, and instead me have to almost do everything around here. If it wasn't for the animals we own it would be different. But I don't want to put them up for adoption or give them away. They want to be with the people they have known their whole lives and I can't bear to put them somewhere new and scary, and in a cruel way, I don't want the responsibility for just owning them either. I feel I'm just at a huge moral impasse, but on the other end is a more happy existence where I can relax and have a reason to smile when I come home and wake up. I'm tired of having these responsibilities I don't want to do here and dealing with these people who have never respected me and just call me worthless. It's not like I don't voluntarily clean at all or ever do my laundry, I will, it's just she wants all these things done everyday and that's exhausting. I don't know what to do.",01Dec2019,1

I take responsibility for allowing this to happen.

He is abusive to me emotionally and verbally and very rarely physically. Without going into details on that, I am ready now to leave. I do love him more than anything, he is my whole life - but I know this isn’t it for me. I won’t survive if I stay, and I mean that literally. I need to go.

The biggest thing holding me back: I have nothing. No license, no money, no job, no friends or family or place to crash. Nothing. And I love in a very cold part of the country. Part of me thinks I should pack a bag and hitchhike somewhere warm but part of me is terrified of losing him and all of the comfort and protection he gives me in a lot of ways.

99,"   Lately my father has been trying to get back with my mom by calling and acting all nice and flirty with her, claiming that he has been going to a therapist and that he's sorry for all of his actions and that he hadn't realised how much she meant for him. 
   The thing is, he has always been like this. For 18 years everytime my mother was about to divorce him he would always put on the nice side until the ""waters"" were calm, in which he would proceed to behave the same way he has always had: fights, beatings, cheating, dominance, etc..

   Since us 3 (my sister, mom and I) moved out of the house, my mom has been feeling kinda lonely. Even though my father acts the way he does, he did keep my mom company (even if it wasn't good company), and that's something my sister and I cannot provide her since ""it isn't the same"" for her. 

   My mom is utterly convinced that my father has truly changed, and she's willing to give him another chance since she wants us all to be a big happy family, but we will never be, since my sister and I both truly hate our father. We won't forgive everything that he has done to mom.

   We are glad that she finally got divorced after 18 years of torture and we don't want her to get caught in his lies again, so when she asked what we thought we both refused on the idea of bringing him back. 
   But after a few more hours of thinking, my sister and I decided we would accept the idea of bringing him back even if it meant us two faking that we got along with him, all because she has truly done so much for us and this is the least we can do.

   We don't know if to tell her though, since we're scared that he's faking the change and is only doing it so he can live a worry free life (cause my mother used to do everything for him), and when he gets a hold of her he will start acting the same abusive way.

Maybe it will seem like it's really small problem in comparison to others on this sub but I dont think it is for me anymore. So let's start from the beginning I met my friend 4 years ago in school we started talking and immediately really liked each other (in a friendly sense). After a couple of months I developed a crush on her so I confessed to those feelings to her but got rejected. Couple months go by and we are best friends now, in the meantime I started talking to and developing a crush on other girl a really good friend of my bestfriend but it didn't go anywhere because she became toxic. After this situation I found myself again crushing my best friend for around half a year but I knew it was bad so I started dating a girl that I didnt have feelings for because a thought this could help my feelings. But as it turns out forced relationships dont work. So I started feeling down again. After a couple of months my bestfriend confessed to me that she has a strong feelings for the other girl in our friends group so I did everything I could to set them up for her to confess her feelings even though I was hurting on because I think then I realized that I didnt just had a crush on her but I loved her. I set them up, she confessed her feelings and got rejected. After around 2 months we started to be super close to each other and ended up dating. It was a dream come true for me but then we started drifting away as a couple and she said she didn't love me in romantic way so we ended up mutually breaking up (I didn't want to but I also didnt want to hurt our friendship). We stayed best friends but I still had romantics feelings for her. I told her after 3 months that I still loved her but she didnt know what to do to help me forget her without hurting our friendship. And now she met different guy that its clear he is intrested in her and she likes him (but she still doesn't know how she feels about him) and I'm I so much pain because of it. I dont know why I'm jealous. I dont know why I just cant move on. It's really hard for me to listen to her about that guy and I dont know what I can do to ease my pain and just be happy.

103,"So my brother has decided to marry his girlfriend of about 4+ years and problems have been arising in my family. 
First of all, my family is from China and it is common that the girl, once she gets married into the family, comes and lives in the guy’s family home (in my case, my brother lives with my grandma in the house my grandfather left him and my parents and I live in a different country). Here where the problem is, my aunt (my dad’s sister) is a b*tch who doesn’t care about my dad or my family, and all she wants is money. My late grandfather left my grandma two houses, one for my brother and one for my aunt. One house was bigger than the other so my aunt wanted the bigger one. Since my dad didn’t want to fight anymore, he agreed to it even though it was supposed to be for my brother. Now, from what I understand, the “title” of the house (the one my grandma and brother are staying at) is in the name of my grandma, and for her to change the name to my brother’s name, my aunt has to sign some papers, but now she doesn’t want to and wants to give this house to my cousin. 
Because of this, as the house is not in my brother’s name, the girl’s family doesn’t want her to get married (which I completely understand as you may want a stable house for your daughter). But, at the same time, they want her to get married before October of next year because this engagement period has been too long for them (another big problem since I don’t live in the same country as them, I have to fly there but I am still studying so I can’t just up and go and leave for a week or more)
Now, my grandma has been annoyed at her for things she does, like entering our house (with my brother’s key) and taking stuff without even saying hi to my grandma. 
So here is where I appear, I’m stuck between cursing at my brother’s girlfriend for not understanding the dilemma my family is in and keeping quiet and have the parents solve it by themselves (but that is quite a challenge since they don’t live in the same country). I’m a very vocal person, in the sense that I want to express my opinion, and I love my family, so seeing them be in such a dilemma is killing me inside and I just want to ask for advice.",01Dec2019,1

So in a fit of emotions I went over there just after the incident - which would have been 4:30AM - and saw her. The short story is that she said she felt super bad and would pay for vet bills.
There was no vet bills. So she said she would pay for the cremation and the vase he would go in. $300 in total.
 
Now I'm not a guy that is going to try extort money from this lady. I used to work as a debt collector so I understand times can be tough. Plus she has no legal requirement to pay it. BUT. I have come home from work every day now to her dogs being out of the house. In fact some mornings when I wake up at 4:00AM they are out.

So far i have a name, she claimed she is 22, the thing is she accepted for us to meet in a crowded area, so i can't really tell if it's a prank, scam or actually real, what would you do if you were in my shoes? I would park somewhere close, check the area and when she calls,  follow the line and see who is at the phone, any better options? Thanks in advance!",01Dec2019,1

I dont know what to do and were in public right now. I'm having a really hard time and just need some advice. She has always been slightly toxic but this is the worst by far. She is using her depression and anxiety as a escape goat and keeps saying ""no one does anything for me"" when she knows In the past week I have done as much as I can to help her, and I also have these things, and guess what mom, mine are not as managed as yours.

116,"
So me (18 yr old F) and my boyfriend (19 yr old M) have been together for 3 years this past October. Just yesterday I got on his snapchat and I seen he was talking to a girl.. I keep looking and it’s a fake account he made exactly a week ago(made sure of it , hasn’t been longer) . He wasn’t saying nothing bad and he was talking about how he loved me to this girl and the rest was just like friendly talk from what I can see. I also seen he added two of his ex girlfriends but they didn’t have no conversation at all he also added another girl and all he said was “single?” And she didn’t not reply. He was sleeping while I did this so I woke him and I felt so much hurt in my heart and started bawling. I left him and came to my moms and he keeps apologizing and he knows he fucked up and he said he didn’t do nothing physical or talked to them in any flirty way but this is still NOT okay to me. He has been crying and begging me to just listen to him and he said he doesn’t even know why he did that, that he just did and had no intentions on hurting me with this by doing this. I love him so much but when I’m in a relationship I want to feel secure by knowing how we stand in our relationship and the fact that I have lack of trust with him doesn’t help with that at all. I know I’m worthy of more and im enough and a good person to be loved right but I also want to know I’m the only one they’re interested in, only girl he has his eyes on, ( I don’t want to be with someone’s who has other girls on his mind) which he says he only wants me but I don’t see where the necessity was for him to have gone to make a fake account to do that and he said he doesn’t know why he even did it, that he just did it and that he knows he fucked up but he wasn’t doing anything “wrong” just friendly talk ( but I can only see chats not actually snaps). I want to be with him but a huge part of me doesn’t want to deal with that but I feel like we still got so much to do together. I’ve also felt like I have gotten too dependent on him and I don’t feel like I know how to be alone no more which I want to work on because I really do dislike a lot about myself and I want to love myself and be okay with myself but it’s just like he is my best friend and it’s just so hard to think about us not being together. I need advice on what I should do basically stay and work it out with him OR leave and work on myself and see how that goes.
TL/DR 
“Boyfriend of 3 years made fake account exactly one week ago to talk to a girl. Nothing flirtatious was said and he mentioned me and talked about him loving me. Still did it behind my back. Lack of trust for him and I love him and he loves me but I’m not sure still being in the relationship is good for me.”",01Dec2019,1
117,"So my fiancé used to work at a fast food restaurant and he met a girl there, they weren’t really close but he’s really nice to everyone so the girl developed a crush on him and tried to break him up with his current girlfriend, now his ex, to be with him. That didn’t work out too well for her but he still remained friendly towards that girl. 

Eventually, she started borrowing money from him and, him being really nice, he lent him some. This escalated very quickly, even when he left the restaurant job, and she now owes him about $12,000. But the problem is, she won’t stop trying to contact him asking for more. He keeps on telling her no and blocking her on messenger but she keeps on making new accounts and hounding him.

When my fiancé and I got together, he told me everything and I took it upon myself to deal with her because she would not stop no matter what he says to her. At first, I tried talking calmly to her and explaining to her that he doesn’t wanna give her anymore money and telling her to stop. Until eventually I just started spamming her with nonsensical things (I copy pasted the whole pride and prejudice book and sent it to her). Then I just started hurling insults at her. This made her stop for a while but after a few weeks she contacts him again and she keeps on saying that she’s borrowing from him and not me and it’s none of my business. This is taking a toll on my fiancé as she calls him at random times and he blocks her but she keeps on popping back up like a bad zit.

Sorry for the wall of text, we’re both at our wits end with this girl and she just keeps on making new accounts and we just want her to stop. Any advice?",01Dec2019,1
118,"   My parents and me were all a bit overweight, I started working out and my dad has too, but my mom makes little effort to get in shape. She's tried the keto diet only to drop out after a few weeks, and every time I get her to workout with me she either does only half of it or has some excuse like back pain. I totally understand that she's older so her body isn't as strong, and that she does have the stress of work, so I don't want to pressure her into exercising too much. 
   Yes, she has lost some weight and tries to eat less but she talks about how she wants to lose weight and diet but she never does. I try to get her to do some of the lighter exercises but she usually finds an excuse not to do it. 
   I just want some advice on how to help her, I've tried being as supportive as possible and I want to see her fit and healthy but I just don't know how to help her anymore at this point. It's frustrating to see her unhappy with her body and not willing to do anything for it either.

121,"Title says it all. Let me explain why I feel this way because my English professor really opened some doors to me that I haven’t recognized within me and it kinda shocked me but I’m glad I got to the roots of it.
So we were talking about racism and stuff . And I spoke to him how I felt I was racist towards my own kind. For example whenever I seen my own kind online I would compare or judge them or just feel negatively towards them. IDK WHY. Every other race like it’s normal but my kind it feels that way. Same in Public. Whenever I run into my kind I immediately think they have big egos or if I run into any female my kind I just FLEE.
Even saying the word Indian gives me negative vibes within me and I hate using that word. My English professor was letting me know that maybe the reason why you feel this way was because of all the abuse I gone through. My dad is a narcissist. I overcame that still am dealin with it but I know who i am and I overcame my depression . Every Indian I was around I felt so negatively about them maybe they were my dads friends but yea you get the point. He was explaining how I should expand my circle and continue to meet other people my kind because of the small data base i got experiencing with other people my kind.

I’m glad I’m aware of this because in the future I do want to break the cycle of abuse . I want a healthy family dynamic and I want to allow my kids to grow and allow them to make mistakes and guide them with tools to Face the real world and same goes when I eventually have a spouse. I don’t want to be that ego maniac my dad was I want it to be a team effort and yea. And before I can do all this I need to eliminate this fucking racism inside of me. It honestly makes me feel so bad because this isn’t who I am but it feels so deeply in rooted inside of me and I need advice or if anyone overcame this.. 

And quite frankly this might be embarrassing to say but I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin. I feel comfortable with myself but there’s days where I hate my race and like I’m trying to accept that this is who I am and the people outside of me don’t define who I am but when I see shit that my race does I immediately feel like shit because it feels like people would judge me based of my race.This was hard for me to type this but I apologize if I offended anyone I just need help I’m 19 M.",01Dec2019,1

I ultimately stopped replying to her texts and went ghost. I know this is kind of an asshole'ish thing to do but I didn't know how to properly end things.

135,"so I'm writing this out because it has pissed me off to the ponit I just need to get it off my chest, and it's kinda starting to happen again { for context C is the guy

and H is his girlfriend.}

    

So like  I've known C all my life ( perks of living in a small town ig) and my sister-friend and I were going to him for weed because he could find good smoke for us, and during that time C, H,and I got ""close"" and started hanging practically everyday. no literary it got to the point where i would wake up to him calling me wanting me

to come over and hang out every single day for months..not that i minded that much I liked hanging out with C he was funny, H eventually forced C to apologize to me for it,

as time went on  and we hung out more it got clear what was going on, C was hitting on me behind H's back. Now i really don't play games like that. because it's too much drama,

and I would had said something to H if I hadn't seen how she treats him first hand. to name a few things I've seen H do to C is  try to fight him in the sister-friend's yard

all because he wanted to hang out with us and smoke a blunt, and on the way out H was trying to kick his car door off it's hinges, H calls him pathetic over the smallest things,like in every day arguments.

she has straight up told him his family would no longer love him if he got caught doing something bad by the cops. So eventually i got tried of being in the middle of them and distance myself for a month or so.

when i finally did come back around

me and C ended up being alone together and C asked me



""where have you been? how come you don't come around anymore?""

    "" well I don't want to hang around H, she's a bitch and I don't see how you do it""

""man! fuck her I don't like her anyway. you come around when ever you want to don't worry about her"" now I didn't really know what to make of it so I just nodded saying OK.

more time passes but I'm getting to the point where I caught feeling for C, and H was getting worse I think now looking back at it H was most likely catching on, one day my temper blew and we stopped hanging out because me and H got into a bad argument,

couple months go by and we start playing fortnite together again. I start going back over there, C clearly stated that me and him cant really talk because of H which didn't bother me I was there to be petty and piss off H by being nice ( which worked for a while)

C was going to fix a part on my car but i had to go through H to message him and she was dicking me around and stuff like that, so I had my sister-friend message C for me which H flew off the handle at.  which started another fight which she lost then tried to start another one

the next day over some dumb shit and i just had to block her and as of right now we're not talking, hadn't been for 3 or 4 months...well the past week C has driven by me in traffic and honked his horn..three times now, on the last one I know for a fact

that H was with C because I seen her horribly dyed hair flip around and looked at C ( probably to yell at him) the day before that last honk I had seen where H

had been looking at my FB. then last night as I'm heading home I heard C yelling hey at me outside of his truck window...I'm just not sure what to make of it my sister-friend

142,"I have beaten or at least challenged quite a few of my previous addictions, including one of the more difficult ones in porn, so I have experience there. However, when it comes to sports I will mindlessly watch games for hours. Scroll through scores, watch highlights, scroll through twitter feeds (even though I'm trying to avoid all social media outside of Reddit). I am all about hype when it comes to sports, and college football particularly gets me hyped up like no other sports. I love the rankings, I love the upsets in the sport, and how it is always filled with intrigue. 

The problem I have with it, however, is I spend way too much time doing all this. Time I could use better by getting a heads-up on college work on my Saturdays instead of taking a rest throughout the day, or doing some housework, spend time exercising, hanging with friends, exploring the clubs on my college campus, making phone calls to loved ones, etc. In essence, I hate the way I am spending my time, but I love the way it makes me feel at least temporarily -- but not over the long haul.

What makes it especially difficult right now is that my favorite team is so great this year. There have been stretches where I have attempted to tune out sports completely, but that has ended up backfiring as I end up indulging even more as a consequence the next time I relapse there. I tried it one week while my team was on a bye week, and I ended up lasting 2 days -- and after relapsing there I relapsed in another addiction after accidentally coming across an NSFW post on twitter (porn at the time). 

I tried convincing myself to start it again yesterday, and I successfully avoided the first quarter of my team's game today, but with that game on the television in my house with other people watching it I ended up mindlessly watching the rest of the game. And then I watched another 2 games, channel flipping.

Around mid October apparently I disrespected/pissed two people off. How I pissed them off is an odd story, one day I was sitting on my bus seat and the one on the one to my left was open. When some people in front of me were giving out gum to whoever asked for it. One of the Big Ego (Kyle) type of people who think that they are cool went to sit on the seat across from me. ""Move so Cletus (equally unusual name) can sit there."" ""No"" I said, (I almost never share a seat with someone that's not a friend) Kyle replied with the typical ""What did you say?"" ""I said no"" They continued to tell me to move until Cletus said something along the lines of ""I'll pound your ass"" (again this is not exact) Now keep in mind he's a year younger than me and both of them are much smaller compared to everyone in my school and then I'm one of the tallest and strongest in the school. 

I continued to tell them stuff like ""I seriously doubt that"" eventually Kyle thinks he's slick and pushes himself into my seat. As you can imagine I got him off immediately with ease. However they continued at it. ""Let's link up"" Cletus said. ""What"" I replied (This is not a normal term) ""Let's meet"" at this point they are asking me stuff like ""Where do you live"" ""Where's your stop"" "" Is your stop the one directly after ours"" to which some of the innocent girls in front me were like ""Why do you want to know where he lives"" they were ignored, I answered there question with ""Why would I tell you where I live"" ""All you need to know is my stop is multiple after yours"" As they got upto leave Cletus said ""We fight Friday"" 

Friday
Friday was a normal day for the most part. When I got on the bus I set at my normal spot my some friends. Cletus approached me and said ""we want you to fight our leader"" as he put his phone in my face. You are probably wondering ""Why did they go through all of that just to try to get me to fight some random guy"" and I wonder the same thing. I should mention the phone was on video call with the guy. I didn't see much, he had his phone pointed up. All I saw was a unique hair style that I remember. I just ignore Cletus and talk to my friends, have a good time, and listen to music. Eventually my friends get off and it's just me. The two of them approached me and starting talking about the fight they made it clear to show up at a place I don't know. ""I have plans"" I said ""Your probably just saying that to back out"" ""Nah, I'm going out with friends"" ( I wasn't lying) Their stop came quickly as it was the one right after my friend's. ""Come to ________"" I went home a few minutes later and talked to my older brother and about how they want me to fight and that I would but not some random dude and not when I have plans, believe it or not I stuck with my plans and had a great time with my friends, However my brother told my mom and my mother talked to me and made it clear that I would be grounded severely if I got in a fight.

Monday
Kyle was gone, so it was just Cletus. He made no attempt to talk to me. It was funny Cletus would only talk to me when Kyle was around and Kyle wouldn't talk to my alone. 

A few days pass and the duo is together they said stuff like ""Why did you no show"" ""We will fight today then"" now, I did not want to lose my phone so I told them that and they just sort of stopped. But kept being passive aggressive. Sort of. Up until recently they ignored me and ignored them. However they ride my morning route and get on before me. They literally only just realized this. 

Most recent Wednesday
This is the day they realized and I overheard a conversation ""Do you want to beat him up he gets off near where we walk to go to (gas station)"" ""Nah, I just want to go home, Thanksgiving break is already here"" Cletus responded

I don't know of they have any intentions of following me after that encounter, but I look forward to advice and could really use it, I need advice on what to do next.

I  will take all advice and criticism",01Dec2019,1

150,"Started my first semester ever of college and had the ambitious dream of becoming a one on one psychologist. 
I am currently 19 years old (Male) and have a girlfriend (18) and just moved across the country to be closer to her family. So I have nobody, no friends, no family and only my job. The second reason we moved so far was for skiing as we both love skiing and have gone once so far this season and love it. 
After about half way through my FIRST semester, I found it almost impossible to focus or have any motivation. Then came the understanding that I’d be in school for years and then I just stopped trying. Failed this semester easily and my parents have no idea. I’m lost on what I really want to do. I feel stuck and trapped in my Buffalo Wild Wings job and want to start making serious money and feeling like I’m actually accomplishing something instead of living my life from moment to moment. I’m interested in being a EMT and becoming of a ski patrol during winter and the rest of the year be in a ambulance saving lives. But again. I just feel like I’ll fail myself and lose all hope and motivation.

I want to get this PC and I’ll be perfectly happy and content for a long time. However, I discuss all big decisions with my parents and my cousin(who is like a sister to me). They all say that I should be holding onto this money and use it to pay for gas/college/car insurance(I don’t drive yet and won’t be driving till after I graduate).

155,"so, i have to get my wisdom teeth removed in a couple weeks and i'm terrified of (the thought of) general anesthesia. i haven't had any surgery, but i had fillings done when i was 5 yesrs old and i was put under. to this day, my parents joke about how i kicked the doctor (unintentionally) and was making a real fuss during it. it only just dawned on me that it's likely i woke up and was in pain, so i tried to kick away and escape. as for this memory, i vaguely remember waking up, being in a very high chair and having what i'd call the ""main dentist"" hovering over me, with two assistants i guess? and i kicked the middle one. 
anyway, i'm an adult now, but i'm terrified of everything that can go wrong from wisdom tooth removal. 
i really want my mom with me in the room, but i'm pretty sure she can't come. i know she can't exactly save me from possible complications anyway, but i also have the fear that the doctor could touch me inappropriately, and no one would notice or stop them. i really, really don't like the thought of being so vulnerable. i don't mind going to the doctors/dentists' in general, but all my visits so far have been while i'm conscious, so it's way different.:( 

i understand that the majority of patients come out just fine, but i'm still terrified of the possibility of complications and death for something seemingly small. i was suggested to get my wisdom teeth removed because they kept getting infected this spring/summer, but i haven't had any infections since then and i'm trying to rationalize not going through with it at all.:( my mom rescheduled my appointment already and is really adamant about me getting it done and over with, and i briefly spoke to her about this but i don't think she totally understands my fear, despite it being kind of irrational. 

i'd prefer if i didn't get comments on still being mostly financially dependent on my parents, but my parents basically said to suck it up and get my wisdom teeth removed before the end of the year because their insurance benefits will change. i've had a consult with the dentist/surgeon(?) herself, but that was in july. i was supposed to get them removed in october but i broke down crying for the above reasons, and had to switch around to a date in december.:( 
i don't want to have to book another consult, but i'm terrified. i really, really don't want to rush this all and be put under, or deal with the pain for the sake of insurance benefits. it might sound stupid, but i'm not sure where to go from here. 

edit: my canines/""pointy teeth"" were shaved down without consent while my braces were being removed- usually i'm told what tool will be used and what for, but the lady just shaved it down and i was pretty horrified, but that was when i was 14 and too shy to say anything so i just went home unhappy. i don't want that happening again, as i've been told that reconstruction can be dangerous and insurance doesn't cover it. i'm pretty sure i'd have to get another mold done of my teeth as proof, but i doubt that'll happen as i don't have any dentist appointments. 
i really, really don't want this done again. i loved my pointy teeth growing up, and i hate that someone shaved them down without asking me. i get some people prefer rounder teeth, but they are MINE. that shouldn't have been done, at least not without asking me first since it wasn't damaging my mouth/cheeks. 

edit 2: local anesthesia isn't an option according to the doctor. 

tldr: i'm scared of getting my wisdom teeth removed bc of using general anesthesia and complications from that, and being put in such a vulnerable position. my appointment is in mid december.",01Dec2019,1
156,"Hello,
Not an expert at posting on reddit so I hope this post is bearable.
My partner is a lovely guy and I have no complaints in our relationship up til now , but recently he did some coke at a party I am at right now, despite knowing my sister was an ex addict, and knowing the damage it caused to my family. 
I'm a very open person, and am OK with people doing drugs because people can do whatever they want with their lives. But the only thing I have ever been against is doing coke, and I felt like he felt the same, up until tonight...
Is it OK to feel betrayed? I am almost scared to talk to him about it because it is the only I've felt is an ultimatum .. But also feel like I am demonising drug use despite the fact it is a common thing in my life, but not in me..
Am I being silly?

157,"I posted this on a different chat, just wanted to get your advice on what I should do.


So I just started seeing a girl about a month ago. She is really great and we have a good connection. A few months ago she was in a car accident and got hit from behind and she said that it messed up her back so she has been getting help on it. She got her MRI results back and she said "" I got the results and they're not good. And some other b*******. I'm just super f****** pissed off right now. So letting you know now if I go off the grid it's because I am actively ignoring the world as to not murder someone."" To which I responded if she wanted to call and talk about it. She ignored that message and I send another one a few hours later saying if there is anything I can do to help let me know. After she responded with another message I sent her a goodnight message saying I hope tomorrow will be a better day for her etc.

The next day in the morning I asked how she was and got no response from her, so I messaged her after work asking if she had plans tonight because I decided to fly home for Thanksgiving and would like to see her. She said she had plans in a unusual tone. As I was going to drive, I asked to call her so I could talk while driving home. She said sure but when I called and apologized for having to cancel our plans (because I am a decent human) to go see family she sounded really pissed off and said ""is that all you had to call me for?"" To which I said I had some other things but then we just ended the call. 

After a few minutes I received this message from her. ""I'm not trying to be mean but unless you have a real dire emergency please don't ask or actually call me. I'll answer if you call but unless you are actually in harm's way and I have to get in my fkn car and monitor your blood oxygen levels and whatever the fk else, I'm going to be pissed off. I'd actually be super mad in both situations but you'd probably only be coherent in 1/2 vignettes.

Also this is the maximum amount of tolerance I have for not respecting my boundaries when they're written out and time stamped. 

I legitimately do want you to have fun with your family and I'll probably text you at some point but you need to focus on yourself, not me.""

few days later

So after a few days I sent her a message wishing her and her family a happy Thanksgiving. A few messages go by talking about my visit and she says ""👍 enjoy your staycay. Lmk when u get back.""

I respond:""Want me to let you have your space till I get back to Florida? ""

Her:""Remember that time I said I fkn hate repeating myself when it's written out and time stamped? 

So many things about how u asked and prefaced what u just said fkn stresses me out. I'd say I'm not trying to be a bitch but by this point I don't want to feed into a false narrative where I take the time to explain shit that is litterally readily available to reread in context.

Don't lmk when ur back I'll figure it out. ""

Me:"" I'm not trying to make you repeat yourself. I'm sorry about that. All I was trying to do was to make sure I understood it correctly so I didn't make what just happen, happened.""

Her: ""Clearly you're not getting it since you just fkn texted me-- stop fkn saying sorry and READ THE WORDS I AM ASSEMBLING into an entirely coherent thought: from what I gather about you, you are pretty fkn impressionable around me and it makes me fkn feel uncomfortable.

I hate the people-pleasingness you've around me lately bc nothing about it is what I want/ want to hear. So unless you have a forreal emergency don't fkn text or call me. I'll text you if I wanna talk.

 I don't owe you an explanation about fkn anything in my life including this goddamn text bc it is available in real time as well as the fkn future sitting in your inbox. Use your time to put some independent goddamn thought into understanding the words I am saying bc spoon feeding you my lucidity clearly enrages me.

If anything I told you enough about my life and experiences you'd think you'd get it TO STOP TEXTING ME. I don't like being mean but the way you are trying to be ""caring"" makes me want to pop THE FK OFF. So when I say ""off the grid"" and ""text me when you get home"" those are my not so thinly veiled attempts to get u off my fkn back before I snap. But here we are. ""

All I was trying to do was clarify her statement and I just keep making the wrong move. I shouldn't have sent that message, I should of known by what she said ""lmk when you get back"" was term for end of convo and hit me up when you are back in town.

Hi, math has never been my strong suit but I thought that this year would be different. (I'm a freshman for reference.)

My overall math grade is decent (high 80s to mid 90s) except for two test scores which I've absolutely bombed on - both around 50%. I've went to my math teacher to see if I could do anything about it, but he says he can't change it since he would have to change everyone else's (entirely understandable) and there aren't any extra credit opportunities at the moment. My parents on the other hand are really disappointed in these *two* grades and constantly complain about how I don't try hard enough, and I spend time online too much despite me putting in extra hours studying lately.

These two scores are ruining my grade, dropping it to a C. We don't have a lot of assignments put in and there are probably two quizzes and two tests until the semester ends (tests are quizzes are 45%, that category is a D). Is there anything I can do? I'm using all the free resources like tutoring that my school has, yet it seems hopeless. I would hate to get a B since my school is insanely competitive - do they matter a lot when applying to colleges and scholarships? (I'm almost certain that I'll study veterinary medicine, zoology or some type of environmental science in college, so I was hoping that a silly B in algebra won't matter too much.)",01Dec2019,1

168,"my account is a somewhat throwaway, as my main's username is recognisable to the ex-friend in question. I feel this is a trivial thing I should just get over, but it's effected me so badly.

Some context:

The story goes I met someone in 2017 through a discord fandom group and we really hit it off. We met in real life and I thought she was amazing. We had all the same interests and she encourged me to be confident about my looks, sexuality, interests, ect.... We ended up dating for six months at the start of 2018... Part of me feels we shouldn't have ever dated. I wasn't the best girlfriend I'll own up to that. But the dealbreaker for us both was I discovered she was a 'radfem' and hated transgender people (Partiicually trans women). It was all she would talk about, even when we went on holiday together and it upset me I couldn't ask her to stop because well...You don't want to upset your girlfriend when you're on holiday you know? It eventually caused our relationship to end after some of my discord friends and her argued over this and she blamed me for not defending her. Which I accept was my fault. I didn't know how to react, my friends are mostly transgender so their hurt was understandable...   After some water passed under the bridge, I poured my heart out to her and asked if she'd still be my friend and she agreed...For the rest of the year we talked, roleplayed, drew for one another. we even bought each other gifts recently to ship to one another...Eveerything was okay again until two weeks ago.

Recently she joined twitter and we were having fun talking and sharing art ect when somebody who is in my general 'online friend circle' found out she was a radfem by going through her liked posts. I had no idea she was liking these posts, i didn't really consider it my buisness anyway. Now this person wrote a 'callout' post about my friend and caused her to be mass blocked by about 25 people possibly more Idk, I was so upset at them attacking my friend I fell out with a lot of my close friends who were angry at me for defending her. I vented to the ex-friend who told me i should block all my friends and move on...I didn't want to do this I wanted to stay friends with her and them...over time I managed to patch things up with my friends but I could tell my other friend was starting to behave strangely with me. She messaged me something odd one night late,  something she said set me off balance I tried not to think about it but I could tell the conversation was getting hostile... So I replied something snappy and logged off discord. The next morning while I was in work she messaged me saying our friendship has taken too many knocks and said I do nothing to change my ways and never defend her when she is attacked for being 'a real lesbian'. She was trying to imply I think she's an 'evil terf' and I care more about online friends than her... and I didn't know what to say at this point and I just let her go, I felt it was the right thing to do and I was so distraught I felt she was right and I was a terrible friend. But when I tried to message her after wishing her the best to tell her I wouldn't be blocking her as I didn't have any ill will to her I saw she had blocked me on discord and facebook.

I'm just hurt it ended up so suddenly and quickly. I really cared for this person, truely I did. Talking to her was often the hilight of my day. I wanted them to be happy, make friends and help them get their art out there. I saw they hadn't removed me on some mediia so I didn't do anything, didn't contact them. Wondering if this meant there was a chance we could maybe patch things up. But that didn't last long either. Should I block her back and accept the loss? Wait to see if maybe she'll want to come back? My friends say I did the right thing by no longer talking to her.

together 3. lived together 1. he has two best friends who both recently just turned 18. we go to their places frequently. my (using this very loosely) boyfriend begged me and tried bribing me for us to go to his friends house. i didn’t want to at first and had a stomach ache but decided to go.  while not even 10 minutes of being here his friend starts saying things like ‘black people are the grimiest’ ‘black people are all ignorant’. he started saying this because he was speaking about some black guy who hates black guys and so my ‘boyfriends’ friend was adding that he agreed and those were the reasons why. and that ‘black people will be the first to rob you’. as soon as he started saying these things i immediately had said “let’s go”. and my ‘boyfriend’ knee things and knee i was extremely uncomfortable from the start. he knows how uncomfortable this made me for sure because we’ve talked about this before so many times it’s something i’m sensitive to because of racism i’ve experienced in the past. he knows how i feel about these things. his other friend recently said some messed up things towards and about mexicans and my boyfriend is mexican. that was crazy too. can’t believe either of these things happened. anyways the friend really said all that and was gonna keep talking. my ‘boyfriend’ was calm but kept wanting to chill and was just telling him something about ‘masculinity’ in the black community and then his friend responded that it’s even the little black guys, it’s all of us apparently. my boyfriend gave me a look and told me ‘please don’t do this’ like not to speak up or make a scene. i got up and walked out. he came out saying i was rude and to go back in and i was like no that’s crazy and disrespectful to myself. right? like he told me he wanted me to go back in so he could teach his friend he was being racist but i really don’t care cause i just didn’t wanna be in there since i had no reason to be there. this guy and i actually broke up today. and we were honestly smoking and i was just there to smoke but it’s shit i bought and wanted to smoke with the guy i guess i was gonna allow him to stay the night and leave in the morning. he just continuously lied and stole from me and manipulated situations and was caught doing things he agreed not to because it was positive for the relationship. he knew it was his last chance then got caught so i told him i had to be done. then we went to smoke and he wanted to go to his friends so we went. 

what should i have done? i don’t have much energy to teach someone who’s saying stuff like that my view.. i’ve just been in that situation so much my ex knows and i just didn’t wanna be in it so i left. maybe i took it too literally and should’ve stayed? i just didn’t even wanna go in the first place cause it makes me uncomfortable. he’s very young we just have nothing in common and aren’t friends. i just wasn’t gonna let him say those things around me but i can’t change his view and i wasn’t gonna argue so i just left..  i’m probably stupid and should’ve done something else. please give me some advice 


I would love advice from anyone and everyone but feel free to add your age/race for perspective or any other info",01Dec2019,1

175,"I’m now almost done with my first semester at college studying engineering, and I feel completely lost in my life. I don’t know when I became lost, but it was only recently as I started to really think about what I want to do with the rest of my life. Life is a precious thing, and I’m placing such a high pressure on myself to somehow know what I want out of it already when I’m not even 20 years old. I thought engineering was my passion, and it even was the entire reason I studied so hard in high school to get to where I am at. But now, a future in engineering suddenly seems dull and unexciting, and overall something that wouldn’t keep me happy. And if you ask me, I’d rather not do something if it doesn’t make me happy in some way.

I guess the simple answer for myself is to switch majors, transfer, or to drop out, but I can’t help to think that I would be throwing away something I’ve spent so much time to get to, something that everyone I know thinks I love. And that’s the thing, maybe I would love it, but there’s just no way for me to know that from where I’m at. On one hand, I feel that if I stuck through to get my degree, it could be a devastating realization to see that what I had studied for four years is actually something that I would rather not do.  And then where would I go from there? Money doesn’t grow on trees. On the other hand, maybe I decide that engineering isn’t my future and therefore I transfer schools or find another path,but years later I live with a regret biting away at me for giving up such a great opportunity?

Furthermore, if I decided to change my career path, what would I change it to? I haven’t the slightest idea as to what else interests me. Of course I have dream jobs, like somehow working outdoors for my whole life, or having the opportunity to travel the world, but finding an occupation that fulfills that dream and also pays you a livable wage is something that is simply impossible. 

I think I just need some assurance or advice from someone that maybe found themselves in a similar situation as this in their life. I’m just so lost right now with what I want to do with my life. It’s eating away at me.",01Dec2019,1

My mom found out that my aunt who was missing for a few months was in a retirement home in Georgia. No one was there to be with her, so my mom decided to take her in for a few weeks. A few weeks became a few months, and I'm absolutely losing my mind. 🤬

She's only 50-51. I never knew her before my mom moved her in. She has something wrong with her, but no one is exactly sure what. She stays on the couch, because we don't have a spare room to give her. We finally got her to take baths regularly because before, she wouldn't take them when we asked and would have the entire house smelling like a seafood buffet. 🍤

My problems with her are:
- The couch permanently reaks of piss 
- She has had shit on the floor, all over the toilet seat which my sister and I use, in the tub, on the sink, and on the fucking wall...I have pics and if I could show you guys, I would 🤮
- She is always eating up all the food and because my mom only thought she would be here for a few weeks, my sister and I have been having to spend money on the food that we barely even eat
- She always smells like pee and doesn't like wearing underwear so whenever you smell her, she stinks so bad
- Always wants my sister and I to help her with the TV and will wake us up from our sleep just to get us to
- She will do things and then lie about it even when she's doing it right there and then 😑

186,"i was pretty lonely in my childhood (only child) and kind of semi-bullied for being 'weird'. fast forward to high sch, had some friends here and there, but in a bid to make more friends &amp; make up for my childhood, i started hanging out online more and befriending strangers on the net who live on the same city. eventually we met up as a group, but being able to text them individually/as a group made me feel like i have close friends &amp; just more 'emotionally stable'. so in general i got used to being open to just meet people in general &amp; hangout. well anyway i dont keep in contact with them anymore except see them on ig or fb sometimes. sometimes when i am lonely i used to just go on tinder to text people without an intention to meet up. other than that i do have hobbies which i do alone.

the couple of close friends i still have are in two categories: 1) college friends who make an effort to meet up every few months, i'm mostly close to this one girl in the group who has common interest with me so we spend a lot of time texting about that, 2) a few individual guy friends that i met from online but we have common hobbies / quirks / just like texting in general. 

now.. i have a ldr bf and we are closing the distance in 3 weeks. my bf hates texting and we dont have much common hobbies but we are still trying to persist thru the ldr and test out the relationship in-person. recently we got into an argument about someone (lets call this person New Friend) texting me. my bf says that its crossing boundaries (not about the fact its a male that is texting me, but its something of a gray area like a boss and employee relationship although that isn't it either, i am just drawing an example) and he doesnt like me to interact with the person. i see New Friend once a week  &amp; we hv common hobbies.

so i distanced myself and just be really cold with replies. 2 weeks later this topic crops up again cos i said the New Friend asked me to hangout (i ended up saying no and just saying my bf hates us talking) and my bf said, 'why are you even still having conversations with this person'. my bf says its 'weird' that we are even talking so much unnecessary things that we can talk about when we meet irl, and that me and bf's common friends agree it's weird. 

i ended up having a semi-confrontation and the New Friend said that we are just friends and nothing more, plus he has a girlfriend too albeit the relationship is still p new.  from my pov, he seems to just like texting me as a friend and he's just generally bored, so he either just shares stuff about our common interest or initiates random topics. i dont think he has any romantic intentions because he doesn't 'go out of the way' for me and he talks about ldr being hard (im moving away from this city). and idk but he does mention about being lonely at times too (only child problems) so maybe thats why he likes to text?? well, we seem to really vibe though.

i asked my bf that is it because it's a male friend that caused his reaction and my bf says no, it's the fact that it's 'crossing a boundary that he wouldn't cross about an inappropriate professional relationship' that makes him upset.  if it wasn't for the fact that it's an 'inappropriate relationship basis', my bf wouldnt be upset that it's just a close male friend and he would be happy for me. 

well.. anyway i feel pretty bad about this but i really dont understand the whole hoo-ha from my bf's pov. him + our common friends who find it weird don't seem to have the childhood issues that i had wrt close friends, and all 3 of them have siblings so maybe they dont have that loneliness issue. i found myself thinking about cutting off the relationship because we have such different pov about friendships and boundaries, but my bf was upset about how i seemed to give up on the relationship so easily (yeahhhh sorta emotional manipulation right there aka red flag), so i decided to just cling on to it and wait it out. 

idk what to do about the whole friendship fiasco though? i do have other friends who like texting but they have their own chat group, idk how to be included though. so they dont text me all the time, but they would ask me to hangout sometimes. and i thought about it -- even if im included, it doesnt really solve the issue with ME. its just like i have some sort of insatiable close friendship urge. 

**i thought about it -- is it a recurring issue? Yes, with a previous bf, even when i had common hobbies with my bf and texted all day and night with him, when there was a chance for a new potential close friend / chat group, i would be obssessed with texting them. And even when i was quite close to them already, I would be like, oh, now i need a close IRL bunch of friends. i think the only time when i am truly 'satisfied' is having a close friend / close friends that meets up with me regularly AND text me regularly (although they dont have to be the same group of people). only then, i was able to nope out people from my life and not care for making new close friends.** 

\---

**TLDR: insatiable urge for close friends, bf unhappy due to the friendship  'crossing professional relationship boundary (like boss + employee relation but this is just an example and not the real situation)' and not so much about having a close friend of opposite gender. BF cannot relate to me having this New Friend converse with me because he cannot see himself doing it.** 

**i havent fully cut away the friendship and it sucks to do so because i feel lonely and miss having someone / some group to text about hobbies, and i thought about it, regardless of the reason, it sucks to cut away a friendship when i dont feel satisfied with my current social situation.**

and i think its something i should go to therapy for. but idk i just wanted to see if anyone can shell out some advice / went through smth similar. and if anything at least i can refernce this post because i have the bad habit of forgetting what to talk about for therapy sessions.",01Dec2019,1

191,"1st semester as a PhD student in math in a new country - USA and I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life. 

I have a computer science and math undergrad degrees  and I visited my friends who are doing masters in computer science and I just felt that maybe I should go into comp science. I feel I was naive in going into math just because I like math more. I don't think I want to be in academia because it's really lonely. Also, I don't think I'm cut out for research. I work well when I'm with people. I feel lonely being in a small town in US.

It's like I'm going through all this struggle for what? I don't think it's worth it. I don't like teaching. I know the influence that teachers have and would hate to be a mediocre or bad teacher. So anyway I'm going to go to the industry. I'm good with coding. I just never found it challenging and fun before. But as I'm maturing, I realize there is more to a job than the intellectual satisfaction. There is money, people, flexibility, prestige, etc which also matters. 

While people think that I'm smart because I'm doing math, they don't really understand what I do or even what value it has. Even if I go through with my PhD, it's only going to matter to a handful of people - if I do a good job. But the work people do in computer science has tangible applications which make it more understandable. 

I also had not planned on coming to the US for the sake of coming here. I did it because I wanted the best education. I left a very high paying, prestigious computer science job in my home country to come here. 

But on the other hand, it's a huge risk to master out and sit for jobs etc in the current climate - being an immigrant. I have 6 months experience interning in computer science but the competition is tough. And I might hate my job. As an intern, I didn't like my work because it wasn't intellectually stimulating enough - but I liked everything else. Now it's literally the opposite. The only thing that keeps me going are my classes which are great fun. 

Sorry for the long post. I'm really lost. I just wanna be a kid again so that I don't have to make these complex decisions. Happiness isn't something which I can optimize because it's very complicated. 

Any advice is welcome.",01Dec2019,1

206,"I have a friend, let's call him Tim. He's a freshman at the college I go to, and I only just met him this semester. I've invited him over to hang out a few times and every time I do he starts getting text messages that seem to upset him, and then he asks if he can have alcohol. The first time I didn't think it was a big deal because hey I've been there before and sometimes an occasional drink when things are shitty makes me feel better. It's happened a couple of times now and I've made sure there isn't any alcohol around when he comes over, because all he wants to do is drink and won't ever tell us what's wrong.

I know for sure that part of the problem is that he cheated on his girlfriend with me. We were both drunk when we hooked up, me way more than him. I didn't know he had a girlfriend at the time which is why I agreed. I later found out about it and asked him if he had a girlfriend, and it seems like he's been getting more depressed since then, for obvious reasons. I didn't yell at him or anything about cheating on his girlfriend, I just asked if he had one and told him what he does in his relationship is his business. I also told him that if he wanted to talk about what happened we could.


He recently sent me a couple of texts that are red flags for me, like how he was texting me while driving after I called him out on it because the alternative was driving himself into a tree. After that I know he's really not okay.

I've reached out and told him that he's clearly not okay. He told me he knows but he doesn't know what to do about it. I told him that talking to someone always helps, and that I'm here if he ever wants to. I also told him that if he doesn't want to talk to me he still needs to talk to someone, or even just write it down somewhere. I asked him to let me or anyone else know if he ever felt like doing something stupid, and that he has plenty of people at the college that would be more than willing to help him with whatever he needs.

He won't talk to me about it after that and is just making small talk. I don't know if he's bad enough that I need to alert someone like the counseling center, or if it would just be an invasion of his privacy at this point.

208,"Hi everyone, just making a post on this to make sense of what I’m feeling right now feeling with respect to a situation that happened earlier today. 

So basically, as the title suggests, my friend’s parents want to pay my Dad to clean their driveway. To provide some information, I come from a middle class family, and my friend’s family is upperclass. My Dad drives a truck for a living and does some window work on the side, so I take in pride in the work that he does, and the extent he goes for his family working long hours despite how hard it can be. Building on this, for some reason when my friends parents asked me if they could get in touch with my Dad, so he could clean their driveway (the contracted snow-cleaners they hired did not show up), had my blood boiling. I felt like my Dad would be the guy to take on a job like that because of how important money is right now but, something like that just really hurts the image I have my Dad, and the work he does to carry himself.

Throughout my life it's like somehow or the other i have been hurt because of any relationships with people which has made me look at life in a different way wherein it is tough for me to trust someone and make a real connection with a person.

215," Hi there  
TL;DR: I'm an unemployed 26 year old artist (though I still manage to sell some art, I started hating it at least 3 years ago) and programmer who failed at the game of life mainly due to my own poor decisions. I've been working on starting my own company which might definitely fail, I've spent the last year painting for money and working on a prototype to get the company going. Now, close to completing it, I'm second guessing myself even though I've spent some money on it to get it this far. Skip to ""(A)"" or ""(G)"" if that's too much to read. Also still living with my patient parents.  


&amp;#x200B;

 This might be a bit incoherent. I'll try to keep it short. 

I'm 26. After high school I got a job (Hated it, basically I was required to manipulate people, which was legal), and worked for about 4 years before I quit 4 years ago to focus on selling my art which went well... at first. I usually paint commissioned portraits. As I started doing this I realised that it's not at all what I want to do. My family, my partner, and clients like the art and have been encouraging me to continue. Right now, I absolutely hate it.   


  During that first year after quitting my job I noticed that I could take advantage of online courses through edx, coursera, and Udacity. I completed two introductory Philosophy courses, Calculus, Basic Circuits Analysis courses as an introduction to EECS, as well as courses in Java, Python, and C. I built and completed an android app which I haven't uploaded (looking back on that app now, I need to re read all of those comments because it's been a while since I've touched Java), got a 3D printer, completed a course on IoT devices and interfacing with Arduino and Raspberry Pi (while learning C++, this helped), then built small projects on the side as practice.  Right now, looking back at those apps I've built and what I've done in Python last year is a nightmare. Not that I dislike it, it's just that I am now clearly aware that I need to relearn a few things I was actually not too terrible at.    


 I feel like I've wasted the last 4 years of my life. I have just over $1500 in my account because I decided to focus on learning new skills (half of which I've forgotten), rather than paint and sell commissioned portraits. My plan was to start a company by developing a prototype and getting at least one product sold to start with (it was supposed to be a tech company), then continue to work my way through it from there. I was taking Courses in data analysis as prerequisites for a Nanodegree from Udacity in Robotics software engineering which I was planing on paying for in a few months. Now, I'm not so sure. I have nothing to show for the work I've done for most of the courses because half of them were free and I would have had to spend money on them to get a certificate (so my results from 3 years ago don't matter now either).    


 Right now, I don't know where I'm going from here. Not sure if I should:    


 (A) complete the prototype, which would take a month, and then see where the company goes. Even though I've planned this out and have been working on it for the last year there's a 50% chance it might fail but it's the first time I'm doing this so let's make some room for the unpredictable... 75% chance it might fail.     


 (B) Brush up on Java and upload the apps with adds (which will be competing with millions of other apps giving them around 1% chance of success? Maybe... if I'm lucky). It's also going to take a while to fix a bunch of bugs in the code.    


 (C) Do what I've come to hate and paint, make money (Which feels like a terrible waste of what I've learned again). It's probably the logical option.    


  (D) Try to juggle them all while re learning everything I've forgotten (I don't know if I have the ability, brain capacity to handle it, or the discipline).   


 (E) Paint on the side while preparing to complete that Nanodegree in Robotics Software Engineering from Udacity, drop everything else while doing this. Thereafter, get a job in the field (if possible), and once I have more money I can actually start the company with at least one issue down — money — and this will set me back by at least 2 years. By then I'm sure this company I would have wanted to start would have some pretty good competitors.    


 (F) Get a job in one of the major financial institutions in the country and climb the corporate ladder then decide later. // I don't think I'm enough of a shark to do this, I don't want to become an a\*\*hole, the world has too many of them. Not saying everyone who manages to successfully climb the corporate ladder in their workplace is an a\*\*hole, it was just way too common seeing this where I worked.    


  (G) \[Please, fellow humans, if you've finished this, give me some advice.\]   


 P.S. I'm sure there are typos above, I'm sorry about that. Thank you for reading. Any comments will be greatly appreciated.",01Dec2019,1
216,"TL;DR at end. 
So I [18F] met a guy [21M] at the beginning of the semester and we got along really well. There's very natural chemistry between us and sometime in September we had a conversation about the possibility of dating in the future. Nothing has come of that conversation since and I almost never get to see him anymore. He's often times absent from class because of what I can only assume to be family related problems as that's what I've gathered from what he's told our teacher. He's very sweet and friendly but he can be really secretive about his personal life, he doesn't like to confide in really anyone. Those times that he misses class can leave him gone for weeks at a time with no word. I can try to text him but he won't answer me and just acts like nothing happens when he comes back. I like him a lot and I really care about him but lately I've been second guessing if I actually want to have a relationship with him because I value consistency, and he seems to be the opposite of it. On the other hand, a close friend of mine [20M] that I also met early in the semester said that he knows someone [also 20M] that he thinks I would really get along well with. He says that me and this guy share very similar interests and similar humor and that he would almost certainly be willing to go on a date with me. I've never met this guy but I trust my friend and I think if there's anyone I would let set me up with someone it'd be him. Basically I'm at a crossroads here, because even though I really like this guy, I don't know that we could make it work, and I'm definitely up for meeting new people but I just don't know if it'd be fair considering the conversation I had with my crush that we could see ourselves being more than just friends. Should I go on the blind date or should I wait things out with my crush??? Please help

217,"Hey guys theres a bit of backstory here, but please help me out if u can, thanks. Ok so im a canadian 3rd year undergrad student looking to apply to dental schools. I realy wanted to become a dentist for all my life, and i have to (want to) become one one way or the other. Heres the problem, i cant apply to canadian schools due to certain reasons  (which are significantly cheaper). Now my only options are to go to australia and come with 400-500k in debt but with a maximum 100k salary (cad)  . Or i could go to the US and go 600k (cad) in debt, which means i'll have to live there forever (because i cant pay back that debt in cad, because the starting salary for a dentist is around 125k , while its very difficult to make that much in cannada). 

So now what should i do . I love my family and Canada soo much, and i dont want to leave them just like that. Im so confused. 

Should i give up my life here (which i love in canada), for more money . Or should i stay here with a huge amount of debt which i dont know if i can ever pay back.

221,"I've spent my whole life seeking the next step. The allure to be successful. To be rich and happy. When I was in middle school, it was about getting into the HS program I wanted. In HS, it was about getting to the right college, and then the right grad school. Then the right job and then moving higher into that job.

In every stage, I've been trying to build a beautiful and successful life delaying gratification because if I just keep working hard, I'll eventually get there. The problem is, I don't even know where there is anymore. 

The tough part about it is I've always move away in each stage too. My parents moved a few times when I was real young. Then we settled on a place for end elementary school/middle school. Then I went to HS out of zone because of the program. Then I went to college out of state, Ivy League, and was the only one around me. Then I went to grad school in a different department. Then I got a job in a new city where nobody else was because it gave me the best opportunity to be successful.

I've never questioned a decision in my life. I've made many mistakes but never had a regret. And now I'm alone. I make a good living in a place full of strangers separated from my friends and family. And I travel regularly for work, and there's no place of work in my current city (it's just the best for airport and central for driving distance of the other cities I have to go to.) But there's no office.

I back in my hometown for Thanksgiving break. I just met up with a bunch of old friends. One is my oldest friend. One is one of my best friends from high school. One is a girl I bonded and connected with everytime I visited home, and I spent years trying to give me a chance. But she wouldn't, either because of me or because I was never back for more than a week at a time and gave no indication of moving back for good. And the last is a friend I've no for a long time. After college, I moved back home for a couple months while I was interviewing for jobs. In hosted several get togethers. When I accepted a position, I had a going away party. A bunch of people were invited, but those were my closest friends that I kept in touch with. And then they paired up and got together.

That was 2 years ago. And I routinely see them whenever I visit home, which the last time was 11 months ago. I visited a few times in the first year. But this last was the longest I went without seeing them. And I'm honestly so happy to see them happy and healthy and potentially in love. But it made me feel sad as well. 

I sat down for drinks with them, and I doted while they regaled hilarious stories of their couples trips and family gatherings. Apparently they became couple friends as well because of me, and they have all these inside jokes and stories and full lives they've established. They have adventures and memories and just generally beautiful lives. And I've never felt like a 3rd wheel or 5th wheel with any of them before when I hung out if I was single and they were dating something (the alternative was rarer) beforehand. And in the first times I visited, it just felt like they were all my friends. And now they're established couples, and they all have lives. And they all have lives with each other. 

And I realized that I didn't have that. I'm not in a relationship and haven't had a serious one in a while. I don't have a dedicated friend group because I travel so much it's been difficult to make consistent plans and I've never been one for initiating. I moved to a city where I knew nobody. So the adventures I've had have been just traveling to a friend's city and catching up over drinks or going on a ski trip. The rest of my life has been work. The majority of what I know has been work, and when I'm not working, I'm home because traveling that much can be exhausting. And after they regaled me with their stories of adventure and beauty and hilarity, they asked me what have I been up to, and I realized that I had nothing interesting to say or add. I haven't had any interesting anecdotes in the last year despite, by all my metrics, my being more ""successful"" than my friends who stayed in their hometown. 

And now I'm sitting here, and I'm wondering in my mid 20s, did I make a mistake? I've spent my entire life delaying gratification trying to make something of myself and be successful. And now I'm here at the beginning of my success story, and I brought nobody with me. And if my friend's can have what I would maybe call much more fulfilling and beautiful lives with what they have, then why am I working so hard? What is the purpose of any of this? What have I been doing all this time? I just feel... lost... and alone... and like I've wasted years for nothing. Everything feels meaningless.",01Dec2019,1

She had a falling out with her partner, which was both where she was living and her only means of getting to work.  Myself and another manager have been giving her a ride when necessary, but it's definitely not sustainable.

A few weeks later, she had to miss work because a family member with whom she was staying domestically assaulted her and she was in the ER   On top of this, she has a young kid who's staying with other family, and she's on the verge of living in a shelter until she can straighten things out.

I'm trying my best to help her. But I feel way out of my league.  What can I do?  What resources are there?  In my previous jobs, I was at a large established company or working for the government  and I knew how to get my employees what they needed in these situations.  But now I feel like I'm in over my head, and I just want to help...",01Dec2019,1
240,"Note: I'm 15, male. TLDR at end. 

So I don't really know where to go, so I came to this sub-reddit for help. 

I found out my aunt [dads side] is severely sick. She is the kindest, most caring person on this planet, and every year when I go on vacation to my home country, I spend at least two weeks at her house. She is the best person I've ever met, and she has NEVER said a SINGLE nasty thing about anyone.

My parents both have traumas, which I have linked back to their experiences with war. 

All of my dad's side was murdered in the Srebrenica Genocide and Bosnian war, except his sister and mother, who passed away a few years ago. 

My mother's side suffered no death's, thankfully, but they had three homes burned to the ground [which they rebuilt].  

Why is this Important?

This is why my mom is also sick, and my dad is a narcissist, who has not healed yet from all of the horrible things. [Can you blame him]?

My dad never really had a role in my life, despite the fact that we live together. 

My mom is sick, and my parents tend to fight sometimes. Nothing physical, but the words hurt. I swear they do. 

This has all led to tensions in my house, which led to my sister moving out unannounced, and this shattered my mom's heart. 

My little sister [11] has always been treated like a baby, and she is so privileged. 

She does not help around the house, and she literally sits on her ass. 

My mom is always tired from work, and sick, which means I do all the cleaning, including dishes, vaccuming, laundry, etc. 

I [used] to be an A+ student, but now, my average has dropped to a 90. I take 2 AP classes, [AP world History, AP computer science]. I have about 4 standardized tests this June. 

At the moment, my day is this:

Wake up at 6:30
Eat, dress, etc. 
Go to school at 8
Im home at 3
I clean until 4:30-5
I go to my taekwondo class, 5-8 
I tend to my business [30 min- 1 hr weekdays]
I do homework , 8:30-9:30 
I eat, shower and am in bed by 10:30.
Repeat.

On top of this, I am the Secretary of my school's Kiwanis Club.

This post is everywhere, so let's recap. 

TLDR: I am the sole person in my house who cleans, and I cook much of the time. Im dealing with multiple sick family members, and my life literally includes no time for me to really relax. My grades are going to hell, and my tensions in my house are at a breaking point. I have to stay strong for my mom and Aunt tho. 

I just want everything to be normal, I just wish I could fix my family, I just... 

I just want everything to be okay. 

Help. Im at a breaking point. This is my call for help. Help me.",01Dec2019,1

We’ve never met in person, but we’ve talked a bit over Facebook about what’s described above and follow each other on social media and like each other’s stuff sometimes. I’m embarrassed to admit I have a TikTok haha but I do and for some reason she has viewed my TikTok profile TEN times in the past few weeks, and I’ve found out that she’s also viewed a lot of my friend’s profiles and the profiles of other people in the club who she’s never met.

246,"My(18) sister (16) has had a history of behavioral issues since she was 14. I haven’t been home as much as I used to be due to me moving into my dorm at college, but I facetimed my parents multiple times every day and would come home almost every other weekend.

Earlier this semester she got a new boyfriend who was a year younger than her. Her and this boy started skipping class together, and even after getting in school suspension, would still skip together. 

This Tuesday when I came home for Thanksgiving break, my mom broke down when she saw me and started telling me about how my sister had gotten in trouble again and how she had told my mom that she was pregnant and when my mom replied telling her she was getting an abortion she refused and argued with my mom and my mom ended up hitting her. As the days passed my sister took a pregnancy test and it came out negative so we all were less on edge but it was also too soon to tell. My sisters phone had been taken away but she would still talk to her boyfriend on an old phone he had given her which my parents never bothered to take away. Today, Saturday, my parents left the house to go speak to her boyfriends mom about the issues and about thirty minutes later I told my sister I was leaving to go study with friends. My parents didn’t want my sister being left alone and so someone was always at home with her the whole week but I wanted to go study so I left, not thinking about what she would do. Not even 25 minutes later I got a call from my dad saying she had ran away. I drove back home immediately and my parents and the boys mom were checking the security footage of the only neighbor that had cameras, and we could see the type of car but not the plate number. Police was called and a report was filed and now we’re basically waiting. We think they probably took an uber to a friends house but there is nothing concrete right now and we have little information.  

My mom hasn’t taken this well and has cried multiple times and I know shes feeling horribly right now, my dad has managed to keep it together but I can tell he’s also worried and he’s just trying to stay strong for my mom and I. While i’m also worried for my sister, half of me is angry with her for not caring about our parents and how this is affecting them, our parents are hardworking immigrants and all they have done in the US they’ve done for me and my sister to have better lives and she wants to throw all that away to have a baby at 16 with her 15 year old boyfriend who possibly deals drugs. In the end I want her to come back just for my parents sake.

254,"15m here. I’ve always been an introvert and have had a lot of problems with depression and anxiety throughout my life. I was diagnosed with OCPD recently so the stuff I’m gonna say is gonna sound really obsessive. Every single day I feel more and more lonely. After getting treatment for my depression I’ve started to get better at actually talking to people, but that’s it. I mean I do have friends but I can’t maintain solid, real friendships that are close. I’ve lost the close friends that I’ve once had due to obsessing over all of this, and it understandably got uncomfortable to them. And don’t get me started on trying to get a girlfriend, I was rejected once which scared me off and now ever crush has ended in them getting a boyfriend before I make even the slightest move. I have a twin brother, and naturally we have a lot of mutual friends because we both do theatre. He’s also had 6 boyfriends (he’s gay). Thing is all of his friends are way more closer to them then they are to me. I don’t know how to make new friends, because theatre is all I do. I always feel like it’s a constant fight over them that I always end up losing, and as my depression gets worse and I just don’t feel like doing anything about it this all gets worse. I know they like me as a person, but I don’t think they even care to talk to me, they never start conversations with me because we barely have conversations over text. And when we do I get so anxious I have to end it as fast as I can. It hurts every day to see my brother and his friends (who are my friends too) going out and having fun, seeing pictures of them at the mall and the movies and just doing normal teenage things. I feel like I’m wasting my life and I don’t know what to do about it. I can’t start conversations. I can’t ask someone to hangout. I just started high school and I hate it already.

255,"Unoften, I can get into a trivial argument with someone that I end up taking the heat and looking bad in it. I'll feel like I'm in the losing position even when I know my position is higher. I know I'm not the root of this problem because:

1. I almost never get into an argument with anyone

2. Usually when I do get into an argument, it's not bad. It turns out alright and we figure things out.

3. The only time it goes south is when the people I'm in an argument with don't even argue the points and instead patronize me.

It's the 3rd situation I need help with. When the argument starts, we're discussing of different points of view, nothing important. However, when the person takes issue with my point and makes an argument, they don't argue about the point itself but the mannerism.

They use lines like ""Do you *genuinely* believe that?"", ""Watch, he's gonna tryhard"", ""control yourself its ok to be wrong"", ""you're just sad"", ""you're hyperaggressive"", ""imagine being that cocky"", ""Wow hear his tone"", 

I'm just not sure how to react when they're the ones acting cocky and aggressive. If I respond in any way then they just say ""see I told you he acts like that"". I can't walk away cause it will seem like I lost the argument for being  ""unable to argue"", I'm not sure if I can say ""No you are"" or ""you're lying"" without looking like a fool.

256,"I have had people who have misused my trust and used me for their own personal motives. Whenever I approach them and try to have a dialogue about what happened, I am responded with long silence and something alongs the line of ""sorry you feel that way.""

I looked up this apology and it looks like people say this when they think they have done nothing wrong and that the other person chose to feel bad. Theses are usually accompanied with:

""you are not responsible for other feelings""  
""you cannot make them feel anything unless they let you""  
""you don’t have to anticipate the needs of others""  
""it's not your job to take responsibility of others""

When I told myself this it felt empowering. I am not responsible for others. Actually, I don't have to care about anyone, but myself. It should not matter to me if someone was offended or hurt by my behavior. It should not matter to me if someone is struggling or left behind. It is not my responsibility to look out for others. But then I think:

What if my behavior unintentionally have real damaging consequences for others that could have been avoided?  
Wouldn't that mean a claim in accountability and changed behavior?  
Why should others be responsible for the ramifications of something *I chose* to do?  
How is that fair to others? Does it even matter *if* it is or isn't fair to others?  
If listening to others needs come to little to no inconvenience to me, then I ignore it?  
How would I feel if I were in their shoes? But if I never will be, then should it matter?  
Would I like it if someone did to me what I did to them? 

I become torn. Like I said, there is something empowering telling myself that they *think* I did something wrong and that they *chose to feel* the way they feel and therefore, it is their own fault and they are hurting themselves rather than of anything they perceive of me and anything they imagine I should be accountable for. It is objectively their own doing, but somethings about that feels insidious and makes my insides turn. If it is objectively right for others to use me and not be responsible for the hardship that their choices has put me through, but really it is all just ""my feelings"", then maybe I had it wrong this whole time and should start to treat others the way others treat me. As in, only look out for my own goals, uncaring of the means I may take to get there.

How do I do this? How do I switch from ""Hey I'm sorry for what I did"" and listening to what are the other person needs are to... ""Sorry you feel that way. Only you are responsible for how you feel.""

257,"So it has been a long year, assume so for almost everyone.

Lately my life has changed a bit, I would not say in a bad way, but not necessarily a good way either. 

For the last 5 to 6 years I have been grinding and working my ass off. Have my own company that os starting to pick up well and I almost have everything I have ever dreamed about. I by no means am full of myself about it, just very great full to have had the opportunities to get me where I am today.

I have spent the last 3 weeks in and out the hospital, first a migraine that did not want to go away, been put on medication end last year to try and keep it under control, but sees to not work so well anymore.  Went in for a wrist operation last week, 3rd one over 2 year span this being the biggest one yet. All good, dealing with it, I am getting a lill older, but also trying to stay fit best I can for someone who mostly has no time for sports or hobbies. Mind you I have been a sporty person my whole life, feeling like my body is failing me is somewhat depressing at times.

Anyway, all while in and out of the hospital to deal with all these minor inconveniences blood tests got run and so forth and basically I was i form that I am at high risk for heart disease as well now :-| ( I am 32F btw ) Triglyceride levels are very high. All this after I have pretty much stopped drinking this year, and for the last 3 months took on a very healthy life style, went to the gym, changed my diet and all round lost 2% body fat in 5 and half weeks. Suppose my only unkickable vices are my coffee and smokes. ( I need to emphasize Coffee, a smoke, and earphones in has been my ritual for almost all my life, neither can go without the other )  But I also realize now I might have to let that go as well. 

I don’t know what I am really looking for, I just feel defeated a bit. Like seriously dude, why now?! Hasn’t the year been tough enough already. Why do you keep forcing me to deal with these things?!

So, she Snapchats me daily, but only for streaks and stuff like that, so I am typically hopeful that if I respond to it, maybe she will reply and we will start talking, but that doesn’t happen, of course, and I just get left on read. Other times I’ll leave those snapchats she sends on open, even if I feel really bad about it, and when the steak is about to end, she’ll try texting me, and logically I know that she just wants to keep the streak, so I’ll be nice and reply to it, in hopes that we can talk some, and we sometimes do, but the next day I’ll try to snapchat her and I’ll get left on read. 
This has been the cycle for a while now, and I don’t want to be mean and end the streak because she seems to care a lot about it, and it really only seems like she only talks to me when we almost lose the streak, but I also want to see if she would want to talk anyways if we didn’t have it, but idk.

269,"The past 7 months have been rough.

Back in May, I mutually ended a 3.5 year relationship because we had incompatible visions of the future, most importantly that I wanted to have kids and she did not. The first 5 months or so I was not emotionally available to start dating again. Now, with my General Exam coming up and a desire to graduate ASAP, I don't really feel *physically* available to start dating again.  Nevertheless, I miss the thrill, affection, and love of a partner, and I'm 31 so it's not like I can just punt on dating for 3 years if I want to be a dad.

I had four close friends in my city that I could talk to. One lives in a suburb about an hour away, and although we remain close we don't hang out very often. The second was my girlfriend, and though we are on speaking terms we obviously limit it and have only hung out twice since. The third has moved in with my ex-girlfriend and has mental health issues of her own, and so I don't feel like it's fair for me to confide many of my struggles in her. The fourth moved back home across the country last year and his sister has exhausted all treatment options for Stage IV cancer, so I don't think it is fair for me to lean on him. 

My best friend back home lost his partner to cystic fibrosis and he hasn't been the same since. We remain close but it's hard to talk to him when I'm struggling because I can't bring myself to open up about what's going on after what he's suffered.

My roommates from the past 4 years recently moved out to move in with their partners. The two women who have moved in with me since are both kind and good roommates, but they're 3-6 years younger than me and it's been hard for me to open up to them.

I have been close with my mother but she suffers from a chronic autoimmune illness that has gotten worse over the past couple of years and it doesn't seem fair to burden her with my struggles either.

The only friend I feel like I am totally honest with right now is an Australian woman I've known online since I was 14, and her dad died a year ago so I should probably be leaving her alone as it is.

I have a therapist (history of depression) and he's helping me to work through some things, but someone you see for an hour once a week can't cure feelings of isolation.

I can't even work out right now because I strained a calf muscle, making my knee unstable.

I miss the richness of close relationships, especially those where you can hang out and not speak at all yet gain nourishment from each other's presence. I miss those relationships where a two-word phrase and a smirk is enough to get someone else to roll their eyes or laugh. I hate how cold my bed is every night.

I'm an introvert - I've always garnered rest from seclusion. But now it's not solitude, it's just fucking loneliness.

I've never been a social butterfly and although I get by at parties I've never opened up easily to new people. Everyone has their own stressors to deal with and complaining too much just leads to unproductive rumination anyway. It's just so damn hard to pry myself away from my work and to not be stressed about that work if I'm not doing it.

To bring this meandering thread of self-pity to a close, here are my questions:

* How have you managed stressful, lonely times when you don't see an end in sight? 
* Any advice on actually trying to date while in grad school?
* Should I be looking for new friends, trying to become closer with more distant friends, or opening up more to the friends I have?
* How can I gain emotional nourishment right now?
* Any other advice?

Honestly even a little encouragement right now from a kind stranger would be appreciated.",01Dec2019,1
270,"I (30f) live a pretty lonely life, away from family, not many friends. Only colleagues and an LDR bf. Old uni mates and ex colleagues usually end up drifting away.

I'm quite the introvert and I need time to myself (hence ending up drifting away from people), and I would much rather have a couple of good friends than a huge group of just mediocre ones. I have those, but they're either far away, or busy with life mostly. I spend most weekends home alone, or out doing chores and errands, alone. 

Lately I feel like I need to make new friends, but I don't get out much and find talking to strangers really awkward. Spending money is also an issue as I mostly save up for travels to and with my bf. 
Also, I'm the kind of shy that even hates eating at a shop alone.

I get that growing up, people just tend to live less social lives, but still. Any ideas and advice on how to be/feel less lonely?",01Dec2019,1

It's still a beautiful dress either way and so I'm not sure if I should shorten it ""just a little"" for a slightly different look or if I should just leave it making it the length to go out to dinner. I'm not sure if I should change it without asking what he thinks because he already got the idea I didn't like it since I didn't wear when I visited. 

I tried it on and also realized there is actually a hole on the left side that will need to be stitched. Should I take it in or should I wait until I see him?

273,"My sister is 12th grade and for years now it's been clear that she has p severe anxiety. I have had it as well for my whole life and have even taken medication the past couple years (which I'm stopping this week). Im finishing my degree this week but I still feel like a mess. How do I tell my sister it gets better when im not even sure if it does?

My mom, bless her heart, is not that supportive. She feels like you shouldn't need a therapist all the time, only when bad things happen to you, and I can tell she gets uncomfortable whenever I mention meds or my counseling sessions. She's the type to tell you to work on mindfulness and leave it at that? And shes even worse with my sister. She tries, but she always says the wrong things. She gets angry when my sister cries, tells her it's just being a teenager, telling her nothing is wrong with her and please stop crying"" 

She keeps voicing these thoughts and they're exactly what I experience. I try to give her tips and tricks for managing anxiety and I hope it helps, but I'm afraid her anxiety is my fault and she picked up the behavior from me panicking and breaking down all the time. She's tried getting counseling but no one in her school is listening to her or helping and she got denied by the youth counselling near us because our family doctor was too far away apparently? 

It breaks my heart to see her suffer through the same constant cloud of negativity and sadness and emotions and fear that I did. I don't know what else I can offer her.

Tonight, last night we were texting eachother and out of nowhere she asks me if I would like to watch the new episode of a show we both like, with her. She also said that it would be ""like a date"". I told her that I would like to, and that I would have to ask my parents.

The other stuff, what people called ""normal sibling violence"", I'm over that; I don't want to be close with her anymore, but I'm not angry about it anymore. 

The point is that she repeatedly smacked my ass when we were younger. She said she did it because ""it was there"", I don't have anger for the other stuff, but the other stuff makes me think it was out of just simply because she saw me as less than human and it was funny to her to make me feel uncomfortable or degraded.

Recently, the guy I like—lets call him Nate—and I got into a fight. 

Some back story: Nate and I have been friends for a while and weve kissed before. Nate and I know each other well and we both confessed we like each other (but didnt date for complicated reasons). Regardless of not having the title of “boyfriend and girlfriend,” we were acting like a couple. It was natural though. 

All in all, things were going well until one of our mutual friends called him and told him that I was calling him abusive. But I never called him abusive; our mutual friend lied.

He got upset that I was calling him abusive (even though I wasn’t) and he told me that he can’t be friends with someone who talks bad about him. He also said he finds it hard to be friends with me since I was still friends with his ex-girlfriend...even though Ive been friends with his ex-girlfriend before they even dated. He also said that I wasn’t a good friend since I didn’t defend him when his ex was speaking badly of him. But I did defend him all but once.

I responded by telling him I’m willing to stop being friends with his ex if that’s what it takes to save our relationship and that I never talked bad about him. I also apologized for not defending him that one time. And I told him he should communicate with me instead of believing what others say about me.

He responded apologizing for his mistake and misunderstanding.  He also apologized for the pain he might have caused me and told me that I’m allowed to do whatever I have to do to protect my mental health. Lastly, he told me to focus on my future and career.

How should I respond to him?",01Dec2019,1

291,"Over the course of the past few days, my cat of 15 years has been losing function in his body rapidly. About four days ago he began showing symptoms of him being sick or not feeling well (ears lowered, lethargic, etc), we took him to the emergency vet that night and they started it could be hyperthyroidism. We got the bloodwork back and they said that it came back clean. Later that day he began pacing from wall to wall randomly, and we began to believe he had a stroke, so yesterday morning again we ran him to the vet, the vet prescribed him some Gabapentin for sedation so that he could actually sleep seeing as he spent the whole night aimlessly wandering. He was able to traverse the whole home, his eyes react to stimulation but they're glossed over like a thousand mile stare. Tonight his body is very stiff, and his claws are stuck out, his breathing has slowed down and we dont know if this is his last stand or if he's not going to make it through the night. We cant see an neurologist Monday, and the vet doesnt seem to be doing much in terms of help.

Is there anything we can do? His health has deteriorated so quickly over the course of 4 days, he's gone from a normal friendly cat to a husk of his former self, he's been great for the 15 years of his life and we really want to allow him as much more time as he can have because he deserves it.

For all the information in a tl;dr
He is a 15 year old maine coon, we found him as a kitten around '04-'05, we've never had any health problems, and he's generally been a very healthy cat. On day one he began to act sick, and lethargic, day two he began to pace between locations aimlessly, not sleeping or eating. Day three he continued the pacing, but has been stumbling over things now, and day four he is now just lying stiff, breathing slowly, with his claws extended.

For this past year, I've been secretly upset because of my insecurity of not having any female friends (I got to an all-boy school). As I look around and on social media, I see COUNTLESS of my classmates having multiple girlfriends.

I'm not bothered by it, and I'm not really bothered by not having any female friends TBH, but I'm DREADING prom this spring because I, and many of my friends, don't have girls to go with. 

I don't really want a girlfriend at all. I'm straight, but I just don't feel the need to have one because I'm already happy with my life. In fact, I don't even want to go to prom. I'd much rather hang out with my group of friends than go to some stupid high school dance with a bunch of assholes that is my grade. 

Yet, I feel VERY pressured by my peers to go because you can't just skip prom. It's frowned upon where I am. I'd look like a loser if I don't go. Not only would it be social suicide, but I don't know how I'll explain to my parents why I can't go. It's embarrassing as they always told me how fun and exciting prom was for them, but I just don't see any of that. 

Plus, even if I do manage to find a girl, I don't want to go to prom if NONE of my friends are going. It'd be extremely awkward as I would have nobody to hangout with except my ""date"", so she'd think I have no friends. 

I went to a freshmen dance my freshman year and hated it. I brought a girl, yet we didn't know each other at all. I really want to bring someone I know personally rather than someone I met a day before.

311,"So I recently got a job in fast food. It's last night was my 4th shift (after 20 hours of training)  and I feel like shit. I feel like I'm just constantly in people's way, I dont like yelling which is something we kinda have to do, the manager has scolded me a couple times already because I was misinformed during training, I've had people teach me things more than 3 times because I keep forgetting, and just, I feel like an annoyance. This is my first real job (after a few years of basically babysitting 24/7), and I can't tell if what I'm feeling is normal or not. I feel like by the fourth shift I should at least be somewhat confident in what I'm doing, but well, I'm not. I'm just kinda a klutz.",01Dec2019,1

313,"Since I was young, I strongly believed that the first step to improving yourself was to first create the right environment for you to achieve it. You had to talk to people about your goals and objectives to make them real and in time of need you could get some support to reach the finish line.

As a university student, I have been highly involved in student projects and international competitions, which led me to a position of leadership in many of my involvements which I think of as defining moments in my life.

The thing is that, since I have recently reached one of my greatest goals that I set for myself, I seem to have difficulty living up to my own expectations and image. This hardship makes my objectives seem farther often instead of tackling them I simply push them away and I feel like I am standing still.

If I could summarize my question, what would be a good way to limit yourself when talking about goals self-made pressure. I like to think that I have the Elon Musk vision of aiming unreachable goals, even though I might not reach what I want. This is exhausting and I do not want to lose what I have worked for.

Thanks.",01Dec2019,1
314," tl,dr: AT&amp;T made a mistake and they want me to pay for it.

I was moving out of my place and ATT turned off my internet 5 days before they were supposed to, and in an effort to try to fix it, they created another account to get internet back up and running. I was on the phone with them the whole time this was happening so before they did anything and just to be cautious because I’d seen my dad go through shit with these big companies, I asked if I was going to be charged for all of this. I was told I wasn’t going to be charged for it because it was their mistake and it needed to be corrected, so I said ok. I remember asking them this vividly. they got internet back up and running that same day. nobody came to install anything but they got it back up and running.

a few weeks later, I get a bill for over $208+ from this new account, so I called and they said it was for installment + first month’s bill. I said I was told I wasn’t going to be charged because they made a mistake, plus no one ever came to my apt. to install anything. the front door to my apt building is locked and for anyone to even get in, I would have to let them in. she insisted someone did come and install. THERE WAS JUST NO WAY IN HELL THAT WAS POSSIBLE. I refused to pay. at this point, I had both chatted online and talked to numerous ATT reps and agents to try to sort this out as they had bounced me from one person to another to “resolve the issue as soon as they can because I’m a valued and loyal customer.” I was livid and frustrated. I demanded to talk to a manager and she said she could only credit me a portion of that $208+ and cancel the account. I had had it and no longer wanted to deal with it so I coughed up $16 and some change (for the five days I used internet at my old place) and have the account canceled asap just to get the bullshit over with. I asked her to email me confirmation of all this and she never did.

fast forward to thanksgiving. I get an email saying I owe $15.92 for the same account. I chatted with about three agents online and one of them told me that I was correct and I should not have been charged that, so she transferred me to her supervisor who then said that her direct report was wrong to say such a thing and that $15.92 is the charge between the billing date and the date the account was cancelled which was only three days and there was nothing she could do. there is NO WAY that three days worth of internet is $15.92 when the monthly bill is $50. I was angry as hell at this point and said I WILL NOT PAY THAT BILL. the supervisor went quiet and straight left the chat. I know that being angry didn’t help, but seriously, what can I do, what am I missing here, and what do I need to know? if I don’t pay the bill, is it going to ruin me in the long run, like fuck up my credit?",01Dec2019,1

317,"Don’t know really how to start this but I’ve always been really quiet and never could really start conversations or bring anything up. I do have really good friends but whenever we all hang out I always feel isolated because I’m unable to talk and interact.

The reason for my being unable to socialize stems from a couple of problems: my insecurity relating to a big lisp I have, not knowing how to respond, and being afraid of how people will think of me. I think my biggest problem is not knowing how to interact and what to say. I realized this the most during our family reunion for Thanksgiving. All my relatives would ask me simple questions or say jokes and I would not know how to respond. I would also be scared I’d give a “wrong answer” or something. Whenever me and my friends hang out or whenever I meet new people, I can never think of anything to say and I’m scared to say things because I feel it could come across as creepy or rude.

Basically, my problem is that I have no idea what to say or react whenever someone talks to me. Whenever my friends or people talk the conversation seems so smooth and I feel that I couldn’t talk that way. Whenever people talk to me it’s always awkward because I just resort to simple answers like “yes” or “no” because I can’t think of anything else to say. Any advice?",01Dec2019,1
318,"Hi, i just started renting an apartment and leased it for a year. It all went well checking the unit and signed a one year lease. Here is where I need advice. This was not disclosed to me. I live on the top floor of the apartment. The apartment uses a centralized AC unit and they are placed on the roof. So every time the units below uses their AC, it vibrates and I can clearly hear it and is a bit a nuisance.

Asked my landlord to have a look and to check on it, but she does not have a solution/fix for it. 

So does this entitle me to have the lease terminated?

He is so sweet and caring and absolutely perfect in my eyes, so much so that I could never be with anyone else. Again, I don’t want to sound crazy, I’m not a super clingy girlfriend, I just feel like this fear makes it hard for me to stay anymore than a safe distance away from him. I know he loves me being around, but I don’t want him to feel like he has to stick around all the time for myself to feel content and happy. People we know are dropping dead left and right.

322,"Context: My girlfriend has been off of her meds for a month due to a logistics issue. I’m supportive and I listen to her. I have no issue with her spending time with family alone. She’s been away at school and we facetime almost everyday at some point while she’s gone. I visit roughly monthly. She’s back for thanksgiving break right now. 

The situation: Things have just been weird since she’s been back. We spent two nights together but due to family things and a therapy appointment, didn’t really spend any actual quality time together. We just kind of slept in the same bed and cuddled. We were supposed to hang out last night but she told me she wanted to spend the night alone with her parents (understandable and totally okay). I had left a few things I needed for hw over at her parents house, and just needed to swing by to grab them. She offered for her parents to drop them off tomorrow. Which I thought sounded strange because I felt like that suggested on some level that I wasn’t going to see her again while she was here/ she didn’t want to see me. Additionally, she’s upset with me because I cuddle her when I sleep and it pushes her close to the edge of the bed. She said it’s fine but she hasn’t wanted to hang out since I stopped by to grab a few of my things. 

When I stopped by, I mentioned the sleeping thing and potential solutions and that I had no clue it was that serious of an issue. I also brought up the text about her parents dropping off things and that it made me kinda feel like she didn’t plan on seeing me again/was upset with me. She said that’s not how she meant it and that everything is good with her (like within our relationship). She’s hanging out with them again alone tonight and is leaving early Monday morning. I know that a lot of this is coming from her irritability, but I can’t help but feel as if I’m being crazy or just generally in the wrong. 

Once again, I have no issue with her spending time solely with her parents. Family time is important. It’s just that I feel as if the reason she hasn’t been wanting to be around me, is because she’s upset about the sleeping thing. 

I just want general advice on how to navigate this situation, help repair this issue before it becomes a real chasm between us in the relationship, and general opinion on the sleep situation presented above.",01Dec2019,1

328,"NSFW, TW for mention of sex and related.

Hi everyone, I’m a 20yo man. I’ve been experiencing an issue over the past few years regarding my sexuality. Since I was 13, I came to terms with being gay and, well, that was it, I thought. But within the past few years, I’ve become sexually active and I’m not so sure anymore.

Men? God, yes. Shirtless/naked men? \*Kisses fingers\* Perfection. Men having sex? \[Head explodes\]

The point I’m trying to make is: I love looking at, cuddling with, feeling, and kissing men and men exclusively.

The issue and perhaps the disproving of my homosexuality lies in the fact that no matter what I do, I just don’t enjoy actual, physical sex. I’ve tried bottoming but that wasn’t fun at all. I’ve topped a few times but just didn’t feel anything. I’ve found nothing particularly notable about sucking dick, and getting my dick sucked just elicits a feeling that I’d call more painful than pleasurable.

For lack of a better terminology, is something wrong with me, physically or mentally? Do I need to come to terms with being asexual instead of gay? I’m just so confused, and I desperately want answers because this has been a burning question for a while now and I don’t want to risk hurting someone else over something I’m not entirely sure of. Any advice/wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",01Dec2019,1
329,"First some back story: 

I just turned 18 and am coming back from college next week. The year before I left for college was an intense power struggle between my parents and I, mainly over time spent with my girlfriend \[16F\], who I've been dating for a year and a half. My parents are highly against sex and are stuck in the mindset that high-school relationships are only about getting experience for later relationships. It's important to note that this is mostly my mom, who is manipulative and controls my dad, he follows everything she does/decides no matter what. 

Long story short this made things very difficult for our relationship. There were countless fights and screaming matches in the months leading up to when I left and it got to the point where they didn't let me see her for two months. After an unfortunate event of walking in on us, my mom proceeded to scream at/lecture my girlfriend and I about how what we were doing was so wrong and we weren't old enough etc. My mom forced my girlfriend to call her parents  (who aren't against sex and understand it)  to pick her up, and a massive argument ensued (almost leading to a fist fight). Now both sets of parents are in a feud, which is honestly the main reason my parents disapprove of the relationship at this point. 

The tension between the two families got to the point of not letting my girlfriend attend my graduation. They also tried to convince me to break up with her because they didn't want me ""having a tether to home"".  They also did not let me bring the car I had to college and instead traded it in to get my brother a truck. They track my phone on campus (although I have no idea how often) and monitor everything I buy on my debit card (my money).  

But other than that, college life is so much better and I have a lot more independence and am happier in general. The issue comes when I have to go home for holidays. I will admit that they have loosened the constraints on some things and are letting me see her, however, nothing is on my terms. I don't have a car (previously stated) and they insist that I get a job and interview exactly when told (I am going to get a job but I don't need the stress of having to do it at a specific time). 

Today was my birthday and while I did get to celebrate with friends and my girlfriend, when I got home I got screamed at for ""changing the plan"" because I didn't go to an interview they set up. I ended up grabbing my bags and leaving the house wondering if I was going to go back. Looking back I think I may have over reacted, but at that point I just wanted the fighting to stop because I had gotten used to peace. I feel like i have a preexisting expectation of the same restrictions i used to have. There are other smaller things like nightmares of my mom rushing at me to hit me and the fact that I can't open doors loudly because I was ""trained"" to have to sneak around all of the time. I lived in fear for the majority of my high-school years.  

I basically need advice on how to set boundaries with my parents while keeping a healthy relationship with them and my girlfriend. My girlfriend wants me to do whatever I think is the best option, however, she believes that I should distance myself from them entirely. Her parents have also expressed their sympathy for my home situation and have offered me a place to stay. I am seeing a counselor, but i need help and advice.",01Dec2019,1
330,"Hey!

So my mom is 51 years old. 5'5 , overweight 250lb woman. Had bells palsy effecting her face, she might have some weakness to her arm, may be developing arthritis, recently in past year had multiple lung blood clots and is being treated for all of this... All of this happened after her losing her ""dream"" job, which was extremely toxic, but she loved helping people and was essentially set up by her co-workers to lose her job.

Anyway. All of that was to say.

Recently, she accepted to do some cleaning work at a office which she typically does 1 floor... It's a big place, but she manages to do it with my sister. That job is technically my mom's to do, but she always feels the need to have my sister do it, and my sister never says anything because there is always fights and it's sometimes better to just go along with it to avoid fights.

She just accepted to double the work and take on 2 floors now. But she's expecting my sister to help her. and on the one week she isn't going to be around, she's expecting ME to do it.

My sister and I are angry at our mom because when she was in the hospital with the blood clots, we ended up doing the 2 floors of cleaning because our mom refused to cancel the work NO MATTER WHAT and forced us to do the job for her. (She says it's money for the house, but the point is her own children were telling her it's ok to cancel it considering her SERIOUS health concerns and we were both tired from working and wanted to see her at the hospital... SUPER STUBBORN... We told her this would be THE ONLY TIME we do it, and that she NEVER accept this work again)

Since she's totally disregarded what we told her while in the hospital and accepted the same amount of work, she's expecting us to work with her.

I've been very firm with saying NO. I feel like she tries to manipulate me and says ""I'm gonna be there til 12am working by myself in that building! Anything can happen to me"" or use ""You already agreed"" (I hesitated once and only agreed because she was on my case so much, and guilted me into it) or she'll say ""We always help eachother out! I would help you out but I just don't know what I""m doing!""

I'm BEYOND frustrated, that's she's totally disregarded what we might as well had told her on her potential deathbed and still accepted work and just assumed we would do the work with her, and feel manipulated if we say ""no"" but part of me can't help but think considering all that I told you... 

What if I am a bad son for letting her do this on her own?

What do you think?",01Dec2019,1
331,"I find myself in an interesting situation. I am being layed off from work due to a downturn in business. I live in California right now. I am considering abandoning my apartment lease, taking my unemployment, and moving to Montana.

I think I can hold out for 26 weeks in my current place. Hopefully this will be long enough to find another position. But I want to leave this state and relocating to Montana is a dream of mine. 

My credit would be hurt pretty bad if I went through with it, but I would have a few months to find work in Montana.

I am a software engineer with a few years experience, but so far (only been looking for a couple weeks) nobody is willing to risk going through the hiring process with me in Montana. Likely due to the combination of me being currently located in California and not having a degree. Talking to potential employers in person would likely make a huge difference.

My next major step in life is out of California. It just has to be, I can't stand this state anymore and I'm spinning my wheels. I'm 28 with nothing tying me to this state except siblings and parents. It's a risk to drop everything and try starting over, but I'm still young enough for it.

I know it is winter in Montana now, but I'm not afraid of the cold. I've lived through winters in some harsh places before so this doesn't worry me too much. I have a good head on my shoulders.

336,"Hey reddit 

As the post title says my real father has just contacted me on Facebook. It's been nearly 6 years. Here goes nothing. 

So at one of the lowest points in my life things were pretty bad. I was in an abusive household, my mum and her partner were alcoholic and drank heavily, this resulted in frequent abuse, especially from my mum's partner who beat me on a few occasions. 

I tried to overdose one night because I had had enough, I took a shit tonne of codeine from my mum's (illegal) stash downed with vodka. Ended up out in the town centre passed out and was taken to hospital, liver almost failed and was in there for 5 days. I knew it would be another beating, so I told the staff to call my dad (who at this point i barely saw any way, just hoped for the best) he came and didn't stay long. 

Social services were called in to the hospital and psychiatrists, I stayed at my dad's for about 3 days out of hospital before he threw me out on the street because his then girlfriend and him thought I was a threat to their child.  I lied to social services (out of embarrassment) that I was still there when I actually was sleeping on the street. I was forced to go back to my mum's eventually, however she was insanely mad because social services had enquired about what happened and she raged about her codeine stash. A couple of weeks passed, then her partner headbutted me in the middle of the street one night and I split my head open. 

That was the final straw and I sought the help of social services (finally). They put me in a youth housing project, I still (for some stupid reason) looked for my dad for support. I called on a few occasions and asked if I could see him (he loved close by) because I was struggling living on my own and just wanted support. He kept making excuses and eventually contact stopped. I needed him more than ever and he wasn't fucking there. 

Fast forward 6 years and I've gotten to where I am today, I've worked in professional job fields, am currently taking my degree in archaeology and am studying abroad in America right now for a year. No fucking thanks to him or anyone else. It was all me, I had to wipe my own ass and I struggled through it all to get to where I am now. Anyhow, I recently heard he remarried (again to a different woman) and he's wanting to get back in touch with me. 

I've got a feeling he's only doing it to impress her, but another part of me says give him a chance. I don't know what to do, the bitterness and resentment is still there from when he turned his back on me. I'm at a total crossroads. Should I try and reconcile or should I just walk away? I really don't know what to do! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Many thanks in advance and sorry for the long post but I'm a little upset right now

It was the middle of the year, I couldn't remember anything from that time because everything was a blur. I was very unhealthy and my mind was only set on video games. I let myself go real bad. My skin and hair were dry and messy and I wore clothes homeless people wore. At around that time people I dont know have been approaching me. Pursuing me when I do something that I later realize is cringy, since I was always sleep deprived and dazed in school I didnt realize I did things. I dressed pretty baggy, sweat pants, hoodies, dark colors, and I kept my hair in a messy ponytail. I'm not the prettiest and my body is so awkwardly shaped i dont even know how its functional. I don't really care. One time I let my hair down and since I knew nothing about how hair should look I went to school in messy and dry hair that was generally so wrong that I looked like shit. I also wore a tshirt that was a little regular sized so you could see how I was shaped. I'm not insecure. Im really not. I dont care. [Besides nowadays I have my hair more healthy] but these kids (I guess you can call them popular, their lives dont revolve around memes imma tell you that) started going on like: ""yaas queen"" and ""work it"" and annoying shit like that.

They didnt do this to anyone else. I hated them so much. I was ready to go back to my old ways and fight them in the middle of the hall. I wasnt fit anymore so I knew that would go downhill. I just didnt care. I was stuck, and these rumor spreading retards were breathing down my neck. My friends thought it was weird too. So I decided to just be plain cold to them. I had enough. I broke it down that I didnt like them. And that at this point I'd rather a gun to their heads. I guess they believed it because I got accused of being a school shooter by them. Only, most of the people in our grade knew me. The clubs? It was all Theatre stuff so I had decent nice people back me up. Then next thing I knew, I was cold to everyone. I lost a chunk of friends that were really nice and didnt deserve me being an ass to them.

Its been years later and I couldn't believe I let myself become such a physically bad person. I was a mess. And those people never got out of my head. The genuine embarrassment all those people had to endure around me. I still cant get over it. They still text me. I'm better now but I'm still out of shape. I'm still messed up. I don't know what to do. I realized how much of a piece of shit I look like. Nomatter what, no workout brings back my energy. No diet can bring back my health No amount of water can bring me moisturized. No sleep schedule can get rid of my bags. Because my bad habits refuse to go away, because I think of the way those people breathed down my neck and judged me behind my back. Even tho I dont care anymore: it makes me think about how much of my life I've ruined, and how little hope I have at this point. I'm in highschool and I'm still the same. The only difference is that it's now also affecting my grades. How do I get rid of these problems. I know for sure my friends do the same and I'm paranoid. All those people I talk to, they probably hate me and honestly I hear some of them go on about me in middle school. What can I do to get rid of this embarrassment? And how can I clear my conscious? They'll never understand until I do? What should i do?",01Dec2019,1

342,"this sounds absolutely horrible i know. but here’s the story and a bit of a backstory too. please do not assume anything unless you read the whole thing. sorry is a really long post btw.

my friend, let’s call him liam, has always been super sensitive. not in a bad way, he’s a lovely guy, i get on with him really well and i’ve known him for about for years now. he takes things very seriously and has a lot going on in his life and has struggled with the idea of suicide very loosely.

my other friend, let’s call her ruby, has been a friend of mine for about the same time as liam. her and i though are much closer than i am with liam and i know her a whole lot better than most people do, considering we used to be absolutely best friends. (we still would be if it wasn’t for a number previous arguments before this one). 

both have had a pretty tough year. ruby has lost a dog of hers, a horse and had many high school dramas that weren’t always her fault. this has caused her to get school counselling a bit and cry over small things more frequently. ruby used to be a very private person and not worry about what people think of her, however, this year that all changed. she’s been trying really hard to fit in with everyone, getting all her anger out on me, date more guys than she’s ever liked in her whole life in one year (and is about three which is a lot for her) and worry about her looks a fair bit more than ever. all of which is fine because that’s what happens to teenagers but we started drifting apart slowly due to the fact that she was standing all over me constantly to get her anger and pain out. for months, i would let her and recently i cracked. i felt sorry for her because of how much she’d been through but i’m usually such a selfless person and when she finally said something that hurt a little too much, i snapped. i finally stood up for myself and neither of us knew what to do about it, because i always just put up with peoples comments and the way they treat me. we’ve since grown a bit apart but are still good friends however, when our friend liam has a problem, she took the matter into her own hands.

liam has been through a lot. he’s got an older brother and younger sister and his father is no longer with his mother. his father constantly sends him messages yelling at liam for not doing good enough in football games and treats him absolutely horribly. he felt as if he’d never get a girlfriend and became a bit desperate for one. however, he got into a relationship with someone who he’s know for as long as i have known him and he’s really happy. liam is a very affectionate person and loves hugs from his girlfriend however, she’s really shy and reserved, constantly looking like she wants space from him. this gets liam really insecure and upset. his girlfriend also he’s mad because he tells people about their problems and she thinks she looks like a bad person because of this. 

anyway, enough of a super long backstory, here’s the real story.

this week, liam pulled aside a good friend of mine who he’s quite close with. they had a conversation and it seemed a bit heated and there was a lot of emotion on their faces from what we could all see. we were all worried about what was happening and when their conversation finally finished, everyone wanted to know what happened. ruby went straight to liam wanting to know “the tea”. liam was watching me, knowing i could tell something and had happened. ruby tried to take liam outside and talk to him but they came back in as quick as they went out. he looked at both ruby and i and said the exact words “youse will get mad if i don’t tell you won’t you?”. which i of course, would never. liam has no obligation to tell me everything in his life same with ruby. but he told us anyway.

he took both of us outside and told us he was in a very dark place. i stood there, a bit shocked for a while, trying not to cry. ruby, who was standing to the side, pushed me out of the way and stood directly in front of him where i had been standing and said all this stuff about how he should get help and all. which was fine. i would’ve said the same if i wasn’t in shock. 

i later texted liam and asked how he was doing and gave him advice and someone to talk to. i could tell, it was going to be fine. i was still upset though, considering that my friend was so hurt by something.

ruby the next day got really upset. she thought she was the expert in the situation and knew what was best for liam. she said that her and another friend of liam and ruby’s, has to go to the school counselling centre for a joint meeting. which seemed really stupid to me. this was about liam, not ruby, not me, no one else. and for ruby to go around being sad over a situation that she forced her way into, it seemed all a bit selfish. liam confided in the friend of mine that he originally told because he trusted her and out of guilt, he then told me and ruby. ruby then told the other friend that had the joint counselling session because he knew she would do it anyway. ruby was crying at school and yelling  at me whenever i asked if she was okay or needed anything. this was giving her a fair bit of attention. 

people started worrying about ruby more than liam and he was the one who was actually struggling in the situation. too many people ended up finding out and ruby was making the situation look like it was hers, saying the person lima originally went to wasn’t helping him in the slightest and going him advice when he didn’t need it. 

due to all of this, i got a bit mad at ruby, but not to her face. i spoke to the person liam originally went to with the problem about all of this and she was really upset about how ruby was making it all about her too. i briefly spoke to ruby about how instead of being upset about all this around liam, would she try to make him happy so that he can feel like he’s in a better place sooner. he’s the type of person who’s happy when his friends are happy and the type who is sad when friends aren’t sad. 

am i a bad friend for being angry with ruby? i understand that she is upset, i was too. i was thinking of the worst case possible, but she’s still making the situation all about her and it’s been nearly a week now. i get it’s a serious topic, i do, but for her to go around and make people concerned about her and make the situation a big deal, when liam didn’t want anyone knowing to begin with, made me really angry.",01Dec2019,1
343,"When I was in highschool (all girls school), we had a young, cool but kind of weird english teacher. He was super creative and talked to us like we were adults too (he began teaching at our school when I was in grade 9, and he was 24-26 or so). I really admired him at this time (and honestly had a little tiny crush on him). I and a few others also spent a lot more time with him because we were in several clubs that he ran (the newspaper, etc.). Over the next 3 years we got relatively close (though he was a LOT closer with a few other students than with me), and when I graduated we started texting. At first it was exciting, and just kind of felt rebellious. We met up twice that summer; once as a newspaper club reunion dinner and another at his house with another graduated student. Although, both these times I just felt very awkward, and left earlier than everyone else (I also did not tell my parents or other friends about this....I just kind of knew it felt...weird).

Anyways, fast forward to my first year of college. I honestly probably initated most of the texts; i was missing high school and I felt like being adventurous. None of these were inappropriate. Until the last time I really texted him. I was basically blackout drunk, meant to text my friend and accidentally texted him. It was just really messy, I was drunk, he was drunk. He asked me some questionable things, like why I didnt visit over the holidays, said that he missed me and my talent, and was just giving off a creepy vibe. The  next day I was so embarassed and his asked him not tell anyone that i drunk-texted him (other teachers who would be dissapointed, and any students). That was essentially the end of my communication with him. I became very dry and just stopped responding all together. Then this summer he ran into a friend of mine from school (also graduated) and....asked her if I was ""mad"" at him. This made me so pissed off. I felt horrified that he approached a good friend of mine to ask after me, a former student.

&amp;#x200B;

I just get the creeps from him. What adult man wants to talk so badly to former students (I was 17 at the time I graduated  and during that drunk text exchange). He was never physically inappropriate with me ever, but would overshare personal things about his life with us as students, would have students regularly visit him alone in his office just to hang out (I was always aware that maybe this would be crossing a line, even then when i liked him).

&amp;#x200B;

Oh also! he went on a VACATION with 2 former students in my year JUSt after graduation. I found that SO beyond creepy. What 27-28 year old man wants to go to cancun with 18 year olds.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know if this is something I should talk to someone about, because he never outright said or did anything inappropriate to me (or others that i know of...), but I still feel like he crossed some boundaries. Even though we had graduated, it still feels wrong to me. There is one other former student/friend that I talk to about this, and she is equally creeped out.

What do you guys thing about all this? Is this something I should speak up about? How would I even do this? I'm to afraid to let me parents know I was talking to this older man.

Also hes not even attractive at all.",01Dec2019,1
344,"As the title implies.  I was seeing this girl about a year and a half.  We ended things amicably back in August.  I knew it wasn’t a good relationship for me to be in, so I ended things.  Since then I’ve gone no contact with her, because I still do really care about her but don’t want to get sucked back into that.  She has two young daughters (age 7 and 4).  Just like her I care about them as well, I want the best for them.  When we were seeing each other she lost her job, which resulted in me working even harder because I never wanted the three of them to go without (she was pretty much full time mother and worked part time for her dad).  I’ve invested a lot of money into her and the children already, I don’t/didn’t mind that I cared and still care about them very much.  Christmas is coming up, and I know she still isn’t working, but I want the girls to have a good Christmas.  I was thinking of sending her some money to get the girls gifts and such, but do so anonymously.  I’ve been considering it for a few weeks and keep going back and forth.  I have a feeling if I do it, she’ll know it was me and think I want to rekindle everything.  I have the money to spare, and really want to do it, but at the same time I’m worried about the reaction I might get from her, positive or negative.

For reference, I’m a nurse, I make very good money.  So it’s not like giving her money would put in a tight spot.  I have no children, just my regular bills anyone would pay and my dog.  I was thinking about giving her $1,000.  I figured that would cover the cost of a tree, gifts and stocking stuffers for the girls, as well as money for a Christmas dinner for them.  And maybe some left over incase she needs something over the holidays.",01Dec2019,1

346,"I’ve been smoking weed at night time (a few drags) to manage my chronic pain (fibromyalgia , several other pain syndromes, migraines, etc and more). It helps me sleep and really seems to help my pain. I use it instead of codeine and seems to be helping. 

Also helps with my anxiety and depression. 

But I’m scared of it being a negative habit??!! as I used to be addicted to cigarettes and I know I can become slightly over reliant on anxiety relieving drugs. 

I get mixed messages in society, I get told by my doctors that it makes you psychotic and that codeine, anti psychotics, sleeping pills and drugs stronger than heroin are better for you. Also it seems though to be more widely accepted as safer than other pharmaceutical meds. 

I have been given all these prescription meds and they were awful!! (made my go nuts!)

349,"Before I start I’d like to add a trigger warning. This post contains talk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and trauma. I won’t go into too much detail about it though. 

I also posted this to r/offmychest because I believe it would work there too. 

To begin, I am going to share a little backstory.

Four years ago I was attending a therapy group for girls who have gone through abuse and trauma. And who now have to deal with the mental heath issues it comes with. Towards the end of the group a few girls wanted to exchange numbers to keep in contact. I was hesitant about this but I didn’t want to say no so I agreed.

Fast forward to a few months later. I haven’t contacted any of them. I decided that it would be nice of me to say hi and wish them all well. All of them replied with a quick thanks, doing well, hope you’re doing good too. And that was it. But this one girl in particular continued talking to me.

Right off the bat she started talking about how she was feeling horrible. How she hated her life and her dad. How she was self harming via drugs, alcohol, and other objects. She would even send pill emojis, knife emojis, and gun emojis. She would continue to text me things like this everyday, multiple times a day, every week. There was one night I talked her out of suicide. But by the end of it I was really shaken up.

It would break my heart (and still does) to hear her go through those things. I wanted to help her. I definitely didn’t want her to die. But having someone constantly talking about stuff like that was extremely triggering to me.

I have severe ptsd and anxiety from stuff in my past. I’ve never tried killing myself, and I don’t ever want to. But it was making me feel very anxious to hear things like that. The thought of not saying the right thing and making her want to act upon her urges terrified me. I was only sixteen at the time and I had no previous experience with talking about such things. I’ve always had a heart to help people. I want to be a kind and supportive person for others. So I continued trying my best to talk about positive things with her. No matter how much I tried, she would always revert back to negative subjects.

It got so bad that I was terrified every time I got a text. I prayed it wasn’t her because I just couldn’t handle the stress and anxiety it put me through. So I decided to talk to my parents and my therapist (who was one of the leaders in the group so she knew this girl too) She agreed that this girl was overwhelming me and not respecting my boundaries (early on I let the girl know that I was uncomfortable talking about things like that, she didn’t listen) My parents also agreed that talking to this girl was bad for my own mental state.

This lead to me gently explaining that I was very sorry but I couldn’t continue talking to her anymore. I told her that it was very anxiety inducing and that I was not in the right frame of mind to handle it. I wished her all the best. She was upset and said that she thought I was there for everyone. I apologized again and she didn’t respond. My parents assured me that it was okay to stick up for myself. Even if it made me uncomfortable. I tried to feel like I did the right thing. But I couldn’t help the guilt I felt. It took a while but I eventually deleted her number.

I’m nineteen now, I’m in a bit of a better mental state, and realizing that I want to become a counselor. And the guilt has been coming back to me. It was very hard for me to tell her I couldn’t talk to her anymore. I’ve always been the kind of person to put other people’s needs before my own. So I can’t help but wonder if it really was okay to stop talking to her.",01Dec2019,1
350,"I (22, M) don't really know how to start any of this. I feel so lost and don't know what to do. I don't even know how to TLDR this because it's just about my whole life and and this is kind of a rant because I'm feeling overwhelmed. To anyone who reads, I appreciate you.

If you want to just help with just one aspect, that's fine too.

TLDR maybe: I feel like I'm spread too thin, wanna do so many things, but so restricted. Either financially, time, emotionally, etc. Because of this, I'm overwhelmed and don't know how to use my skills to direct my life to something meaningful.

**Home life**: i've realized i can't stay consistent because I don't really have a place to just be. I kind of share a room with my brother because my parents can't afford a bigger house and rent out the other rooms to international students. I hate this room situation. I don't like my brother and I have to wake up everyday to him sharing my room. I don't hang out there much because he's there. I can't study there. I can't have a place to just put my papers from school in that's just my desk and only mine.

I would love to move out but I live in Vancouver and rent is just too fucking expensive. I can't stay in this house any longer. I feel like it's a trap. And my parents are no help. My dad is an avoidant, emotionally unintelligent, socially unintelligent couch potato. He sits on his laptop (the laptop I gave him after I bought a new one) or his phone for hours on end, just watching political or historical videos. My mom is a clean freak who ruins my mood every time I see her because I used the wrong cloth for cleaning or she watches me cook and tells me how to do it step by step. I'm 22. I don't need to learn how to cook eggs or fry. That's like the easiest cook. They dont have a good marriage, he doesn't respect her he doesn't communicate it's his way or the highway, she's Christian so she doesn't believe in divorce, she gets frustrated all the time. He doesn't have any friends, she's outgoing and has many friends. She takes him out because all he wants to do is stay home and watch videos like a fuckin retard.

I've been trying to be more consistent everyday but more often than not, I do my work and be myself when everyone in the house is asleep, which is late. Most days, I give up sleep just because I can concentrate best when no one is there. I do go to the library, but not having a car and having to travel 45min each way to a place that's not comfortable, wearing uncomfortable clothes (even joggers. they're no pjs, esp for me a student), to do work that I have to reset my mind for everytime is just becoming too much especially doing it everyday. I have to reset my mind because then my papers aren't where they are supposed to be. i lose my flow on my laptop. I have to begin 'starting' again. And starting is always the hardest part. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Dating**: I haven't dated in 4 years. I've been putting myself out there recently and am ready to be in a relationship again, preferably casual because I just wanna get out there and experience life and meet people and learn about myself and what I like. People have told me I'm attractive, why don't I date? I was in a 4 year relationship with a girl. We were just teenagers. But idk I just gained incredible insecurity from that. I didn't think her lacking the initiation for sex affected me emotionally but it did. I just don't see myself as a sexually attractive person. The sex also waned as the relationship went on. And also she didn't introduce me to any of her friends. I'm over her now and I'm learning to love myself now and I think I can get girls to laugh and maintain a conversation, but I'm always scared to take the next step. Of telling them I like them, or going in for the kiss. It comes to a point where we could talk for hours but I can't make the move or don't know how to.

But what bothers me more is I just don't know how to date without a house or without a car. I just want a place where I can like practice dancing or recording myself speak or record myself be flirty. I mean I think I can flirt but because of my insecurity it's always half-assed in the sense that I'm scared to go too far in case she doesn't share the same energy and I get rejected. Then this comes across as mixed signals and eventually becomes creepy. I think I'm the guy that becomes friendzoned. I'm not depressed because of that. I'm learning but it's just frustrating sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intimacy, Touch, and Sex**: I have severe sex anxiety. I've had sex multiple times before and I think I was good at it. I mean she never reciprocated but I always loved going down on her and teasing and everything. But I didn't find myself attractive when I was with her. I don't find myself attractive now. 

I always keep people at arm's length because I'm afraid if they get to know the real me, all hell will break loose and I dont wanna feel heartache again. It's one of those irrational fears that I just have to face so that I can see it's not so bad. But goddamn.

Also, I never know if I really like someone or I'm just so attention- and touch-deprived that I'd go for anyone and then get insecure and not text them back. Insecure because I don't have a house, a car, this, that.

&amp;#x200B;

**School**: I don't know what to do. I think I'm smart. Everyone I meet says so. But in university, intelligence and talent doesn't matter. In high school, when youre smart, youre on the right of the curve and you dont have to do much to get an A. In university, youre average and the only thing that matters is hard work. doesn't matter if you were the smartest or the best footballer or best basketball player in high school. When you get out of there into something more challenging, youre average again and you gotta do the work.

But the thing is, I've lost all motivation for studying. I love learning. I love what I'm learning (Kinesiology). But I just hate studying. and writing papers. and exams. and stress. and anxiety. I feel like I know what I'm doing now. Give me a scientific paper, I'll review it and know what it's talking about. I can quickly evaluate information accuracy. I have a good understanding of physics, chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology, philosophy, religion, technology.

I feel like I'm smart enough, So just please give me the $40,000 piece of paper proving that, right now. Please just let it end. Please, please, please.

I *have* been trying productivity apps like Pomodoro and it helps, but it's still painful. My grades have been suffering the last 3 semesters and my self-esteem is really tied to my grades (Asian parents) and I just can't anymore. I feel like a failure for having like \~10 Cs in my degree.

I have two more years left and I don't think I can take it anymore. I have no life, I can't work full time because studying is more than a full time job. At least with a full time job I can go home and it's over. studying, no no no no you don't get no rest friendo. I do have a part-time job as a bartender in a big event center that pays $25/hour, which is good for what it is. But I only have like up to 10 shifts a month because it's event-based. (I'm not complaining right now because it's the perfect job for a student but I just wanna quit school and find another job).

I want to travel all of Europe in one go, all of Asia, Africa, South America, save up for some photography equipment, get a longboard,  I wanna rave more and enjoy my twenties, I want my own place where I can have privacy and solitude and can bring girls home, I want a car, I want to join an MMA gym and learn how to use my body, I want to build my own PC.

I can do none of this because I can't focus on my career because I'm in school. I recently watched this video and this guy quoted Mark Twain "" I *never let my schooling interfere with my education*. "" I'm starting to understand that more everyday.

But at the same time, I'm so fucking close. I just have to be depressed and anxious for 2 more years and then it's over. I just have to brave being in the same toxic home environment that's holding me back for just 2 more years. I just have to remain date-less and sacrifice fun for 2 more years. Then I get to not be self-conscious and feel like a failure for not finishing my degree.

&amp;#x200B;

**Career**: I don't know how to advance in my career. I am doing a 'Co-op' but in the Fall of 2020, hopefully as a student kinesiologist. I'm really good with networking and have always had good professional (and personal) relationships with managers and coworkers. I understand office politics and know how to play the game. I'm a really fast learner as well. But I don't know how to direct all of that into something useful. I am going to volunteer for a physio clinic soon. I'm planning to just learn more about beer, wine, food so I can apply to be a server and make bank. I am going to do treeplanting in Summer 2020 (Jun to Aug) which has an average daily income of about $250. If you work hard you can gain up to $400 a day. Servers might make more than that, yes, but I'm doing it for more than just the money. I want a job where I use my body. I wanna move around and feel my muscles hurt at the end of the day and then complain about it after at the firepit and drink some beer and smoke some weed.

I want to be in a leadership position but my work experience has kind of been patchy. Largely due to school. Everytime I took a break from school, I've always worked full time. But we're talking one summer break a year. Haven't volunteered much but at every job I always make sure to learn something. But those jobs have mostly been bartending.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal development**: This is an area where I think I'm really good at. But trying to get better at not letting outside influence (i.e. home environment) affect me. Have been trying to practice meditation everyday. Trying to nail down my mood swings and riding the sadness waves (i.e. being sad/angry at 11pm for an hour instead of letting it fester for a week), coping mechanisms, and so on. It's a work in progress. I'm also beginning to accept my anxiety (more general anxiety than panic attacks. but it's at the point where I wake up with anxiety) and manage it through meditation.

I keep a cigarette pack to remind me everyday that I've made it through my worst anxiety. I've never been a smoker, but I smoke occasionally. But it's so easy for me to just have a cigarette everytime I'm anxious. So I nipped it in the bud early on and try not to smoke when anxious. I do other drugs though, all of which aren't really dangerous. i.e. weed, molly, gonna try mushrooms on NYE. But I feel like all those help me and my relationship with drugs have always been of enhancement of a skill I'm learning (i.e. learning that love is a connection, not something I can get from someone to satisfy my hurt ego. molly intensified this) rather than of dependence.

I do have a big impostor syndrome and never feel enough and always feel like I gotta be doing the next thing. esp cause everyone around me is doing well in life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gym**: I'm kind of scared of the gym. Then I get insecure because I learn all these things in Kin about how you lose strength so quickly and if you don't use it you lose it. Plus I know it just feels so good after. But everytime I go, I feel like I'm not doing something right. I guess I'm not worried about others as much. But I'm worried about ""Oh, this form might be wrong"" and then ""fuck i should know this im in kin.""  i used to be in analysis paralysis and now I go to the gym to fail. In a good way.  I might not know what im doing but everytime I try to learn. but then I never have time, idk man. it's all a mess.",01Dec2019,1

353,"Hi everyone. This has been the most emotionally draining month of my life.

In late October, around Halloween, I got the news that my dad had been involved in a very serious car accident with a family of 4. The driver of the other vehicle was six months pregnant, and her siblings were also in the car with her.

My father was coming back from getting groceries when the woman pulled out right in front of him coming from a fast food place. My father ( who drives a pretty big truck) t boned the woman very hard, as it basically crumbled her car. 

While on the scene, the passenger ( a sibling) revealed to the EMT’s that the woman was six months pregnant, and needed medical care immediately.

After hours of waiting for a report, I found out from our towns Facebook page that she had died. ( I live in a very small Oklahoma town.) After seeing her name I was absolutely sickened. 

I knew her. She graduated my highschool last year and was a grade above me. I was good friends with her little brother, and played football with him.

I was emotionally distraught. As soon as i got on Snapchat all i saw was posts in her memory. I had a crippling anxiety attack and hyperventilated for what felt like forever. I missed school the rest of the week because it was all everyone was talking about.

My father suffers from PTSD, and i now feel quite depressed and scared for the future. No one has found out my dad was involved, but I feel like the secret is going to come out any day.

I hate carrying the weight on my shoulders. Even though it was not my fathers fault, I feel like I’ll be known as “ the kid who’s dad killed a pregnant woman”. For the rest of my highschool career. I feel like I’m hiding a giant secret, and everyone will hate me and look at me different when they find out.

It also kills me seeing her siblings at school everyday. They don’t know it was my father that took their sister away. I hate it. I want to transfer to another school or online school, but I’m also scared of the isolation that brings.

My father is also very scared of retaliation from the father, as the father of the baby is not very well respected in our town ( with reason).

What do i do reddit? How do i cope with the guilt of seeing these people everyday? How do I stop feeling like I’m hiding a secret from everyday?

354,"**We’ve been dating for 9 months**

What will happen is I will want to have a few drinks one night or smoke some stuff with him and he’ll start acting like he’s my dad and get strict. 

A couple examples are... 
1) I was going to a graduation party earlier this year and I, obviously, was planning on drinking. The second I told him about this he got all quiet and upset over it. We went to dinner before the party and we didn’t talk the whole time because he was upset over me drinking at a party. 
2) Him and his friends smoke week everyone once in a while, usually on weekends. If I’m not working then I’ll come over and smoke with them if I don’t have to get up early the next day but whenever I’m with him and bring up smoking he never wants me to get my own stuff or smoke with anyone else but him. 

I’ll get upset in these situations because I feel like I’m being “controlled” or being told what to do, even though we are both adults and he’s not my parents. He gets frustrated with me because I’m a bad listener and I get upset over him getting upset at unreasonable situations.

The thing that really bothers me is that
 1) I’m not an alcoholic or crackhead or anything. I rarely drink or smoke. I only really do it with him.

2) He does these things too. It’s not like he has something against drinking or smoking because he does these things too, probably more than me.

I just get frustrated because it’s like he does these things whenever he wants but I feel like I have restrictions on when I can do these things without him getting mad over it and I feel like I can’t order a drink at a restaurant or have a smoke on a day I’m not doing anything without us arguing about it.


*PS he also straight up told me that if I smoke on the regular it’s a dealbreaker for him. And on the other hand, I told him that even though I get anxious when he smokes and drinks too, I don’t care what he does and I’m not gonna tell him what to do as long as he’s safe because I’m not his mother but I still care about him*


What do I, and we, do about this?

356,"Hello! Before I start I just wanted to say please excuse any grammatical errors in what I say below. :)

  
So I kinda gave up trying to fix my dysfunctional family. Given up on always being a pushover looked down upon maid. I don't know when it started, but at some point, I became the silent backbone of my ""family"" with absolutely no recognition. Anytime there's a problem I get blamed, my are family are absolute slob hoarders that leave a mess everywhere, and I'm the one who has to clean it. I tried to bring up how I pick up after everyone and was told IM THE ONE who's a slob and has a problem. 

Everyone treats me like I'm below them, and that I owe them for gracing me with the opportunity to clean their dishes, dirty laundry, trash, and hair shavings they so thoughtfully left on the ground just for me. They act as if I always need to listen to what they say, and that they're always in the right. They always talk over me, and never listen to what I have to say, but when I do it to them they act like that is the most awful thing and ignore me.  I'll ask for them to buy me something online, and someone always has to say how selfish I am for even asking.

Trust me I've tried it all, psychology tricks, rules, befriending them, rewarding positive wanted behavior, giving them a taste of their own medicine, trying to talk to them about it, even flat not being their little dog maid anymore, none of which worked. I guess It's not all bad, we sometimes times have good moments, but it can into a fight in the blink of an eye. It's funny because they can call me the most awful horrendous disgusting things, make me cry and doubt myself making me feel like I deserved it, then they forget what they said after few seconds then blame ME for being so sensitive. But when I slightly raise my voice or say no, I'm ALWAYS in the wrong, and a total piece of shit that everyone hates.  
The day I found out the way they were treating me wasn't right was the day I became a parasite, I acting like the helpless dumb pushover person they think I am.  I know this might sound bad, but I'm giving them what they deserve and taking advantage of them as much as I can without them even knowing. 

I have to say it's made me a stronger person and gave me many tricks that will be useful to me in the future,  but at the price of not having a childhood, unfortunately. I just wanna leave, I don't wanna be like this, I don't wanna deal with them, I hate being depressed, feeling like I'm under their control, sleeping on a couch, not having my own room, and having all my belongings being able to fit in a single box. I don't have a job, and on the rare occasion, I have money I usually spend it on things that make me happy. Idk the first thing about finding a job, paying bills, or saving money, because no one cares enough to help.  I try so hard to be positive, and by brain always tries to block out bad memories, but it still takes an emotional toll on me, and I'm just tired of covering up the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

SO what should be my first steps? I want to set a good foundation for my future. I would be so grateful if you could give me advice to point me in the right direction. It could be Educational wise, Career-wise, Financially wise, anything you think will help me.",01Dec2019,1

In late October, around Halloween, I got the news that my dad had been involved in a very serious car accident with a family of 4. The driver of the other vehicle was six months pregnant, and her siblings were also in the car with her.

My father was coming back from getting groceries when the woman pulled out right in front of him coming from a fast food place. My father ( who drives a pretty big truck) t boned the woman very hard, as it basically crumbled her car.

361,"Okay so the title sounds hella wacky, but I'll try to explain myself. BTW this is a throwaway account because I don't want this to get back to me. 

Basically I work at a movie theatre, and have been for about a month. Almost a week ago a guy got hired (Let's call him C), we banter back and forth, are pretty open with one another, and joke about relationships from our past. As of late he's started to establish physical contact, i.e patting my shoulder, nudging me with his elbow, all platonic things. And my heart can hardly take it, I'm a super physical person and I catch feelings hella easily. Anyways, the real reason I took the time to make this throwaway, is a conversation me and him had tonight.

A movie was just getting out, and he was saying a good line as guests left, ""Have a beautiful day in the neighborhood"" and it made me feel hella awkward, don't know why but it did. And I kept telling him to just stop (playfully) and he continued no harm no fowl. Then he makes a side comment, ""What? I'm charming, older women and highschool girls typically take a shining to me"" I chuckled and muttered looking away (people were walking past so I figured he wouldn't hear) and said, ""I've noticed"" implying my own feelings. He repeated what I said with a chuckle before saying something along the lines of, ""It's kinda obvious"" I got super flustered and switched topics as quickly as I could.

My question is: Am I the innapropriate one for catching feelings? And how should I act on this moving forward?

I appreciate any comment, and anything said will be taken to heart.

I made friends with him on a dating website. [We're both gay.] We text each other a lot.  And we hung out once so far in the couple months we talked. [Between school and work it's really hard to find time to see anyone.]  But he gets really really annoying because he guilts me for not seeing him. Or tries to twist my arm into making me say that I like him or not every night. It's really uncomfortable. And spends a lot of time talking about his past romantic woes. And I feel like that guilts me from saying it to his face that I don't like him like that. 
I feel like he's just really lonely and needs friends to see.  
Its kinda toxic imo.  I feel like this isn't someone I should be spending my time on when there are more significant friends that won't, you know, won't guilt me for seeing someone else.

363,"Background-background: I'm 16, a junior in high school, and a lesbian, but neither me or my gf are out of the closet to our families.

Background: in march of sophomore year my friend texted me on snapchat and said she wanted to set me up with a girl she knew and I agreed. One thing led to another and we've been together since April and she's made me so happy. She's probably the most stable person I've ever met (my dating history goes Cheater, Psychopath AND Cheater, Psychopath, and I thought my current gf was pretty normal considering what I've been through).  A big part of it was that I knew I was getting nowhere with my crush I've had on this girl since freshman year (we'll call her S, she comes into the story later) and I needed to move on. I connect to my gf way more than I ever did in past relationships and I feel like she really gets me, as cheesy as that sounds, but despite all this something didn't feel right.

A couple road blocks in our relationship is that we both go to different schools (we'll call my school School A and her school School B), we're both in the closet (I've never even mentioned her to my family), and we've never met irl and only talk on Instagram, but we've made it for this long and we're both happy like this.

Main story: I was on a group chat with my friends (this chat also has S in it, getting over my crush on her made her WAY more approachable) and half the chat goes to School B and everyone, save for 3 people including me, went a different middle school as me, so idk their WHOLE history together. My friend L was gushing about his girlfriend when he asks me how me and my gf met. I tell the whole story, my friends think it's cute and I send them a picture of her (I've mentioned her a thousand times in the chat but this is the first picture I've sent). My close friend, B, goes to School B, recognizes her and the conversation goes like this:

B: is that (girlfriend's name)???
Me: yeah... lol why did you not know it was her??
B: dude I'm sorry to say this, but I hate your gf

And at this point I was like wtf dude but then she tells me that my gf used to be her bully. She also used to be VERY rude to S, but apparently they've made up but B still HATES my gf for it. She was also VERY rude at B's friend's funeral which was around last year if I remember correctly (I didn't know him so details around that are a little fuzzy).

Honestly, I feel so betrayed because I've asked my gf if she knew B before because they have the same dual credit class and she said she's only heard of her but never met her. Why would she lie to me?? I've mentioned her to my friends (including S) who have met irl and went to school with her, why wouldn't they tell me??

My question is: what do I do? How do I bring this up to my girlfriend? Should I break up with her? She makes me really happy but I don't think I could be with someone who would do awful things to my friends. I'm in such a crisis and idk what to do about it??",01Dec2019,1

I have developed an addiction for weed over this time, once I get home from work its the first thing I do and its the last thing I do before I go to sleep.

So what happened is, I was dropping my sister off at her job and when I left and was about to get on the highway and I noticed this car behind me. As I was driving on the highway, they switched lanes whenever I did and got off the same exit as me. I was getting close to my house and saw that they were still behind me and I was suspicious at this point. So I took a long winded and unnecessary route to my street. They followed me the entire way. I went down a side street and called my mom. As I was turning they went the other way, back to a street we had already been down, basically confirming that they were following me, and they probably only stopped because they thought I was calling the police.
It really freaked me out because I have no idea why they’d be following me all the way from 2 towns over. I guess I just wanna ask what I can do to get back my peace of mind when I’m driving. It generally doesn’t take much to make me anxious, and I don’t want to be paranoid watching every car that drives behind me.

Someone gets shat on everyday. At anyone time there’s about 15 of them scavenging for food. In extreme cases they’ve gone inside the cafeteria kitchen and swallowed a slice on pizza whole.

So I (16 M) was at their house last weekend and I saw their 12 year old son sitting next to the pool full of crayfish just watching them crawl around in the pool.

When I was closer and could see the other side of the pool, I could clearly see several corpses of crayfish scattered around the area behind the pool. There were at least 25 dead crayfish that had been sliced, smashed with rocks, impaled with sticks, and other brutal methods of murder. I was kinda shocked by the sight and turned to look at the kid. He just said to me ""Please don't tell mom and dad."" with an empty expression. So I just skedaddled on away from him and went to mingle with other people, but in the back of my mind, this kid slaughtering these fish so brutally was eating at me a bit.

There have been times when I've seen a guy friend or some random dude and complimented them for their handsomeness but I never thought that made me gay.

And for some unexplainable reason, I kept running into more gay smut stories on random questions and posts where you wouldn't even expect them.

382,"My best friend hasn’t talked to me in a few weeks now. I don’t really know what happened, but i’ve been trying to reach out. I’ve called and texted and been ignored. But she keeps posting on her pt (private twitter) and finsta (private instagram). I’ve even tried making plans with her but she either cancels or makes an excuse or just flat out ignores me. I know she’s not a bass person and she’s quite honestly my only friend. I don’t know who else to ask and  I just feel like giving up on trying to reach out. Would it be wrong to just stop trying?

384,"To start, my brother is 12 years older than me. (I was adopted when I was 2) He: 34 Me: 22. He has 4 kids. 2 biological frat twins ( boy and girl ) and 2 older kids that he adopted. My brother is in the middle of a messy divorce with his wife, he just got it finalized. It was messy because he was essentially seeing a girl a month before it happened. He claims that he and this girl are just friends, but they go out on “friendship dates”, he buys her jewelry, perfume, brings her food to work, and other gifts. He’s also paid to have her car fixed numerous times. When confronted on this he’ll respond with “What separates a friendship from a relationship” “Why can’t friends do that?”  He states that he likes her, but they will wait until after he gets out of the divorce to date, but they’re moving in together with this girls daughter, and his daughter. (Also important to note; this girl was forced to move out of her apartment for an unknown reason, and moved into her friend’s basement) 

I also feel my brother is putting his desires of keeping this girl he’s talking to happy above his own kids. He is retaining full custody of his younger biological daughter (All of his children had a choice, but little time to make it). His daughter gets along really well with this girls daughter. He bought his daughter a brand new iPhone and told his son his mom was going to get him one (knowing his mom couldn’t get him one as I later found out). As of today, they haven’t moved into their new house, but my brother picks the twins up every weekend and they all do stuff together. They have just started bringing this girls daughter into the mix, and the two girls team up and bully his son. My brother won’t take up for him at all, but if his son says something that hurts their feelings, and they complain, then he’ll tell him to be quiet or stop being a bitch and he’ll just let the girls bully his son. Basically, he shows extreme favoritism towards this girl and his daughter, and his son is placed in a bad position. It’s extremely frustrating to witness. 

My brother has neglected me and my mom. He couldn’t be there when we needed him. He was in the hospital for a week, and I stayed in the hospital by his side and didn’t leave multiple times. I have chron’s and it became active, and I was in severe excruciating pain, and needed him to drive me to the emergency room (I drove him to the emergency room at 4 in the morning because he was having chest pains). He told me he couldn’t because he was hanging out with Mallory. He didn’t message me until our mom forced him to check on me. I had to go to the emergency room again because I was coughing up blood, and I had to sit at the emergency room for an hour because he didn’t want to be late to work. (It was 5 and his work started at 7) If you are unfamiliar with chron’s, it can be a debilitating disease when it’s active. My brother moved back in with our mom, and she was upset with him for numerous issues, but one was him not helping around the house. So my mom tells me that he tried to scapegoat me, saying I’m not doing anything. He hasn’t asked me how I’m doing once, and he just gives off the vibe that he doesn’t value me anymore. 

Also talking to him would be pointless. He is a lier and very manipulative. I tried to bring all of this up in a convo. I started off with; hey bro, my new job gave me a Nike Employee Store Pass, and he’s like, “so I can use it” Everyone has tried to talk to him and he blows smoke up everyone’s ass or gets upset so he doesn’t have to talk. My gut tells me to just phase him out of my life until he becomes a better person, but I need some advice!",01Dec2019,1

I looked at some local postings and actually found that it had been found a month prior. I contacted the person who found it that time and the person who claimed to know the owner. The person that found the cat (Dave) said that the owner seemed very aggressive and uncaring about his daughter's cat. The cat seems just under a year, no tag or chip. Clearly the owner let the cat continue to go back outside. The kitty also seems very friendly and cuddly unless it see's feet or shoes and then becomes a little defensive and hissy. Not sure if this means it was abused. Its very small and hungry. At this point I'm not sure if I should try to give it back to the owner or Dave. Dave said he'd gladly take the cat because they got along fine and loved it. Is it really my choice to make? Should I intervene based on one side of the story? I just want the kitty to be safe.

We kept taking and he kept flirting, calling me cute and stuff. I declined his offer twice. Anyway before leaving he asked if I would go ride with him.

395,"So I’m a 19F who has been with my boyfriend for over 3 years now, and he’s been the absolute love of my life. He’s attentive, supportive and so much fun. 

I’ve always had some sort of feelings for girls as well as boys, however I always just brushed it off and said ‘oh I’m bi, cool’ and never felt the need to make anything out of it. However recently, something hit me one night like a brick. I think it occurred when I was watching a video and just thought ‘am I attracted to the girl in this video?’ and ever since then I’ve been obsessing and freaking out that I like girls, even though I knew it previously. Every time I see anyone in public I over analyse my attraction to them, trying to quantify my attraction to each gender even though rationally I know gender is fluid and I can’t control my attraction. I’ve been over analysing everything in my past, trying to determine if what I felt is real or looking for signs I was secretly a lesbian all along. I know in my heart everything I felt for my boyfriend was real, but my mind is twisted and I’m over analysing every aspect of my life. I can’t tell if the attraction I’m feeling is manufactured or real because I’m so fixated on this. I can’t even go out in public without this affecting me.

Every time I sit down and say to myself ‘I’m bi’, it doesn’t quite feel right to me. I worry that I don’t feel as much attraction for boys as for girls, even though I’ve had crushes on boys all my life and have never actually crushes on a girl.  I currently am finding my attraction more directed at girls, even though I know I have been attracted to guys. I think my attraction to guys could be more emotional and based on a connection rather than looks, which is something I never even questioned before because I just had the feelings. In other words, I think my sexual attraction is more geared towards women.

I have lost attraction towards my boyfriend and am constantly in floods of tears longing for it back, because I love him so much and so badly want to feel normal in my relationship again. I can’t sleep or eat, and I’m driving myself crazy looking for a finite answer to my confusion. I can’t even hang out with him anymore because every time I do I’m driving myself crazy wondering why I just don’t feel what I used to feel. The idea of him with anyone else deeply hurts me and living my life without him is a thought that I hate to have, but I just don’t know how to revive my feelings and would give anything to feel them again. 

Within this, many things are tied up and I’m having trouble knowing if they’re contributing or I’m just analysing it all wrong. I had a pregnancy scare recently and, just like in this situation, went mad googling whether I was pregnant. I wasn’t. But it scarred me because I really genuinely thought I was pregnant and going to have to deal with it, and I feel like it could have something to do with this lesser attraction I feel to my boyfriend. Also, we had a period where we weren’t able to see eachother for about 3 weeks due to work and I feel like that may have caused some distance as well. On top of this, I am a person who suffers with depression and anxiety so I don’t know how much that affects anything either. However, since this is all happening in such a close time frame, I feel like I don’t know what’s contributing and what’s not. 

So i guess from this you can see how much I’ve been overthinking, and you probably think I’m crazy and are wondering what I even want to know. Essentially, I want advice. Do you think I can ever get those feelings for my boyfriend back? How should I work on my relationship going forward, given that I just want it back the way it was? What’s your opinion on how I should begin to accept my sexuality, or what my sexuality even is? Has anyone been through this before in terms of overthinking, or suddenly having this happen? Were you able to get through it if you were in a relationship?

I’m just struggling so much and am at my wits end as to how to just let this matter go and get on with life with my boyfriend like I planned. I don’t want to be unhappy like this forever.",01Dec2019,1
396,"i’m sorry for any mistakes, im writing this in the middle of a lecture on the verge of breaking down lol.

let’s start from the beginning, before going to uni i had no clue what the hell i wanted to do, my parents like most asian parents just wanted me to be a doctor, and since i was the first of my sisters to do that well senior year and due to the fact that i just wanted to make them happy to pay them back for all they’ve done for me, i saw this as the only way to finally make them proud, i decided to go for it and ended up doing the opposite. 
first year went fairly well, i got marks that made them kinda satisfied and all was swell.



 last year ( i was in yr2 ) first semester i failed one of the five courses i had,( i had passed it before the uni decided to go for a whole new grading system and ended up failing one due to that) i was devastated and very much in shock ,i was terrified of the makeup exams and my parents were extremely disappointed to say the least, i briefly mentioned that i can’t take this stress and that im not really the one to burry myself in studying and maybe this just wasn’t right for me but because some other students were also affected ( about 30 out of 150) they just told me that it was bad luck and brushed it off, // and then the next semester i ended up failing all four courses at once, i admit that i didn’t study nearly as much as i minimally should but i just couldn’t, i had  quit basically every team or activity i had and just to get rid of the guilt of not doing well and went into deep fucking depression, i didn’t even blink about the news of failing and literally was numb as fuck, i didn’t care about friendships, uni grades or literally anything. 
(now in my uni failing more than 2 courses means that you will repeat the year no matter what and wont be able to do any makeup exams, and during the year you repeat you have to retake any course you got less than a C in which in my case is every course but one ) now that literally broke me down, i am not mentally able to go through all that stress all over again, i for the second time told my parents that i wanted to quit and that i had no desire for this.

the conversations i have had with my parents during that period were the most draining and destructive ones i’ve ever had in my life, but i don’t blame them at all for reacting that way, they pay for my education and for the roof above my head and i deserved way worse tbh.

after two years of me being a lifeless sad fuck i didn’t know what i wanted to do , but taking a gap year was a no fucking way to my parents and not knowing what i wanted was an even bigger no fucking way, and without any of these two i just had to suck it up and so at the end i told them that i’m gonna take a coding course along with the summer courses of the 2nd yr of med school) and if i got a good mark i would just do that. i got a C- in both medical courses and a B+ in my coding course, and when i told them that they were like oh you didn’t fail the summer courses you just repeat the year and brushed it off ( these two courses were considerably easier than the ones i failed but they weren’t convinced when i said so) 


and so here i am repeating the year, did absolutely terrible on my midterms, i am literally burned out have seriously considered suicide and just want this to end.

i am so scared and i just need advice on what a person would do in my situation, as every one i’ve ever went to has told me that if i did quit i would have waisted three years of my life and that im going to be living in life long regret of leaving this chance so many people “ dream” of getting. not to even mention wasting my parents hard earned money:(",01Dec2019,1

398,"I know in today’s advanced technology, doctors can run tests during the pregnancy to determine genetic or other disorders. But things like autism and a spectrum of other disabilities can’t be captured via a test. I’m just so intensely gripped with the fear that my future child(ren) could be disabled too. How can I deal with this fear in a mentally/psychologically healthy way?

A lot of this fear and anxiety stems from watching my parents’ lives caretaking my sibling with special needs. He’s now almost 30, cannot live independently, and my parents are caregivers with no end in sight. My mom stayed home and stopped working to take care of him when it became clear he had special needs. My dad worked so hard since it became single income household. They never were able to save enough money to buy a house. My sibling is a nightmare on many days. 

I love my life right now the way it is — great career, freedom, financially stable. I’m so scared if I ever have children, what happened to my parents can happen to me too, and I’d be spending my whole life stuck as a forever caregiver for a child who can never be truly independent.

I expect when my parents pass away, I will also be involved in some way with my sibling. In a horrible nightmare, I can’t imagine the stress of a special needs child AND my sibling. I sometimes also think I shouldn’t have children, period, just to avoid this reality 100%. 

I know these thoughts are very irrational in some way. There are no promises in life. No one can ever guarantee how your children will really turn out. And even if they are healthy, there are so many other things that could go wrong. 

How can I get over this fear? How should I think about it in a more mentally/psychologically healthy way?",01Dec2019,1

A bit of context: I am a 15 y/o teenager practicing satinism. My mom an I had discussed before (months prior, keep in mind) that I didn't believe in God. She seemed perfectly fine with this and even told me whatever I practice is fine with her as long as I don't hurt anyone.

The incident: I had been hanging out with my sister and her fiance that day and we went to dinner together. The topic of religion comes up because my brother in law has recently converted to Christianity after being agnostic his whole life. We start talking about different religions and something about some church being slightly hypocritical in some of their practices comes up and I casually mention about that being the reason why Satanism was created, and why people like me practice it.

I get a look and a relatively loud and almost condescending / sarcastic ""Really?"" from her. I ask her what's wrong and she looks exasperated and says ""Well clearly I've failed as a mother!"".

405,"TL;DR in the title. I apologise for any spelling/grammatical/etc errors.

My parents said that they got rid of the door because ""I'm a teenage girl and teenage girls don't deserve privacy."" I haven't had a single good night's sleep since that door was removed.

I can't explain it, but being around my parents gives me a large amount of stress. I have anxiety and I only have this specific feeling of stress around them. It doesn't go away.

Whenever they come into my room (which is usually between 8:00 - any time I'm trying to sleep), it's for something mundane. Whether it's to tell me I'm too fat, to make fun of whatever interest I have left, to tell me I'm wrong about some random thing we had never discussed because I don't initiate conversations, etc.

The crazinest thing was the time my mom put a lemon in my room because she read on Facebook that lemons are the cure for anxiety and being in the presence of one is helpful. 

I can't explain it, but every time my mom comes into my room when I'm trying to sleep, I just don't sleep that night. The stress just makes me cry until I can't anymore. 

The feeling can only be described as thinking ""I'd rather be asleep or dead,"" and that feeling is so overwhelming it doesn't do away, therefore, no sleep.

I'm writing this at 3am because my mom woke me up to tell me that radiation from my phone could cause cancer. We spend yesterday at a family gathering and got home late, and because of this I only got an hour of sleep and there's absolutely no way I'll go back to sleep.

My parents aren't open to any criticism of the sort, but I'm so tired. I just want to go to sleep. I haven't gotten a healthy amount of sleep in months and I just can't take it anymore.",01Dec2019,1
406,"I know this guy from a meetup. I first met him one or two years ago but we barely talked, and then I was away for a while but I started going back to the meetup again this summer. It’s a male-dominant tech meetup and sometimes I (introvert!) find it quite scary to talk to anyone so I’d usually try to stick with those whom I know or I feel comfortable with to talk. 

This guy happened to be the one I liked and felt comfortable with to talk. I messaged him on the site after one of the meetups this summer, telling him it was nice to meet him, he replied saying the same and that he hopes to see me again. I then replied to say I’d like to see him again for a drink or something. 
He replied saying he’d like to meet up but he’s going away but gave me the dates when he’d come back so we meet up, but that was when my family was coming to visit me and then things got busy.

So there was a couple of months gap till we met in the next meetup last month and the another one which was last week. We had been sending messages in between but I was thinking that maybe he wasn’t interested so I had backed off, but in person I was feeling a lot more positive vibes that he seemed interested. He buys me drinks in meetups.

He’s done some software work over years that is paying him back so he freelances from home. While we were chatting last week during the meetup, he mentioned that he hasn’t been very productive and he feels he needs a holiday. However, he’s a vegan environmentalist and he only travels once a year by train and ferry to visit his family, so he isn’t going anywhere till next summer!

I find him very compassionate which is something I haven’t had in a long while in my life but I also feel he is a bit depressed and maybe the compassion is coming from the projection of his own sadnesses. To explain this better, I’ve gone through too much in recent years but I’ve learned (not very well!) to not tell people about my experiences because they usually don’t want to hear even if they ask first. However this guy would ask me about things and while I’ve become conditioned not to say much, I notice he’s usually interested in listening and hearing more and sympathizing. 

I messaged him to ask for some help (buying advice!) earlier this week and he was quite responsive. Then in the evening I had mixed up the dates and had gone to a film that wasn’t on that night. As I had told him about that, I replied to his message and told him that the film wasn’t on and suggested to grab a drink if he’s free. He didn’t respond till the next day when he wrote to say that he saw my message late and felt bad about not replying quicker and so on. And that he’s not very functional at the moment but we’ll have to grab drinks some other time. 

I replied and asked if there was anything I could help with and that he should reach out if he needs help. He replied today to say that he’s ok but has been very unmotivated and is hibernating and that doesn’t help. 

I’ve been through long phases of sadness and loneliness during recent years (if not all my life!) which has led me to situational depression according to the doctor and I’ve been taking very low dose medication for a few weeks now which has already got me out of that darkness, yet I’m struggling with getting things done as well (I have no external motivation).

I find him intriguing and intelligent [a bit too slim for my liking], while I do care about the planet and try to do small bits to help, I’m not vegan nor I avoid flights, etc. I also don’t have kids while he has a 9-10YO who doesn’t live with him all the time. He’s an expert in the area that I’d like to get back to learn.

I’d like to help him get out of that dark mood, and cheer him up and get to know him more and get/give motivation. How should I do this? Or what should I tell him now that he’s opened up to me?
 
TL;DR: I’ve known this vegan environmentalist guy,  father of a 10YO for a while who works from home [and doesn’t have to] and seems a bit [seasonally] depressed, and he’s opened up to me about how unmotivated and unproductive he feels.

I love belly button piercings so much and that's why I want to get one but I'm not absolutely sure If I should finally do it. Now I'm wondering what girls think about that?

411,"Me (22F) and my boy (23M) have been doing great for the past year, we almost never fight and we're madly inlove and most recently we got ourselves a dog. I have never owned one before, we have a cat and I've been around them all my life, i love how independed and clever they are. He previously had a couple of big dogs and really wanted to try again so in a blitz we conpromised on a dobermann. It's been a couple of weeks and honestly I am shitting my pants, it's all very new to me, we have eatablished strict rules with the dog, he still has accidents all over the house and I feel very tense all the time when the three of us go out. If i'm holding the leash my Boy will start giving the dobe commands and i feel out of place the whole time, then we end up having a fit because he insists I order the dog around more by following his instructions. I understand the order is very important to the dog but the pressure of being tested everytime we step outside for a walk and stressing about failing every step i take with the dog puts me in overdrive mode. I lose all of the confidence and dont feel like i should be doing it at all, it quickly spirals and I regret getting it all together. I cant express it out loud because it seems very negative and temporary for me,i know it will get better but my Boy gets hurt and confused because I fail at following directions and explaining the reason to him. So far it's been 90prc work and 10prc fun most of it is when i walk him on my own and we go on explorative adventures, everything else is sending me straight down. I dont even know how to talk to him about this, I dont want him to exlude me or feel alone in this.
How should i go about this?

412,"Hi so this is my first post to Reddit ever so sorry if it’s messy. Basically, I’m 18 years old and have lived in the same house in New Hampshire my entire life. My entire life is here, all my friends and family and memories. I live with my mom, two sisters, and their 2 husbands. Me and my mom are leaving for Asheville, North Carolina in 14 DAYS. My one sister and her husband are going to Arizona and the other 2 are going to Florida. One sister is taking my 10 year old dog who I love dearly. Saying goodbye to my dog is probably going to be equally as hard as my dad/friends. I was so excited for this move and to finally have a cute little place with just me and my mom. But now its 5 am and i’m having a full mental breakdown in bed. I’m so fucking scared because I don’t go to college and don’t have any family in North Carolina. We are simply going because it’s cheaper living. My whole life feels so out of control right now and moving all of our stuff out of this house that we’ve lived in for the past 20 years is beyond stressful. I guess I just need reassurance and advice from people who have experienced a big move like this.

414,"My dad is nowhere near a bad guy. He did a good job raising me while he was living here with us, and when I do see him, it's always a good time. But, whenever I do think about him, the reason he moved away always comes to my mind, and I don't know why.

In September 2010, we moved into a new house after living in a condo for 2 years shortly after I started 3rd grade. Not long after this, my parents' relationship was kinda starting to deteriorate. They were getting into loud arguments more often; I remember once somebody's glasses and the windshield on our SUV got cracked (don't ask me why \*shrugs\*). Around April/May 2011, my dad started growing weed behind our backyard near the forest, like a full-fledged garden of the shit. He kept it hidden from my mom and me for a while. Then in August 2011, my cousin stayed with us one weekend and he was smoking ice with my dad.

That's when things started to really go sour. When I was in 4th grade, I remember my mom talking about my dad and drugs a lot. By this point, she knew about the weed my dad was growing and was afraid of the cops coming to arrest her or have CPS take me away. By October, my dad had noticeably changed; he started being more prone to mood swings and lashing out, and my parents were fighting almost every day, with things being slammed or thrown a lot. I remember locking myself in my room, turning on the TV loud, and just crying.

By late November, my mom was telling me that my dad was doing drugs, and 9-year-old me was trying to just think of some way to get him to quit. My mom moved into my grandparents' house right about now, and I was going back and forth between there and our old house, where my dad still lived. The DirecTV got shut off in December because he wasn't paying the bill (probably buying more drugs), and he moved in with my other grandparents in January 2012 (probably wasn't paying his rent). 

He decided to move away to attend rehab in February 2012 and hasn't come back home since (though he plans to come in May for my high school graduation. He didn't let my mom pack up anything when she moved out, and when he left a lot of my old things were either given away or possibly thrown out like stuffed animals, toys, DVDs, and I've even lost some old photos/videos from when I was small. He'll answer me about 2/3 of the time when I call him and he always seems happy to hear from me, but he never calls me himself at all for some reason.

For some reason, whenever I think about my dad now, even if I'm remembering something *awesome* about him. I always end up retrospecting about these events and thinking about him + drugs., even though he is now clean, and hasn't lived like that for a long time.",01Dec2019,1

(Also using a throwaway and I'm on mobile so, sorry if the formatting is off.)

I don't even know where to start or how, but lately I've been finding myself feeling these stronger impulses to set fires, I get all excited and shit when I do set them and when I see the damage it causes, and I will say that I've never actually caused any (serious) property damage and have technically never committed any arson related crimes, but I'm more afraid that I will go that step too far, and find myself in hot water. 
I've always had a fascination with fire, ever since I was a kid, always dreaming of it and I loved to watch it. Yes, I did indulge in with setting small fires when I was younger (think small campfire size), I always came to my senses before they grew too big and extinguished them, but I don't know anymore, I just feel the need to set bigger more destructive fires. 

I guess to some extent I'm afraid of the conesquences if I were to be caught but at the same time I'm not even sure if I really do care about them. I'm so torn about what I feel or at least what I should feel.

And I don't feel comfortable telling any family/friends about this and I can't see myself bringing this up to my therapist because I'm afraid that it will jeopardise my career, I am (somewhat ironcally) a firefighter, and one that loves setting fires isn't really a great thing lol, but as I've implied, I've always found myself drawn to fires so is it really that surprising?

426,"I have to walk down the road to my grandma’s house at least once a week. She’s old and it’s too exhausting for her to do any heavy/hard work, so go I rake her leaves, feed the dog, and help her carry heavy stuff whenever she needs it.

My next-door-neighbor has big dogs in her front yard, pit bulls I think. A lot of times as I’ve walked by her house, the dogs see me and run out to the road barking loud. I freeze for a second, then start walking away slowly, and sometimes they follow me, at which point I start calling for the owners and running fast. Once I’m about 20 ft. away from her property, they go back inside.

I am afraid that I am going to get my nutsack bitten off one of these days. I told her son who’s a year younger than me to tell his mom about this, and he said he did. I walked by about 2 times, and the dogs weren’t in the front yard, so I thought I was safe. Then I walk by again and the same shit almost happens again (I started sprinting as soon as I heard barking).

I told my grandma I wanted to roll up and shoot those dogs, but she said the humane society would come after me any way they could. My brother also said to shoot the dogs, but after hearing that, he told me to call the police and tell them I HAVE to walk that way, and it’s a real dangerous hazard.

———————————————-
I have just finished the last course of my master, it was really hard, and I ran into all kinds of problems plus my mental health issue. I got a 47%, witch means I am eligible for a special assessment, allowing me to get a 50% and graduate. I consider this an easy way out since special assessments are usually relatively easy. However, I had applied for a special consideration since I knew I was not going to pass, I was offered a chance to redo the course semester 2 next year, nulling this result. The professor even offered me a job in his lab over the first semester next year. The catch is, I need to get at least 75% to meet the requirement of the PhD degree.

I consider myself really bad at writing, and do not enjoy group work. I like experiments and calculations. This course is all about assumption and write ups, and it even involves a lot of group works. I have always have a bit of mental issue, I am sophisticated and often thinks too much and too negatively for my own good. I often have breakdown here and there, usually it resolves with time but I am getting worse over the my master degree. In my down time I just want to lay in bed and do nothing, but usually I can still operate just fine. I have went to GP a few times but never seen a psychologist. My last assessment is a detailed report on equipment of a process our group had designed. Our group only got passing grade for our earlier works, and there is almost no way I can get 75% for the course. I was feeling sick, and only did about half of the final assessment, but I just want to escape the course ASAP and rest.
The concerns I have for special assessment rout is that I still might fail it, and even if I passed, I am not sure what to do next if not phd, and I am really afraid I can’t motivate myself to find a job.
The concern I have for redoing the course is that I don’t know if I can actually get a good mark, if I don’t it would all be a big waste of time and I will have to go through the course (that I strongly disliked) again.

Tl;dr
Should I go for passing grade and escape uni, or should I redo the course, risking another mental breakdown to go for good grade and PhD?",01Dec2019,1

437,"So I've had this group of friends for around 8 months now. Even though... I've never felt some sort of 'real' connection to them. For instance, the last time I got together with them I wondered if they were worth the effort of driving there (30min drive). 

The group is formed by me, two guys and two girls. I have no logical reason to, but I've always disliked one of the guys (never showed it, as far as I know). I have a sort of neutral relationship with the other one, we've had a couple chats in person but never texted each other outside of the group chat.

I have a slightly better relationship with the girls, but I still don't really feel anything. I had my first kiss with one of them, but her jealousy towards my best friend (not part of this group) kind of drew me away. Plus, she rejected me the only time I tried to kiss her in front of this group (with probably one more guy who I didn't know). She did kiss me on the same day afterwards but in front of my best friend, probably out of jealousy. And also after I caught her making out with another guy and asked her wtf is going on, why does she make a scene every time I'm with a friend she doesn't know then (but then again she didn't kiss me in ""public"", so I figured she was just playing games with me and never talked to her again. I blatantly ignored her an hour later in person and that was the last time I talked to her or texted her). The other girl is her best friend, talked to her a few times as well, texted her once or twice.

Been thinking about the whole thing and I honestly have no idea why I'm still in a group chat with these people. I mean, they kind of considered me their friend at some point, I guess, but now... I don't know.

One of my best classes was English-1 (I'm in Canada, don't know how it works in other countries but here -1 is the highest level for a class), but the thing is... I'm REALLY bad at essays. My essays have good information in them and flow very well but because I'm very to the point my essays are crazy short, I rarely even meet the minimum word requirement on essays. The only way I got away with this was because I had the same English teacher for 3 years in a row, so she understood my style and marked me accordingly. Of course marks were always taken off for not meeting the minimum length requirement but she was able to see my other strengths and focused most of her marking on that which is why I was still able to have a good grade in the class.

I know stuff like that will NOT cut it in university so if it's possible I'd like to go into courses that either don't have essays or don't entirely rely on essays so if I fail them I can still pass.

445,"Hello, this is a situation which has involved one of my friends and i thought about asking u for advice

So for backstory, my friend (female,30ish) became friends with one of her coworkers (female) and they would often go out with each other. Lets call them A and Y respectively. They are both married and their husbands happened to be coworker (not in the same place as their wives) and friends too. Lets call them B and Z respectively. 

In time these two couples grew closer and would go out together, go to eachother's houses, go on trips together, u know the stuff. They got so comfortable  with eachother that for example A would use phrases like ""i will rip ur butt"" while playing mortal kombat against Z, or would make sexually themed jokes about eachother's cars' plates , etc ( i have to say that sexually suggestive jokes between a married man and a married women are a bit of taboo here) but none of these jokes were made outside the presence of all 4 of them so none of them were suggestive or had any intention behind them.

So a while back, X gets accepted in a course and has to move to a distant city so Z couldn't be with his wife(X) as much as before. Yesterday Z started texting A and directed the subjects of the conversation towards sexual themes. He reminded her about the mortal kombat jokes, the car plate jokes, and other stuff. A tried multiple times to steer the conversation away from these topics as sexually themed jokes between two married ppl are a taboo and inappropriate, but Z would still steer it back into sexual themes, and started using words like 'my dearest' (roughly translated, in our culture a man shouldnt say the original to a married woman unless he is her familly or husband), and in the end he went on to  bring up explicit sexual subjects and even mocked his own wife( for example the size of her breasts!), And request video calls for vague reasons. The conversation ended when A responded with "" i will only video call u with my husband present"".

What would be the best approach to this situation? Should she tell her husband (B) about this? If yes how should she explain it considering that Z is a friend of his husband. Or should she not tell her husband? Or something else? Thanks in advance",01Dec2019,1

He asked me to come over to his place in the evening so that we could have a proper talk and when I went there, my ex stood in the hallway, crying and bawling her eyes out, saying that I had touched her in inappropriate places without her consent. I was shocked. Whatever happened to, ""Please continue, I really like it."" I couldn't say anything though. I felt ashamed. Her family members stood around us, looking at me with disgust.

So many questions made their way in my head.  
""Why now? It's been almost an year...""  
""Is it because I wasn't a good enough partner to you?""  
""Am I truly at fault here?""

How would you expect a 15 year old to react to that? I don't know either, I simply felt empty. Not even anger. Just, nothing. Our fathers sorted things out and we went home. For the next couple of weeks I was cooped up in my house, scared that the word had spread throughout our society and people were talking about how disgusting I am as a person. But time heals, and soon enough, I managed to not feel scared either.

However, I've felt a little disconnected from my emotions since then. Neither too happy when something good happens, nor too sad when something bad happens. I always feel neutral. I don't feel anger. I don't know why. I don't think I was traumatized or anything by what happened, and life was smooth after that so I didn't think much of it either. The few people that I've shared this with almost didn't believe me because of how lightly I was taking things. It seemed at that time that I hadn't let those things affect me in any deep manner.

Since the above mentioned incident, I hadn't gotten involved in any relationships, until recently. I'm 19 now and I've met this amazing girl and she means a lot to me. It's only been a month or so since we started dating and we've been getting comfortable physically. However, when we're close, I will sometimes feel extreme anxiety. I will feel like getting away from her, and avoiding any and all physical contact.

What if I get involved physically and then one day, if things go wrong, she comes and says that I abused her? I always ask for consent, but then again, there are no witnesses other than her and I. They are such irrational thoughts, but they keep nagging me from the back of my head. My parents would be crushed if that happens again. I can't imagine what they must have gone through, but I sure as hell know that I can't afford to put them through that again. I feel idiotic every time these thoughts take over my head. Not everyone is the same. Just because it happened once doesn't mean it will happen every time. I understand that perfectly. But I can't help it. Perhaps, coming from a 19 year old, all this might seem immature and stupid, but it is what it is. Should I perhaps talk to a counsellor?",01Dec2019,1
450,"I've been in a relationship since approximately half a year and we would like to take things a step further but i can't help being afraid of having sex for the first time. I don't even know whay exactly is so scary about it.
Maybe somebody had the same problem and could tell me how they solved it? 
Somebody has an idea what I / my partner and I could do?",01Dec2019,1
451,"I feel like a really boring person. I don't have a lot of hobbies since I almost always put all the time I have into work and if I have some free time, all I want to do is relax while watching Netflix. I don't travel, I don't play instruments I don't do sports, I basically do nothing.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy activities with my friends, are capable of having deep and interesting conversations, but besides that, I feel that there is just not much to my personality.

I was really fine with it and didn't think a lot about myself until recently a girl I was dating just straight quit meeting, since she felt i was just too boring and I came to the realization that my live has literally no content except work, chilling at home and occasional meetups with friends.

453,"My \[20M\] housemates \[19F\] \[20F\] \[20F\] \[23F\] and I live in a decent sized student accommodation, right next to our uni. We all have our own rooms and en-suites so this is just about the shared kitchen. Myself and one of my housemates are very tidy people, immediately washing up after cooking and cleaning the kitchen sides and the tables. My other three housemates like to leave dishes for days piled on the counters and in the sink, basically making it impossible to cook without either doing their dishes for them or seeming petty by leaving them alone. Our house rule of 'do your dishes asap!' stopped after a week. 

The main reason this bothers me is because most of the time theyre using my pots and pans, so when I come to cook I literally can't because I have no cook-ware thats clean, meaning *I have to wash it up*. This doesnt help, obviously, since theyre getting used to just waiting on me or the other clean housemate to do it. 

They also blame eachother for the washing (""its not mine, its XYZ's!"" when its clearly theirs too), and one housemate just lets her boyfriend (who does not live with us) cook and leave his stuff lying around. 

I was fine just complaining to my classmates about it and getting on with my life, but the tipping point which lead me to write this was a party we had Friday. Because our house is bigger than other student housing, and we are literally a 2 min walk from our art studios, all our classmates come to our place to watch movies and have a few drinks.

I got way too drunk and passed out in my room for a good few hours right at the beginning of the party, and when I did feel well enough to venture out of my room, the kitchen was a mess. Pringles crunched into the carpet, empty bottles everywhere, alcohol spilt on the table, somehow a chocolate cake had been bought and eviscerated to the point it was all over the floor. All this happened whilst I was K.O. on my bathroom floor.

Then that morning one of the notoriously messy housemates messaged the house group-chat telling us all to get up and help clean. I helped mop up, even thought none of the mess was my fault.

Im just really frustrated about the fact I have to constantly have to clean messes so our house doesnt become too disgusting to live in, and I need any advice on how to point out to my housemates that they need to clean their own shit in the nicest way possible, since I dont wanna be seen as a dickhead for the rest of this academic year.

454,"Hi guys!

So I recently got a boyfriend and it's been like 3 months and I was wondering is it normal if he wants to spend every day with me? I honestly have nothing against it, and he always asks if it's ok with me but here is the problem I can't really say no, and some of my friends get angry with me because of it. I feel very guilty and scared because I'm almost certain that we are going to get tired of each other eventually. He also always texts me which on some days I find cute and enjoyable but on others, it annoys the hell out of me. This is my first relationship and I'm a bit clueless as to what should be considered a red flag and what is just normal for the beginning of a relationship. I think I'm very insecure and indecisive... If there is someone with more experience than me I'd be happy to know your opinion on what I should do!",01Dec2019,1

461,"Ever since I was a kid I loved two things, physics and coffee. I know weird combination but it works.

(There’s a summary at the very bottom if you don’t want to read all or this) 

My love for coffee came from my grandfather. He was a man of few words i swear he could sit at the table in his wheelchair for hours without saying word  with only a cup of coffee. When I 7 he would wake up at 6 am and starting brewing a fresh pot. he’d give me a cup and just smile sitting with me at the table. Those times seem so short but extremely lovely. Now every time I make coffee I feel nostalgic almost longing for something I can’t quite understand it’s like an enigma to me 

The second part of this Is physics. Like every young kid I always dreamed of going to space. When I was around 7 years old I started to think of all the things that go behind everything in space. How everything worked how we knew what gravity was and the math behind it. Then I started getting into physics. I can’t explain how much I love physics it’s my favorite thing to study about. Fast forward a bit and I started collage when I was 16. I inspired to be a astrophysicist so here I am with a bachelor’s degree on astrophysics at age 18.

For the last ten years I’ve been saving up money for anything I needed in general but one thing came to mind. What if I opened a coffee shop. I would have to let go of my studying for this so I don’t know if I should. But then I think about how I could spread my love for coffee with other. Think about it like you walk into a coffee shop expecting nothing and then theirs a bunch of equations in the walls 

In short I am asking if I should momentarily let go of one of my passions (learning about the cosmos) which cost a lot of money in order to give a shot at one of my dreams (opening a coffee shop) which could potentially crash and burn",01Dec2019,1

Here's the thing.... I think T and one of my friends have been cheating. I'll be sitting off just outta a view of them while they watch breaking bad' together and I swear I hear them like sneaking kisses or something. 
I asked my friend from the relationship and he told me no but I keep freaking the hell out about it. I think I'm paranoid but I kinda wanna set up a camera or something so while they're just sitting there I can either catch them or free my mind from this.

465,"I met a girl a couple months ago and we hit it off. We were originally friends with benefits, but as we got closer it resembled boyfriend girlfriend. She ultimately didn't want that kind of relationship and I was originally very hurt, but okay with that.

We continue as friends with benefits but I felt insecure. I hadn't beforehand but I was going through a stressful part of my life, and someone I cared for dearly not wanting to date me but still being in contact with me made me feel bad. Relying on someone who kinda rejected you for emotional support is rough.

I eventually got over the stress and we continue as friends with benefits. We both start finding other people we like messing around with, but when I spent time with her she slowly stopped wanting to have sex and just be friends who cuddle (her sex life was complicated and messing around with me was too much for her).

I want to spend time with her as a friend, but just cuddling doesn't feel good for me. It's like going from a relationship where I could express myself and be free with this person, to one where there are boundaries. It's not that being friends isn't bad, but the anxiety of not messing around with her just makes the friendship not worth pursuing.

She says, and very fairly that I'm objectifying her and that I'm leaving her because she won't have sex with me. And in a kinda shitty way where I still really love and care for this person, yeah it's true.

She has always encouraged honesty between us, to tell each other everything and be there for each other. To be honest it's probably the first and only time I have ever gotten that close with a friend. 
Ok fast forward to the future, I can count a few times now that I have told her some very sensitive information and she encourages me to tell more mutual friends, as it could potentially deepen our bonds with one another. I understand that and each time I was hesitant, however each time I went through with it because I thought she knew what she was doing I guess? Like what harm could be done? I just needed to get over my own hesitations. I know, cop out on my own feelings, I should've stood up to myself but whatever. Now, again fast forward to the future, I'm starting to hear things about her from other people, things I would've thought she would tell me about. I know she doesn't necessarily have to tell me anything but considering how close we were I just assumed that she would at least mention it? This has been happening a lot recently and I am starting to get resentful? I know it's totally childish to be because it's her choice to tell me but considering the times that she has pushed me to tell really sensitive things to others and then withholding herself, I dunno it just rubs me the wrong way.",01Dec2019,1

But lately ive been realizing more and more that the actual fields of genetic engineering and biotech are just. Vague masses of repetetive work and just sitting behind a screen analyzing data from the experiment 92804838 of the year where we do the same thing on the same leaf from the same tree and just see what happens.

The reason i got into genetics in the first place, as childish as it may be, is animal books and whatnot. I adore the idea of genetically modifying species and cloning and creating new animals. For i dont know how long i have had the wish to make housecats as big as tigers or lions because hey if we have wolf sized dogs why do we max out cats at maine coons? And yes i KNOW how unrealistic it is. I know alright. Noone is gonna let anyone with less than 3 phds and experience that isnt at least twice my age even talk about anything like this but like, i dont mind starting from small things? Its just that all the bio and genetic tech stuff is so centered around just meds and drugs and plants and like yeah theyre important but i really dont care about them the same way i care about animals and species preservation. At this point i feel like all of my extra studies and courses have just gone to waste and i should just switch to programming or IT since im gonna spend most of my gen-tech life behind a screen anyways.

Mostly just oversharing in my private life to total strangers. I've learned to back off and not go so much into my private life with people who don't need to hear it.

That didn't stop these things from getting me in trouble and banned from communities of the stream site Twitch because it made others uncomfortable. 

There was also a rumor going around that I dated someone very underaged but this is not true. The person in question was 18 at the start of our relationship and people assumed they were 13 for some reason and never bothered to ask.

Fast forward to about 10 months later, I have had three people recently burn their bridges with me. I had a friend mediate between me and one of them and they found out that my now ""ex-friend"" had information about me shared with them by someone else. 

So I deduced someone has dirt on me, or rather screenshots of what I've said, and also possibly bringing up the fact that I'm a ""pedophile"" and these people are being misinformed with false facts as well as things that are irrelevant 10 months later. 

I'd like to know if this counts as harassment?

She told me that she knew I could afford it and since I have an above garage apartment that maybe she could move in there.


I gave her a firm but loving “NO”. 

My husband and I are not interested in taking care of a pregnant teen and a newborn. She told me that she will get an abortion. I told her that I fully support that decision.

501,"I also posted this in relationship advice but looking for more opinions.

In January I (F21) will have been with my bf (30)for a year. Back in April I moved into his house because I was spending all my time there, it was free housing, and I was in love and really felt like he was the one. My name is not on any of the bills or anything, I just moved all of my clothes and put all of my furniture from my apartment into my parents basement. Things were going well all summer, but recently I’ve just felt myself distancing from him. I’m set to graduate with my bachelors in a week and start my full time job along with grad school in January. I feel like our age difference has begun to show more and more with what we are wanting to do, I’m looking to travel and explore and enjoy my 20s and he’s ready to settle down and have kids. I’m not blaming him for feeling this way, it’s totally understandable based on his age and what he’s already experienced, I’m just not ready yet and I think it’s caused us to  grow apart and I’m ready to break up with him... I’m just not sure how to do it. 

I’ve found an apartment I can afford and the landlord is being really flexible, told me the deposit I put down can either go towards December rent or January rent, just depends on when I move in so there’s no financial advantage to my timing. 

I’ve spoke with family and friends and they are ready to be supportive and help me move all my furniture from my parents house (approx 30 min away) and my clothing/other belongs whenever I choose.

I’m looking for advice on timing:
I’ve thought about moving all my furniture and less obvious stuff (summer clothes that are storages in my bfs basement, etc) one weekend and then packing up my clothing, breaking up with him, and then walking out the door whenever our conversation is done. 

Some friends have told me to wait for a weekend when he’s gone (frequent with work) and move everything and then come back to have the discussion... and then leave. Or some say to break up, then pack and then leave. 

Im thinking this would be spread out over two weekends. One weekend moving stuff he can’t see/wouldn’t know about and one weekend moving stuff that’s in his house and that he would notice is missing. 

I think this break up will be heartbreaking but mature, I don’t expect us to fight or yell, so I’m not worried about my safety when I go about this, just not sure what order is best??",01Dec2019,1
502,"Hello, I'm a supervisor of approximately 15 employees a day. The job is customer service. Anyway, the issue is that I spend all day every day sitting in an office watching videos. When I first became a supervisor I was VERY proactive and tried to change things. After a couple years of that I have given up. Changing anything around here seems pointless and near impossible. The bureaucracy runs so deep man, horrors hitherto unknown to man lay waiting in mountain of forms and chain emails.

Anyway, now whenever one of my employees tells me there's and issue I pretty much straight up tell them that there is practically zero chance it will be resolved and that they should handle it how they see fit. I back their decisions up through email so there is no way they can get in trouble, it would all come back to me if the higher ups decided to start micro managing. What I'm saying is I bend company policy to get stuff done but not so flagrantly that my job is on the line or my subordinants are at risk which o would never do.

Has anyone else figured out a way of changing basic processes at work or is it just something we have to live with? I have so many ideas for improvement that not only cost nothing but actually save money yet actually accomplishing this takes years of strategizing and organization that I just don't feel like doing. And in the end all my effort can be wasted with a single memo from management undoing any progress we have made.

This is urgent and I’m terrified so I can’t wait 48 hours to post.

The TL;DR is that my Tinder date has stood me up for six weeks, I finally agreed to meet with her in the morning three days ago only for me to give up waiting for her text, do my own thing and get a call to come over at 3PM when I could know longer do so, so I took my family’s advice and went NC because it’s not healthy for me.

I didn’t receive a text from my match until late last night. I tried to be honest with her about how I felt, that I had mixed feelings about her and that I no longer trusted her to come through for me, but that I was willing to give her one final chance to not fuck up. She said I was making her out to be a nasty girl because she was scared of meeting me and I said that wasn’t the case, I just wanted her to be honest with me and trust me.

15 hours go by without a reply. I figure it’s over. At 1PM today I receive a text saying “who has said that I’m a nasty girl?” I’m now being bombarded with texts asking for names of people who’ve given me advice to stay away from her. At this point, I know in my gut that my family and the other sub were right and that I’m dealing with a psycho bitch. I don’t want to rat out my mother and grandmother but I’m scared of getting hurt too if I don’t tell her. She knows where I live and I’m afraid of her coming over while my stepdad is here (I recently overcame a mental breakdown and am living at home until I find work and can afford to rent somewhere) as he is *very* protective of my mother to the point that he’d probably be violent towards a 24 year old woman if he needed to.

507,"Ok I have to ask someone who better than thousands to millions on the Web?
Assuming this is an appropriate place to put this, if not a subreddit suggestion is welcome.

- Ok so recently my soon-to-be ex-wife/mother of my child began talking to another guy, we've had our problems and I was okay with it at first because we plan on divorcing ASAP. But after awhile her sister came about doing her thing with her own set of dude(s) and in the words my wife they both trying ”ho” I guess while I'm trying to focus on me. I was my wife's first and only for the last 5 years and she was the only real relationship I've had. Once again I was cool with it, not really trying to give a fuck cause I'm damn near out the door. I'm pretty nonchalant person when it come to most things.

- But recently I've been overhearing the conversations (not even deliberately listening, they're just loud), not something I actually want to hear; wife basically want to fuck ol’ boy and her sister is encouraging her.
And last night was the night I guess.
They left (circa. 7:30 pm) and I myself not being stupid say have fun (I'm still in the house for time being), to which she just has this excitable expression on her face and that made me feel some type of way (anger maybe?). I put my kid to bed at 8 pm, then cleanwe up, watched TV thinking they'd be back by 1 or 2 am.

- Her sister returns at about 4 am with the only car we got.
Mind you, the house we live in is 35 miles from anywhere and apparently the guy lives 30 miles plus the 35 so a total of about 65 miles away. And her sister left her because she said ”kick rocks”. No ride and alone with a guy she barely knows.
Side note: They both have a history or being __taken advantage__of. 
So I've no clue what to think. As I'm writing this it's 5:30 am. I'm at a loss.
It's not that I want her back, that's BIG negatory. But I honestly don't know what I feel. I'm tempted to drive the hour and change to make sure she's okay. Literally to make sure she's good.
I understand she's an adult. But she is the mother of my child and her sister left her. Alone.
Am I being dramatic, because I've never really felt this way. The worry is nauseating.

- Also does me ”allowing” (for lack of a better term) her to fuck another dude make me a cuck?",01Dec2019,1
508,"I will refer to my sister in law as SIL. She is currently 22y.

I (26m) have dated this girl (26f) for 3 years now, and she is an extreamly kind and good hearted girl. Her family is like a secons home for me, and they have treated me so good since day 1.

After roughly 1 year of dating, i had only heard about my SIL, since she lived abroad. The things i had heard mostly involved how she was bipolar, had uncontrollable tantrums, and was extreamly rude to her parents and her sister (my girlfriend).

When i finally met her, i had told my gf that i would be firm, and also respectful, and expect her to treat me like an adult, and to my surprise she has always respected me, and actually finds me kind and interesting. So thats a good thing i guess.

The problem is, she is making her family and home life unbearable, and constantly yells and her mother for no apparent reason, and she also treats her sister, my gf, like shit. Steals, verbally abuses them all etc.

I have talked to my gf about this, because i notice how it is affecting all of them, and i can almost cut through the tension in their house with a pair of sissors.

Apparently they have tried everything, and my SIL is insisting that she does not need, nor want professional help, and she gets super defensive when being confronted about her issues.

At first, i really didnt want to get involved, but i cant just stand by, as shes ruining my in laws, ans therefor I have asked why they dont give her some kind of ultimatum where if she doesnt get her act together, then she has to get her own place.
The response i got was that she cant live on her own, and her parents dont have the heart to kick her out.

This obviously cant continue, since i have to comfort my gf everytime i see her, because she is so stressed of her home environment.

I want to add, that SIL can be hard working and kind, and actually be really nice, but her mood swings are out of this world.

518,"So this is important for context, we’re firefighters. We work and live together. 

I’ve been a firefighter for 2 years, he’s been one for 2.5 years. We are both rookies and we’re relatively the same age. Recruit school (basic training for FFs) is 6 months long. He graduated right before I started and after that weekend, my class started. 

Everyday we come into work we do two major things. We clean up the station and whoever is driving that day will check off the truck to make sure everything is in working order and any used supplies are replenished. On Sunday’s the truck is checked off in-depth. The cab is lifted and the driver makes sure all the fluids and belts are good, etc. 

Anyhow, typically the captain is in the office doing work in the morning. Driver checks off the truck, other FF is cleaning. He won’t start cleaning until after I’ve checked off the truck. I don’t mind helping him clean, it takes probably 15 minutes, but he would never extend the same favor to me. 

I’ve jokingly commented to him about this and he will with all seriousness tell me I’m the rookie and he’s the senior firefighter. For starters, to be considered “the senior firefighter” you need to have years of experience on someone. The difference in our time in service is absolutely negligible. Anyhow, in the spirit of keeping the peace and showing that I’m a hard worker, I just get the daily duties done so I can do my thing after breakfast. 

He and I have only been working together for a few months and I’ll hopefully be transferring soon (I’ve put in a transfer request and I want to leave for reasons totally unrelated to him). Our territory does not get a lot of fire. 

Anyhow, yesterday we had the big one. He knows what to do in a fire, I know what to do in a fire. This dude is telling me stuff that doesn’t need to be said because it’s common sense. But he’s ordering me, I don’t take orders from him, I take them from the captain. So I start to get annoyed and basically give back to him exactly what he was giving to me so he can see how annoying it is. 

Let me just say, this guy is absolutely worthless on the fireground. He is incapable of moving with a purpose and I worked circles around him. He didn’t do anything of value. When everything was said and done with, one of us was clearly much dirtier than the other. 

Anyhow we get back to the station and we’re fortunate in that we have a gear washer (a big washing machine). So I immediately transfer all the stuff in my main set of turnout gear to my spare set and put my dirty set in the wash. He then asked me why I didn’t wash his. I just shook my head and walked away and continued decontaminating my gear, cleaning up the truck, and then taking a shower. This dude went straight from the truck to the shower and as of this morning, never washed his gear. 

Last night, while I was cooking dinner (not because I was told to, I just wanted to) this dude comes into the living room and changes the channel on the tv. I feel like common courtesy dictates I can watch whatever I want while I cook dinner for the crew. This dude comes in with headphones in, a tablet, and a laptop, and decides to take control of the tv. I said something, I was polite, and he changed the channel back to what I was watching. But he attempted this 3 other times that evening! Then to top it off, he never helped clean up. 

I also go to bed early, like 8:30 I go lay down and surf reddit, by 9 I hope to be asleep. He comes in the bedroom and starts talking on the phone, so I give a pretty loud “fuck off” cough and he says, “oh you trying to sleep”. I say yeah and he leaves. Then this morning he didn’t even help me unload the dishwasher. 

I’m at my wit’s end here. This guy and I are about to have it out, but I’ve already gotten a stern talking to about “losing my temper” (another story for another day, but the short version of that is my words were misconstrued and I never meant anything by it). My captain is afraid of me, he thinks I have PTSD because I screamed in my sleep a few times, I’m an OIF and OEF veteran, and something about my posture is “aggressive”. 

I just don’t know what to do. At a normal fire station, the captain would let us have it out as long as we never came to blows. But I’m on thin ice because of my posture. This transfer can’t come soon enough, but until then I need to not let this guy walk all over me without losing my temper. 

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",01Dec2019,1

521,"So basically I am a girl, and I am a Tom boy so my friends are boys and girls a lot of them being boys. I met this dude at the beginning of the year, let’s call him Nick. He is tall blond and smart. I started out liking him desperate to get every possible chance to be around him to strike up a conversation. In science I would talk to him make jokes casually just say “Ugh this class is so boring.” And we had band together as an elective for a semester. So we became friends. Around early-mid October is when I’m like oh shit I don’t like him, but he probably thinks I do but whatever I don’t care. So fast forward a week there is a girl I will call her Heather.  Heather is friends with my bestie so when I hangout with her friend group at lunch instead of my own, I am automatically with heather. Here is the thing, Heather is nice. She doesn’t try to be annoying or rude she just sometime does these things that are like “wtf bro why would you do that?”  Anyway one day nick and heather were gossiping somewhere and I walk up to them and say “what is up my dudes?” And she says “none of your business now go away.” So I say “woah I feel the love and the amazing vibes” They laugh and it breaks the tension and at this point nick has a girlfriend. He told me when he got one. Heather says “ You know he has a girlfriend right?” And I say “Uh yes he kind of told me cause we are friends.”  (Here is what really pissed me off) “Oh. But you like him don’t you?” While Nick is still there in the conversation standing there with a blank stare not knowing what to do. I say “past tense LIKED him. We are just friends” one day she also told me “nick thinks you like him” so I go up to nick at lunch and was like “ you know I don’t like you right?heather said you said I liked you.” And he was like “yeah  and I never said that”. Fast forward to November where he dated my “friend” We’ll say Nevaeh is her name. She is so fake I hate her but internally.  They dated for two days and nick broke up with his old girlfriend to date Nevaeh.  So their was a huge fuss about all the attention blah blah so they broke up yet act like they date. She wore his hoodie ALL day and she dared herself to hug him every day and she wrote him a note says “will you hold my hand?” And it is just like YOU’RE NOT DATING!! LIKE WTF?! And I brought it up when I went to sit with my friends in that group when nick sat at our table one day. They literally shrugged and didn’t discuss it any further. So fast forward to now hen we are at a reward thing the day before thanksgiving break.So we are allowed to use computers and chit chat all period and me and Nick are casually doing stuff sharing music tastes and playing games on the computers when go a foot away to talk to my friend mentioned before, I over hear a little bitch who earlier in the year pushed me repeatedly into a desk and threatened  me with his sister who had a broken arm. He says “ you know she likes you right” 
Nick :“yeah” 
Bitch : “ you should go out with her!” 
Nick :” ew no” 
I don’t wanna sound weird but even though I don’t like him that hurt my feelings like he could’ve sugar coated it a little. And now he thinks I like him. I told my mom who is amazing and she said that I should tell people who are annoying about it that my friend who looks my age but isn’t he is three years older, is my boyfriend and he lives in nyc and my family goes there a lot so I could say I visit him.

529,"So I recently had an interview for a PhD position in an area I find very exciting, and if it was located in a more urban location, I'd take it without a second thought. However, it's a very specialized facility, and for various reasons related to the research that is done there, it is located 150 miles away from my home (which is also the nearest city). The local community is very small, and chances are the only people I'd really come into contact with day to day are colleagues.

My dilemma is: is this a good idea at a young age? It's exactly the kind of place I'd like to live in 5-10 years time, but to take on this position today would basically be ending my current social life, and moving at least a 2 hour drive away from all my friends. (Not to mention my prospects of finding a relationship would be severely reduced!)

Of course there are some good aspects:

* As I already mentioned, the area of research is fascinating. It's a unique opportunity I won't get anywhere else.
* It's very close to one of the most beautiful locations in the country. I love hiking and it'd be great to live there for that reason
* It's cheap. I could very realistically get a mortgage and buy a house with my current savings and the salary they're offering. This would be impossible for me at any major city and I'd have to continue to rent.
* While it's a relatively small institute, a large proportion are fellow postgrads and postdocs of a similar age to myself.

So that's it. Do I take it and ignore all the downsides? Do I turn it down and look for something that will allow me to continue my current lifestyle? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm really at a loss and the only advice I've received from friends and family boil down to ""do what makes you happiest"", and I'm really not sure what that is.",01Dec2019,1

542," I  have some real trust issues. I end up thinking that people will end up  betraying me and that I’ll have no one. I believe I think this way  because of my previous relationships. I’ve had a few people who I have  called my best friend over the years, and those relationships have  disappeared from my life. I used to talk to someone for like 9 hours  everyday until they suddenly left my life, that was a relationship that  lasted for 4 years. No one could fill in the shoes like that, that’s a  ridiculous amount of time to spend with someone every single day. I have  made new and better friends since but underneath I still have so much  distrust inside of me. I am skeptical of what they tell me and their  motivations. A lot of it is negative thinking. I believe I do the right  things I am open to how I feel, I tell people how much I care about them  (though not too much of course because then it doesn’t sound genuine  and becomes annoying). When I think I’m going crazy and that I shouldn’t  feel the way that I feel, I tell several people how I am feeling and  get input from multiple sources. I am always reassured that my feelings  are genuine and that I should not feel crazy. I believe this is the  right path and that I’m doing the right thing for myself but yet I still  cannot truly trust the ones closest to me. I am open to change and I  know that I need change, I do not believe I am a very defensive person  and I do not usually take things as insults or slights. I believe that I  am patient but I guess not patient enough. It does not take a few days  or even a few weeks for this to truly heal. I do not believe that a lot  of people are manipulative or deceptive, I do trust the people in my  life but at the same time I guess I really don't.

I don’t know if anyone will care but I think way things turned out in my situation is important. 

Tl:Dr E was in a mental health crisis. He didn’t need to be dropped, he was desperately clinging to his support system. 



When I made my initial post almost everyone said to drop E and run away from the whole situation. That felt wrong to me. Instead I got the people that he loves the most together to talk about his behavior. I didn’t think that someone who was reacting to things the way that he was could possibly be in a good mental state, and I was afraid for my friend. 

First, I contacted R and and him if he was actually interested in being romantically involved with me. He was. So we set up a time for the two of us, to sit down with E and his girlfriend to talk about why he got so angry seeing R and I together. 

It was a long conversation with lots of question dodging and tears, but in the end we started to unravel things a little bit. Here’s the basic summary:

E and R’s dad left their mom when they were both very young. He stayed in contact with them until he got married. E was 13 and hasn’t spoken to his father since then. E never received more than a few days of therapy for this. (And this is when he started having outbursts of anger).  They have another brother, L, who is a few years older than R. (Never mentioned him before because that original post was long enough and he was irrelevant). L became like a father figure to R and E after their actual dad cut contact. Then L got married about a year ago, and moved out off the house they lived in together, and became much more distant. Making E and R even closer. 

L didn’t leave entirely but E still felt like he lost a branch of his support system. Since L got married E’s mental health has been steadily getting worse. He was always prone to both anxiety attacks and depressive episodes in the past. Never diagnosed with anything officially because he wouldn’t go to a doctor, but when L became distant those things started getting much worse. E tried to keep it from everyone because he didn’t want anyone to worry. His girlfriend noticed a change, but E insisted to her that he was fine. 

You’re probably sensing a pattern in E’s life. Someone he cares about gets married, and stops being in contact with him. After some talking we found out that lots of E’s panic attacks are triggered by a fear (no matter how illogical) of losing people. 

After a long time insisting that we still loved him and we were there because we loved him, E finally told us why he freaked out at Friendsgiving.  When he saw R and I kiss he suddenly panicked, thinking that he was about to lose both his best friend and his brother to a relationship. In his mind the only way to keep us around was to make sure we didn’t date, and his reaction was the incident you read in the original post. 

E acknowledges that the way he acted was toxic, abusive,  and a bad way to handle the situation. He also said that he doesn’t mind if R and I date, and he doesn’t have romantic feelings for me. After much debate we finally convinced him to get a therapist and to stop drug use. To try it for at least for six months. He seems like he’s ready to get better. 

Overall I’m saying that while there is no hope in some situations you should still try to talk to people who are behaving erratically. There’s probably a reason they’re doing it. They may even know what the reason is. A cry for help doesn’t always sound like one. If your friends act in a way that is abnormal and negative, don’t immediately run away, try to help. If I had run away my best friend, who was already spiraling, would have been in a position that was so much worse.",01Dec2019,1

Also this took me by surprise cuz 2 weeks is very little. Now I have this fear that people will think of me as lazy if I don't go but she goes, and since I would always say to the folk there that I would come back, the fear grows.
I texted her about this because we have this bond with her (at least I thought), but when I told her this she started saying that I have this motto which is I don't care what people think of me, which is not true and I think it's very clear that I do with the things I would say to her and  sometimes I would just say it so she wouldn't start overthinking about something.

563,"Hi Reddit

My roommate has recently been talking about me to other people, including close friends of mine, acquaintances, etc.

This includes:
-telling people I'm stupider than I seem
-talking shit about my gf and my relationship
-revealing my PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS to other people that he overhears when I'm the phone 
-flat out lying about me

In general, he's been saying he's tired of me and that I have no friends and that's why I'm always trying to get myself invited in everything even though noone wants me there.

This is all false. I know everyone talks shit behind people's back but I won't allow my personal conversations with my gf to be shared and joked about, and I I'm not going to let him put my friends against me

The thing is, I know it because of some people that saw his conversations with that people and my own investigation once I started hearing rumors about me and my girlfriend accusing me of being controlling and abusive (yeah, it got to that point). Thus, I can't really stand up to him and tell him to stop because technically I can't know anything about this.

565,"After my old, old cat past away at 21 I adopted 2 kittens. They're 6 months now and I'm still amazed at how much they like to play with allll the toys (and pretty much everything else that isn't nailed down). 

So each night I try to do the whole hunt, eat, sleep, routine with them (play with them, let them catch the toy, give them some food and then cherish the calm, just like mr. Galaxy said). 

It's just, although they're the exact same size, one of the cats is faster, more determined, more likely to jump up high to catch the toy etc.

Even when I pretty much shove the toy towards the less agile cat, her sister just jumps on top of her to get to the toy.

Timid cat does stand up for herself, like if she's holding a mouse she really likes she'll growl to get her sis to go away, so it's not like she's wasting away completely. 

But right now playtime is more one cat playing and one cat watching. Reddit I want this to change! My home is pretty open planned, so putting one cat in a different room doesn't really work (would mean one of the cats losing access to the litter tray). 

So please people with pets with different levels of feisty-ness tell me what you do!",01Dec2019,1

I was like... really ? Do you think I won the lottery ? Or my and hers relationship happened just by some fucking luck ?..

I was triggered right away, I knew they probably didn't mean to offend me in any way and was just complimenting me for having such a beautiful girl by my side.. But I got so angry, irritated, insecure and under valued as a person compared to her.

Don't get me wrong I don't look like a monster, I kind of like how I look when we take selfies with my gf, I also train sports most of my life and staying in the athletic shape most of the time.

About a year ago I asked my brother to take a picture of my form just to record my progression in the gym and as soon as I seen it I felt disgusted, by my assimetrical lips, smile shape of my face.. I just couldn't recognise myself like wtf.. really ?

Time went by and I forgot about it I rarely ask someone to take pictures of me since we take selfies and I feel quite happy with the way I look.

But today we had a coffee in town and I felt amazing, I felt so inspired and grateful and asked my gf to take a picture of me and as soon as I seen it my ""bubble of happiness"" blew like nothing, I felt so disgusted and upset I almost puked looking at that smile and shape of face.. suddenly it reminded of what my colleagues told me and I realised that how such a freak like me could be worth it such a beautiful lady..

Is this some type of body dysmorphia ? I kind of accepted the fact that I am not the most beautiful person, but it's hard to accept that my self imagine is so different from what I see in pictures from the rear lense.

How do I deal with this ? Just accept it ? Or fight it and try to love myself as I am ?

573,"  **TL;DR** I am unsure if I should stay out on my own on the East Coast or move back to the Midwest to save money and be closer to friends.

Sorry if this is long and rambling, but I could definitely use some advice about how to go forward with the next steps in life.

**(Background)**

I graduated from college 18 months ago and moved from the Midwest to the East Coast. I had lived in the Midwest all of my life and had a lot of good friends and a healthy family life, but I was definitely looking for a change of scenery. When I got an offer from a good company out on the East Coast I accepted it right away and moved out. I made some good friends through my new job and was pretty social and everything was going well.

**(Current Day)**

All of the new friends that I made out on the East Coast have all gotten really busy with work or have moved out for their own adventures and I almost never get to see them anymore. The only people I see outside of work most weeks are now my two random roommates and we communicate almost none. I've found myself playing video games with my friends back in the Midwest almost every night just to have some non-work conversations. It's really making me miss the Midwest and I am really considering moving back once my lease is up. However, I'm also thinking that ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" and if I moved back to my home state I would feel like some kind of failure for not being able to cut it out on my own.

**(Options I'm Considering)**

*Staying with my current job*

· Explained above, nothing would really change from the current situation.

*Moving back to home state*

· All of my friends back in the Midwest keep encouraging me to move back because they want to spend time with me. Also, my sister said that she would like it so that she could move closer to her boyfriend and still have someone closer to our parents. I would be able to save a lot more money and pay off my student loans/invest.

*Looking for a new job in current city*

· I'm currently working 10+ hour days with at least an hour commute each way so I really have no time to go out and meet new people in the city. On the weekends I'm a sloth and like to catch up on sleep from the week. If I found a new job in the city I would vastly cut down my commute time and also be able to get a pay raise which would help with saving money.

*Moving to new location with current company*

· The company I'm with is always offering positions in other locations that seems appealing to the adventurer in me. I love the American southwest and have definitely considered positions out there. The main problem with this option is that I would be even further away from my Midwestern friends and the current situation could happen all over again.

*Grad school*

· I am planning on applying for grad school next fall. The nice bonus of this option is that I could look for programs anywhere that I would like to end up.

574,"hey, I don't know if this is the right place to put this and sorry for typos there are like 6 keys on my keyboard including shift that work only half the time. I'll start this off with some basic info for exposition. I'm a sophomore in a choice high school that focuses on more rigorous courses many of which are just free college courses provided by the local college. I work as a cashier at a restaurant known for having the meats. I have many extracurriculars including the student leadership team which is basically just the staff telling us to tell interested students good things about or school on our own time. I play games in my free time because I need an escape and its the only past time that I don't have to ask for help to do in some way. With all of that out of the way, I'm done with a lot of things. I'm not suicidal don't worry but I'm ready to stop appeasing everyone just to get yelled at. My grades have slipped since middle school, I went from mostly B's some A's to Mostly C's some B's and one D because I genuinely don't understand geometry. Because of this, I get yelled at by my father telling me how lazy I am and how I'll never be able to succeed because all I do is play games. I get so frustrated I just spurt off the same idea every time ""I have a job, 7 extracurriculars, 7 classes 2 of which are college classes, my break was working 6 days a week near full time, my break was watching as my dog died and I couldn't help because my mom refused to take her to a vet, I've had 4 years of perfect attendance. I'm lazy because I play games for a few hours a week?"" Which usually solicits lines similar to ""bullshit"" ""you're lying"". This happens every grading period and I had a solution. I'll quit my job until the summer break because I'm not making much through the school year and it doesn't warrant what is happening to me. Once I posted this to my mom I get told I have a horrible work ethic as I'm working near the same hours as her plus writing a book a few hours every week. I give up on that and change it to getting rid of a few extracurriculars. Bad move. I get told that I'm making the worst choice if I want to go to college I'm sure you get the speel by now. I always get told to stop playing games. I refuse to, not because I'm addicted but because 5 hours a week to myself is the only thing keeping me relatively happy. otherwise, I have stress nightmares, I can't sleep, I can't focus, I can't perform. The few hours that I get to be my nba superstar and make everyone happy in this digital world lets me live out a fantasy that keeps me going. I was heading into work today and I didn't want to do something small because I already had and I'm extremely sore from a 3-hour basketball break on my school break. My mom slams my door and starts talking about how terrible I am, etc, etc, but this brings back a few memories from when I was younger where she did the same thing but would talk about how she wished she could just jump in front of a car or walk away and leave me alone unable to fend myself. I don't know what I'm hoping for but I do know that I away from the toxicity and I guess I just need something or someone to tell me that I'm not going crazy, that I'm not the piece of shit that I keep getting told I am. If I am I'm genuinely sorry for wasting y'all's time and have a great day/afternoon/night",01Dec2019,1
575,"Okay, this is quite a long and intricate story. I’ll try to be as vague as possible and not provide too many personal details just in case.

My best friend and I were out last night with our school group at a party. She has liked Boy for about 2 ish years, and they’ve finally got a little thing going on. Before they started their thing, Boy and I got together once or twice, nothing exclusive or any feelings attached to it. 

Boy and her are together all night until she goes home. Boy, in a group of people, grabs my ass and asks me to go outside with him. I say no, he’s with my best friend now. He asks again, I decline again and he walks away. I don’t know if anyone in the group of people seen or heard him doing this, but it happened.

On his way home, Boy tried to kiss a girl in the car. She said no, because she has a thing with another guy. Boy said that guy is texting other girls anyways (trying to make her jealous, so that she’d make out with him).

Now. What tf do I do? I want to tell her, I do. But I have no way to get to her in person so it would have to be facetime. Do I tell Boy to tell her? Do I not do anything and let her find out when everyone is gossiping about it? I’m really stuck.

When he got fired he was just sitting home gaining weight and sad all the time, then i came home from school he had his gun in hand and he told me that he wants to kill himself, I hugged him and then i took it away from him. Second time i was in the car with him and he started driving in the opossite side of the road and he told me things like he doesn't care about his life anymore and that he wants to end all of this, then he stopped by the road and cried next to me. (When i was little i didn't have a good relationship with him, he used to beat my mother and sister, but he changed. I was always scared of him but when i saw he changed I was not scared of him anymore, i just didn't like him. He was never there for me, it was just him and his job.) I asked him to go home with me, I made him chestnuts because he really likes them and tried talking to him, I said to him that he can go to the gym with me( he used to go to the gym and he was a cyclist before i was born, but he had a knee injury so he stopped). Other day i was in the gym with him and after gym I made us some healthy food and asked him if he wants to watch a movie, i picked a comedy so i was happy after i saw him smiling. At the time i was boxing aside from going to the gym so i tried to be with him for the rest of the time. Every time after School I tried to talk to him, he was often sad but i was able to see it was getting better, I mean at least he was smiling sometimes. He started to exercise and eat healthy and lost about 20 kilograms. He also started going to the psychiatrist and I really thought that his problems will be over. it's 11 months since this and i don't know if he made little steps or how are things going, he is still having active lifestyle, but my mother is always yelling at him and making things worse and i don't know ho to explain to her that she is making this just worse, he now has 1 friend and he goes to the gym with him, sometimes they go on coffee and at the summer they were grilling together so i feel great about him. But except for this gym  he has nothing to do and i don't know how to help him to find any hobby, i tried to give him some books but he is not really into reading. I dunno what to do now, i feel sad when i think about this and i just needed to get this of my chest and get some advice, sorry for my english btw. I also feel sad because my sister is always just using him for money and he always sees her as his favourite but i feel sad because he never said something like thank you to me.

I pretty much sprinted out, only halfway done. Had to clean myself with kitchen roll. But I know I can't just surrender my bathroom to the wasp forever, and I still need the loo.

The window is shut at the moment - think it must've been blown shut by the wind after the wasp got in. Also, the windows in my flat have an annoying safety latch thing. It's possible to open the latch, but it's designed to be fiddly because the windows are not meant to be opened more than a crack. Even in a calm state of mind, it takes me 20 seconds and a few tries to open the latch.

582,"Our friend group consists of all guys aged 18-19. Related to the story are G, S, N and B. To get some context, G and S are both gay while N is bi. Also, N gets alot of shit in the group, especially from G, something that me and B usually try to lessen. Despite this, G and N are quite good friends, at least until recently. 
S was planning a get together recently and invited everyone but N. When me and B asked why, G messaged us both telling us how N sexually assaulted him about two months ago and being around him makes him uncomfortable. He said that N had tried to make him do something and, although he said no, N had done it anyway. S then messaged me to tell me pretty much the same thing. So I told S I would message N asking what happened to get both sides of the story. S told me that N is manipulative and a liar and I ""have to believe the victim with these things."" I said I would keep that in mind.
So I talk to N, he tells me that him and G had done something they had previously done before, but this time G regretted it two months later and stopped talking to him and invited him to things. N also said G had done some pretty fucked up things aswell.
Also, everyone else in the group had known about this before me and B, though I was the only person who had messaged N about his side of the story and he had no idea that G had told anyone else.

I don't really know who to believe. Though I feel like people in the group are using it as an excuse to make jokes at N's expense without consequence. Do I involve myself more by prying for details so I can take one side? Or do I stay out of it and let the group agree with G even if it may not be the whole truth. In my opinion, G and S like drama and attention a little too much. But I don't want to hurt G by not believing him if he's telling the truth. Sorry if this was too convoluted. Thanks.",01Dec2019,1

My girlfriend suffers from almost nightly nightmares and it's really impacting her life ans sleep schedule. She doesn't want to try meds (long story), so we are trying to come up with ways to settle her down after she wakes up crying. One of her problems is that she often doesn't know where she is when she wakes up, and she doesn't immediately know that she's not still dreaming. 
So I came up with the idea for an Inception type totem device, something that could be used to let her know for sure she was in the real world and safe. It needs to be small so she can keep it under her pillow, or with a stuffy. I've heard that in dreams you can't read clocks properly, either the time changes every time you look or the hands spin. So I thought maybe getting her a pocket watch would be a good idea, so she can watch it and count to 60. If anyone else has any ideas for a totem, or just ideas to help with this issue in general, it would be greatly appreciated.",01Dec2019,1

Most of our fight where around this girl that I don’t really like, I catch her texting her all the time (when we where on dates) this girl asked my girlfriend to go to prom with her as a friend and would occasionally just come say hello to her, it started to get frustrating because it felt like my girlfriend didn’t love me anymore and was putting all of her attention to her and not me, she never texted me telling me she loved me, she never complemented me. We broke up, one of the hardest things I have experienced, time went by and we started talking about possibly getting back together and it was a grey area but I had hope, she comes over last night extremely high and we start playing video games and I started asking her questions like “do you have feelings for this girl” and she’s saying no and stuff, we go to bed and I started thinking to my self that I should see what’s really going on, because it felt like she wasn’t being honest with me, I then see messages with this girl like “I miss those lips” “I want to impress this hot hockey player” and this girl is also texting her saying “I wanna see this cutie” and my ex sending her pictures of just her face, yes we broke up but we where always saying we where gonna try to figure our selfs out and get back together when we feel like it’s right.

Going to back track to the first day she came over after we broke up, I was extremely high and she had asked to come over, I said yes and she came, I had told her I was on tinder and she should look at my messages because of how bad I was at texting girls, she then goes through my phone and goes into texts with a girl she didn’t like to see if I was trying to get with her( I wasn’t)

So back to today, I get up crying, I’m having a panic attack and I start waking her up asking what was this and she starts freaking out at me saying I shouldn’t be going though her phone and how I used her, we get into a huge fight and she’s calling me abusive for saying “if you want this relationship to work there can be no her” and she’s saying I’m.

She then gets up and I order her an Uber, she’s waiting out side for it, I grabbed my bottle of antidepressants and I put the bottle in my mouth to try to attempt to kill my self, I take the bottle of water and I try deploring the pills, she ran in grabbing my face to spit them out and I did, I always though of killing my self but this was the first time putting the pills in my mouth.

I feel so unloved and so lonely and I feel as if I have fucked up my life. Do you think I should put my self in a mental hospital? I don’t want to fuck up my chances at a career so I don’t know.",01Dec2019,1
595,"I bought my house two and half years ago with the idea of living here for at least 5 years then maybe sell it.   The house needed some fixing up so I was able to come in low with a cash offer that was accepted.  I have put about 25k in it total to get it to where it is at today.  I recently put it on the market and after two months and one price reduction I got an offer.  We negotiated slightly under my asking price but everything has been signed and agreed upon and I will be walking away with about 30k.  So,  my plan was to roll it into another house but I am starting to wonder what all of my options are.  If I roll it into another mortgage do I have to pay the gains tax?  Is it possible to leave it in an escrow account if I don't want to buy something right away?  This is what I would like to do but I don't know what kind of taxes I would have to pay if any.    Also,  is it stupid and irresponsible to spend a little bit of it on maybe a vacation or pay off some other debts?

596,"WORK - I work in sales as an account manager at a big company. I manage the relationship between the company and a financial network, roughly 300 financial advisers fall under this network. This is a fast paced job with competitive sales targets. 

Since January there have been major issues with the network holding adviser's commission in a suspense account, as they can't identify what money belongs to each adviser due to the lack of information on the statements our company provides. This is 100s of thousands of pounds just sat there.

My company have pushed back and said the fault lies with the network. The network have pushed back and said the fault lies with us. As a result it's been a stale mate since January, and I have to manage the repercussion. My manager is unable to help as it's on a network level.

This has resulted in very stressful conversations with the advisers I manage. I receive very angry phone calls daily as the advisers aren't getting their money and there is nothing I can do. I also receive very emotional calls where advisers have broken down over the phone and sobbed due to the impact on their livelihood. These are very upsetting calls to get and this has been ongoing all year - I feel like I can't handle it anymore.

FINANCES - I am no longer receiving bonus pay as I am not hitting my sales target due to my advisers no longer wanting to place business with my company - understandably.

This has reduced my wages by half as I am only recieveing my basic pay.

We bought a house in May this year, and the financial pressure due to my drop in earnings is causing a lot of stress for me and my partner

EXAMS - I am also studying for my financial exams which I will be taking at the end of 2020, which are funded by the company, so I feel very trapped by this because I can't quit my job and lose this. My evenings are spent studying which adds pressure at home

Effects:

Finding it hard to keep up appearances at work when experiencing sickness and blurry vision after tense phone calls and having to excuse myself to go to the toilet. This has started to happen in the last couple of months.

Experiencing waking up with a tight chest and difficulty taking a full breath during the night, which has been making sleeping difficult. It lasts around 20 minutes each time. This has been happening since January.

Low mood and despair in bouts daily, sometimes feeling unpredictable which I'm scared will compromise my job - I've written and almost handed in my notice a few times spontaneously whilst at work

I feel a complete lack of control and isolation, my employer won't help me and my partner is at a loss. I feel anxious and have feelings of dread all of the time, I feel like nobody will help me.

Things I've tried:

Contacting our employee assistance programme and spoke to a counsellor who  provided advice on financial budgeting after my wage drop and advised meditating to manage stress.

Trying meditation and yoga, following classes online. I also use the headspace app on my tablet.

Cut out caffeine completely and only have alcohol on special occasions

We have a dog, which helps with regular exercise

However things have become steadily worse over the year with frequency and intensity of symptoms, and the above is no longer helping.

Do you think if I speak to a doctor and relay the above they will sign me off for stress?

597,"I've never posted here before so im sorry this is long and incoherent i'm just really messed up

I'm a 17 year old girl and this all happened march-july of this year when I was 16 and he was 19. I had just gotten out of a long abusive relationship with an adult and I guess was looking for the worst possible person to involve myself with. We met online, he was a literal neo nazi who immediately started to verbally degrade and abuse me, but i just let it happen. I became obsessed with him, I did whatever he said, but I knew how unhealthy it was. I just felt i deserved it. After a while, I tried to leave him over and over, tried to find relationships in real life, which ended badly. I even got raped, which he mocked and blamed me for. But I always went back to him. He told me many times he wanted me to be psychologically broken and he loved that i was severely mentally ill because it made me easy to manipulate and abuse. In may, he forced me to carve his name into my thighs to take me back after a fight. He then made me block all my friends and delete my social media so i would be isolated from everyone but him. This caused me to lose many relationships i had with my friends, which i never got back. This was all some sort of fetish to him, controlling every aspect of my life, masturbating to my cuts and bruises and making me cry multiple times a day so he could get off. 

The worst part (besides the permanent scars of his name) is that he also coerced me into sending him all the money i had to him to ""keep safe"" for me because he said i was too stupid to handle my own money. He promised it was mine and he would give it to me when i needed to buy something, and obviously i fell for it because i was dumb. Of course when he got bored and left me in July he took $1500 with him which was all I had. After he left there was a police investigation because at one point he threatened to blackmail me with my nudes, but the police said they didn't find enough evidence. I'm sure he has the pictures of me, and i'm sure he has the pictures of my cuts, which makes me sick to my stomach. I ended up getting put on leave from my job because the trauma and anxiety made me unable to work, so my life is really out of control right now. I'm not sure if there is any possible way of getting my money back, i mean he did say in writing that it was mine but i don't know if that means anything. 

I've been hospitalized multiple times since we broke up and i don't know what to do anymore. I'm not suicidal, I just feel so lost and hopeless. I can't wear shorts in public because I have a nazi's name etched into my body and probably will for the rest of my life. He has all my money and most likely spent it on guns (which terrifies me to my core because he idolizes mass shooters) I don't go back to work until march, i don't have many friends, my mental health is declining and i seem to be getting more traumatized as time goes on. I can't look in the mirror anymore and i'm just disgusted with myself. Therapy doesn't seem to be working because all anyone has to say is ""I guess you learned your lesson"" or something like that. 

I really don't know how i can possibly get my life back together, I feel so stupid and and gullible. Sorry for the rant/vent I just feel so lost",01Dec2019,1
598,"Hi, hope y'all are having a good weekend. 

I wanted to post to ask when it's okay to cut off a parent. 

I'm in my 20s and live with my mom. Sometimes she is very rude and has anger issues. 

As a child I was abused mentally, physically and tortured in ways. 

I was asking my mom if she wanted anything from Amazon as I found a hat knowing she wanted something nice. 

She was saying they have the exact same thing at Dollarama etc or home hardware. I explained the quality is different and I even showed her. She tends to say ""sure"" and be rude. I explained I've been taught to question stuff like that unless I see evidence. I've brought this thing up many times because she tends to make up false claims and give false info about many things and I like to check if it's true. 

I was explaining it may be similar but they don't have that one and the ones online are higher quality. When she's proven wrong she was being rude and said get a job etc. Also made up some b.s. 

I was a part time student and had to leave my job because the hours were getting in the way of classes at Uni. 

I've worked contract jobs etc. 

Since she was being rude I decided the TV I got recently that I let her use in the living room I would take back and put it in my room. I later heard her telling and then she threw my nice belt buckles, few of my clothes and my property and damaged some of my things. 
She can be extremely childish. 

She threatens to break my stuff sometimes and throws or damages my property, yells in the apartment to clearly get attention and I still have nightmares from things that have been done to me as a kid. 

I was wondering when it's okay to cut off family? If I should perhaps sleep outside in the winter. 
If something happens to me my sleeping outside and I pass away I've kind of accepted it. As a kid I used to try to sleep outside in the winter when I ran away, just to be able to get some sleep. 

I'm just wondering if it's okay to speak to her less or if I should just start sleeping outside and find storage  for some of my things etc. 

I've already donated a bunch of clothes and other things last November in case I do move out I less things. 

Any tips on what to do? 
Perhaps I wasn't meant to be born lol.

Have a great weekend ✌️",01Dec2019,1

But I’m talking about my friend (idk if he’s my friend anymore) since it’s a new month this could be our 7th month being friends but idk if I should even count it. We were talking yesterday and I was talking to him about how our friends is like falling apart and we don’t talk anymore or play games together. He said “ik we barely talk anymore, but in reality i dont really talk to anyone that much nowadays. The only ones i really talk to are my family and friends on xbox sometimes. We don't play that much anymore because im running out of xbox live and i cant pay for it again. I have friends that i dont talk to so you arent the only one”

Idk what that means? I mean I said back to him “Oh okay. I hope you get the money, you’ll get through it. Take it easy. See you Monday.”
If I didn’t add that see you Monday it would sound like I’m leaving him. But since I said see him Monday we can still go on. Then thing that I didn’t expect was that he had a whole convo with me.

606,"  We are both 19, I'm a male, and we've been dating for almost 5 months now. We both grew up in a hell-hole of a city that's booming with drugs, murder, and theft. Yesterday we were talking and she mentioned being in a gang year back. At first I thought she was joking, but I learned very quickly this was not the case. 
  She grew up in basically poverty with an abusive father and crazy mother. She grew up around drugs, guns, death, addiction, and things like that. She needed the money and wanted a ""family"". She admits to running drugs and when people didn't pay back, they would ""hurt"" them. She also admitted to be addicted to various drugs, which is hella common here so I wasn't to shocked. (She's been clean for over two years)
  Then there's me, although I lived in the same city, my father owns his own company and I grew up in a ""white rich neighborhood"" where I never had to worry about anything ever. There's never been addiction, I've never lost a family member or a friend, and we've never struggled for money in my life. So obviously we grew up in two totally separate lives. 
  Now here's the rough part, one of the times the people weren't paying back and they shot first. My girlfriend and a couple other members shot back. Shes 100% certain she hit one of them, and she's 100% certain that he died soon thereafter. 
Obviously this came to a shook to me, I just sat there in stunned silence for a couple minutes as she rambled on about that being her past and over three years ago. I couldn't really hear her. I was still trying to process she mightve killed someone.
  The thing is, I know my girlfriend for who she is now. I've spent the last 5 months with her pretty much everyday, growing to love the silly goofball that she really is. I know she loves me and would do anything for me. I truly believe she wouldn't hurt anyone now and that she's completely out of anything gang related. 
  She said that she shouldn't have told me, but that if I wanted to leave she would completely understand and that she would love me no matter the decision I made. That ""I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her and around me she's genuinely a better person."" 
  Honestly this whole situation is a little uncomfortable and scares me a little. I left her house around 2:30 last night after talking for awhile and went home. Now I have to decide what to do. I love her but that's not something that should be taken lightly. Would leaving her for something she did in the past be reasonable? Does this whole situation seem insane and I'm letting me emotions cloud my judgement? General advice? I honestly have no idea, I am completely lost. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend opened up about her trouble past, admitted to being in a gang and killing someone. I need know what I'm going to go, if I should breakup with her and leave or stay as this was her past, not her.

Long story short I found nude pictures and a very very unsettling text to another guy that apparently ""never got sent"". I believe her that she didnt actually cheat on me. It was enough that I broke up with her right then. She was still living with me but wasted no time she ends up having sex with 3 different guys pretty much immediatly. 2 weeks pass and I find out shes talking to another guy but not in a just want sex type of way. So I'm finally getting her moved out to her  mom's when she tells me the ceiling is caved in. I cracked and let her stay with me till shes on her feet on the one condition she stops talking to that guy. 1 day passes and I find out she never intended to stop talking to him saying that if I didnt want her she wasnt going to give him up. So I kicked her out. She had no place to go so ended rooming with this guy. I have found out since the breakup she said that when we had sex she wasnt getting off (this was only the past 6 months wasnt always like that) and thats the reason she just wanted to fuck someone else and get it out of her system. But the new guy shes actually talking to and it doest seem like its just sexual. She likes him. Shes now telling me that shes sorry and wants me back that she loves me and wanted to get back together the whole time. Ive been saying no but its down to this decision now. She wants me back but if I say no this time shes going to have to keep living with him and im guessing that will probably be the end of us.  Do I keep saying no and let the love of my life the woman I was gonna propose to and spend the rest of my life with just let her go?

Hi,


  So, this is my first ever Reddit post and really don't know how to do it properly. I initially thought of posting this on r/seduction but things escalated pretty quickly.

  16M here and i recently experienced what i would call my first ""true"" passion, admittedly, I have liked a number of girls before but with none of them I felt the same as this time.

  By the time I was considering posting this on r/seduction things had already started going down south but were not nearly as bad as they are now, she'd ""hurt"" me a few times by them and all my attempts of getting closer to her would have quite the opposite effect (Something I was dumb enough do simply ignore and never really question the reason of why it was happening), I would see her getting pretty close to other boys but constantly ""ignore"" me, she would hug them a lot, tickle them and sometimes even... Bite them... I'm going off tracks here but one of them is relevant to what we'll be discussing here, ""Gus"", a mutual friend of ours ( much more hers than mine at the time ) admittedly, he'd nothing wrong to me, he is currently dating and has been so for more than two years, the thing that separates him from the others is that he takes the same route home as us up to a certain point, we would pass through a kind of narrow viaduct and I would see them going in front of me, walking arm in arm, joking and laughing while remaining utterly oblivious to my presence, these would be moments were I would have a thousand things to say but courage to say none.

 One time I was pretty fed up with those things and decided I've had enough and being the genius I am I concluded that the best thing to do in this situation would be to just explode, the last straw being one day when I lost something important (So important I don't recall what it was) and while I was looking for it after class was over, she simply left, after countless months in wich I would wait every single day so we could go home together, sometimes she would even ask at times for me to do so (Though not referring to me alone most of the time, it still felt good for me) and when I need her to wait for me, she simply goes. I waited for Gus to go on his own way and started, btw, I was necessarily screaming but I was speaking in a very hysterical way and it was almost certainly disrespectful (Something that makes me feel even worse now) I commented on how I felt she constantly ignored me, on how even if we were alone I needed to be the one to start a conversation otherwise she would remain mute, in how she didn't treat me as a friend but still asked me things (Something that, if I had the mind I have now at the time, I would be grateful, I mean, at least she trusted me with that, at least we would do school projects together, at least she would ever so often call me for a duo on specific tests, and no, I know what you're thinking, but she is quite a lot smarter than I am, so it wasn't interest) and I giving a special focus on how I felt horrible around her because of the way she treated. Arriving home, we continued the conversation through social networks but it was more of the same so I won't mention here.

  Some time after that, she would talk to me even less(I really don't know what I was expecting) and I felt thing we're going back to normal (She ignoring me, I going through the viaduct with her, we both acting as if we were ok) and I simply couldn't take it anymore, so I decided to not wait for her anymore, I started earlier with Victor (another mutual friend, this one much more mine than hers) and eventually even Gus started coming with us, needles to say it didn't take much time for her to notice this, and what she did? Started leaving earlier as well! A lot earlier in fact, even before the three of us, and even if I managed to catch up to her, she would refuse to say even a word, I tried apologizing the first time and the only response I got was ""I'm just going home, ALONE, all the people who used to come with me left me behind after all"" to wich I responded saying I didn't know she cared that much, her response was ""Good, cause I don't care anymore"".

  Time passed, I tried apologizing some more(these times, receiving nothing in response) and the world kept spinning.l that is, until in one of these apologies took a very shameful turn, basically at this point I had told her I was thinking about stopping taking the viaduct route, I said that I had about 3 alternate routes I could take and I felt at the time it was the right thing to do, however, during this specific ""apology"" I said something like ""You know when I said I had 3 other routes I could take? Actually, there is a fourth one, I could just follow you and go home from there, you know what? I'm not leaving till you start talking to me again."" Keep in mind she was still mute up to that point, soon enough, she responded with ""But you aren't going to this... Are you?"" wich I responded with ""if I have to..."" I soon followed ranting about how I didn't want to lose her as a friend, since I already lost her as a love interest. Needless to say this didn't help my situation not even a bit, as since then she seems to be avoiding me completely.

  I started going another route, passing under the viaduct and taking a bus from there and... I always got this thought that would lurk in the dark corners of my mind, haunting me ever so often ""What if she's usually this as an excuse to finally get rid of me? What if she just wants to be alone? Have I finally gone too far?"" But at the time I was just a suspicion and I didn't let it stop me.

  Fast forward to last week when we were going home in a large group(the usual people are there, but there are much more this time) and I notice she is once again, walking arm in arm and speaking normally to Gus (She said when I tried to apologize, that she wasn't going to talk to any of us outside of school, it wasn't just with me) and I finally got the confirmation I needed: The problem really was with me, I decided trying to apologize one last time(Read: make one last mistake) this time, I mentioned how I have betrayed not only her confidence but of many more, how in my mindless rantings I would shittalk many of our friends just because she was closer to them (including Gus) and how i was an asshole to them and now to her, I said I wanted one last chance to fix everything, to wich she responded with ""Just forget all of that"". 

  Thing is, before all that happened I asked Victor if he could talk to her about this since he was pretty close to her, he didn't, or had not done so far so. He ended up doing this after this last conversation with her and well... She told him that though she has agreed to give me one chance, she is really avoiding me and didn't want to get close, because she is scared of me, saying I threatened her and I was acting worse as time passed.

  2 days ago, the last time I spoke to her, I told her about how I was the one who asked Victor to have that conversation and how he (obviously) told me everything, I asked if she really did feel threatened and if she was really avoiding me consciously, she confirmed both thins, at that point, I started crying and wailing about having fucked everything up and admited I didn't know how to fix this, or even if I would be able to do this, she told I don't to prove myself to her, I need to change my actions.

  And here we are, after all of that happened I had time to think and now realize what I had done, I harassed her all this time while playing victim and threatened when I felt most desperate, turned against my closest friends, and blamed everyone except myself for all of that.

  What do I do now? How do I change myself? Would be better if I just get  away from her, like forever?

612,"A few years ago I was a deep and dark place. It was like being at the bottom of a pit and I'm desperately clawing my way up, but I was hopeful that I could reach the top. I had extremely bad days but also really good days where I felt like my depression was gone. 

Nowadays things are just meh. My depression isn't as severe but I also don't have those really good days. I don't know what to do. Is this a good sign? 

I Have a few theories for why this happened:
- my antidepressants worked really well at first but they don't increase my mood as much as they used to
- I've matured/got too tired and gave up on the idea of a quick fix. And I've come to terms with the fact that my depression is probably never going away. 


In a way I'm functioning better, I have a job where I'm barely late and barely call in sick (huge improvement from where I was 3 years ago) I also seem to be doing well on my studies.

Yet I still feel like this isn't enough. How do I start caring more. A small part of me misses being that naive 22 year who thought she could cure her depression within months.

615,"So several days ago, I (17M) stole a pair of boots from a relatives house because of a complusive urge of my fetish... I don’t know what I was even thinking... I started feeling guilty about stealing them, so I told my mother the truth about me stealing them then to go to my relatives house to apologize and return them. The relatives gave me the benefit of the doubt and I gave them something else for compensation of my wrongdoing. My mother, however, was really disappointed about me stealing and feared that I would steal something else and face bigger consequences like jail time. As a result, she grounded me from video games for a month and disallowed me to go out of town for a couple of universities I would like to go for a couple of years as hopes that I would regain her trust again. 

This morning, she asked me to write an essay about how I feel about this, but I am not sure if I should mention my fetish.

616,"I just got back from break and I can't even do anything because I just lost my phone. When the bus arrived I had my phone with me and put it in my jacket pocket (which I think it probably slipped out of). I never heard it fall out and hit the ground, so I only realized it was gone when I was back in my dorm unpacking my things. I immediately ran out and tried to retrace my steps but I never saw the phone and the bus left so I couldn't ask the driver if my phone was on the bus. 

I can't relax or do anything because I can't stop thinking about where my phone is. I don't know how I'm going to call my mom and tell her I'm here or anything like that. All my social media was on that phone and so much personal information too. I have it password protected and a fingerprint ID but it doesn't make me feel any safer right now. I just want my stupid phone back and I have no idea how it could have been gone this quickly. 

This all happened within half an hour, so I strongly feel that someone picked up my phone after I dropped it. There is almost no one here right now so I don't know who could have done it.

617,"Good day, everyone. This is obviously a throwaway account, mostly because I feel extremely ashamed of myself for stooping to this level. 

Well, my conundrum is this:

Should I ask my college instructor out to the symphony on Friday? 

I am a 23 year old guy, working on my bachelor's. My instructor is a 25 year old woman working on her graduate degree. Regardless, I have unfortunately developed a crippling crush on her. Usually I am able to handle such feelings and they go away, but I guess because I see her almost every day they have only gotten worse. 

I have zero experience with women (well, I did ask out a girl several years ago. Nothing came of that.) I cannot tell if she likes me at all. She seems friendly enough, but then again, she has to be because she is my teacher. I have gotten very good at convincing myself that people (especially women) don't like over the years, as a way of killing such feelings and coping with being alone. If I could convince myself right now that she doesn't like me, or wouldn't like me, I could carry on with my life, go to the symphony alone, and generally go back to normal.

One half of me is telling me to bite the bullet and ask her, hide my face if she declines *or* get to experience something human for once in my life if she agrees. The other half is saying that it's just a crush and that it will go away when I no longer see her, that she couldn't possibly want to be with me, that I will make a categorical fool of myself, and so on. 

I was planning on going to the symphony alone. But these runaway thoughts have now suggested that I ask her if she'd go. I truly hate being in this position. I don't know what kind of advice I expect, if any. I haven't given many useful details, though I am sure you can derive something of my personality from this post. I am not usually this scattered.

622,"So my mom has always been a very protective and overall kinda annoying. She loves to make things way worse than they actually are. Yes I understand she is looking out for me. I've recently got into a relationship with a girl from my psychology class. She's friends with my friends as well. Her family is overall very loving and welcomed me with open arms into their family. On the other hand, my mom is not so keen on same sex relationships. So we haven't told her about it yet, maybe never well. She would ban me from hanging out with her. And she's done it before. I don't blame my mom for being sketchy because the two of us together is a little hectic. I ran away from home even though I'm 18 to live with her and her family. I was planning to go to EMT training so I could move out as soon as possible and they were the nicest people to me. That lasted a little under a week. My best friend ratted me out to my mom and she forced me back with the threats of making all our lives hell. I didn't wanna bring that onto their family so I went back home. After a month of not being able to hang out with her. My mom finally gave in and has been letting us hang out with each other. But only while her parents are home. Even those they don't supervise anyway. We aren't doing anything, we're waiting for that. 

That's the backstory of the last 5 months. And now we're here. This is where I need advice. Ever since my mom has been letting us hang out together. She's been trying to make my girlfriend and her family seem like they're lying, horrible people and I shouldn't be around them. Today I wanted to hang out with her after she got off work. And the roads are pretty bad. Her mom and dad had a little family get together last night with social drinking, and the last week her parents have also stayed up long nights to work on redoing a bathroom. I asked my mom if I could hang with her, and she was yeah whatever. And her mom said that we can if I can pick her up from work, which is totally fine. I need to go shopping there anyway. And her mom really doesn't wanna drive in this weather unless she has to. Because she's tired and having a slight hangover. She's been working her ass off the light week. I told my mom the situation and she looks at me and told me that she was lying and manipulating me into coming to get her from work. Which is extremely hard to believe. She said a mom wouldn't do that to her kid? I'm just frustrated and I don't know who to believe at this point. I love both of them to death. And I've been lied and cheated to before and I don't want that to happen again. 

I'm scared my mom is going to be right for once. Please help. What do you think I should do.. i obviously won't leave my girlfriend. But like, I don't know who to believe anymore.",01Dec2019,1

624,"So recently, I'm getting episodes of frustration about this certain problem. Tho this is only the second time when I actually cried. 

Been with my SO for 6 years now. We've already talked a lot about getting married and starting a family, but we really didn't have a concrete plan, especially about saving up (financially) for it. A few years ago we even thought of getting married this 2019, but then again it wasn't a concrete plan and we haven't saved up for it. For some reason, earlier this year, I looked forward to getting engaged by the end of 2019. We both agreed before that he'll be the one to propose. 2019 is coming to an end and he still hasn't proposed yet, and I can't think of any more special occasions in the near future when he'll probably propose (our anniversary and my birthday both just ended this November).

I totally understand why he's probably not proposing yet: 1) we still don't have enough money, 2) I have joked about waiting for my brother to finish his studies first before getting married. A few months ago when I told my SO about getting married, he asked me to wait and be patient (in a sincere tone). I'm ok with that before, but now I don't know why I'm so upset. I also get triggered when I see posts of friends getting married/engaged. I'm afraid to tell my SO that I'm frustrated because I don't want to pass the burden and pressure to him. 

It's a really shallow problem, is going to a psychologist too much? Or should I just talk to my SO about it? Or maybe it's just a phase (it's only been a few days) and wait for a couple of weeks?",01Dec2019,1

she has a lot more friends than me and regularly talks to them. i have very few friends who i try to regularly talk to, but in the end, i really don’t have anyone there for me. i need to get over her being my girlfriend and focus on building our friendship, but i’m finding it so hard when i don’t have anyone there for me. she’s really my only friend and even though i can confide in her about my feelings regarding our breakup, i just find it inappropriate and honestly i’m not that ready to fully open up to her again. like i said i want to focus on rebuilding our friendship that was lost.

630,"My friend Jane (fake name obviously) and I both go to college and have been friends for the past 5 years. She's always been a jealous and competitive person, and I've always performed better academically, so things would be tense at times. Still, nothing serious happened until this year. In Spring 2018, I was the only student from my class selected to give a poster presentation at an annual conference, and Jane asked me how I did it, so to help her out for the next year I sent her my project details and poster format. Then the following year, in Spring 2019, her project was accepted, and when I attended the conference to see what her project was about, I realized that she had literally copied my project and poster, with enough minor changes to avoid plagiarism. I was stunned but didn't say anything, I thought that maybe she hadn't meant to copy my project and that my project inspired hers. Then, this semester, Fall 2019, we are once again both taking the same class together, and once again we have to complete a research project by the end of the semester, but this time it's a requirement to pass the class. We were put in separate groups, and me being the Type A personality that I am, I made sure my group finished our project well ahead of time and submitted it a month before the deadline. Jane's group was falling behind and she never once came to me for help, and I never offered. I had learned my lesson, and the only person I shared my project with was my other friend Laura, who was in a separate group and had also completed and submitted her project. Then, around 3 days before the deadline, Laura told me she had found Kate (one of Jane's group members) snooping around on her laptop without her permission, and when she stopped her and asked her what she was up to, Kate admitted that Jane had put her up to it and told her to look for my project on her laptop and then copy it onto her flash drive. I have no idea how Jane even found out Laura had a copy of my project, and I was obviously furious, but I remained calm and decided to confronted Jane quietly and in private. Jane denied that the whole thing was her idea and claimed that Kate was the one that wanted a copy of my project. This seemed strange to me because Kate and I have never even spoken to each other before, and when I asked Kate about it later she corroborated Laura's story, that she was looking for my project on Laura's computer because Jane had told her she'd find it there. Now I don't know what to do or whether I should do anything at all.

634,"Hi, first time posting + english is not my first language, please be gentle.

tl,dr.: Customer gets the same piercing pierced for about 8 times over the course of 9 months. Piercer told him, he's not getting it done again because of his abusive communication over phone and whatsapp towards us. Now left one star review on Google and we want him to delete it.

I work the front desk in a piercing and tattoo shop (I'm an apprentice) and one of my jobs is to answer e-mails, social media and whatsapp. We had a customer (early 20's) coming to us since february. He has gotten the same piercing about 8 times at our studio, same spot and always took it out a day after it got pierced. The problem in his opinion is, that the placement is always a bit off (we talking  ""half a millimeter to the left"" etc).

The reason why my boss (the piercer and owner of the shop) went through with piercing this guy 8 times the same thing was that he always payed full price and we thought he's just a dude with to much money and not enough self-esteem/hobbies. Another reason is that we have a 5 star rating on google, and we are pretty proud of that. We kinda knew, he will review us, so we went that extra mile.

Over the course of 9 months, we got about a 100 (!) messages from this customer via whatsapp and other social media, ranging from:

* demanding monologues to get a new appointment,
* not answering him within 10 minutes,
* wrongfull and just mean spirited accusations against my boss and me,
* apologizing for accusations,
* begging for a new appointment,
* innuendo of being able to sue any company
* ""customer is king""
* stalky messages like ""i've seen you in the shop after closing hours. why's that?"" (+ phonecalls to check if we are working today),

which are all very obviously a manipulative scream for our attention. If I answered him, I was polite and professional.

So last friday, after he raged for half an hour on the phone, demanding and accusing as always, my boss finally told him (still in a polite manner ofc) to go to a different studio, this is not working out anymore.

Now he left us a one star review on google, stating very positive things about the shop in the beginning, but in the last 2 sentences hes accusing my boss of being snappy, moody and rude, when asked for appointments. (which is not true, only the twisted perseption of his)

I see that this his last resort to get our attention. And I don't know how to handle it. All we want is him to take down the unjustified bad review and never step foot in our shop again.

What is a reasonable way to deal with this situation? I don't want things to escalate, since my boss was already talking about legal actions, which I think woudn't do much good, instead harm for everyone involved.

What would you do?

Tbh, as I am typing this madness and reviewing all these abusive messages, I don't know how we continued to let him in the shop. We were never able to make him happy in the first place. And my own mental health took quiet a bit of damage as well because of this.",01Dec2019,1

I have a girlfriend, witch i love more than anything in the world. Period. I love her with all my heart and she loves me. Im the happyest in the world witth her.

The problem is that she has no, and i mean NO self esteem...

She has horrible nightmares almost every nights about me cheating on her or something equaly horrible...

She pretty much ASSUMES that im gonna leave her or that i'll stop loving her one day for some reason an she cant be convinced ortherwise no mather what i do...

she gets extremely possesive beacause, from HER perspective, EVERY GIRL IS BETTER/PRETTYER/NICER than her for some f'ing reason...

She has alot of problem in her nurse-school too since she is treated like a walking rug by many professionals beacause of it and she is really sturggling to keep it together despite really wanting to be a nurse...

She apparently dosent even imagine me being with her instead of someone else, and she keeps saying that she doesent deserve me or someting equaly absurd...

I actually had to stop her several times form doing something really dumb out of self deprecation (not talking about suicide atempts, that happend BEFORE she met me) like completely stoping school because of ONE internship that didnt go well (and even if she faills it, she is in the last year of nurse school and can do this internship over nex year anyway)

She keeps saying horrible things about herself... like how fat she is (she is just a little chubby) or how ugly she is (Wich is objectively bullshit by any standard, She is Really f'ing cute, and not just beacause i love her) she even said she was a monster... and she does that every day!

SHE EVEN CALLS ME A LIAR WHEN I SAY I LOVER HER! (kinda jockingly but i can SEE from a mile away that she actualy belives im lying)

IM sick of her feeling so miserable... i feel useless ... i love her more than anything and i KNOW she can get better!

Please... If you see this post, and you know any way i might help her or at least, push her to find the help she needs, so she can FINALLY be happy with her life...

i love her so much and i wont stop until she gets better.

I occasionally hang out with friends but I also have dogs I take care of and need to watch, I don’t want them to be locked up all day in their crates :( so that’s another reason why I don’t like hanging out with people much. But I just lost a friend because she asked me to hang out yesterday and I said I already had plans and it was because i was hanging out with my boyfriend and we took the dogs to the park. And also bc she was hanging out with her other friends and I didn’t want to have a panic attack because  I didn’t know them lmao. Well today she said that I didn’t know how to be a friend and that it’s always just about my boyfriend. And it’s really not. Sometimes I just have stuff to do ? Like I have 2 dogs I need to take care of. I feel like even though I don’t hang out with people much I always text them and ask them how they’re doing. I don’t feel like I’m a bad person I just feel like people aren’t interested in being my friend because I’m shy and don’t really like interacting with groups. It’s very confusing and I understand this probably just sounds ridiculous 😅 I’m a good person I’m just shy basically 
But does anyone else feel this way? You just feel annoyed with friends but you want friends at the same time ? But I feel like they usually have a high demand for hanging out 😂",01Dec2019,1
648,"So my “friend” (we’ll call him Greg) and I are childhood family friends since the age of 4 (both 25m now). Greg knows that  I take care of my hygiene and occasionally go out to spa’s for massage, facials, pedicures, cupping, waxing, etc - well because I believe in taking care of my body and treating myself every once in a while because of my sedentary job. He’s into doing these things too but knows that I’m probably the only one happy to do this stuff with him when we hang out. We used to go out with our friends to restaurants, movies, clubs, and did other fun stuff together, but now he reserves those things with the others and just calls to hang out with me when he needs to go get a haircut or go to the spa. I don’t mean to sound butt hurt/salty, but that just doesn’t feel right to me, especially since he ignores my texts and calls when I want to hang out. He is available and calls me when I’m not. We never compromise on dates, it’s always been what he wants to do whenever he wants to. 

Again, I’m probably wrong here and understand that a person like that shouldn’t be called a real friend. I just want to know how I can politely call him out without sounding crazy. I hope we can fix this issue, but I doubt it as this is not the only issue I’ve had with him. 

Grateful for your input!",01Dec2019,1
649,"so for my friends birthday, she took me and 7 of our friends to see a haunted attraction in a mall. it was a classic story about our country’s prime minister getting trapped in a hotel a killer or something- i wouldn’t know, i left after being there for 10 minutes. 

even though i didn’t see much of anything in there, seeing as i left after about 10 minutes, i was still terrified to my bones. i can’t get the image of the hotel staffs scream in the hallways as she threw herself onto the window. the flashing red lights. the eerie broken down version of our national anthem. 

i had to beg the chaperone to let me leave the attraction and sit outside, which was humiliating enough to have to do in front of my friends. it’s only been a couple days since then, and i haven’t gotten much sleep because the window in my room is bringing me back to the experience. and the silence is making me hear the broken down national anthem in my head. even just closing my eyes reminds me of the hands that slammed into the window. 

i didn’t think i was THAT terrified of a fucking fake irl horror movie, but i guess i learnt my lesson. 

how can i get rid of these reoccurring thoughts? please help me.",01Dec2019,1
650,"Hi, thank you for reading.

Recently, my family wanted me to sign up for an interview where I could potentially receive a full-tuition scholarship. I have signed up, but I feel guilty for doing so.

A full-tuition scholarship would be a huge help, but I come from a very fortunate situation. My family can afford the college that I am going to, and they are willing to help me pay for tuition. By applying for this scholarship, I feel like I am taking the opportunity away from someone who needs it more.

I do not know what to do. Of course, I am not guaranteed to receive the scholarship. However, in the case that I do, I am afraid that it won’t be fair for me to receive it. I don’t want to potentially take it away from someone who needs it; but at the same time, I do not want to wrong my family. 

Should I let the interviewers know of my financial situation so that they can take it into account? Is there something more that I should do?

I’m sorry if I haven’t articulated this well. Thank you for your time.",01Dec2019,1

it’s been like this for a few weeks, but every time i mention to my mum about how i’m worried about her and we need to take her to the vet she just responds with “yeah..” and mentions something about being her allergic to fleas (i don’t think that’s the problem- she’s never had such a severe reaction to fleas before, we use flea treatment every month and we’ve tried a bunch of different ones to make sure they were actually working)

We need to take her to the vet, but my mum just keeps brushing it off as a flea problem. IDK if she’s doing it because we can’t afford to take her to the vet and get medication if she needs it (we’ve always had money problems, so maybe money is extra tight right now, but at the same time she wastes money on sweets, snacks and random items all the time??) or just because she doesn’t think my cat needs it, or whatever.

I started thinking about it when I was a kid. I'd think of what I'd look like as a girl a lot. It got me erect when I thought about it. I'd forget about it for a time but my thoughts would keep coming back. 

Back when I lived with my parents, I'd go and take my sisters Halloween wig and I'd take my moms bra and panties. I would put them on and then squeeze my nipples to make it look like I had boobs. I would look at myself in the mirror and it would get me really erect. I got orgasms a few times thinking about myself growing a pair of boobs and turning into a woman.

I  grew out of it but I still get addicted to male feminization. I watch MtF videos on growing boobs and a butt and it turns me on a lot. I can't stop getting erect on men turning into women. The changes they go through make me really addicted. I also get addicted to male sissy posts and pics but I don't watch them a lot.  A phrase like grow a pair (of boobs) turns me on so much.

I like being a guy though, I'm attracted to women. I've never had a girlfriend though. That might probably be why these things turn me on, I don't know.

I am stuck in my country. My plan was to apply to a German University and do my under graduate their (Germany because cost of education is basically free there) and then apply for student loan , go there , join the University team and then go on but then all plans failed and now I don't even have the money to apply for any exam or admission in a university.

It was a detailed plan and I know my family's financial situation so I DID plan accordingly but then life got in the way and now I'm stuck at home.

Tried applying for jobs everywhere and got nowhere basically no one wants a high school graduate .I'm good at studies and did score 90% in my exams but still I have nothing and am nowhere close to my goal (pun intended). 

I do play well and I feel like I'm home when I'm playing football. I have no idea what to do next and where I'm going with my life. I do know my purpose I just don't have the means to fulfill it.

She never sees them.

(Here in minnesota) Her step dad doesnt allow my friend to talk to her mom grandma or half brother there if they so much as disagrees with them. He has major issues. Anyways shes getting married in 3 weeks they were all set to come but the mom lost her job cuz her boss died. I get this huge long email detailing how sad they are they cant make it and idk. It just seems like a last minute excuse he is pulling. They're going to miss the wedding for financial reasons but still plan on going on another cruise this summer? The mom is a wreck and nonstop crying I guess. So I think this is all on the stepdad. Gimme advice. Do I say something to him? Do I just go passive and post pics of the wedding shower as if she is fine without them.. and how much fun were having?

If I say something he may just come down on my friend like he always does and possibly stop her from talking to her mom.

She expected this so she isnt shaddered but is sad that she wont have her mom there. She has made a few comments but she knows to toe the line with her dad cuz hell go psycho on dumb stuff... Hell once he ripped the router out of the wall and flipped out when we were 16 cuz she dared to write ""dezs chinese food do not touch"" on some takeout we bought... I guess cuz ""i never write this on the food i buy"" He has lost countless jobs because of his insane temper.

For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled to talk to woman or even approach them. In the times I find I like someone or would like to talk to someone I either remove myself from the room, or find myself boring and awkward attempting to converse. 
 
It’s not like I think I’m unattractive or things like that, I’m actually happy with my appearance. I just think I’m a boring person to talk to, I can never think of something interesting to say. I can’t hold a conversation, and when I think I can, it doesn’t last long. 
 
But the absolute worst is that if there’s more than one person in the room, which is 90% of the time let’s be real here. I can barely say hi. 
 
Example~ This happened today, and is why I’m posting 
 
I’ve been learning a language for 2 months, this week I’ve been practicing it where I travel often with the people around the hotel and local areas. The girl I like was unfortunately on annual leave at the time of my visit for the start; and has now returned. When I went to where she works, she had returned (yay) and her co-worker greeted me in the language I was learning (I had practiced with her earlier in the week); so golden opportunity to give it a go with her there too right? Yea I thought so too. Except my brain commanded me to smile, say hi, then proceed to stare at the floor for a few seconds; at which point my group I was with also walked in and said hi. So we went away and used the facilities. Fast forward to finishing. I stood outside the door for a minute or so just to tell myself I can say more than hello to her. I knew I’d only have a very short time to speak, I rushed ahead of my group on purpose. So I go to head out and ask her how was her time away from work. She smiled and responded, as we quickly conversed I feel like I made the conversation quite hard to keep going, I didn’t really know what to say, and her time off did sound fun.
 
I’m just getting tired of this scenario always happening. When I finally find confidence, it makes it a little harder to find it again the next time. What can I do to just say what I want to say instead of staring at the floor worried about screwing it up; which ultimately is how it ends up by not talking and staring at the floor.

Except for the I just found out that they only keep it outside and go down to his truck when I’m there, which isn’t often. So most of the time they are smoking weed inside of our apartment.

He then brought weed (that was laced), pills, and COCAINE and they proceded to use all of the drugs inside the apartment. I knew the weed was there because they kept going outside so I locked myself in my room.  That’s when all the other drugs came out because they thought I wouldn’t know.

the thing i want to know though is if im being paranoid and scared to lose someone or if he genuinely regrets his decision example: i was at his house today, i work nights and see him right away after work.

687,"I'll give context, I'm 19 years old and live in a town with a  population under 3,000. I have medical certifications and administrative work experience. 
 I recently was evicted from the place I was staying at because I lost my job in August due to a mental health issue. I'm currently living with mentally abusive parents, and one makes me very physically uncomfortable with my body and being touched in any way and am having breakdowns almost every single day and I'm stressed to the point of suicidal ideation.
 The year has been rough for me, started the year off by ending a relationship where I had gotten cheated on. Then at the end of  September was dumped due the other party not being able to do long distance (understandable). I had two friends commit suicide. Then most recently I got into a bad car accident where I couldn't go to the hospital because I can't afford any sort of medical care.
 I am completely unable to find a job in any field, I couldn't even get a call back from McDonald's. The area I live in is very racist and some places straight out refuse to give me an application. 
 I'm in debt and my phone service was disconnected and the home I'm in doesn't have any wifi, which makes it even harder to try and get a job.
 I was planning on moving to another country by this time of the year and now my entire plans have been completely destroyed and I'm struggling mentally to keep it together.  I don't have any friends or people that I know in real life because my work schedule didn't really allow free time. I'm so isolated from everyone and everything I don't know how to even have a conversation with my parents without it leading into a total meltdown on my end. 
 I have absolutely no money and am in the negatives in my bank account, there's no one who can help me financially and I seriously can't find a job. I don't have my drivers license and am restricted from certain jobs that have a 21+ age limit like prisons and such. I can't even look through job posting without crying because I get so stressed seeing all the jobs I applied to and never getting an email or callback.

688,"So to put things in a medium story, last year I was talking to this guy (we will use A for him) for about a month and then all of sudden A disappeared and ghosts me. Fast forward 10 months I’m getting out of a bad relationship and all of a sudden A pops back into my life. I started talking to A again because I give people second chances.  I find out A was having a rough patch in his relationship back then but now he’s single and wanted to apologize and try to be friends. We instantly hit it off of friends. We both just got out of a relationship and agreed to just support eachother. But then feelings started to get involved. We finally met in person and things went great we had a lot of fun and when it was time for him to leave he left his jacket here and when I brought it up he told me he wanted me to have something of his but we where just friends. A week later and basically we talk 24/7 and he comes and sees me again we ended up doing the dirty together and we both said we liked eachother. He spent the night and then left in the morning. So after this point it’s been a weekend thing where he sees me spends the night and then goes home he stays for about 24 hours in all. But he keeps saying he doesn’t want a relationship but he says he’s not use to courting people and he has taken me on a date and he’s met my family.

691,"hi all -

im 17 years old, high school senior, female. ever since I was in middle school, I've been questioning my sexuality. I started identifying as bisexual in 8th grade, but I've shifted between identifying as straight, gay, asexual, and bi ever since. I think I'm bi, but I'm scared I'll keep changing my mind. I think I've been afraid of it ever since I figured it out, but I want to be accepted for who I am, and my sexuality is a part of who I am. I know I'm not straight.

I'm just really scared to come out, even though my family is not religious and I know they'll accept me, it's still scary to look my parents in the eyes and say it. plus, I've mentioned a bisexual friend to my mom before and she seemed skeptical, and said ""she's just gay"". I know my parents don't intend to be homophobic, they just don't understand bisexuality. I'd like to come out to a friend first, but it worries me that my friends might look at me differently since they're all female and I don't want them to think I'm hitting on them (I'm not). I'm also really close to my parents, and even though I'd really prefer to tell someone else first, I'm scared they'd be offended. I don't have any siblings or other close family members.

I dated a guy last year, and he was great and all that, but we ended up breaking up because I just couldn't make myself like him. I think my confusion over my sexuality was the reason we broke up, but nobody knows that. I have a friend that I think might be good to come out to first (she's a lesbian) but I'm worried about that idea too. I know she probably wouldn't care, but I think she may like me, and I think I may like her too, but I'm afraid to start another relationship and then realize I don't actually like her (or girls) and end up losing someone who could end up being my best friend. I don't want to come out to her and have her ask me out, because I don't want to say no and lose the chance to be with her, and I don't want to say yes and then end up flaking out of the relationship. I don't think I've ever had anyone understand me like she does, but the idea of dating her (or any girl, or anyone really) scares me. (I have a long history of social anxiety, so it's not really surprising to me that I'm so easily scared, but still.)

fuck I'm just so scared and confused. I have no idea what to do about this. any advice you have for me would be really, really appreciated. &lt;3 thanks",01Dec2019,1

696,"Hello-this is my first time reddit posting &amp; I guess it didn't fit in the ""debt"" section, so it got deleted. Im mainly posting because I'm truly at a loss for what to do/whom I can talk to &amp; there seems to be no one else or article/research that has a similar situation as this. 

Since I started working at 17, my parents would sometimes ask for extra money assistance. We've always been up and down because my father owns his own business and also has health issues, my mother doesn't work (even now that all of us kids are 18+). The biggest expense was my using some money for my tuition (out of my pocket) to help pay $2500 for rent and an extra $2500 for ""other expenses/bills"" for the month when I was 19 or so. My siblings and I were raised to always be there to help out family when need be, no matter what-and I feel my parents have taken advantage of this mindset for their own benefits.

When I was 18 my parents discovered credit and credit cards and tried to teach me about it at the same time as they were navigating it. Essentially-the blind leading the blind and I racked up about $15,000 in credit debt (some being tuition payments). Currently, I'm in graduate school, working two part-time gigs that have me at over 50-80 hours a week (depending on the time of year) and trying to stay afloat myself with paying my bills off on time, while having some to save (usually nothing or barley anything), while supporting my parents and younger siblings.

My parents have asked to use my credit cards throughout the past 3 years (on and off) to help with my father's business expenses. Overall, they have racked up around $3000 of credit charges that they have NOT paid back, nor have taken full responsibility for doing so. Citing, ""it was to keep the roof over your head so it's for family."" My father also had me list him as an account holder under one of my credit cards since he couldn't secure one to help with his business expenses (I do not use this card and he solely makes the payments on that, at least.) However, my credit shows this and it carries the balance and reflects on my credits score. Recently, my parents asked myself and two of my three other siblings to take out $1,500 from our lines of credit each to help with rent and other bills/expenses. My sister, mother and I sat down and went over everything and found that my father's ""fancier"" car payments made us go over monthly on our budget. My father also has the mindset of ""I work every day and do hard labor, therefore, I should have anything and everything that I want without a care about price."" He genuinely does not understand how some bills are monthly besides rent (he is 53). When we tried to talk with him about selling these extravagant cars, he said no because he wants to be able to keep up appearances.

My parents have not made any payments towards my siblings and I's credit line payouts to them for the last 3 months. They also have one car payment routed through my bank account which houses my savings (a mere $700) and often ""forget"" to give me the payment unless I harass them for it. When I do, they give me a whole talk of ""well all these bills just came in so, we don't have the money yet."" Now I'm in the negatives in my savings.

Whenever I have resisted giving my parents money it has been met with, ""you aren't family then and you can leave because you don't care about anyone else!"" Or it's a ""we've done all this for you and you can't give us xyz amount of money?"" And with my lack of savings and credit-debt ratio, moving out isn't very applicable. One of my best friends also recently moved out but still gives her parents $200 or so to help out because her father is disabled and her mom has mounting health issues. I mentioned this to my parents since they know my friend well and they said that I should also be able to do that for them whenever I move out. Especially because my friend and I are in the same work industry (broadcast/entertainment/freelance). I'm 24 now &amp; would like to move out for multiple reasons but am unable to due to just not having money and support/financing my family.

TL;DR: I feel stuck and unsure of what to even do next, or where to go. I feel inevitably stuck and like I'm never going to not be in debt, or be able to live on my own, without worry that my parents will still ask for extra money that they'll never pay back or own up to racking up on my (and now my siblings) credit cards to keep up their lifestyle in an upper-middle class neighborhood simply because my father ""never had that"" growing up and uses ""but we're family and it's what we do"" as an excuse. What are some things others have done to help alleviate their debt situation? While saving &amp; trying to help out when they can?

I also 100% own up to my own debt-I fucked up, but it would be much more manageable without this consistent knockdown from my parents financially every couple of weeks. I just feel like I have 0 idea what to do/what my steps going forward should be without fucking over my entire family.",01Dec2019,1

I dated a girl a while back and she really fucked me up. I dumped her because her brother was a sociopath and loved drama and I just couldn’t take it anymore. My family seems to think I did the right thing. My dad firmly believes that if I would’ve stayed with her and had a future together we would’ve gotten divorced. 

She made me extremely self-conscious and worried about my height and appearance. She found a new guy 2 weeks after we split up and told me that he’s better and has done more for
Her in 2 months than I did in a year. That really stung.

700,"Last year I was sexually assaulted by my ex boyfriend. Ever since I don’t really feel safe anywhere because he had been in my life for 3 years and knew where all of my family members live. My now husband and I are currently living in the same city but in a little house that is right next to my sisters house. We are able to move in mid December, but it is in a part of town where the druggies and sketchy people walk around all day and night and will just go onto peoples porches, look their windows, and take anything off of porches and yards. The crime map for the area is good and looks safe, but is right out of the most dangerous part of our city and when I drive through that area at night I see people sitting on the sidewalks shooting up and acting erratic. So on top the fear I already had from my trauma, I’m now fearful of what could possibly happen in the new house. We just ordered a 3 pack of Arlo cameras because they were very cheap online from Black Friday and we also have a Ring doorbell camera. What can we do to make me feel safe when we move in?

701,"Hi y’all

Feel free to direct me elsewhere if this question is misplaced

For reference (FWIW), I’m a 25 year old male

I’ve always been introverted and it was never really much of a problem for me (at least not in my opinion), but recently my communication tendencies have caused issues in my life 

My career:    
I’ve been relatively successful so far in my life. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 2017 and I’m currently a mid-level administrator in local government (Parks &amp; Rec). I started this job in June of 2018. After my first 6 months, I had a performance evaluation which went really well and I got a raise. This year however, my performance evaluation did not go nearly as well (was scored 73/135 -“satisfactory”) and the biggest knock on my evaluation was that I’m kind of approachable, that I haven’t been outgoing enough when it comes to making connections in the field, etc.  &amp; my boss was actually worried that I’m depressed 

My relationship:
I have always had communication issues in my relationships because sometimes I have trouble saying what I’m feeling, other times I’m just not quite as articulate as I’d like to be.

In an effort to be concise, I won’t tell the whole story here. But my relationship of 5 years  ended this week. We got engaged about a year ago, and things kind of fell apart shortly after.

Part of this was because of a big mistake she made and it seems like we just can’t get passed it. But I am not without fault here. I know that my communication issues caused a lot of problems throughout our relationship

I’m curious if therapy would help me with these communication issues, as I don’t want it to continue to negatively impact my job or my (future) relationships? 

I don’t know how to go about this or if I should even be considering it?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!",01Dec2019,1

But after that he asked me if I was being safe and I was like ""yeah I am being a safe as I can be, I use condoms and birth control"" and then he started saying how abstinence is the most safe form and that even using these two, I could be at a risk.

I get this, but he was making me feel really weird by talking about abstinence, when clearly that isn't a choice here. He also asked me how many partners I have had and I told him I've had only one, the guy I am currently in a relationship with.

They called my mother instead of talking to me saying that I didn’t follow their rule of not bringing people over when I was never told this.

Kind of a long story but I’ll keep it short: 
A couple of months ago, Firestone repaired my front right tire. A friend noticed it having issues recently, filled it w air and saw that the tire was manufactured in 2008!! Kept acting weird but I couldn’t take it in until the following business day. On the interstate, it started shaking uncontrollably and wouldn’t allow me to accelerate normally. Was quite terrifying in this metropolitan area. I literally had to turn my flashers on and barely go 30-40mph bc you cannot stop in this area). Brought it to Express ASAP and after inspection, not only noticed the tire was in fact 11 years old (4 years is legally the oldest you can sell for obvious reasons), but also they put it on totally wrong. I’m not a car person so I cannot say the details but I know they messed up the balancing, striped the piece on the tire that fits the lug nut key, AND somehow this ended up screwing up my brakes (I do remember that my rotors were totally warped and in awful condition) and I had to completely replace everything for $550 (at Express) in addition to Firestone ripping me off for the initial $160 for AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD TIRE! Blah blah blah then Express made formal documentation of this (all of which stays attached to my vin, per Express), and printed it for me to bring back to Firestone. 

Where I need help: 
I’m sure it’s state dependent to a degree, but what can I do about this?? Obviously, at bare min., I need a new free tire. But...not only did I spend $550 on new brakes (which I replaced just a few years ago and have been fine up until this), I also need another balance and rotation and I lost half a day of work dealing with this (and it’s still not finished..ugh). I’m not one to come in Full Karen demanding a brand new free car for my inconvenience, but I do feel there needs to be some rectification considering everything + me nearly losing my life (and others!). Got anything? I know nothing about cars but if need be I’ll take my print out and wear my best RBF and see what I can do. I’m a calm and patient person but I’m honestly expecting them to fight me on this so I just want to know what I can do (legally or otherwise), so I can be as well prepared as possible!

714,"A little briefing- 

My ex and I were in a relationship for 2 years, where it became toxic towards the end, and as much as I hate to admit it, I kind of cheated on her with another girl who had a crush on me (i told her about this and we talked it out), during the early phase of our relationship, which later became more serious then toxic. I was a bad person who was possessive, rude and fought on trivial matters.  
She dumped me cold turkey, and I was depressed for over an year and tried to contact her many times, before deciding to let go of her and the guilt.

Now, my ex messaged me last week for the first time in 2 years, saying she's guilty and sorry for breaking up without giving any explanations. I didn't reply.  


Today, my ex called me from some random dude's number (Truecaller says it's a dude) and was reluctant in telling me her name at first, then said it's her, and apologized for breaking up without giving reasons. 

I was freaking out, but held my composure.   


She said that she has had this guilt for a very long time, and really wanted to apologize. I told her it's okay, and apologized as well.

She said that we were young and immature back then, I hmm-ed. She asked if we could meet once, to which I said i don't want to, and said bye, and hung up.  


Now, after an hour, I felt weak and sent her a request on Instagram, which I unsent immediately. She must've noticed and sent me one back, which I accepted and reciprocated.   


She accepted the request, and what I saw shook me beyond heights. She was changed. 110%. She was no more the simple and nice girl I once dated. She seemed like a popular college girl (she left me one year before going to college). 

She was not like this. This change has shook me. So bad. I expected to see the girl I once dated. But there she was, looking like a totally different girl!   


For my own mental peace, I unfollowed her, blocked her, and deleted the Instagram app.  


Now, I don't want to ruin all the progress that I made in these 2 years of moving on, what the hell do I do?",01Dec2019,1

I'm younger, so I'm not necessarily in need of things like kitchen appliances or things like that. I feel like I don't really have hobbies even, so that makes it more difficult. I mean, I like doing art, but I've been super unmotivated with that so I feel like any art supplies I receive will just sit around.

717,"I used to be really close to her up until I was 14, that’s when my grandad died. I remember the Easter after he died it was like 2 weeks after he past away. She drunk too much and she was sick. Ever since then she has steadily been drinking more and more through the years and now she’s an alcoholic. But you can’t say that to her or she will flip out. 

When my grandma died (from my dads side) she gave us all £100 on her death bed for that years Christmas. Then on Christmas Day my £100 had vanished from where I kept my money. I didn’t no it was her at first. She was even helping me try to find it in my bedroom. I found out about 2 weeks later that my other grandma was given £100 on Christmas Day from my mum. So my mum stole it from my bedroom and had the balls to help me look for it. She even offered to give me £100 and I obviously flat out declined her dirty money. Again you can’t mention it, she will just flat out deny it and go crazy, trust me it’s not worth it. But that day was the day that I never loved her like I used to. I’ve even tried to get it to but like subconsciously it’s always there. 

Nowadays she’s constantly trying to impress people and will bend over backwards for them. She keeps buying me all sorts of crap to eat like cookies and stuff. She’s just trying to be nice I don’t no. But it’s like walking on eggshells with her. An argument started from nothing the other week. She ripped her shirt and was screaming, that’s what I mean when I say you can’t say anything. 

My dad has just decided to let her do whatever she wants, drink herself to death and eat all her rubbish. In a way I don’t blame him but it’s my mum I don’t want her to die. But I can’t say anything to her or she flips out and it’s scary as hell. She is actually a nice person like very thoughtful. She’s been shit on all her life and she got raised very badly by my grandma and grandad. But ever since she flipped out then few weeks back living here has been awful. My dad constantly moaning at me about her and she just seems gone. She’s constantly glued to her phone and you can’t gave a conversation with her. It’s like she hates me or something, yet to be honest it should be the other way round.",01Dec2019,1

719,"Basically I was friends with 2 people this guy and this girl. 
(English is not my first language if some sentences don’t make sense I am really sorry) 
This guy and I were really close friends but he started to become extremely toxic.  I mean he really is a self opinionated person, always wants people to agree with him on everything and never lets you speak.  I started  to agree on everything because I was sick and tired debating with him. 
He later started taking drugs and is severely addicted to Xanax alcohol and weed. 
He would always complain about his addiction  but  never did a single thing. Doesn’t go to a psychiatrist and thinks anti depressants are dangerous. But hey using Xanax own your own is less dangerous ( sarcasm on). 
He said I am overreacting and I am the type of person who condemns drug use ( which I don’t ). But I don’t like it when people complain and do absolutely nothing about their situation. It got too extreme .. something went wrong and he would always come to me. 24/7. I
don’t get me wrong I don’t mind when people come to me and talk about their problems but it was just annoying when you listen to the same destructive pattern over and over again. 
He said he is a drug expert and made hard drugs seem not that dangerous. It annoyed me so much. He was explaining me stuff I already knew .. which was so annoying because it made me look dumb. 
He is also friends with this girl, who just likes to party and take dangerous amounts of alcohol. That’s pretty much her life .. hooking up with strangers and getting hammered. 
He told me she is a boring person but always hung out with her and talked shit about her best friend ( who he had sex with).
He said how fucking dumb these girls are. 
I wasn’t really friends with them, I hung out with them only in groups but never liked it when they were with us. 

Now I broke ties with him because his behavior is too toxic for me. I am a very dominant person. I can’t always agree with someone on something or listen to the same self destructive behavior .. I have to say something and I despite it when people don’t respect my opinions. He would always try to take me over 

Apparently yesterday they hung out. They talked shit about me and made me look like the bad person. 
I have 100000 screenshots that prove how much shit he talked about this girl. Should I send it to her ? I don’t wanna take revenge. I think revenge is extremely stupid. I just wanna clear my name ...

Oh and i forgot one toxic trait HE WOULD MAKE FUN of my skills.

720,"Context: 30 year old trans woman, currently not on HRT due to lack of finances/job in Florida.

So in August of this year I lost my job at one of the major theme park companies. I floated by just barely for the next few months trying to find work. The landlord recently sold the house in which I was renting a room and was given the 30 day notice, etc.

I don't really have a lot of options but I'm torn between two paths and could use some outside opinions.

Path 1: I move in with my girlfriend, try to find work and restart things so to speak. I'm only really torn about this because I'm moving into her room which isn't super big and basically would have no space to put anything I own, making me put my computer, TV, etc in the garage unused.

Path 2: I move back to my hometown here in Florida which is about two hours away. My uncle is a warden at a prison in the state with my cousin working at the one in town. I'm fairly confident I'd be able to get a job through my family connections. Obvious downsides to this is having to be away from my girlfriend and living with my grandparents who I am not out to and deal with being misgendered and possibly having to go back into the closet work wise for a time.

I suppose there is an option 3 which is go back north to my parents who are supportive, etc but that would make the distance between my girlfriend and I about 10-11 hours.

A couple days ago she suddenly blocked me on all social media with no explanation, I was shocked and felt like I'd been shot. She gave no reason until I texted her begging for an explanation, she said it was my fault for her relationship problems, and that I should be ashamed of myself for trying to break them up, and that I needed to stop meddling. So she'd had enough of me and didn't want to talk to me anymore.

We've been best friends for over 5 years, we talked every single day and called eachother most days. I have no idea what to do anymore, I don't have many other friends to go to and I feel so lonely. 

I can't believe she's done this in such a cold way with no explanation, basically ghosting me after years. She never gave any hint she felt this way before and never discussed it with me. It was such a shock. 
How do I get over this? I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore, and I miss her so so much. I think her boyfriend has convinced her I'm the problem so he can carry on with his abuse.

Lately I have been struggling greatly in school. Last year I had a hard time but was able to make the cutoff (2.5 GPA to stay in my school).

I am taking tests that I am sure I had done well on and receive my grade which is generally under a 60%. 

Lately I have been getting into cars. I have a fairly old SUV that works for getting me to school and thats about it. I want to buy and work on a car that I can personalize and make it to my liking so I can get into racing and such.

I have been trying to sell my car and have had some people interested but not sold yet and I have but just told that I am not allowed to sell my car because it works just fine and I need to get my grades up before I can even think about it. I have some weird addiction thing I get for all my hobbies where I cannot stop thinking about them, and that is what is happening to me with the car.

730,"My boyfriend’s coworker takes a lot of things. I know she does mushrooms and weed, among other things. Not judging, just some background for you.

He has ADD and has finally found a medication, prescribed by his psychologist, that works for him. It works much better than Ritalin, but he took Ritalin for a few years and still has some left over. It sits in our medicine cabinet and is actually past the expired date, but he keeps it just in case he runs out of his usual medication, in a pinch. That’s the reason we haven’t thrown it out.

He was talking with her over text, helping her with a college paper (she basically asked for him to do the work for her) and she mentioned all of the things she takes, suggests that she could come over and they could do mushrooms or something else together. She knows he takes ADD medication, as he’s friends with and very open with his coworkers in general. She seems to be pushing him to bring the Ritalin to work to give to her. She doesn’t have ADD, etc, it would be for recreational use.

Something about this really bothers me. Is there a chance he could get into any kind of trouble for giving out his prescribed medication, it being expired, etc?
I’m also kind of worried for him because she seems to be a bit of a user and he doesn’t see it at all. Just for more background, she’s married and was asking for him to do the work on her paper while she took a trip with her husband.",01Dec2019,1
731,"Some background information: I was in a 5-month relationship with one guy and after that, a very serious 4-year-relationship with another guy guy. Sorry if this is TMI but I just want to be detailed so the story is understandable: the second guy was 2 years older than me and used my naivety to abuse me emotionally and sexually. I am also very close with my cousin, she is essentially my best friend. We text 24/7.

It was really difficult for me to break up with the second guy who was abusive. It took a lot out of strength and courage especially since we dated for 4 years. However, my cousin didn't even seem that supportive when I broke up with him. She was more mad that he wouldn't be able to drive us places anymore (since he would often drive us to the beach or bring us to parties). She also didn't seem to believe that he was abusive. Whenever I would explain what he did to me, she kinda blew it off and made me feel like I was exaggerating or overreacting.

Anyway, my ex began to snapchat her often about me. He would say things like ""I miss her"" and ""I had a dream about her last night"" and ""I want her back."" She would tell me whenever he said those things, and at first I felt uneasy that she was snapchatting him, but I didn't say anything because I assumed he would stop saying those things to her after he moved on. The thing is, he never stopped and they still snapchat. Sometimes my cousin even tells me that he says ""you're sexy"" to her. I feel so uncomfortable, but for some reason, I'm afraid to confront her. I'm just confused about who to blame... her, him, me? I feel like I'm not 100% over the relationship (I don't miss him, but I am not at the point of not caring when he flirts with my friends/cousin), so I don't know if maybe it's my fault for being upset. I don't even know how to handle this situation. I also feel kinda mad at her for not having the common sense to NOT snapchat him. I feel that is given and I shouldn't have to ask my best friend to stop contacting my ex boyfriend.

Secondly, once my cousin was visiting me from out of town and my friends and I brought her to a small get together. My first ex was there (I hadn't seen him in 2 years). I didn't really talk to him that much, but my cousin did all night. I was kinda upset that him and my cousin talked for two reasons. First, it was my cousin's last night before she went back home (she lives 7 hours from me), and I was upset that all she did was talk to him (a random guy) instead of spending time with me. Second, it was my ex... I know we only dated for 5 months (which was years ago) and hadn't spoken in 2 years... but still. It seems weird that he would flirt with my cousin. But more importantly, why did my cousin just sit there and let my ex flirt with her like that. It was weird. I felt really uncomfortable that he was flirting with my cousin so hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm fucked. Our last PE class I just toughed it out and wore one, and our PE teacher called me out if I was a ""tough guy"" and just answered that I get really cold.

734,"Where to start... I’ve messed up on so many different occasions I don’t even know if I can redeem myself. It all started in my senior year of high school. I was doing wild land firefighting for the summer, but stopped because of school. It was hard work but good money. I didn’t want to drop out and continue it because my whole life I had told myself I’d join the military and now a days you at least need high school diploma for a sure in. So I quit when school came round and started my studies, but around the time I came back home my sister started seeing a girl. She was cute and nerdy. Just my type. Long story short I slept with her and in the process found out she was on hard drugs. Now I was on drugs too (weed and brew), but nothing like crack, meth or anything else. I got angry at her. I didn’t want her to get my little sister addicted too and so I threatened, argued and yelled. I never hurt her physically, but I did a lot of emotional damage. Now when it was all said and done she got her payback. She laced my weed with what I believe was meth and it wasn’t long before I developed schizophrenia. It was scary at first. The voices told me I was a slave in a drug den and I believe them. I graduated but now I knew I could not join the military, because I am a section 8 (crazy). I moved back to my dads and I tried to go to school, but the voices made it hard, I started hanging out with the wrong people and in the process found out alcohol made the voices stop.  I drank. A lot. One drunken night I fell off a trailer and broke the ball that connects hip to thigh off. It was replaced and doc told me I can no longer run or jump or I would need another surgery soon. I moved back to my moms and out of sheer boredom and simply because I believed the voices were real. That their was no hope for me. I started doing meth. I did it for about two years pretty heavily. I never shot up, but I smoked a lot. I can eventually got off it by removing myself from the area in which I found it. Back to dads. I’m abusing some of my medications and hounding my own father for his pain pills. I need to get clean. I need to make my parents proud. I need a better future. My schizophrenia is more manageable now and I no longer believe in the voices. Part of me wonders if it’s not to late to join the military. Just lie about my hip and head and hope they don’t find out, or maybe wildland firefighting again. I looked up hip replacements online and it seems most last ten to fifteen years. I might need another surgery, but surely I can do the military for a few years. I need a solution.

738,"I'm in a university orchestra and at a rehearsal today, I heard someone saying there was a rehearsal on the day of the concert (which is pretty soon) which was news to me.

So, I ask the orchestra manager about this and find it clashes with a mental health appointment I've had arranged a few weeks before this rehearsal, and having never been told about this, turning up to every rehearsal, and my appointment's existence being known to me first, I thought the appointment would take priority (it looks like appointment times tend to be booked out for the next few weeks and if you try to rearrange they won't give you priority. I've also been trying to get help for a little over two months now and don't feel a single person should stop me from trying to get diagnosed and find help I need).

The orchestra manager doesn't think so. They decided to create a brand new orchestral policy on behalf of someone else on the spot which says I must attend this rehearsal or I can't perform in the concert. I found this quite amusing and checked the policies I had to agree to when joining the orchestra and found nothing related to the rehearsal they said, and there was also a full list of rehearsals which doesn't include this new one.

So now I'm awaiting a reply from the person they created the policy on behalf of.

My current thinking is that if I can get the appointment rearranged or the orchestra is happy with my reasoning, I'll play in the concert.

However, if the reply is anything prioritising the orchestra over health, I will simply not tell them anything and not turn up to the concert (there are two of us playing the same part, the other person is better than me and this wouldn't affect the concert in any way).

I dropped off my lovely lady and left the parking lot, behind the lady who cut me off. I was left a voicemail saying she’d left something in my car, so I went back through the parking lot to drop it off. The lady was in front of me. 

There’s the jack in the box next door and I was feeling like getting a buttery jack. Lmao. I went and pulled into the parking lot around the corner from the drive thru, debated on whether I was getting something to eat, then realized I’d left my debit card at home. Pulled out and what do you know, the same lady that cut me off was pulling out of the drive thru behind me. 

She started yelling out her window so I stopped my car in the parking lot for a minute bc I’m petty. She got out of her car, went to my window, and kept on yelling at me. I cracked my window, asked her if she was on drugs (I’m not going to argue with someone who isn’t in their right mind), and she spit in my cracked window into my eye and on my forehead. Then went back to her car and drove off. 

I tried to block her in with my car while I was calling the police, she drove around me, they ended up finding her and she admitted to spitting on me, but also told them I was “inciting fear” by following her around and blocking her in. When, in actuality, when the last instance happened, I was the one in front of her?? And told them I was blocking her car. Which, I tried to, but she went around me anyways since my car is smol. 

Now the police are telling me I can press charges, but they can also arrest me for blocking her in a parking lot and trying to incite fear. And they told me that there are a lot of cameras at that location, so I do know they can find out what actually happened (her spitting on me, screaming at me, me trying to block her car in).

We were fighting (now with hindsight more because of me than her) and in the middle of that fight we took a ""break"". On that break I met someone else, we'll call her Nicole. Because of my anger and frustration with my current relationship, and the loneliness of the break I started talking to Nicole and we hit it off.

She is from Toronto and I at the time was living in Pennsylvania but we visited each other back and forth (about a 6 hour drive). Now she had this plan to move to western Canada and I had just left my other life behind so we decided to embark on this journey together. She came down to Pennsylvania for 2 weeks and we built out a van to take an epic cross country road trip together. Then one night...she looked at my phone. I had just sent my ex a text giving her my new address and telling her where she could ship my stuff that she still had. Then told her I hoped all was well.

Nicole flipped, I came inside to her yelling at me that I was a liar and was cheating on her etc. etc. After calming her down and explaining exactly what the texts were for I explained that I was in turn livid she didnt trust me and even took that as far as going through my phone. Big red flag for me. This caused a lot of turmoil as we finished the van and I was doubting the relationship but felt I had an obligation to at least get her west considering that's what I had promised.

Fast forward through a tumultuous road trip and 100 fights later and in sitting in our room in Canada, van won't start, no paychecks coming until mid December (I work online) totally and utterly lost. I'm depressed and cant see a way out of this, I just need some reassuring words or advice. These last 6 months I've proven I have a black belt in self sabotage and I just want to do something right.

TL:DR broke up with the love of my life and drove across the country and into canada with someone new...and I dont want to be here or with her anymore. I have a black belt in fucking up my own life and I feel terrible.",01Dec2019,1

A few days ago I found her through my recommendations on Instagram. I texted her and I asked if she wants to get in touch again and she responded that she does.

Welp, I'm ~~kinda~~ socially awkward and at the beginning of conversations I usually don't know what to talk about.

I don't really remember much of what she likes and dislikes because my memory is _really_ bad and after two years it could have changed anyways.

749,"I am a manager in a high street shop and I'm having issues with an employee that is extremely smelly. I'd describe this as a smell that is from general untidiness; from not showering, not washing clothes, not brushing your teeth... Think homeless. Her clothes are visably stained and creased. 

Other colleagues have complained about this as well customers saying they will not be returning due to the smell.
I have spoken with the employee in a kind manner asking if there are any underlying issues or health problems I should be aware of. She asured me there are no health issues and she  agreed that she has a stench. However she continues to make no changes.

In addition her contract states that when showing up for work you need to be ""neat, clean and groomed"" as part of the uniform.

750,"Hello,

Currently I'm at a crossroad. I may go back to college next year but I'm really considering the music path. I absolutely can't stand college classes and music is my passion. I'm 18 and currently living at home recording everyday for my band. But they're all at university, and we can't play much together anymore. I don't want to toot my own horn, but I have a really good voice and can sing live really well. I've been told by a good deal of people I really have something special; however I don't want that to inflate my ego enough to make this significant life decision. So my question is this: How do I go about starting a music career? I don't care about the money (obviously I need some source of income which I have), and if I were to make just enough to get by I'd do it in a second.

Regret is my biggest fear. I don't want to look back at myself in some desk job years from now wondering what could've happened if I took this chance. Advice is hugely appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read this.

754," 

I've been having a hard time this year with a lot of unfortunate events and have been going through terrible anxiety and depression which have left me struggling to get back on my feet and back into the work force. My friend (23F) knows my situation, and she's in the middle of planning her wedding. My dog is currently going through heart failure and i'm spending a crazy amount of my savings on all of the vet bills and medication. Anyway my friend always remembers my birthday but it slipped her mind this year. She only drops by to see me for 5 minutes at a time usually since she's so busy. She wanted to come over and do a bunch of baking so I went a long with it. Problem is she only bought the cheap ingredients then left me to pay for the more expensive stuff while she chose the recipes. Then she ditched me when they were ready with the whole mess of my kitchen. She asked me to buy her something as a favor and she would pay me back. She came over to pick up the item but ""forgot her wallet"" and said she'd get me next time. She's done that so many times for little things here and there and ""forgets"" to pay me back. Now she keeps mentioning she wants me to attend her bachelorette party thats abroad and all of the bridesmaids are expected to pay her portion. I already said yes to being a bridesmaid months ago out of pressure but now I'm just feeling annoyed because I feel like i'm being taken of advantaged/expecting too much when she knows i'm not working. I just don't feel like participating in all of these bridal events when it feels like i'm not even a priority. Am I in the wrong for feeling like dropping her as a friend?

TL;DR Friend has been neglecting me while busy planning her wedding and feels like she takes advantage of my kindness/weak spirit. Going through depression and unemployed and don't want to drop money I don't have on my friends wedding activities.

760,"Stuck with this and I really don't know how to move forward. My friend has really bad depression, constantly ""joking"" about it and making Facebook posts seemingly poking fun about it. Recently she posted a picture of herself holding her cat with the caption ""so happy."", typed out exactly like that. I have confided in a mutual friend who isn't on Facebook and doesn't see these posts, I really think she is crying out for help and I feel like I am the only one who sees this (I can't possibly be the only one).

​

A little back story: About two years ago I went through a VERY dark time and pretty much cut off all contact with just about everyone I knew. Right before I did this my friend broke up her boyfriend and sent me a message on Messenger telling me that she loves me and always has. I completely ignored the message, I convinced myself that she didn't really mean it and that if I responded she would just mock me. I also ignored it since if she was serious and I made a move I would just do something stupid and ruin both a relationship and what I considered to be my best friendship. After about a tear and a half I started to reconnect with my friends (two of them successfully, including the subject of this post) and I am now having trouble moving things forward again. In our first meeting she commented that I lost a lot of weight (50 pounds woohoo), and asked if it was ""crippling depression"" like it was with her.

​

Back to present time: I really do have strong feelings for this woman, every day I regret not responding to her message. Right now it hurts that I have no idea how to help her. Besides our mutual friend I don't know any of her other friends that I can reach out to to find out if anyone else has noticed anything. I've only met her boyfriend once so I don't feel comfortable bringing up anything with him. I am also having trouble telling if I only want to help because of my feelings for her, or if I only think I have feelings for her because of how much I want to help her. I also am deathly afraid of pushing her away by talking to her too much, and also by not talking to enough.

​

This whole thing is messed up for me since I have so little experience being social. My work schedule doesn't allow me to go out during week nights, and I have my daughter just about every single weekend leaving me with about three hours a week of real social time. In the end all I want is to make sure that my friend is okay and I have no idea how to do so.

Sorry if this seems to jump around, stream of thought and all that.",01Dec2019,1

763,"Mmm... so a year ish ago, my dad came back to my life. He came with two new childrens and a girlfriend. They are nice, the kids are a little be naughty but I don't hate them and we sometimes do things together (mostly, me having to take care pf them and doing preescolar activities as they are below 5yo ). I noticed, that my dad treats myy brother and I different from our stepsiblings, he's more strict with the kids. I'm not sure of if it has always been like this or maybe it's since he is here.

So two or one hour ago, my little stepbrother (4yo) came crying to me and told me that my dad hurt him. I thought that it was the normal slap or hit and that it wouldn't be anything really serious (we are chinese and my dad is the old school dad, even if I told him that it's not good), but then he told me that he was hit by a cable multiple times just because he didn't know to say ""eye"" (they just came here and the kids don't really know how to talk the local idiom), my stepbrother is a slow student and the methods that my dad use to teach aren't really the best :/. I talked to my dad and had an argument, but he never listens to me. What I was more surprised about is that I was actually scared when I saw him. The rest is the bs he always tells me.

It's not that I'm trying to give my dad a reason to be like this, but he's actually a good dad, he goes to activities with his kids, he cares for them and all that. It's only that a lot of things happened and I thing that he's overwhelmed or maybe all the things that happened changed him. It's been a lot of time since I saw him, because he got divorced with my mother and after really big arguments my dad stopped coming because my mum wouldn't let him approach us, she usually got mad if she knew that we have been seeing him. And I don't know what to do :/ I'm planning to not go to school tomorrow and stay with my stepbrother just to be sure he's ok, I already told my brother about it, he's my same age.

A little background story, my weight has fluctuated throughout my pre teens, teens and young adulthood. Pre-teen i was very very heavy and was teased alot for it and was very self conscious of my weight, but then i got really tall and skinny, and remain pretty skinny to this day.

Now, i have never been on a diet, never made myself vomit after eating to make myself not hold the food, nor do i think im massively overweight.

Every time i am unwell (vomiting/ diarrhoea) i get super happy, i hope to myself that the sickness lasts a long time, because it makes my stomach extra flat.

I also have TRIED but been unsuccessful at making myself vomit, ive tried with my fingers and various ways i have googled online to do this but failed.

I think to myself, if i could physically make myself vomit, that i would definitely be bulimic, no question about it, i’d love to be able to make myself vomit after eating to achieve a flat stomach, but i don’t, because i cant.

What i really want to know is, is this considered an eating disorder even though i don’t make myself vomit (only because i am unable to), and don’t think im crazy fat, but id love to be skinnier?

766," After finishing High School in 2016, I started going to Trident Tech for an Associate's degree. I went for a Media Production degree, and started with the Film Production career path because at the time it sounded interesting. However, I switched over to TV and Media production path because at the time I was interested in sound and audio, and this path had more classes relative to that. Those few classes weren't very interesting, and my interest in audio as a career dimmed a bit. Because of the change in classes, I took around 3 years instead of 2 to finish the degree (i just finished all my classes, and am finishing up an Audiovisual internship before i get my degree). The thing is, my final class was Film As Art, and it REALLY got me more interested into film as an artform. I feel like I would enjoy doing film as a career, but because the majority of my classes were focused on TV/News/Media, I have no idea where to go. I started out college doing a few film classes like Lighting, but the majority of my classes were focused on radio, editing, etc. Since i wasn't very focused on film during my classes, I never really networked or tried to make anything. Meanwhile all of my fellow students have tried stuff out. There was an Indie Grants film being made on our campus, and we had an opportunity to sign up to work on it. However, at the time I was busy with my first school internship and other things, so I admittedly fell through on applying. My time at school is pretty much over, I have no experience in filmmaking besides the basic knowledge I was given in my classes, and Im worried about my future career.  I could start out working in TV/media, since that's the bulk of my teaching, but even what I was taught there was pretty basic too. I read about directors like Scorsese and others, and they all started out networking with classmates in school and making short films. I feel like I fucked myself over by being too shy, or not really knowing what I wanted to do at the time.  I really don't know what to do and I'm pretty nervous. I should add that the school wasn't too expensive, Im lucky that my parents paid for the majority of my classes and I paid for the last year. I'm pretty sure that I have no debt, but that still doesn't alleviate my worries. What should I do?",01Dec2019,1

For one of my courses I have a semester long project. To start we were supposed to have 5, while others have 6 people in our randomly assigned project. One person has never acknowledged us in our group and we made it clear to the professor so thats that. 

It seemed like myself and the other 3 were getting along fine and I felt that this would be the one group project where people actually split up the work and hold their own.

The project is due this Thursday and I have my entire portion done, one person in my group did about 25% of their portion, and its clearly sloppy and hopefully not plagiarized. The others don't really respond in the group chat and are starting to make me feel like I'm going to end up being the one in the group to do the entire thing. 

Throughout the semester we had to do 'weekly project updates' and the entire class was lying and just putting something down for credit. 

I'm scared to bring up to my professor that they're not doing anything because I hate dealing with confrontation with group members and we have been lying about progress on the weekly updates. I have finals, another project, and an internship interview this week; as well as work on top of that.

It'ss kind of hard to explain, but her Flo period tracker app estimated that she was ovulating the day before, which could mean she could be ovulating any time around these couple of days. If she was ovulating yesterday, or the day before yesterday, or today, would the Plan B still work to prevent a pregnancy? Everything online pretty much says that if you take it within 72 hours you have a good chance of preventing pregnancy, so does that mean as long as she takes it within 72 hours, even if she was ovulating, that it would be effective at preventing pregnancy?",01Dec2019,1

I kinda expected that maybe after some time apart we would get back together. But idk if she has moved on and if I should as well.

I work at a company that offers ok pay right now, but kind of crap medical. Like, 300+$ a month with a 7000$ deductible. My fiance got denied medi-cal coverage and she's got quite a few medical problems that have to be addressed. Recently, they took her off disability because she's ""disabled, but can work some hours so therefore not ellible.""
Which, ok, but now she doesn't get medicare which was treating the disability enough for her to find work ya doofs.

Rant aside, we need medical we can actually use. We make just enough for Covered CA to not be able to help, and I was thinking of just picking up a 2nd job again to get medical.

Normally he comes over to my house on Thursdays after work and I hang out with him for a few hours before sending him on his way. Normally we play video games or watch some TV. I don't mind hanging out with him some since he doesn't really have any friends and has a rough home life. This has been our arrangement for the better part of a year. 

Occasionally on the weekends she'll send him over here without asking (likely because I usually say I'm busy). Usually when this happens I just let him in, welcome him, and let him play games or whatever while I go about my day and do laundry or work on my PC or whatever. Shes does this maybe twice a month. 

Idk what to do as I've never been in this position before. When he comes over uninvited should I let him in or tell him I'm busy? If I let him in should I hang out with him or go on about my day?

789,So I was in a 3 1/2 year relationship with my ex boyfriend. We were madly in love I’m still in love with him till this day. But we had issues and in the end he broke up with me for them. So 9 months later we reconnected and slept with each other a couple of times. Meanwhile he has a gf he just started dating not too long ago and admitted to only getting into a relationship with her because he thought I was in one which I never was since we’ve been broken up. He says he loves her but isn’t in love with her because he’s still in love with me. How he doesn’t see a future with her. Yet he doesn’t want to break up with her because she does things for him he wishes I did in the relationship. So he’s recently texted me like he can’t do this with me anymore and cut me off completely. A part of me wants to message the new gf and let her know how her new perfect bf played both of us. I’m not sure if that will come to bite me in the ass one day because I still want to be with this man. What should I do ? Should I take the high road and see how it plays out ?

I visited these sites months ago and I decided I did not want to find a sugar daddy or anything of that sort it just isn’t me. I just continue to get the spam emails from the website about how new people await me and such but I just simply delete them and pass them by like they don’t exist because I never went through with using the website. My family is making a scene about all of this even when I try to explain that yes I visited the site but I decided not to continue using it and get involved in anything telling me that I’m an awful person and I have issues acting like I used the website and say found a sugar daddy or something.

And I believe that's why I usualy put people's desires before me.

My friends have already told me that I shouldn't be pleasing everyone everytime, that I should take care of myself too, I believe also that that's why I fall in love way too fast, because I'm craving for love, from both a romantic partner and friendship. I believe I'm craving love from others because I have no self-love for myself, and I want to actively change that, I want to live my life, I can be a good guy without pleasing everyone, I should be able to say NO when I don't want to, I want to love myself, I want to be loved for who I am, not because I please them everytime.

My teeth are not great. I am a smoker and have not taken proper care of my teeth, so I have receding gums in some places, cavities I’m sure, sensitivity and  two of my back molars are just rotting away. My lymph nodes under my jaw swell frequently and I’m sure it’s from an infection in my mouth. It’s disgusting and I am so self-conscious about this already. 

I am worried about number one being judged by the dentist and having them make snarky remarks or just being rude in general, my previous experience with dentists shows me this is how they are.

Second I am scared it is going to be extremely expensive to get needed work done or that I have mouth cancer or something horrible that can’t be fixed. Again logic is out the window on this one, even knowing if something is wrong it’s better to go now than it is to continue to procrastinate.

805,"Okay, so I have this friend who ive known since middle school. Me and him were very close up until about a year and a half ago. I feel pretty guilty for this but I was the kid who introduced my friend group to pot or weed in my freshman year of high school. It started off as something that was ""crazy"" and ""insane"", but nowadays (were all seniors now) we just smoke once in a while and dont really bug out. My friends and I never really had a ""problem"" with smoking pot, the most I would smoke was like 2 or 3 times a week, and i smoked the most out of everyone. That same summer we tried smoking, one of my other friends started using a juul (I know now that that shits terrible for your body and i had a little problem myself but i quit while i was ahead). With using juuls came with some of my friends getting addicted to nicotine, one of them being the friend that im about to talk about. Im gonna keep it anonymous and not use a name but this person has been using nicotine ever since then and has gone through a juul, a myle, two novos, and a nord (all are vaping devices). I was with him when he said he quit nicotine forever and i recorded him throwing his device and the vape juice in a lake. That worked for 3 weeks and he has been buying disposable vapes since then and says that he isnt addicted anymore, which everyone knows is bs. A huge problem that my friend group had to deal with is he started driving drunk, which is a BIG problem in my book. So for you to get the whole picture im gonna need to explain this, my parents have an open door policy with me. They let me go to parties and they know i smoke sometimes and theyre okay with it because if anything happens where i need help or one of my friends do, i will call them and theyll be able to help us. Whenever we would go to a party my parents would let us crash at my house, as long as one of us was a D.D, and if they were available they would. My parents do this so nobody drives drunk or high for obvious reasons. At the last party we went to, we all got pretty trashed because it was halloween, and one of my friends was our D.D. After we got home, we were all just chillin around my house and that one friend was sipping on vodka and sprite, right before he just wanted to leave. My parents were asleep at this point so they couldnt hear us arguing on my porch. We told him that it wasnt a good idea to drive and that it pisses us off when he does this (leaving peoples houses when he's supposed to stay has became one of his habits). He then told us ""yeah, but i dont really give a fuck"" and drove off, he got home fine, but the disrespect to my family and my friends still annoys us. Another instance was at my other friends house when we all drank and he said he wouldnt. I was too out of it to notice but multiple people said that he drank the rest of someones 4 loco before right before leaving. He also left peoples houses high but i cant tell all of those stories because this is long enough as is. We sat him down and talked to him about how we dont want him driving drunk anymore and he said something along the lines of ""stop caring about me, itll be easier for me that way"" or something like that. Now he finds excuses to not hang out with us and when he does its to buy another vape or he hangs out just to smoke and then leave. My friends are talking about kicking him out of the friend group because he doesnt seem to care about us anymore. I know it sounds selfish but this past friday me and my friend got into a car crash and he didnt even say anything when we sent pictures of the car and everyone was asking if we were okay. My friends think its about time to axe him from the friend group, and im on the fence, how should i go about dealing with this?",01Dec2019,1
806,"The title gives you a basic idea. On mobile, apologies in advance.

When I say my body is broken, I do not mean I am paralyzed or anything of that sort. When I say it is broken, I mean that I am living with the body of an elderly person. I am in never-ending pain. My back has been in a constant 7 on the pain scale since I started my teen years. I never have relief unless I smoke weed or drink and then I can forget about it until I sober up (I am not addicted to either vice and I am trying my hardest not to become reliant on them). I do not know what is the cause of this pain other rban it is most likely because I am overweight. It feels as if my nerves are being pinched at all times but, as I said, I don’t know for certain.

I wake up to work my overnight job and have to wake up earlier than needed because I can barely move when I first wake up. The pain in my back is spreading to my legs, feet and neck. I can’t walk on one foot when I first get up because it hurts to put any weight on it. I cannot sleep on my back without getting stuck and having to call my brother or my dad to come help me move.

This physical pain is affecting almost every aspect of my life. My mental state is already in shambles, I cannot sleep, this pain is affecting my ability to work hard, it’s affecting my social life, it’s affecting my sex life (to me it is), it’s affecting my ability to care for my pets the way they should be cared for.

To top this pain off, I sleep on a broken bed frame and mattress that is older than I am. I’ve slept on mattresses older than me my entire life. For a time, one that I had was at least 3x my age. It would be easier to just throw the frame away and sleep on the floor but guess what? There’s a couple mice I cannot get rid of no matter what I try.

My mental state has been in ruin for years. It’s so incredibly easy to hide it all behind a bubbly personality and a smile. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and then was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my early teen years. All of these conditions are going untreated simply because I can’t afford it even if my dad’s medical insurance covers most of it.

I’m suicidal. I am not hurting myself and stopped doing so (scratching myself was the go-to) years ago because I didn’t see a point in hurting myself if it didn’t fix anything. But if all I had to save myself from a potentially fatal accident was swerve out of the way, I probably would have to think about whether I should or not.

Some days are better than others. And maybe I’m lucky that I have more good days than really bad days. My friend group is a very good support system. My best friend is my whole world because she is the best person I’ve ever met. My boyfriend is one of the kindest people and has made me incredibly happy in the almost year I’ve known him. I love my job and I love my family. But it doesn’t stop me from thinking awful things and crying myself to sleep when I’m alone.

My friends, my best friend, my boyfriend and my family have no idea about most of this. They all know about my mental illnesses and sometimes have seen me in a low point (I hate crying or getting sick in front of my boyfriend because I don’t want to be a burden on him having to deal with me).

I don’t know what to do to even begin finding that light at the end of the tunnel. I thought I could see it for a time, but now, I can’t find it.

809,"TLDR: cut friends out because of awkwardness in my relationship and am trying to earn my trust back. 

This is a long one. In high school (4 years ago) I (21M) had a small group of friends with another guy and two girls. During this time I developed very strong feelings for one of the girls and the other girl developed feelings for me. It never ended up working out for any of us and we all moved to college but kept in touch. Fast forward a year and I met a girl who I quickly began a relationship with, she knew about my history with these old friends and told me it made her uncomfortable that we talk all the time considering our past. I agreed and told them that I needed space because it was impacting my relationship. Years passed and I very relevantly broke up with my now ex. Soon after the old friend I had feelings for reached out to me and we all met up for thanksgiving break and hung out. It was fun but I could tell that some people in that friend group resented me slightly for ghosting them for so long. I understand but here’s the problem: after spending just one day with them I very quickly developed the same feelings for the old friend that I had in the past and I know that she felt some of the same feelings. I decided that I should tell her how I feel and see what she thinks, she responded with a sense of excitement but also confusion and said she needed time to think, after a day she got back to me and told me that she would rather stay friends because she feels like she can’t trust me given how easily I stopped being her friend and cut her out. She knows the pressure I was going through and understands my actions but still can’t trust me. She is also afraid that I see her as just a crush and can’t fully appreciate her friendship. I understand, it is just a shame because we both make eachother laugh non stop and really enjoy each others time.

While she did work with me, we became close pretty quickly and were also pretty flirty with one another, especially physical things like tickling and her touching my face and it got to the point where our coworkers would jokingly say that we were dating, and we would go along with the joke, saying that we're madly in love.

A while ago we were talking about how I have a work party coming up and I was saying that I hate how she wouldn't be there since she doesn't work with me anymore. And then she said she would have loved to have seen drunk me, so I suggested we just go out for drinks sometime, her and I. So we ended up setting it up for Thursday this week.

Thing is though, I'm not entirely sure if this is a date. My intention was just to spend time with her cos I sincerely do love and miss her company, but I would be lying if I said I wouldn't mind if we ended up flirting and getting romantic.

I personally feel left out, but (Im not?) 

Ive been in England for 5 years, completely fluent, Im open and not shy and I luckily get along with everyone I like.

I study Graphic design, and I work making coffees on the weekends.

 I have a small group of collegues that I have a lot of fun with and we go to the pub every two weeks to talk and have a laugh. 

Theyre all girls but one, but he left and we only see him in the pub night.

I got really close to this girl which I ended up really liking, we went out on a date for a whole day and constant texting and after all of that she said she wasn't looking for anybody at this moment (shes going away for her studies for a few months)  

We still talk, I know we like eachother but theres that barrier of commitment which I understand, so I dont push anything since she said no even though Id really want to.

So theres that which I think is driving all this emotion of lack of ""love"", I personally don't have any friends like I used to have in Spain, but because I didnt grew up here.

And here I am in my fucking bed :) I love talking/texting but everyone seems to be super busy or they dont use their phones as much as I do and I feel left out since no one asks how I am or anything, only my mum and honestly I love her but I feel I need to hear it from other than my family.

829,"Im \[20 F\] sorry for the long post in advance.

So here is my situation. 

I have been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. I thought my way of going about life was normal and that everybody lowkey really meant it when they said school made the want to die (to my surprise this is not the case for most lol)

I'm pleased to say i finally realized that i needed help and that i went about getting the proper treatment with antidepressants and medication for ADHD.

Although, being put on this medication has been so great and has really had some positive effects, i have found that adjusting to them is extremely straining on my body. I find that i'll be up all night and will fall asleep in the AM making it very difficult to attend morning classes. I've desperately tried to reset my internal clock by taking some days of medication but have found that it renders me unable to function or really do anything. this has ultimately caused me to be unable to finish some assignments for my classes. I've talked to my doctor about my concerns but he assured me that the medication will take some time to adjust to.

Here's my problem.

I'm in my Final year of college and may be flunking a course meaning i'll be graduating a full year later since this is the only semester said course is offered. This would require me to fork over a huge amount of money for a semester of school solely for this one class.

The class in question is heavy on assignments and i missed a bunch of them due to my attempt to adjust to my medication. The assignments i have handed in have always been given grades around 80%-90% so i have no doubt that i know my stuff. However, because of these missed assignments I have been given a couple zeros which have really f\*cked up my overall grade in the class :(

I would really like to email my professor but i have no idea what to tell her as it's basically the end of the semester and the class has no final exam so i have no other opportunities to bring my grade up. Any advice on what i could say in the email  to improve my chances of being granted a pardon? I'd be willing to hand in the missed assignments now but i feel like i'd have to preface my handing them in with an email outlining my circumstances since so much time has passed since the day they were due.

please help\~

831,"I F[18] have from a very young age always had relatively bitter relationship with my younger sisters F[15] &amp; F[15]. Although I have never considered it abnormally tens. I always regarded our fights as normal sibling fights, even though they sometimes were physical. My sisters are twins and I was always secretly jealous of their bond. I practically have no chance of ever getting a sisterly bond with anyone because of them being twins and kind of always excluding me. I know it sound like I’m still bitter about it, but I honestly am not. Already around the age of 10 I stopped caring about it, but the fights kept on going since we at this point were permanently bitter towards each other. I know that this in all sense is my fault, since I was the jealous one, but I was also just a young child when I started teasing them. The last two years I’ve stopped caring about fights, because I honestly got so sick of it and there is literally no point. Of course I have realized that I started the whole ordeal in the first place, so I have started being quite kind and friendly towards my sisters. One of them has warmed up to me, and even though we’re not that close, we respect and trust each other. 

However the other twin has continued being mean to me, and for a while I fully thought I deserved it. However now the fights are 99% one sided, from my sister. And it’s honestly causing her a lot of problems, because my parents are always yelling at her for being mean to me. I feel like my parents are a little bit protective of me because I am a lesbian and also quit weird. It’s almost like they think I get more effected by her mean words because I’m kind of an outsider in the small town we live in. The insults range from threatening to kill me, to saying that my face is disgusting, to saying that I talk weird etc. We ask what she is justifying her behavior with, and she says that I am bullying her, but in all sense I stopped teasing her at least a year ago, and I have also apologized for my earlier behavior.  I asked her if I am bullying her just by existing and she said yes. 

Sometimes her words really hurt my feelings, and I already struggled with a bad self image. Other times I find them quite comical. For a while her behavior has really confused me.

Today my sister (the bitter one) told my mom that me and my friend once chased her and pulled down her pants when we were in elementary school (I was probably around 12). I am in shock. I can absolutely not remember this happening, which makes it even worse. The truth is that we were quite mean and physical towards each other at that time, and me being the oldest one meant that I,for a while, was in the power position. During this time I would also consider myself a relatively mean child and I definitely showed bully tendencies towards other children as well, despite being the “weird one” at my school. Now I’m spiraling because I know that this might have happened, even though I honestly can’t remember it at all. As I have become a legal adult I have learnt a lot about sexual harassment and psychological bullying, especially during the me-too movement. I would NEVER do something like this today, and it disgusts me that I might have done it in the past. I am afraid that I might have heavy traumatized my poor sister. 

Idk how to react and I don’t even know how to phrase all the questions in my mind, I just want to make things normal between me and my sister and I desperately need some advice.

(btw nothing more happened than us pulling down her pants (and maybe her underwear idk), we probably just laughed and went away, although I know that might be extremely traumatizing as well)",01Dec2019,1
832," My best friend met this girl in late August. She came on incredibly strong and he fell for her really fast. To be honest, he was kind of an incel before he met her and he seemed to think she was out of his league. Everything was going great, according to him. It was nice on my part too because he used to game 24/7, have his loud ass friends over for card games, and would never leave the apartment( he works from home too) until he met her. I've only met her like 3 or 4 times... I realized she was a little out there when I spent one on one time with her. That being: very aggressive, ie: flipping everyone off in traffic, screaming out the window at people, starting fights... I'm a workaholic so thankfully, I don't have to spend tons of time with her. She's also super allergic to his dogs so she cannot come by the apartment for more than an hour at a time. But to him, she was this super sweet, gentle, ""can never do any wrong"" angel. I figured after the honeymoon stage she would show her true self to him and they would split.

Anyway, so early Oct. I found positive pregnancy tests in the trash can. Apparently, she told him she cannot have kids so neither parties were using protection. My roomie was super ecstatic about being a dad etc. He wants to marry her, the whole 9 yards. Ever since they found out she was pregnant, she totally showed her true self to him and blames it on ""hormones"". They constantly fight. I found out my roommate was put on a ""probationary period"" at work because he's used up all of his PTO and then missed additional days of work hanging out with her. (She doesn't work.) He also expressed concern because she was upset that she had to stop talking to guys she used to mess around with and I guess used to ""do stuff"" for money. She swears she's clean though and he said he ""trusts her"" so he's not getting checked either.... When friends confronted him about their concerns he lashed out at them.

She moved back in with her parents after breaking the lease with her roommate because \*Surprise, surprise\* they fought so often. She's not letting him go to doctors visits and in a way, is shutting him out from baby stuff. He even mentioned that her parents told her to be nicer to him in front of him and acted like that was the sweetest thing because that meant ""they like him"". Well, when they argue over text or phone calls, he gets mad at me and yells at me. I've seen the texts he sends her and ""submissive"" is an understatement. This guy is a doormat to her.

A few weeks ago, he asked me for advice because they were fighting over baby names. I told him to tell her (not ask her) that he was getting a baby book and she can highlight the names that she likes and then he will highlight the names he likes in another color. Apparently she didn't like that idea because in a way that still meant ""no"" to her name so she went off on him. In return he started screaming at me ""why do I ask you anything?!"" etc.

On Tuesday, things were okay at the apartment. He came home and they immediately started text/arguing whatever. He was asking me for advice and I declined. He asked why I wasn't helping him and I asked him why he never stands up for himself and why he is mean to me instead. He said 'because I know you won't leave me."" He said that because I'm a commitaphobe, I don't understand relationships. I haven't talked to him much since and he's tried sending me videos of his dogs , and said ""happy thanksgiving""while I was gone to visit family for the thanksgiving weekend.

This morning when I got in, I had to go into the office but I stopped at the apartment to pick up my gym clothes for afterwards. He was gaming so I didn't want to disrupt him. As soon as I left, he sent me this text ""Hey buddy, you seem distant. Is everything okay?"" I have not replied.  
I feel so used etc. I don't know what to do. The lease is up in March and I plan on getting my own place because I have a feeling she's the crazy type and I don't want to burn bridges with him but slowly fade away. How do I do that?",01Dec2019,1
833,"I need some serious help with this one. Don't quite know what my problem is but I feel like my heart is crushed and I just want him back.

I'll call the guy Tim, and I'll be straightforward and say he's an asshole. We were friends for years before he told me he had feelings and we made out a bunch of times. We never ended up ""together"" in the way that I hoped for. What happened instead was a sort of FWB situation in which he would treat me like a pal until he was horny at 2 am and then he would beg to go to my room.

I was struggling with a lot of things at this time, one of them being the pressure to lose my virginity to Tim despite what I perceive as my inherent aversion to sex. I wanted to be with him and it was fun for me at times but I think I was putting up this filter to cope with my discomfort. Things went on like this for months and I started to feel really awful about everything.

All of this fear and insecurity came out one random night when he asked me to blow him, I said I didn't really want to, and he asked again so I said yes. I froze up and almost cried (who knows why) and he was frustrated. I decided to go home instead of just staying the night even though he only wanted to cuddle after that. He walked me to my car and told me that we couldn't go out because we'd end up hating each other, and since then I've hardly interacted with him.

I dated another guy very briefly (let's call him Rob) and he took my virginity on our first date before cheating on me with my best friend and never talking to me again.

I feel like I'm at a new personal low. I let Rob do what he wanted whether I wanted it or not because I had lost respect for myself and I felt like I wasn't in control of it anyway. So Rob fucked me over, and I had to deal with the consequences as the friend who had slept with him him fell in love with him and got her heart broken.

Meanwhile I want Tim back because I miss our friendship. I don't care anymore if he wants to go out with me but every time I see him he's so cold toward me and it hurts like hell. I feel traumatized by our last interaction and I don't know how to cope with it so I want to restore what we had before. I know I can't and I need to find new people. It just hurts and I feel so used by everyone that I wish none of it had happened.",01Dec2019,1
835,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a student working part time at a small retail store. It's not part of a big chain or anything, just a small, privately owned business. My uncle is one of the stakeholders, and that is how I got the job. The pay isn't great, but I am a student, and I need the cash, so I won't complain.

&amp;#x200B;

Like most places, we have a fixed hourly rate. Salary = No. of hours per month\*Salary. Simple.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my co-workers went back home during his uni holidays. And as I had my holidays as well, I was asked to cover his shifts. Well and good. On the 29th of November, we received our salaries. The next morning, he messaged me and asked me to send a photograph of our time-sheet (we use a calendar to write the number of hours we worked on the day, and at the end of the month, the hours are added up and we get paid).

&amp;#x200B;

That day, after I went home, I decided to just add up my total hours and see what I got paid. After comparing it with my bank account statements, I realised I was paid nearly $200 less. The next day, I photographed the records for the month of October and September. For October, I found that I was once again paid \~ $200 less. For September, however, I was paid nearly $500 less than what I should have gotten. 

&amp;#x200B;

My direct correspondence is with my uncle, who manages the store I work at. I haven't been in contact much with the other partners, as I don't really know them. What I do know is that one of those partners is in charge of the accounts side, and they look after the salaries and stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to jump the gun and start blaming them straight up.I am gonna talk to my uncle about this first, but I don't know what else I can do.  I wanna know what the exact problem is. Although, once this debacle is solved, I no longer intend to work here.

May i ask your opinion on the following, please. 

For 5 years, i had a guy best friend. We live far away from each other. When i visited him the last time, i successfully pushed the limits of this friendship. I have confessed my feelings towards him and he said that this is the first time he had feelings for a girl and that he never thought he would get these feelings one day. He promised to visit me soon. 
One week later, when we were apart from each other, doubts started to unearth. He suddenly was not sure. He mentioned that we are not really compatible, that issues may arise with his family, and lately the fact that he has is not capable of feeling emotions. 

The past 5 months, he never called me. He initiated once a conversation by text messages. Im the only one initiating conversations regularly. He generally replies but ignores me for hours. 

I have told him that if he wishes only friendship, this is fine with me and that myself, after having been treated this way, i do not feel like having a relationship with him at the moment. He does not seem to believe it and he is wondering how we can come back as friends again after the very short lived relationship.

What if she thinks I'm trying to pry into her personal life? I'm genuinely not, I just want to let her know that I hope she's doing all right since you know the text she sent me implied that she isn't 

Is it weird to being up a text she sent a whole week ago? I just haven't had the chance to see her recently.

Is this a good thing to do, to ask a friend how she is doing since a text she sent you seemed like she was going through something? Or should I not do it? I just want to show that I care is all. I mean, people *do* do that, right? Check up on friends every now and then? That's not weird, right?

Why am I like this?",01Dec2019,1

864,"The whole problem started under difficult circumstances and led to something we did not expect.

This summer, mom \[41F\] and dad ended up in a babysitter dispute. Our ordinary babysitter Jenny \[26F\] also worked as a substitute in various schools, while also working as a babysitter for my family, taking care of my little sister.

This time she was about to work in a summer school during the whole summer, which meant she couldn't babysit during the months of June until September.

Dad suggested hiring a new babysitter, but mom refused, she thought it was not nice to Jenny because she's worked with us for almost 2 years and that it's not loyal of us to fire her and hire another person.

Jenny had also asked my mom not to fire her, she suggested that her younger brother Ryan \[24M\] could take her place and work until she can again.

That's where mom and dad ended up in the babysitting dispute. Mom had no problems with Ryan as a babysitter, but dad refused. Dad's argument was that Ryan couldn't take care of my sister and that he was a male, inexperienced and untested.

Finally, dad agreed and Ryan became the casual babysitter, until his sister is back. He worked during the same weekdays and times as Jenny, from Monday to Thursday.

He was nice to both my parents, had respect and was polite. He got along really well with my mom and shared interests with my dad.

We were now approaching the end of August and I started university. I \[21M\] graduated in 2016, but chose not to study immediately afterwards, I worked to make money, but now it was time to study again. I had to leave home because I started studying at Geroge Washington University in DC. Far away from my home state.

Jenny came with a new message, she would be gone for another couple of months, until December. It made dad and mom get into yet another dispute. They spoke Spanish to each other so Ryan wouldn't understand. It was about dad being tired of this situation, he didn't want a male as a babysitter and that he couldn't continue this way. Mom was determined to not hire a new babysitter because she wanted to be loyal to Jenny.

They did not agree and it continued for several days. They also began to argue about other things that were unrelated to the babysitting topic. Dad finally got furious and demanded divorce, a big shock to me and mom. I tried to change him, but I couldn't.

The house was on dad's name, which led to mom falling outside. I tried to convince dad not to do this, that mom didn't have anywhere to go. He simply didn't care. We went over to our neighbor to think of a solution there, Ryan then came over and said that my mom and my little sister could stay with him and Jenny, until we find another solution.

There was not much to choose from, I saw Jenny and Ryan being the best option. It was better to leave my mother and sister to people we knew.

However, I recently returned home, I took a study break for about 2 weeks. I came home 3 days ago. I first visited dad and there I saw a crushed and emotional person, he told me that he was trying to reach out to mom but was denied by Jenny. My sister was also at home, dad told me he got full custody of her. I don't know how it was possible but I was worried about my sister, but dad informed me that his sister, my aunt, will come over from Colombia and remain with him until a solution is find and to take care of my sister.

I took the chance to go over to Jenny's and Ryan's, it wasn't too far away, I left dad home to avoid trouble. When I arrived at their house, I was met by a disrespectful and angry Jenny. I didn't understand anything, I wanted to talk to mom but Jenny didn't allow it. She said things like ''You have nothing to do here'' ''Get out of my property'' and ''I'll call the cops if you don't leave now.''

Jenny said it was a bad time right now and that I should come over tomorrow and maybe then I'll be permitted to talk to my mom. I left because Jenny totally refused to let me into the house. The day after, I met Ryan near our house, we talked and he told me that my mom is no longer interested in my dad. I told him that my mom should talk to me, but he said it wasn't possible, felt like he forbade me from meeting my mom, I didn't answer and went on.

Yesterday I managed to call her and she answered. She explained that she was happy where she is and that it's difficult for her to explain, she couldn't more than that.

I wonder if there is something I can do, if it does, what is it?

I suspect something is happening to my mother there, something she didn't want to tell me, I have a hard time putting my finger on what it is. Dad made a mistake, mom should forgive him and come home again. I can no longer trust neither Ryan nor Jenny, they are hiding something. What advice can you refer to that I do or say? What is happening with mom over there, what's going on?",01Dec2019,1

Some background i met a girl about 4 months ago to play bass with her around local areas to make money. Im 17 shes 16. We hit it off pretty early everything went really fast. I love this girl i know people talk about kids not knowing who they wanna be with but i just cant explain there is something about it when we hold hands that makes me feel a certain way. When we kiss the whole world disappears and i can think of our future together. She had recently gotten put of a relationship a bit after i met her the guy had cheated on her 3 times. He is extremely immature and really loud. He came down to visit because they have known each other since they were like 4. She still liked him but she fell in love with him again when he came down to visit. I was there throughout the entire thing. He was really good at getting her to listen to him and kinda rub his way in between us. We were in a relationship at this point. The day after she broke up with me but she said she still loved me and she wanted to be sort of friends with benefits and leave it open for the future. Today is when i found out that she loved him and me i feel like im competing against him. Hes 800 miles away while im right here next to her. We kiss a lot still and we mess around. I trust her because we are always open about stuff shes told me i could get hurt. This girl is my world i bought concert tickets for march that we are going to and ive planned a trip to Ireland with her this summer. This guy is an asshole who is mean to his mom and sister and they didnt have the best relationship. Weve had such a great time together i spent the week with her for thanksgiving and she got sick and i cared for her. I just dont know what to do ive probably missed some important details any questions i will answer and if anyone can help me that would be great. I want her to be happy thats all i want so whatever she decides im gonna eventually be okay with, but i just dont wanna get hurt because this is my senior year of high school. I spend a lot of time with this girl so she is my life rn and losing her will be a big toll on me.

**We broke up because I had a 7 minutes in heaven type thing with a girl and went beyond kissing**

875,"Hi all. 
So as my title suggests I think I’m falling for a freshman, which is a problem. So here’s some background information...
I am a 16 year old female and I’m currently in my junior year of high school. I recently came out to my friends as Bisexual but have yet to come out to my family. The freshman is a 14 year old female and she is straight. My feelings started in late August of this year when I saw her at volleyball tryouts. I didn’t talk to her because I was far to nervous, I actually did not speak one word to her until about 1/3 of the way into the season. Her friend (lets just call her L) was talking to me and being weird high schoolers someone made a joke about L and themself being “married.” So as we were in line the freshman (lets call her A) was in front of me and heard this conversation, she turned around to where I was and hugged me and said that I was her “wife.” I went with it and to this day she still calls me her “wife.” Time progressed and feelings grew stronger. I didn’t really think anything of it, I didn’t even believe that I liked her until my friends told me that it looked like I did. After putting some thought into it, I came to the realization that I did in fact have feelings for her. Now it was probably October and me and A started talking more and every time she’d see me in the hall she’d come hold my hand, and before we went separate ways she’d tell me she loved me. We became real friends and the weekend before Halloween she invited me to her house for a haunted maze thing. I was the only Junior going so I made my friend go with me. We went through her maze then made our way down the street to a bigger and scarier maze. As we walked through it she held my hand the whole time and even said to me “whatever you do don’t let go, I’m scared.” So I didn’t. Her sister and her friends were there who are all also freshman and instead of standing and hanging out with them, she stood with me and even when her sister said that she was being replaced in the group A looked at me and squeezed my hand before saying that she didn’t care. We had a great night and I loved every second of it. During this time she did not know how I felt. Then late late October we had a team fundraiser at a restaurant and she said it was “a date” we had a fun time with the rest of the team and she held my hand all night. Later in October we had a team dinner and she held my hand the whole time. So me being dumb is thinking she is flirting with me, so then of course my feelings started flooding in and became a lot stronger. Then the time came, I had to tell her how I felt. I told her and she was completely chill about it, like scary chill. I had previously asked her to be my date to prom so when I told her that I liked her I asked if she still wanted to go to prom and she said she did. So everything was fine and she gave me a hug. Then later that same day she texted and asked if I wanted to hangout, we went to the mall. We had food and talked about life and really let each other in. Then when my feelings became too much I asked her to turn me down so she did. (This did not help). Now its early November and every Wednesday I’d buy her a tea and leave it in her locker, it made her day so it made me happy. Then things got complicated...later in November things changed. We didn’t talk as much, whenever I texted her it was only me carrying the conversation. By now I had sent her a text telling her I would put my feelings aside in order to keep our friendship so I don’t think it was me pushing her away by flirting? She texted me about 3-4 days ago telling me she wouldn’t be in school until after winter break. (For personal reasons that I do know of) Anyways, now when I try to talk to her she is not involved in the conversation and I feel as though she is done with me? I don’t know if it’s me trying to hard. I may just be being an asshole for making it about me when she is going through her own things. But I’m scared of losing our friendship so I don’t know what to do, do I leave it and wait for her to talk to me? Do I ask if everything is ok? My friends want me to send this text that is me telling her that I’m proud of her and that I’ll always be there for her. Should I do that? Also even though I know the answer is no, is there any chance of this working out? Thank you for reading all of this...even though you probably didn’t.",01Dec2019,1
876,"Second ever post here on reddit, and also on mobile, so forgive me if the layout is crappy.
(if something sounds confusing, please tell me, I'll add or answer to you. I've written this in the middle of a crying session, so thoughts weren't the clearest. Also English isn't my first language.) 

I'm an only child (21F), I live with my mom and grandma (my parents are separated and never got a divorce since I was 10).
I have a boyfriend in another city, 2 hours of bus and we can see each other. We met online in a MMO, started to talk and we fell for each other, it's been almost 5 years now.
Since the beginning of our relationship, my mother was not pleased, mostly because my begin with a guy was a shook to her. In the beginning, didn't tell her that I met him online, since she would throw a tantrum, like she did when I was 12 and told her my online best friend was sending me a package (then proceding to call me a dirty liar, giving me another cellphone with her spare number, so I wouldn't contact her, and costantly checking my Facebook account to see what I've written to this girl).
The first thing she said to me, when I told her I was in a relationship, was ""If you come home pregnant, I'll kick you out"". I was turning 16 in a few days and my bf was coming to see me, in a city that he was never in, ALL ALONE. She didn't even want to come and greet him, I got my dad with me to pick him up (I eventually arranged an ""official"" meeting with both my parents and things went good).

Now, most of my friends are spread across my country and I don't have many living here (and some of the few I have here don't make a call to see if I'm dead or not). I made friends with some of my bf's, and got introduced to some people who I genuinely enjoy staying around, and they care about me a lot.
I start to tell my mom I want to go there some days. ""No you're a girl"", and proceeds to come with me if I go there, following me and my bf. This happened too when we went to a con, there was bf's mom too who tried to help my mom calm down and conversate with her, but nope, my mom didn't want to (she had a little surgery on her foot nail some days before and had some trouble walking. I asked to go alone for this reason too, but I guess she likes to destroy herself). In the span on 4 years, I manage to spend every New Years Eve with my bf and friends, to stay there the night (over the last year), and enjoy to have more time for me and him.
With Christmas approaching, I told her I want to go to my bf's 7th and 8th, since people planned a d&amp;d campain and they want me to join them. I never ever played d&amp;d, no one at my place even know what it is, so I'm pretty excited as I'm a little Sorcerer in training.
She told me that that holy day is to pass in family (I'm at my house 24/7 if I don't have any university lessons, with my 86yo grandma telling me that she wants to die and crying over my newly deceased grandpa, 91yo when he passed due to heart failure), and we have a 50yo marriage celebration that we have to attend.
I argued with her, since I had plans and I'm old enough to do whatever I want, but she started claiming that I want to go god knows where, staying the night with people she didn't know and yadayadayada. She attacked me saying that I'm in uni since 3 years and I did nothing (I have exam anxiety, most of them are oral speeches because I'm degreeing into linguistic mediation and translation, and fear of her reaction to my grades). I just broke out crying like a baby, like I always do when she hits my soft spots.
I'm already in therapy and my psychologist has helped me a lot, I even brought my mom in and she came in everytime I asked her to.
She's a good single mom, but I really struggle due to some of her worst decisions she's taken on me. I don't know what to do. I just want to see my boyfriend, watch Frozen 2 with him, cuddle and play that d&amp;d campaign.
Am I a bad child to take all of the emotional crap on me?",01Dec2019,1
877,"4 years ago I started hanging out with this girl I met from social media.  We hung out a couple of times.  One of the last times we hung out it was very physical; we made out and got touchy with each other.  After leaving my car to start walking towards an event we were going to she made a comment ""I know you're an ass guy anon.""  I touched her butt as she was walking and she said ""Haha anon stop"" to which I mistook her just being flirty/kidding as we were just making out.  She then said ""Anon I mean it stop"" to which I realized she wasn't kidding, apologized on the spot, then went on with hanging out.  The hang out continued as normal and we made out again.  I made sure during that to respect her (e.g., ""Please watch your hands anon"" when we starting getting handsy during making out).  Following this her and I talked for a little bit via texting (her initiating the convo).  Eventually we stopped talking and I unfollowed her on social media after not interacting for years.  

Recently this girl has started a rumor about me that I kept grabbing her ass when she said not too. I can honestly say this is the only time I ""crossed the line"" but stopped and apologized immediately. I have had other girls make comments to me about how respectful I am to them while hooking up. I have been anxious about the repercussions that this may have on all aspects of my life.  

1.  This is something I have never told my girlfriend about as it was a random hook-up from years ago.  I want to tell my girlfriend about this but I am worried of her not believing me and breaking up with me.
2. Should I try reaching out to this girl from years ago?  I was considering apologizing again to her, however, I worry that it would look like I am admitting what she is saying to be true.",01Dec2019,1
878,"So my gf and I have been together for about 4 years now, and I love her so much. She means everything to me. She's helped me through so many tough times, and I have done the same for her. Although one thing that sort of gets to me a little is that she acts like a literal child. I would never do anything to hurt her, but there are so many times where her childish antics just make me have to step back and take a deep breath to regain my patience. A lot of times I love it and it keeps things fun. But she doesn't have a off switch for it. It keeps going on and on and she acts like that at the most inappropriate times. I don't know what to do. I would talk to her about it, but I'm afraid I might hurt her. I don't want that.

881,"I’m 22 (F) and never had a relationship, mostly because my family is stuck in the 1950’s and have the mentality that guys can do whatever they want and it’s fine (my brother never had a problem dating), but women should be more careful and stuff like that. 
One time I had a group project and I was the only girl in the group, we scheduled to do the project at my house (I had asked permission from my mother) but when my father got home he freaked out, basically kicked everyone out and started yelling at me (stuff like “what would people think”). Events like these growing up made me very conscious about dating.
Now I don’t how to act and feel like stupid mistakes I might make in a relationship can be viewed as immature since majority of people have gone through the first awkward relationships as teens. Any advice?

882,"So I have a friend group of about 15ish people and there is one that I don't get along with because he trashed my girlfriend for no reason except for the way she looked. I asked him to apologize and he refused so I am essentially forced to hang out with him or else I won't get to be around the others. He has constantly talked crap about me behind my back and has talked badly about the others in the group but they don't seem to care for some reason. I personally don't want to deal with this anymore and have decided to remove him from the people I associate with. 

Here's where the problem comes. Every year I host a LAN party which is where everyone brings their video games and we all play together in the same room. This friend that I dislike assumes he's coming but I don't want him to at all and I'm not allowing him to since it's held at my house. I don't care about being mean towards him but I am overall a nice person and would like to let him down easy.  I would like to know how do I tell him that I don't want him there?",01Dec2019,1
883,"Hi There,

I am unsure if this question is going to make the most sense, but I figured I'd give it a shot. Back in junior and senior year of high school, I watched a lot of broadcasters on the livestreaming platform YouNow. There was this one specific individual I always watched, and I like to think I established a sort of friendship with him. On the app, the way to get noticed by these livestreamers are by giving them these awards called bars, in which you have to pay real money for. These awards are then used to help the broadcaster gain more viewers on the platform. Back in senior year, I used to have a job and would pay my own personal money to give him these awards, because I wanted to support his career (he is a musician). It got him to notice me, and after some time, I feel like we actually formed a friendship, as we followed each other on social media and even exchanged numbers. However, as I got busier towards the end of high school and got into college, I matured a lot in that year and realized I could not afford to be throwing money away and giving this guy awards, as I had to pay for my own financial stability in college. As much as I wanted to give this guy awards to support his career, I just could not afford it anymore. However, I was worried that if I stopped paying money to give this broadcaster these awards, that he would not longer pay attention to me, and I therefore just stopped watching him and communicating with him. 

I am now halfway done with junior year in college, and I just came across his page after years, and felt a bit sad. Back in HS, I remember that I paid to give him awards because I wanted to support his career in any way I could, I found him to be so talented and wanted him to have some more exposure. Looking back now,  I also feel as though he didnt just appreciate the fact that I gave him awards, but I think he valued the connection we made and the support I gave him regardless. I however, felt that me no longer giving him awards would cause him to hate me, and hastily decided to cut contact with him, and its a decision I regret, and wish I just told him I couldn't afford to give him these awards anymore rather than ceasing all contact. Would it be weird to reach out to him, or go onto his broadcast again to try and re-establish a relationship? Now that I am older and more mature, I could explain to him where my mindset is. I still cant afford to pay and give him awards anymore, but I still want to support his career, and would like to get back in touch if possible, but I am worried he probably would hate the fact that I randomly stopped watching his broadcasts and supporting him, when in reality, it was because I was worried he would be unhappy with the fact that I couldn't give him these awards anymore.

Let me know your thoughts, thanks.",01Dec2019,1
884,"Hi. 

So, a little about me - I am a 22 year-old guy doing my bachelor's degree in design. I study Human Centered Design which mostly deals with stuff like UX/UI related things. Next year, I will be graduating and will work for sometime/intern at a good place for some experience. Then, plan for my Master's in Design somewhere abroad. 

I have spent the past four years in college mostly with myself. I have a loving girlfriend (who I met during the first year) and we're going strong, generally happy. However, when I am not with her, I spend my time on video-games, playing/learning musical instruments and writing jokes. There was a time (few years back) when I used to practice stand-up comedy and music freely, with confidence in public from time-to-time. As the years passed, I got busy with college and I guess the whole 'needing validation for my talents' just died down. Now I look forward to spending my time alone; reading books, playing music and video-games. But I wish that part of me was still alive.

Never got into stuff like smoking-up/drinking like my peers and this took a toll on my social life - majority of the folks in my college socialize over that since its a nice lubricant. When I am with them, I don't gel so well and back out eventually. I have no trouble holding conversations; I make people laugh but fail to form meaningful conversations. Almost graduating college, I wish I had formed better friendships.

Other than that, I am pretty lost. The more I try to understand 'what I want from life', the more it backfires - I want to do so much: do stand-up comedy, make music, create narratives for video-games, create expressive and meaningful designs for stuff... but just don't know what is holding me back. Feels like I am missing out on life and its passing by me, one day at a time. 

Its a weird spot, and if you are reading this I assume you too are confused. But if you can understand this, it'll really help me out. I want more clarity in life and chase the goals I *want* too, not the ones I am *supposed* to. 

Can you advice me on this path o' mine? Thank you.",01Dec2019,1

887,"My grieving boyfriend(21M) is turning a massive asshole and I don’t know what to do
u/Minoucat200017m
Backstory:

He’s 21, I’m 19. His mum passed away in September which was extremely traumatic and he’s an only child with a 79 year old dad who we think has Alzheimer’s. I’ve supported him every way I can, from the moment his mum went to the hospital to the day she died. I stayed in the home with him, looked after him and his dad and left college and work to support as much as I could as he was on his own. I wasn’t very close to his mum but I did this as I really love my boyfriend.

Fast forward to 3 months and he’s just turning into an asshole. I’m trying to help him through the grieving process as I know everyone is different his is to not talk about his mum, he hasn’t really cried and he just tries to keep himself excessively busy. I respect this if this is his coping method and leave him to it and just generally look after him by cleaning/cooking/organising ect.

But he’s just turning on me all the time. I understand I can be moody but I’m only human with my own problems too. But he’s aggressive, argumentative and just plain rude. He tells me he hates my haircut, I’m ‘unmotivated’ as I’m not working but I’ve found an apprenticeship, he told me I was ‘limiting myself’. He breaks my things. Tells me we’re spending too much time together then always wants to be together. He apologies and offers to buy me clothes only to tell me he doesn’t like any of my choices and it’s ‘his money so he can decide’. He acts like he’s excessively stressed, which he is but he’s doing it to himself. He’ll shout at me for wanting to eat what I want, won’t spend any quality time together but then will book us trips and suddenly be really loving and sorry.

I know this erratic behaviour is due to grief, I also know he won’t go back to his old self and that this is a semi-normal reaction to someone dying but why doesn’t he see he’s upsetting me and pushing me away? I could cry in front of him for hours and he wouldn’t even look at me.

Is it me? How can I help him? Is he just being an asshole and using grief to get away with it? I’m so confused I don’t really know what to do. Should I just take it as he’s in a dark place?

Side note: I’ve got him therapy and he wouldn’t go.",01Dec2019,1

I try and try but I honestly just feel like running away from everything and everyone. I want to press a reset button.

I know I need medication and I have been asking my mom for years, but nothing gets done. Sometimes when I ask she gets upset and tells me that I am just ungrateful for what I have. Other times she will tell me she'll do something and months later I ask how it is going and she tells me that she didn't do anything. She is a busy woman but I really need to get through to her that I need my medication before I do anything stupid to myself. I am just so tired of people leaving me and I just feel so lonely. I am under her insurance so I am not sure if I can even do anything about it myself. I need to tell her but I am scared it will just be another argument.

Here's all you need to know: I'm young and I work for minimum at a basic job where money is a big component under a family run location of a franchise where all upper management are related family members. 

For some unknown reason these people dislike me. Im a person who keeps to myself and goes by the book at work because I've witnessed so many issues that could've been avoided by just doing that, so I don't know what's wrong with them.

To be fair, I'm *assuming* they don't like me because of things they've done that give me reason to believe that, but I promise all of these incidents are very on-the-nose, and I'll elaborate if I have to.

Anyways, I was accused of stealing a substantial amount of money. Me being innocent, I tried to be as straightforward and honest I could've been, offering to look through all my logs to see if I made a mistake. It sucks because we really have NO cameras or any way I could've proved I was innocent.

We spent like 20 minutes back and forth about what could've happened to the money, until I noticed on their screen the person who took the money was listed and was not me. My name was only listed cause I opened the account but I didn't even do anything. 

After I pointed that out they, very awkwardly, told me to leave so they can talk about it. When they came out they legit said they needed to ""double check"" and make sure it wasn't me and I haven't heard of it since.

I am very certain they were going to try to pin me for stealing. Don't get me wrong, I'm working on leaving here ASAP but I'm scared I'm going to be accused of something like that again and stealing is no joke. I really don't want my name and job eligibility to plummet just because of shady assholes.

As of now, I've only been printing personal copies of daily user reports from my account that list my activity just in case they do something sneaky again. I've also told them I don't want anymore solo shifts (lied to them about reason) so that I always have a witness.

I am 23 years old and living with my parents and my younger sister.

I had been working part-time for 3 years while going to community college but quit last week because I am at that point where I really need the extra 16 hours to study.  
I am currently a nursing student with 1 year left before I can take the NCLEX as an ADN in a competitive accelerated program. My tuition costs $5,000 average for the whole program. I have enough saved up for this alone.

   
I still live with my parents. I had saved up 10k extra in savings, but aside from tuition now I am almost down to nothing.   
We burned through the savings paying off my parent's mortgage and electricity/water/internet/phone/insurance bill. (1500/month total.)  
My father has been unemployed for 2 years, but he ran out of benefits, savings and no more 401k.  
We barely had any savings before he became unemployed and the past year without any benefits has just been difficult.   
My parents never had a financial plan before they had me.  
   
I've tried convincing him to just work at any store like Walmart but it is difficult for him to let go of the idea of getting a position that'll pay him $40,000+ so he can ""pay me back."" My mother used to be my coworker but she roughly makes 1,000 a month. Their English is not the best. They are not on the best terms and nobody is open about their finances. My sister is bringing in some part-time money and grants but she goes to school as well and we have split the bill into half between me and her, but now we are down to nothing and I feel tremendous guilt.   


&amp;#x200B;

I have not heard back from any scholarships. I am not eligible for FAFSA. The credit hours given in my program don't meet full-time student requirements even though we spend 12 hours attending class total.   
\[3 credits for fundamentals (3 hours), 2 credits for health assessment (6 hours) and 1 credit for skills (3 hours contact time)\]   
We are not eligible to apply for the 2020 healthcare insurance because we do not make enough income. I have yet to apply for food stamps because I am just so overwhelmed with finals. Where do I go to find resources to help me apply for things? What else is out there?

I am at a crossroads where I feel obligated to quit school to work full-time anywhere that'll accept me.  
I know I can pass NCLEX after the program, I am a good student and have faith in myself into becoming a good nurse. 

Should I talk to my parents about selling the house and moving into an apartment and stay in school?   
Is that a viable option?  
Should I hang on for one more year, hoping for work as an ADN nurse?  


I am not sure how to do anything right now.

I'm a student and uni got me depressed... I don't like the way the teachers do their job and treat us.

Some of them are simply jerks that are changing their minds about assignments on a daily basis and make you do uni work in vain, so I feel like a slave.

906,"My purpose in posting this is to get some advice. I don't currently have a therapist, and I therefore have some trouble thinking through problems. It can be hard sometimes, to figure stuff out without someone else giving you some kind of second opinion. Sometimes it's easiest to find out what you should tolerate by talking to other people about a similar situation. 

Let me paint a picture for you.

I require kind of a lot of love and affection. I'm not crazy high-maintenance, but I do require physical touch, words of affirmation, and attention fairly frequently. I consider myself a reasonable person, albeit slightly immature at times. I'm a mature adult, but I've been in more unhealthy, toxic relationships than healthy ones- So it's difficult at times to ignore the habits I learned in those relationships. 

That being said, I have been uncomfortable in my relationship lately. My boyfriend and I live together, and we just passed out 6 months mark. During the honeymoon period, it was still fairly difficult to feel like I was receiving what I needed in order to feel loved. I'm not sure if this is because of the fact because I was just previously in a clingy, toxic relationship, that maybe it just felt like a stark contrast. Alternatively, I could just be incompatible with him. 

We have talked about this once before. It was one really difficult talk. In the weeks leading up to that talk, I tried dropping comments like ""I love it when you do that, thank you!"" when he would do things that made me feel loved. I would reward him with his love languages when he fulfilled mine. It didn't seem to work. After a while, I sat him down and asked him to touch, kiss, and affirm me more often. His response was ""I don't think I'm what you're looking for"". 

I know there's such a thin line between compromising in a relationship/asking your partner to try harder, and trying to change them. I have tried too hard to change too many guys, and I don't want to do that again. 

So, my question is: Is this just who he is? Is there any way to condition him to love me the ways I need him to? Or would it simply be too much to get that from him?",01Dec2019,1

There's not a lot of structure or discipline and I have no idea WTF is going on.

I don't want to burn any bridges cause there isn't much recent experience to fall back on for my resume other than another office job which I resigned from and stayed at longer than I should have. There's no hard feelings with that one but ehhh...it was definitely a case of I should've probably quit a few months sooner than I did and everyone there is aware of that fact, it's a tiny company, but again it was all done professionally with no hard feelings. They were tired of me, I was tired of them. By-gones. Whatever. 

As for my specific role there's no actual work that would have to be handed down so it's not like a 2 weeks would be necessary, but I feel like I have to out of professionalism and not wanting to have some corporate 'black mark' on my record. It just seems awkward as all Hell to have this type of conversation and work knowing I'm leaving and don't give a shit.

No I'm not a telemarketer, but basically I have to build my client-base 100% from scratch with a little bit of industry knowledge they've given me. So that requires a lot of cold-calls and I just don't have the level of extroversion to continue on with this. I'm not a 'rockstar salesman work hard play hard etc.' and I thought the role was going to be a lot more structured than it is.

Please go easy on me. I'm obviously anxious about the whole situation and have no idea how to approach it. I've had some successes at my past 2 jobs that I can definitely put on my resume so it's not like I have nothing to show for my work, it's just that they were definitely not right for me, which I think is to be expected when I'm in my mid-20s trying to carve my career-path for the first time.",01Dec2019,1

915,"So long story short, 
About two and a half months ago my girlfriend and I got together after 4 years of knowing eachother and being friends! 
We always were eachother’s “partner” be it at parties and get togethers or just casual hangouts and such. We fooled around a lot but it never led to sex because she didn’t want to have sex unless we’re together. 
I always liked her and I even asked her to be my gf the first year of our friendship but she rejected me and so I completely snapped out of her but still kept contacts and still we were fooling around but I was no longer really interested in her becoming my gf. 
So two months ago it finally happened and we both decided to make it official because we both wanted it and it was that point of “what are we?” In our relationship, so we made it official. 
I really love her and I love spending time with her but I am a person with very high need of personal space and she seems to be the complete opposite. She constantly wants to see me and just be with me or text me and talk to me and always thinks that she is not my priority or that I don’t pay enough attention to her and stuff like that because I don’t want to meet up all the time or talk and text all the time! 
For example, she always wants to meet up at 8 in the morning and hang until 7 or 8 in the evening because her father doesn’t allow her to be out after 7. And she expects me to do this every day or whenever we can! 
I love to see her a lot but I also want to do the things that I have to do and or maybe spend time with my buddies or even just be by myself! 
I like to get through my day by doing my daily tasks and works and then have fun at night but she is the opposite and she JUST wants to hangout with me!! 
The other day she got mad at me again for not meeting up with her on a Sunday morning because I was sleeping and dealing with a fucked up hangover and she said that I had nothing to do but instead I stayed home and didnt see her, therefore she is not important to me. 
These things are just pushing me away from her and I don’t know what to do.
I talked to her and told her that it’s nothing personal and I love her but I need my personal space and I don’t like to spend every second together not because I don’t like her but just because I’m not that kind of guy! And plus, I can’t afford eating out and getting coffees all the time for the both of us or paying for the gas because we drive around the whole day just to be together!!
I told her these things and she said that she has high expectations from me and from now on she’ll lower her expectations and be as how I like to be! 
This made things even worse for me!! She agrees with everything and I don’t know it’s just not going the right direction!!!! 
I don’t know I love her, she is gorgeous and super hot and fun and smart but her clinginess is just driving me crazy! 
Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for your advices!

917,"Hoping for some guidance on something that happened recently.


Just slid all the way down a hill. So badly I missed my turn. Luckily not a lot of traffic. In the process of firmly holding the break and pointing my car where I felt was safest my car died cause it was in gear still. Luckily was able to come to a complete stop without going in to the intersection at the bottom of the hill. Can't say the same for the guy behind me who was following too close and driving too fast. Was able to check the intersection, start my car, lay on the horn to go through a red light and get out of this morons way before he rear ended me. 

Did I do the right thing? Clearly the outcome was fine, no collision, but I can’t help but feel stupid for what I did. What if there had been a car coming that I did not see, or worse a pedestrian? I feel like I put way more on the line to avoid, what likely would have been no more than an inconvenience for myself and the other driver.  Furthermore if, I caused a collision it would have been my fault rather then getting rear ended. This could have caused financial and legal issues for me.",01Dec2019,1
918,"So the title is the TL;DR but there are a lot more details here. I'm 20M, she's 20M, we're both in the same college and went to the same high school.

&amp;#x200B;

I care about my friends a lot. Anything that happens, I always am there to help or support them, whatever they might need. This person (let's call her Clara) and I have known each other for about 5 years, although we really became close last year when my girlfriend and I broke up and Clara and her boyfriend broke up. We were both really emotionally hurt by those breakups and as we healed, we grew closer as friends. I would do anything for her, just as I would any of my other friends. We've been there for each other, and I even encouraged her to go to therapy, and then she confided that the therapist had let her know she was showing signs of depression. In short, we were very close.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a month ago. We're in a night class together, stepping out of our comfort zone for a comedy class. At the end of the class, we each give a live show.

&amp;#x200B;

She delivered a (very funny) bit about a part of her being a ""horse girl"" and for some reason, the professor started calling her ""horse girl"" rather than her real name. It reached a point where she was crying about it in my car as I drove her back to her sorority house. I was able to calm her down and then told her that I had her back and that I would handle it so it wouldn't happen again. Earlier in the semester, she had my back when we were had to partner up (oddly enough my ex was also in the class and I didn't want to be in that situation). So I sent the professor an email and told him as kindly as I could, to back the f\*\*\* off my friend. He sent an email back a couple of days later to the both of us apologizing and that was it.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't hear from her once she got the email, and she ignored 2 texts I sent about a week apart. In class, we barely had the time to talk and so it's been a bit since we've chatted. I'm still concerned about her, but I also am worried that I did something wrong here. How should I move forward? I'm just concerned and also worried that I did something wrong to mess up our friendship.

920,"Before you start reading this, I apologise for my bad English and for this  long post 


Everybody makes mistakes. There can be consequences. I get that. 
I am a normal guy, friendly and I consider myself pretty chill and I really care about my friends. But whoever I talk about in this post have known me for atleast three years, even though not very close.

There's this group that I used to hang out with almost all the time. At one point I started to notice them kinda ghosting me and I waited out to be sure if it was just me. Few days forward...pretty much sure that it was true, decided to confront one of them who i was really close with...well atleast I thought I was. Now, I've been friends with him for about three years now and he knows me pretty well. Let's call him A. So I waited for the right to time and talked to him about what I felt and asked him if anything was wrong. Apparently there wasn't anything he had an issue with so A calls up others and asks them if they had any issues with me. Now, I've never really been able to be very close with those guys but A is pretty much a part of that group and they're really close.
The problem was, they felt i started ignoring them as I started hanging out with this new group, that had a mutual friend of ours and I was very close with him too,  B. I've known him for 4 years now. Tbh I missed one of their calls as my phone was on silent mode. 
Understanding the seriousness of this and potentially losing my friends, I apologized and asked them to put it behind us. They agreed and tbh I was really relieved.

Fast forward a few days and I noticed no change in their behavior and they still ghost me and don't talk to me unless they're obligated to.Now, i understand that this is definitely my fault and I'm probably repeating the same mistake again buFt I'm pretty sure I've been giving equal importance to both the groups.
 At this point, frustrated and confused I try talking to A who also seems to do the same as the others and won't give me a clear idea of what the problem was. 
Fast forward a few weeks , A and the others went out drinking, obviously not inviting me and when I called up one of them who I was also close with, lies that they're out just for a walk. Now I did know they planned to go out and drink and this really upsets me . Later that night , I was at B's room chilling and A walks in and asks B , why wasn't he going with completely ignoring my presence and not even looking at me. Now this hurt me real bad. Later that night I talk to one of them who always seemed pretty mature to me and told him everything that had happened and his advice was to confront them and he would help me do it. 

Fast forward a few hours and he calls me up and asks me to meet everyone.
So the whole group was there I took a deep breath , at this point I was very upset and frustrated. I ask the whole group what the actual problem was and  everyone all of a sudden had really petty and small issues with me and tbh it really caught me off guard cause they've known me for quite some time now and this starting to bother them now was really upsetting to me. These problems tbh didn't seem to be an issue that had to be handled this way to me . But anyway I apologise again for everything I did and try explaining to them and again asking of everything was clear. Everybody seemed fine at that point and it felt the same to me too.

Now, me thinking everything is fine , I try to talk to them and they do seem to talk to me fine too. Until one night I try to go to A's place where I usually used to chill before all this started and saw everyone was already there hanging out, so thinking everything was fine I join too. Later that night I was out for a few minutes out in the corridor of our dorm, walked up to my room to get my phone and when I returned found no one there. The whole group had shifted room which was weird because who does that. And I realized they were a couple room down from my door and locked from the outside. Well this just was too much for me and I returned to my room not knowing and I try to relax

A few  weeks pass and I completely avoid them whenever I can and this one occasion I was with B and some others at a pub and A was there too but the others weren't and A talks to me and talks to me about the whole thing of locking door from the outside and they doing it because I didn't have the 'vibe' and everything. His way of talking kinda told me it was the others in the that came up with the idea and he said he felt guilty for doing so and wanted to move past it. We talk about it...meh.. what the hell... it's A ...so I told him it's fine and we're cool with it and everything.

But I've come to notice that the whole group talks to me sometimes but A just acts weird when I'm around and I don't feel the same and he usually never talks to me when I'm around that group whenever I see him anywhere.

There are a few minor details I left out. But I feel it's time I move on and find better friends.

921,"Before i dive into this rabbit-hole i’d like to provide some context and backstory:

my parents separated when i was young, about 5 or 6 and still go by custody rules they implemented then. my dad has confirmed anger issues and has been to therapy time and time again, but it just doesn’t seem to help. He cut me with an electric razor once and threatened to stab me when i didn’t want to cut a cake the “right way” aka his way. he cusses me out and verbally and emotionally abuses me on the regular (every time i’m with him).

What do you guys advise that i do? i know i can’t do much since i’m too young to drive.

I don't want to find a therapist I like because that's unlikely, and I'll probably lie to him anyway because I wouldn't trust anyone to tell my thoughts openly since it might cause more trouble than solution and I think it is almost impossible that they would get me.

Problem is my mom is being really weird about it. My mom and I get along pretty well but she's also a narcissist as far as I can tell and has a tendency to make everything about her. She doesn't want me to move out but gives me weird advice about finding somewhere to live. She says I should immediately buy a place near her so as to not 'waste money' but I feel like that's her way of trying to get me to stay close to her forever. I don't want to buy a place when I'll only be 25 years old as I don't feel I'm ready. I also don't even know where I'll be working. Every time I mention working she only thinks of it as being close by, but my career is not one that can really flourish where I currently live. It's not like I'm planning to cut off contact or something and I love my family, but I want to grow up and be my own person and not feel like I'm tied down to my hometown. I also frankly just want to live somewhere else as I'm not really fond of the place I live now as it's a more rural area and can get pretty boring in addition to not being good for my career. Whenever I mention growing up or doing things on my own she gives me the guilty treatment and acts like I'm not considering her feelings.

I'm not really sure what to do about this. I just want to be able to grow as a person and not have my family act like I betrayed them or something. I love my mom and don't want to hurt her feelings and she's not being outwardly un-supportive. I also understand how hard it must be to see your child move away.

The  Virus broke containment accidentally and  infected the entire Internet  infrastructure in a week, The United States Government quickly  intervened, a cover up ensued, my work was buried. The first wave of  pedophiles were arrested under Operation Sunflower conducted by ICE in  2012, the  arrests continue to this day in spite of The Deep State  hindering the prosecution of the pedophiles and other criminals.  The  Shadow Government then turned this virus into a surveillance tool  against the American populace, and did everything they could to  interfere in the arrest of Pedophiles and other criminals. I had to go  and lay low this began a cat and mouse game which continues to this day.

934,"Hi, this is me first time posting on Reddit, or anywhere like this for that matter, so please excuse any format errors or typos.

So, I created a throwaway account to post this as I have some friends on here who know my username. I don't exactly know where to start, but maybe I should explain a bit about myself and my circumstances. I hope this post resonates with some of you out there, because I think there are some that can relate to having feelings of loneliness but still be surrounded by people whom you love and love you back. 

I(21F) have always been very focused on my future and my goals in life, so I went straight to university, moved out of my parents house(who are the greatest people on earth) in 2017 and started studying. I have always regarded myself as fairly smart and was able to keep up in my classes, not the best grades but whatever. I used to love hanging out with my friends and going to parties, always getting a high from being around people. I have been with my amazing, loving and caring boyfriend for nearly a year now, and I just know, and knew very quickly, that this is *the* guy. 

However, I have never felt so lonely and stuck in my life as I do now. As of lately I have felt very isolated, and the only person I want to be around is my boyfriend. I have stopped going to parties or hanging out with more than 3 people at a time, because I have noticed that every time I say something I keep thinking about what other people might think about me. Maybe they think I sounded mad, irritated, stupid or not funny, and I don't like thinking that way, so I have just stopped showing up because then I wont have to analyse every little thing I do. It's exhausting. I have a job at a big company in the same field in which I'm studying, and I do the same there. Always thinking about how my coworkers perceive me or the work that I do, and I'm so afraid of failing that I constantly worry. In addition to that, I failed a major course at university even after all my attempts, which would have allowed me to continue my education, and my self esteem really took a hit, because maybe I'm not as smart as I thought I was. It also means I'm in financial struggles. My parents, as amazing as they are, have offered to support me financially through this rough patch, and that irritates me so much, because I wanted to do this on my own, and make them proud. I feel like I'm stuck, and I can't do anything but wait until I can resume my studies, while working to scrape enough money, so I won't have to leech my parents dry. In response to feeling this stuck, I have been dropping hints to my boyfriend about moving in together. I have been wanting to ask him for a long time, but now I feel this kind of urgency I know isn't healthy for me or our relationship, and I have even privately thought of children which is far too early, and absolutely mad, for both of us, considering my situation. 

I have thought about seeking professional counsel to receive some tools to overcome these unhealthy habits, and I wanted to hear a bit about what I could expect or if I would even benefit from talking to a professional?

I also highly encourage people in a similar positions in life to share their struggles, so this post can help others to put their thoughts into words and maybe receive some advice also.

Normally I was always with ""M"" because we had more in commom even though he was 12-13 at the time. He brought me everywhere he went including hanging out with his friends and girlfriends. What more could you want from a cool older brother...

""M"" bedroom was in basement away from everyone elses. I use to hang out there with him playing games and watching videos. But there were a few times he asked me to do something not knowing what it was then.. He had me do oral on him, I can remember the feeling of not knowing whats going on and just going with it cuz it was my cool older brother. I shake at the memory. I just wish it never happened as it ruins my memories as a childhood. 

I continue to act like it never happened. But its always in the back of my mind. Im just about to turn 31, married with 2 kids and a great job. I dont imahine ever bringing it up cuz I am not sure what it would do with my other family. I hate that I keep it inside but battle back and forth what the best thing to do is. Only time I talk to ""M"" is at family functions. But I talk to ""J"" everyday like he is my best friend.

936,"so, i’m 14(f) and for the past 5 months i’ve been stuck in a major depressive episode — frequent breakdowns, trouble falling asleep and then sleeping too late, lack of motivation, occasion thoughts of death, no hope for anything, easily agitated — this is the biggest episode i’ve ever suffered and i don’t know why, but i believe it was triggered by something personal. 

about a month or two ago, i came to the realization that i feel neglected and unloved by my boyfriend. i discussed it with him and he assured me that he was still very much in love with me and is now putting in a constant effort to show it, which cleared that up but i also feel like he doesn’t care when i’m sad because he gets easily agitated and doesn’t seem to put much effort to help or support me. i also confronted him about this. he says he doesn’t know how to help me and how i am when i’m sad is annoying. 

which brings me to my issue. i feel as though a lot of my current mental and relationship issues are brought on by my own depression, anxiety and way of thinking. when i get depressed, i shut down. i become insensitive and stubborn. i shut down every attempt he has to help me and i get even more sad when he doesn’t try harder which is very unfair. 

granted, his tone when he talks to me ( while sad ) could be an issue. he sounds frustrated and uses words that seem harsh to me but he never means it that way so he feels really bad in the end. but like i said, i’m stubborn and i HATE when people try to help me, but i want to be loved and supported. i’m very complicated and i don’t even understand myself. i need therapy but i can’t afford it ( nor do i have a way to get there ) 

my boyfriend and i are currently on a two week break which was brought on by me. i thought it’d be good for us both to clear our heads and self-reflect and figure out our problems in our own time. 

but i need advice, i don’t wanna run this relationship into the ground because i genuinely feel like he’s the one for me ( i know i’m young, but i really do )",01Dec2019,1

938,"My son just turned 14. He has always been a good boy, doing well in school and at home. Yesterday around 7:30pm, I heard he opened the door and went outside.  I thought he went to get the mail.  A few minutes later, he still didn't come back.  It was cold outside, so I went out to check.  When I open the door, I saw his pants outside on the ground! and his underwear!!  I was very nervous, thought he was kidnapped! I looked around my house, my neighbor's house, ...  and when I was about to call the police, I saw him coming back.  He walked so calmly as if he didn't know he was naked in his lower body.  Then when he saw me,  it seemed he immediately woke up and tried to cover himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so confused. Later, I asked him why he went outside pantless. According to him, he wanted to poop and he was kind of in a sleepwalking state. I don't totally believe it because:

1) It was 7:30pm, and he wasn't even sleeping, and he never sleepwalked before.

2) I wanted to take him to see a neurologist.  He didn't want to, and he promised this would never happen again.  If this is sleepwalking, how could he be so sure this would never happen again? 

&amp;#x200B;

For a moment, I thought it could be a seizure. He had a seizure before, but that was 8 years ago, and it's because of a high fever. He had taken anti-seizure medicine for a couple of years, and he was totally normal for the past 6 years. 

 

So, what is this? Exhibitionistic disorder? Should I take him to see a neurologist, or therapist?",01Dec2019,1
939,"My mom is friends with an elderly lady that comes by her shop that talks to us and occasionally brings us treats to eat.

She started talking about how her family (her biological son and daughter-in-law) had convinced her to sell her house and move in with them so they could take care of her and keep her comfortable. So, she did. She got $330k from all that and wanted to keep at least $30k for herself but the son and DIL convinced her to give all of it since she'd be staying with them to which she reluctantly agreed and did.

Well, once the house was sold and she had given the money to them, they started treating her like crap. They provided her with one small room in their house and that's it-- they don't even feed her and they've already begun throwing out her stuff to make room for their children's belongings. She can't even leave a toothbrush in the restroom without it getting tossed. 

From what she says, she lives off of her Social Security checks but she really has nothing else. On top of that, they started to complain that she watches a lot of TV so she should start contributing to the cable bill. Like, wtf?

956,"I have a 95 year old grandfather who is very entitled. He is the speak to the manager Karen, the old man telling you to go right up to the manager and demand a job with a firm handshake, every stereotype of ""old man"" you can think of.

I want to learn how to just say OK boomer and let it all roll off (he's too old to be a boomer but you get the point).

He says inflammatory things all the time, sometimes it'll be bad enough that he gets racist. But the more daily things are irritating. He is very aggressive to customer service workers, and anyone who has worked a customer service job knows what I'm talking about. He thinks floor workers have control over the corporation somehow, and that if everyone like him would demand what they want aggressively that there could be changes. I am usually not with him when he does this because I no longer live at home.

Mom and I tried explaining that it's rude to rant to people who have no control over his situation and demand that they do something. He said it's their job to do what he says. This kind of thing strikes a chord with me because (1) I've had to deal with people like him at work before (2) my mom deals with people like this every day for her entire life because she's a nurse and (3) I just cannot wrap my head around how someone can be so inconsiderate and demand for everyone to bend over backwards for them + tolerate their belligerent yelling. I asked him if he's okay with people like him doing that to people like me and he said I deserve it if they have a good point.

Last time I was home he was yelling at me for not setting up his Amazon Fire TV Stick at his convenience. I bought him the product so he could watch movies on my Netflix account. I had to change the Amazon account it was on because he was charging my credit card for $200+ worth of micro-transactions for some Amazon TV game, so he was demanding I set it back to normal because he lost his progress when I changed the account to one a new one that I made for him. He called me disrespectful for telling him I wouldn't do anything if he would keep yelling at me.

How do I deal with this entitlement? I want things to go peacefully in my family and he is beyond reason, so how do I get myself in a mindset where I do what he says and take his crap without it being a huge toll on me? Have tried talking things out, but he is very loud and interrupts us when we speak. It's impossible to talk over him and it always feels like it isn't worth the energy. He's super old and I don't want to be fighting all of the time, so swallowing my pride and doing what he says is not the worst. The hard part is that I cannot disconnect myself from these situations after they happen, and I feel really shitty and walked-over for the whole day. So how do I separate myself from the bullshit and still be able to appreciate my granddad?

More context, my mom and I live with him. I am out of state for college right now but I will be moving back soon to take care of the house/my mom/anything she needs since she is approaching 70.

958,"Please forgive me in advance since this is a long post. I’m not sure what to do in this situation or if I have any rights here, so any advice would be great. 

My partner and I signed a lease in May for a two bedroom apartment above a pizza place. At the time, the restaurant below us was a pizza place with a very relaxed environment. It was only open 5 days a week with limited hours for dinner. Sometimes we could hear the music but it generally wasn’t a big issue and once or twice, I went downstairs and let them know it was louder than usual and they didn’t mind turning it down. 

However in August, said pizza place shut down and a local chain pizza place took their place. They are open 7 days a week, all day, and are much busier and much louder. Not long after they opened, I sent a friendly email to the manager and let him know that we had an understanding with the last place and would appreciate if they could be mindful of their upstairs neighbor and that we were looking forward to visiting them. The manager was very friendly and said it was no problem at all.

It’s been a few months and we’ve run into several problems with them. They’ve stolen our trash cans a few times which we trust was a mistake, but the kitchen staff has been leaving their trash and cigarettes on our stairs. Sometimes leaving crates or towels in the path blocking our stairs. It’s been frustrating and feels disrespectful. The music has also been gradually getting louder to the point that I can always hear it no matter what I’m doing. Even with the tv on or listening to other music. It’s hard to relax. 

I love our home here and the only downside is the constant noise. I don’t know what to do. The circumstances have changed since we signed the lease and I’m wondering if we have any rights because of this. Our landlord owns the whole building so he is renting it to us, the other upstairs apartment, and the pizza place. Can we approach the landlord and ask for an early lease break or reduced rent?

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",01Dec2019,1
961,"I’m quite torn

First and foremost, I’ll provide context to why I’m torn. Me and my ex of nearly two years (11 months previously before we got back together again) broke up going on 4 months ago. At first I was distraught, for the first three months I was but i slowly come to accept it more and more and I didn’t become happy but I was okay. It was due to the fact I didn’t try and talk to her more as time went on, and she had seriously little time for me that i actually healed, or so I thought.

About a week ago now she called me. No warning, few texts but it was completely about of the blue, she did this a couple months earlier when she was really upset about something, she came to me. She was down about a family friend (I learned a couple days later was now her boyfriend) had been arrested and she was very upset. I asked why she had called and she said she needed a friend, but I never knew she even classed me as friend anymore?? Anyway for the next couple days and mornings (I was off work) she called and we just chilled together, she commented on how nice it was to be around me again and even got a little jealous when I would get notifications (this wasn’t new, she used to always get nosey and jealous when my attention was diverted away.) Then I learned about how she had moved on, and I couldn’t bring myself around to being happy for her but actually being so hurt, but also happy he was being put in prison, so much so I couldn’t help but be honest, I thought it was best. This led to her going, understandably pissed at me, continuously calling me names saying she regrets ever meeting me, ever knowing me and some things that are too personal to reveal, they hurt a lot. The following day, she was seemingly docile until something reignited her and she started up again with all the abuse. I didn’t take it to heart as much, I know her well enough to know she was saying it out of hurt more than anything, trying to hurt me. I thought that whatever friendship we even had at that moment was lost, I thought I’d lost her for good. 
Until she called again that same night. I was so confused because by now I’ve probably given her every reason to hate me and yet here she was, she wanted to talk to me and she wanted me around for comfort. Even when I would offer to leave she refused to let me go and got visibly upset that I was leaving, it wasn’t necessarily that she wanted to be alone it was that I was there that she could keep herself together. She still shows me that warm loving smile she used to, she still cares deeply about how i feel and, dare I say she still comes to me for support. 
I realised why she had been around less and obviously she was around her boyfriend instead, but now I can’t stop asking why me of all people, her ex who emotionally drained her, who destroyed the relationship just because of how insecure and jealous he is, why would I be the one she relies on when she needs someone the most?
I’m torn because I want to see this girl blossom into the wonderful, most amazingly beautiful and intelligent woman I know she can be, but I also know her boyfriend doesn’t deserve her, and that goes without saying that I definitely don’t deserve her. I’m happy he was arrested, I’m happy he’s more than likely gonna be sentenced because he is guilty of what he’s done and I know he doesn’t love her. But I can’t say this to her because it simply isn’t my place, nor do I want to lose her anymore than I already have. I’ll be honest with you, I really don’t know what it is anymore. I guess really I’m just looking for someone to offer guidance or tell me I’m completely overthinking everything and/or tell me I’m just a jealous idiot. I just can’t make sense of the situation i am in.",01Dec2019,1
