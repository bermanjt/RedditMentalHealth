0,"For context, I'm 15M and have been with my GF for around 6 months now. We live about 40 minutes away from each other so that generally means that we only get to see each other once every one or 2 weeks. And as with any long (kinda) distance relationship, it can get tough every now and then. Age aside, I love her to bits and want to see her happy, so I always try my best to be supportive and caring of her.

To put it simply, she's had a rough going at school. A couple of years back some people at her school did some unthinkable things to her that I'm not going to divulge for her sake. As a result, she has been through a lot of trauma, self harming and has attempted suicide before, and I'm truly grateful that's she's still around. Understandably, I was really concerned for her mental health and still am. I've tried my best to create an environment where she can open up and not feel embarrassed or lonely, and she does talk to me about her feelings from time to time. She used to be on antidepressants but one day she told me she hadn't taken them for a whole and she felt OK. I was over the moon when I heard that she was improving. However, I do get really emotional when she brings the topic up, and then at any point (what I think is) my bipolar flares up and then shes the one who ends up comforting me, when it should be the other way round. I feel shitty for being like that, because compared to what she's gone through I feel like I'm worrying over nothing.

Recently she's been having panic attacks at school, and I hate the fact that I'm a 40 minute drive away and can't do anything about it to help her or comfort her in any way other than by text once school is over. If either one of us has a panic attack near each other, we both know what we have to do in order to comfort the other. She said that she's constantly worrying over things like how her breathing might be annoying everyone else, and I'm really concerned for her. I don't feel like I have a full grasp of what she's going through, as she gets kinda quiet and doesn't text much, like she doesn't really want to talk about it, I'm not sure. I'm just scared she's going to revert back to her state before, and I'm scared that it's gonna be my fault because I didn't help her well enough. 

She has talked with school support and now she can walk out of a classroom at any time if she feels like she's going to have a panic attack, which seems to have helped a little.

Some advice on what I can do to help her in any way possible, even the tiniest thing, is very much needed as I feel out of my depth here. I want to be useful and do something that will actually benefit her. Do I seek professional help? If so how do I help her navigate around parents? I'm really at a loss. 

Im getting really emotional writing this down, so please point out any errors or questions you have for me. I've probably missed out things. 

Thank you in advance for your time, it really means a lot.

1,"I'm in high school, not gonna say my grade or age but I've known I'm gay/bisexual for a while now. I'm not the stereotypical gay person and I've been told by many that I'm attractive and I've been approached by many girls before. I have little to no sexual interest in girls and only see girls as a way to create a social life and have a relationship so I avoid dating girls as not to hurt them emotionally. Lots of straight guys do gay stuff just to joke around which makes it easy for me to blend in but yet some people have (mostly privately) asked if I was gay and of course I acted offended and strongly denied it but this is getting pretty old and I'm dying to share my feelings with someone. I haven't told a single soul (besides some 'trusted' random strangers on the internet) that I'm gay so I haven't lost my coming out v-card therefore I have no idea how I would come out to somebody. I'm not attracted to openly gay people who talk like girls and dress like girls and walk with their hand upside down in front of them (you know what I mean) rather, I like cute, somewhat athletic and confident boys who are most likely straight asf so it's hard for me to find a relationship without coming out. I'll just get to the point; how should I go about opening up to someone and how do I know that I can trust them enough to spill the beans. yikes",20Mar2019,1

9,"I met a girl last year on a night out, I got her snapchat. But because I got drunk later that night I totally forgot the next morning that I added her, so I never messaged her.

Fast forward to a few weeks back, I matched with her on Tinder. I messaged first, she responded. Then I asked her if I had her on snapchat as I recognised her, then she said she remembered me from last year but she didnt remember if we had each other on snapchat. So instead of continuing the conversation I decided to move it to Snapchat. I messaged her “hi”, she opened it but didnt reply. Bear in mind I didnt mention that we should move over to snapchat, i just did it.

Decided to wait until the next day as I was out of the house. Snapchatted her again with “hey”, opened but no reply.

Its been a couple weeks and I didnt bother to message her again thinking she must have lost interest.

But Im debating on trying again, this time back on Tinder. But Im super unconfident in text messaging girls because I find it hard to get a good read on people through texts. Should I give it another go or would I come across as desperate, considering she blanked me twice on Snapchat.

10,"So Taco Bell was hiring people a little different than most places by having you come in and you’d fill out your application in the restaurant and then they automatically give you an interview right there. Well I did all that and they wanted me to get a background check done. That’s understandable and I have no problem with that. The problem is that about a week and half later they call me on a Friday and tell me what I need for work and to come next Wednesday. I think it’s a bit of a problem that the manager didn’t even tell me what time to come in. Well earlier today I called them so I’d know what time. Even though it was the same lady who did my interview and originally told me to come Wednesday she said it was someone else I talked to (I could tell from her voice). Anyways she asked if I was coming to work and I told her yes even though I really don’t know what I’m coming for entirely. The concerns I have with this is that they initially didn’t tell me what time to come in, it’s as if they didn’t even know a new worker was supposed to be coming in the next day, they didn’t know what it was I was coming for despite me giving my name, and they seem kinda disorganized. Is any of this stuff normal for a fast food restaurant? Should I just give up and go try my luck somewhere else? I don’t want to be picky but if their that disorganized then it’s a bit of a problem not just for me but also themselves. It would also explain the 4 different “now hiring” signs they had in front of their building.

11,"Back story, my bf and I have been together about 5 years, own a home together. No plans of having kids or getting married pretty easy going. He is high functioning on the aspergers spectrum, funny, intelligent and a steady rock, not overly emotional. 
I just got back from spending 2 days with my mum who is going through cancer treatment. And my boyfriend (27) has been pretty down lately, but whenever he's down he clams up, says hes ""fine"" whenever I ask him if he feels okay and I can never crack an answer out of him. Occasionally he has opened up about his family life, and it was quite traumatic (alcoholic abusive father, mother died when he was 18 of cancer, family abandoned him)
I got home and asked him if he was feeling any better. He said ""well I've been meaning to talk to you about something that is a bit awkward""
I grabbed on to this moment and managed to get this ""secret"" he wanted to tell me.
He went on to say he ""thinks he was sexually assaulted"" when he was a kid.
Me: do you think or know?
Bf: know
I immediately just grabbed him and hugged him and told him I loved him etc and stayed like that for what seemed like ages because I didn't want to over whelm him
I didn't want to ask too many questions so I said
Me:is this person close to you?
Bf: not anymore
Me: does this person have contact with children?
Bf: yeah he has kids now
He says he doesn't want to report anything but he doesn't know what he should do.
He went on to say that when he was 11/12 his cousin (16yo male) assaulted him.
I didn't want to ask him details because I didn't want to upset him. I supported him as much as I could and thanked him for telling me and that if he wanted to talk to me about it again he can and I will always be there for him and I suggested talking to a professional if he needs to. 
But I'm still not sure what I can do to support him more, I'm so upset that such a horrible thing happened to him and it breaks my heart.
What can I do to help him? Should I get him to talk about it more? Shall I let it lie and wait for him to talk to me? Should I encourage him to prosecute or will that just hurt him more?

12,"There's this person I have recently have become friends with. This friend has been very friendly towards me and has always approached me and been comfortable and candid with me, overall a great human being. After a couple of months later today I was told that she's a woman and that I completely mistook her gender. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the reason I mistook her gender, was because she always dressed in boyish clothes and never seen her wear feminine clothing, ever. Also she goes to the gym religiously does engineering (a men dominated field) and has a fairly butch body. She also has a masculine presence from the way she talks and the way she presents herself. Though I wasn't alone, a couple of my friends mistook her gender too, and we were all talking about it recently. Some of my friends made the mistake by laughing at one of my other friends when he correctly referred to her as a ""she"", some forgot her gender and some didn't know her true gender till that point. But the girl was very mature and didn't seemed to be phased by it at all, and truly enjoyed herself for the rest of the evening. At that point I didn't have a clue why those guys were laughing, until recently.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel terrible for mistaking her gender especially when people have teased me for being feminine and calling me a girl when I was young and still rarely till this day. I feel like I should apologise to her, and let her know how amazing she is, and how admirable it was the way she conducted herself. I personally find her to be gorgeous regardless of her gender, so I don't want her feel that she is not. 

Should I apologise and let her know, or just ignore and move on?",20Mar2019,1
13,"I’ve known this girl since kindergarten, and we were best friends in elementary school, but drifted a bit apart in middle school and we’re currently in high school and still close. For as long as I have known her, she has never shown emotion or empathy. I’ve only seen her show emotion (more than very fleeting) twice in the ten years I’ve known her, both of which when she was younger and got very mad about things not going her way, once was at her birthday party, when after some people got into an argument she made everyone go into separate rooms and argue and insult each other until everything got worked out. The other time was in a fight with a friend back in elementary school. She’s very charismatic and gravitational, to the point where everyone in the room likes her. She is very controlling and manipulative. For example, frequently she will get mad at someone for doing something very very minor, like steal a chip, and completely ignore them for the rest of lunch, or when in a group of 3, to make one jealous, she’ll completely isolate them from the conversation. Once, we went to the mall, and we went into Sephora. As a joke, I took a bit of bright purple eyeshadow, and put a bit on her arm. She got really mad and wouldn’t talk to me, even when I was apologizing, until after I offered her a dollar, and she said two if she was going to forgive me. I gave them to her. I didn’t really think about it at the time, but looking back it just looks all sorts of wrong. In the moment I thought nothing of it, I was too pulled in by her gravity to really think. I’ve confided in a mutual friend about my feelings, and both of us agree that we think she wears some kind of a ‘mask’ of a personality. It’s stuff like this and more, but I just want to give you guys a picture of what it is. She has good grades, is in theatre with me, and had a relationship that lacked a lot of emotional depth (from an outsider and friends prospective) but was very physical. The problem is, I know even if she’s not a sociopath or a psychopath, which I think she may be from what I’ve read, I still care deeply for her. She was my first best friend, and I love her (platonically). No matter what I can’t just leave her, friendship wise. We have so many mutual friends, and I know she would suck me back in. So my big question is, is she a sociopath? A psychopath? A narcissist? Something else completely? None of these? And what do I do to protect myself without shutting her off?

17,"I've been seeing this girl on/off (Mostly on, especially the last 6-8 months straight.) for over a year now. But I feel like we are almost at the same level we were in our first month.  I have this sinking feeling that she doesn't really care about me at all, the only time she seems to get excited is when we have sex, or occasionally when we go out to do photography that she enjoys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am (34m) she is (36F.) and we don't fight really, we dont argue, neither of us are particularly angry ever or anything, but I have a lot of building frustrations and this might get a bit all over the place, but i'll try to make this make sense, I just want to know if I am the issue, or if perhaps my feelings are a little off, it wouldn't be the first time I was a bit too into my own head. 

&amp;#x200B;

So she has a job where she enjoys the job mostly, but doesn't like one or two of her co workers. She has a really, really hard time divesting her personal life/life outside work, from her workplace ( I think we all can be guilty of this sometimes though.) this in itself doesn't bother me at all, but every time this one co worker does something stupid, or that she doesn't like, she can totally lose her shit. Suddenly its ""I'm quitting and moving away!"" and she does this every month or so, this reaction. I have told her a few times that telling me she is moving away suddenly every time she gets upset like that really hurts, and that it makes me feel like I am not valued or that I don't matter. She has acknowledged this but....not -really-. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried many times to have her back, presented tons of solutions, like changing jobs within the company, even offering to support her as she re-trains, everything I could possibly offer to help with this negative workplace situation. But for every solution or offer that I make, she has 10 negative reasons to ignore it, they are mostly really silly too, like ""Well what if X happens"" or ""What if I dont always have x hours"" ect ect ect, mostly ""what if's"". I am a person who has done this, who has re-trained for a COMPLETELY different job, I work in Tech now, and I used to be a chef, so my advice in this regard is actually coming from a place of experience. It boils down to, I feel, that she doesn't value my opinion at all in this, or basically anything else I have come to find. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is hard to express, but it feels as if she has a sort of ""bubble"" of negativity that she has created around herself, and every time I try to reach into it, or try to help in any way, she is immediately dismissive or comes up with 10 negative things to throw out rather than coming up with any sort of solutions or even having a proper discussion about any solutions. It's always negative, I am constantly dismissed, my opinions are dismissed, I mean hell, we are both gamers, and I tried to introduce her to a game I was enjoying only for her to constantly complain and complain about it until I just gave up and never invited her to play it with me again because it was such an awful exercise in frustration for me. I do genuinely enjoy a lot of the things she does, and I am willing to try new things I have not tried to see if I do like them (Such as the photography, which I have found I am enjoying.), but she does not seem to care at all about any of the things I enjoy, or, for that matter, care about even trying them for more then 5 minutes.  

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, to me, with her always dismissing my opinions, solutions, or anything without even discussing it, her constant, draining negativity every time anything is discussed, her unwillingness to even -try- to go outside of this negative bubble she has wrapped herself in, it boils down to ""Does she even actually give a shit about me at all?"" Because it doesn't feel like she actually cares. It feels like as long as im fucking her and as long as she gets to vent to me and we get to do the things she wants to do, then she wants to be around me, but it is starting to feel incredibly shallow. I don't really feel valued as a person besides a thing to fuck and an occasional emotional crutch until she decides where she wants to run away to. She doesn't care about my opinions, my wants, what I need (Or this is how it feels.), anything that doesn't confirm her personal constantly negative outlook is dismissed or buried under more negativity, and it makes me feel like shit.

I, a 23yo Female, rarely use facebook. The only reason I maintain the account is because my friends use it for sharing pictures. However, a few weeks ago I signed a political petition. There was a button that said ""share with facebook."" I thought ""ehh, why not.. good cause/message"" and hit send. Fast forward to today, and I get a text from my sister, ""Call me ASAP."" Upon calling, she tells me that three or four people from my hometown sought out my extremely conservative grandfather (who raised me) and told him that ""I had gone off the deep end"" and that this was ""more evidence that I wasn't raised right.""

29,"\*This is going to be a VERY long post\* 

TLDR: my boyfriend and I are getting married next year and I need help on if I should invite my father to the wedding or not, father is a bit of a toxic person. All routes of solution seem to be regrettable\*

I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible while keeping all of the key details to the story. My boyfriend and I have been dating for seven years now, and we finally discussed getting married. We have our date; our venue, our rings, our guest list, the whole 9 yards, but what I am conflicted on is if I should invite my father to our wedding. My boyfriend is very supportive of my decision, but I cannot come to one at this time. My father and I have always had a tough relationship. He was never the one to sit down and gush about his feelings, tell you about his day, or confide his hopes and dreams to you. He was never abusive, he has never been inappropriate to me, he's just been a quiet 'simple' man. Growing up my father was a car mechanic and he never liked to do much other than work on cars, go hunting, and fishing. He didn't really like to play catch, he has a few problems with his back so he could never do any physical activity, just hunting, fishing, and working on cars. When I got a little bit older into my highschool years my fathers back problems started to get worse so he took to pills. His mood became more intolerable, (grumpy, didn't want to talk much, more reclusive) he was griping about how everything is 'shitty' the house, things that need to be fixed, going hunting is shitty, going crabbing is shitty. Soon our favorite activities turned into chores which involved fits of anger and frustration from him. This behavior of his started to sour the relationship my father had with my brother, my father took most of his frustration out in front of my brother talking to him like he was one of the guys at the autoshop instead of his son. When my brother was old enough he moved far away with his girlfriend, now wife. When I was old enough and I met my S/O, I moved in with him and his family, as soon as my brother and I moved out of the house, and I graduated high school, My mother divorced my father. He was not contributing toward their relationship in any means especially financially and that left my father with nothing. His toxic and reclusive habits have burned bridges with just about everyone in the family so now all my father has left is me. Recently his pill habit has gotten much worse, or so I thought until it turned out my father has been on heroine for the past five years. When his heroine addiction got brought to light my uncle (my mothers brother who graciously let my father live with them rent free during the onset of the divorce) kicked him out and told him he needed to go to rehab during one of his withdrawal episodes. The rehab facility wasn't open/taking in any 'patients' during the weekend so my father had to stay at our townhouse. (which is already cramped and filled with roommates) the weekend turned into an entire week while my father kept trying to find ways out of rehab and onto a permanent spot on our sofa in the commons area. Figuring out his plan of living off us for free since he spent all of his money on drugs, we told him he could no longer stay with us. He wasn't going to contribute to us while living there but continue to find money for drugs and that wasn't going to happen since my father has never contributed anything towards me. He is now living in he car where he can still using heroine but he constantly talks to me on the phone how ""Good it is just to talk to me"" and ""how I mean the world to him"" ""how much he appreciates everything I've helped him through"". I'm so torn, I know what he is capable of when it comes to one of his drug induced episodes, the nodding off at dinner because he's high on heroine, calling me crying because he's drunk and is thinking of the past, getting black out drunk at my cousins wedding which I missed because I had to babysit him. I let him come over from time to time to have a hot meal, to shower and wash his clothes, but he doesn't come around much. He only calls me when hes drunk/high, or he needs something. I'm afraid if I invite him to the wedding it's going to be hell. He finally found out about my mother getting remarried, (which I kept secret because I was afraid my dad would go on an emotional rampage and take it out on me) and my step-father (who has been more of a father to me than my real father) is going to be part of our wedding ceremony. I don't want to take away my step-fathers role of walking me down the isle because he's been such a wonderful step-dad to me, but I'm afraid my father will cause a scene, or emotionally break down and drink himself into a scene during the reception. I'm also taking away the father daughter dance and replacing the father roll with my mother since she has been a mother and a father to me. Again I'm afraid to do this because I don't want it to cause a scene. In addition even if I walk down the isle by myself or don't have a dance at all I'm afraid my father will cause a scene since he has not been around any of my family especially my mother and step-father since the divorce, and I'm going to regret it. I'm also going to regret not inviting him because that will literally crush his feelings and send him into a possible K-hole which might ultimately push him to killing himself. 

\*In conclusion: if I invite him it could be an entire fiasco and I'll regret it, or I don't invite him and it could be an entire fiasco and I'll regret it. Please help\* ",20Mar2019,2

34,"I’m a 21yr old Female who feels like she’s not meant for college despite how much I’m forcing myself to go. I’m in Nursing school, and about 3 years ago I had to drop out to seek medical attention due to a nervous breakdown and severe eating disorder. Following that and going against all medical advice, I went back to school blaming all of my issues on my stressful major, this time transferring and majoring in English Education. I hated it and cried every day, but managed to make it through the semester. I took another year off to work and decided I should just go back to Nursing school, and here I am in a 20 credit course load missing class because I can’t keep up with my health, both mentally and physically. I cry every night thinking about everything I have due and having to wake up in the morning. 

That being said, I love working. I’ve worked at the same vet office for 6 years and I love waking up and going every day. I don’t think I’m a lazy person, I just hate school. 

I’m looking for any words of wisdom. If you comment for me to stop being a baby and just finish school, like I tell myself every day, I still will. I just want anyone’s opinion or guidance.

35,"Here's a bit of backstory:

I'm a 18F and I started working at a local fast food joint about a month ago, so I haven't really met everyone yet, or at least, have been scheduled with them. Very recently, they moved me to morning shifts so now I got to meet new faces. One guy came up to me and introduced himself, I thought it was very nice because I haven't really talked to anyone besides him and another girl, since I'm shy, it makes it hard for me to befriend people who don't talk to me first. He kept joking around and stuff, so I was pretty happy about making a new friend... or at least that's what I thought he just wanted to be.

After two days, he asked me for my snap so I gave it to him and he didn't wait to text me, like literally right after clocking out he sent me a message. We texted a bit back and forth before I said I had to go and he said ""Goodnight, sweetie."" and I felt so terrible, so I didn't read or reply. Today, I pretended not to see the message and we started talking about normal stuff, y'know? Nothing eluding to liking him, and he literally said ""I think I'm starting to like you..."" and I closed the chat. I'm frustrated because #1, I only wanted a friend, and #2, I don't know how to come right out and say it. The reason I don't know how is because I've handled situations similar to this one so terribly, and they began to happen after I got in a relationship with my current BF of three years. I also didn't expect this to happen at this point at my job, in fact, I thought it would be the last thing to happen. Now, I have to either say ""I'm not interested"" or ""Can we please just stay friends?""

I don't want any hate or anything, I'm **really inexperienced** in social situations and my social anxiety makes it really bad, and no guy has ever confessed after a week of working together. What is the best way to tell a guy I want to remain friends? If he doesn't want to, what's the best way to enjoy my work environment without tension between me and this guy?",20Mar2019,1

43,"Throw away and I dont know if this is the sub for this, sorry. I'm an 18 year old guy and life just doesn't feel as good as everything kind of mounts up. So I went through a break up back in November that hit me hard as we assumed be good friends after and all that and after about a week she ended up hating me and we never talked since. Understandable, I wasnt the best bf to her at times and its a break up it happens. I dropped out of uni cause I was failing and I went there for her really at the start as we dated for a while. Of course lessons learned and I came home and I got accepted to a new college for September something I feel confident in and job searched just landing a fairly nice job in the past month as well as meeting another girl. 

Now of course Im not saying I have the worst situation at all. Its just that all these things feel empty and its been months since I closed that chapter of my life. It's as though I still miss my ex as we did everything together and she had been typing to me on Snapchat a few times the past few months and its dumb I get excited like she'll send something but she doesnt, even on Valentine's day when I made a post with my new gf she was typing after she seen it and she was typing for 5 minutes till I checked the chat and on snap you can see if someone is checking the chat and she stopped typing and that was the last time she did. I thought that was the path my life was going to go down and I know Im still young but it feels like this how things will go from here just winging it and unsure. The girl I've been seeing is really nice and has a lot going for her as she's in uni for journalism and already getting paid to write for two newspapers. We are long distance though so I'm not use to this and I've been trying to build a connection but I have my second doubts a lot as it doesnt feel the same and I only see her once a month at the moment. Some of my friends say to drop it and others say to wait cause distance and her summer vacation is soon. 

I also thought with coming home I'd be happier and be so busy with friends and I was doing something with a different friend almost everyday for the first month when I got back but now it's about once a week. I spent so much time with my ex when I was home I lost touch I feel with some friends and leaving for uni only made it worse as I was nowhere close to them. A lot of them are busy with school or had made new friends and groups that I feel by myself at times as I missed out on chances with my friends here.

I started going on these long 3 hour walks or random bus rides when I dont work or when friemnds are busy and I dont have plans for the day cause I dont like feeling alone in the house or playing games. I feel I need to be constantly on the move to be happy to say I did something today and makes me forget about it all or think about stuff and it sucks that I end up in places I have a memory of my ex in sometimes as dumb as it is and I feel I should be past this by now. I want to make new friends too in town or find a relationship like I had before were I can have someone to do almost anything with. Im nervous with college and if I fail at this course or I wont like it like my last one. I still dont know how to feel about the girl I'm seeing now as I'm told dating always feels different. It's dumb I probably have it made to some people but I'm not happy with it like I was happy before. There's a feeling and aesthetic I want in my life right now but the aesthetic currently for me just feels sad and gray and I dont know what to do with everything and how to stop feeling mad at life and just kind of grasp the calm kind person I felt as I was before.

There are 2 other guys that like her, and she knows about them liking her. One of them is actually pretty good looking and is sort of popular, but he is a bit of a jerk. She doesn’t like him at all, but considers him a brother. The other guy that likes her is a junior and is pretty handsome, but weird and also they have a 3 year age difference. She doesn’t like him either. And then there is me. I’m pretty ugly and I am not funny nor am I popular. We share some interests, but thats about it. I am short and chubby, so I don’t have looks in my favor. I am socially awkward, and absolutely cringey in a bad way. Lastly, she is in the top 15% of our class, and I am in the top 25% of the class. I feel like she is out of my league.

49,"I am a 22 year old woman living with what I can only assume to be severe anxiety.
I first had a panic attack when I was 15, I randomly felt like I could not breathe, and went to the hospital thinking it was an asthma attack only to find that nothing was physically wrong with me.
After that when I was 16 and 17 I had these random feelings of surrealness or hyper awareness. It's hard to explain but it felt sort of like I was realizing how strange the world was and when I thought to hard about something big like how my body functioned or how gravity worked I felt a sense of fear like everything might fall apart at any moment.
In classes I sometimes got these feelings of breathlessness or panic and would run out, and these feelings followed me after graduation. I am very naive about drugs and a friend tricked me into smoking pot once when I was 19 which caused me the worst panic attack ever and I felt like I was stuck in a very realistic nightmare. It was awful and seemed to make my anxiety worse after. Since then I've had moments at work where I'm helping someone and all of a sudden I feel the need to run away, it is truly horrible. I've also gone through bouts of hypochondria and excessively visiting the doctor. Recently my friend gave me what she said was a honey stick with cbd oil in it, and it gave me another panic attack, this one so bad I wanted to be sedated or something. But afterward I found out the honey stick was just that, honey. Which means I made myself panic. The past few weeks have been bad. When I'm in the car I sometimes feel stuck and panicky, and I hyperventilate and think I will lose my mind or something. The one thing I can say though, is that symptoms nearly always go away when I get home or when I am with my dad or boyfriend. And they are always worst when I am at work or a place where there is no easy escape. Anyway, I have not been diagnosed and I can not afford to see someone right now, so I was hoping for some advice. I know it sounds extream but these panic attacks only happen once in a while, it's just that when they do they scare the hell out of me. So anyone who has gone through something simiar or knows of any ways to help over come this it would be greatly appreciated. Also if anyone has taken medication that truely did help, I would love to know too. Thank you to anyone who read this far, hope to hear from someone.",20Mar2019,1
50," I'm not sure what to do. I'm only in my 2nd year of college, and I'm still undeclared. I've failed a few class, and done average in most but a few. It's so hard, but the hardest thing for me is I have no strive, no passion. I'm not sure what path I want to continue, and when I seek help from other people, I get in general two responses. One is, life's hard and it doesn't really matter if you do something you like, as long as you make money because money plays a big part in the quality of life you have. The other is directly the opposite, do something you like because you're not going to enjoy working in something you dislike. But I'm not sure, for both. I don't know what path to take.

I have to passion for school. I never really had. It was something I have to do so that I could get a job, I'm pretty sure many people would agree with me. I don't really know how to study. I never had to in high school because my high school was really easy. Before that, in elementary and middle school, I was as bad as I am now in college. I thought from my grades in high school that I had cleaned up my act, but it merely just how easy my the academic at my high school was.

I throw myself at games to ease my depression. Maybe because I have a passion to play games, maybe because I know that I can be a better person in the game than I could ever be in the real world. Games has been where I've made a good amount of my friends, and it's what connected me to the little friends I was able to make back then. It's my 2nd year in college, and I've still made no friends here. The only friend I made, is someone I met in a game who happens to go to my school, but I can't expect them to solely fill the gap for the lack of friends I have, even though they mean a lot to me, I don't want to be a burden to them. People might say I'm addicted to gaming. And they aren't wrong. But it's the only place I can feel safe. I actually have the ability to do something to progress myself, unlike I do in the real world.

Growing up, I was really just content with working in an office. Seeing my older siblings working there, I always thought it was fine if I did too. But I guess things are different for me. They were children raised in a life where my parents were newly immigrants here in America. I was born in the world where my siblings took care of me, I grew up with all these technologies, I grew up in a better, more well off life than them. One of the reasons why I considered putting myself through a degree that I may not like in order to get money, was to pay them off. They've done so much for me, and I just want to be able to pay them back, but it's starting to look like I can't, because I'm a failure. I wasn't expecting college to be like this. Maybe I wouldn't be the top student, but at least I would be somewhere right now.

It's honestly really hard to do this alone. My siblings were more like parents to me, they are much older than me, and so my relationship isn't that close and personal with them. I can't talk to them about how hard it is for me, how much lack of passion I've been having for school. I never really had friends that talked about this stuff too. I grew up as a gamer, and the friends I made irl, we basically only gamed together. I've made friends in game too, but it wasn't until recently I found friends who I could share my more personal side with. I made four friends online, we were all online friends ( I've been met one irl and continue to do so), but things happened and I'm no longer friends with three of them. The one friend that I met irl, means the world to me. If for some reason you find this post (which I doubt you will) I can never thank you enough for being in my life, you changed the meaning of friendship for me, and my friendship with you is something I've never had with anyone before. Thank you, I love you from the bottom of my heart.

Honestly I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so ashamed of myself. Sometimes at night, I just breakdown in bed and think about what a failure I am. I pray that my roommate doesn't hear me, but sometimes I can't help it. I've thought about running away, so that I'm not a burden to my family anymore. I'm not sure. I'm pretty sure I'm close to being expelled from school due to my poor performance. I really don't know anymore. I'm so lost, what can I do.

52,"A little background. I work for a bank, in a department that isn't customer facing, but our tasks are time sensitive and need to be done in a certain window of time. It's essentially data entry and we're correcting images of tellers work. 

I am the assistant manager and my manager is a piece of work to say the least. She has horrible people skills and can't communicate effectively. I know it's really useless to diagnose people, but a part of me thinks she has issues with reading people's emotions and comes off incredibly rude. 

To give you an example of her temperament, she never says hello or good morning when she walks into the office, if you say it to her, she rarely responds. If you go to her desk to ask something, she generally continues typing and kind of pretends you're not there and just says ok, and gives off a big vibe that you're annoying her. 

She doesn't like to be corrected and is very sensitive about even hinting at telling her she missed something or didn't do something. 

My whole department walks on pins and needles with her. 

We've been having software issues lately that need to be addressed immediately in order for us to finish our work. If she's not in the office, I get cracking on it right away and everyone asks me if I'm aware of it.

If she's in the office, no one wants to mention if she's noticed, in fear that she'll respond with a rude ""yes"". Often times she won't notice for quite some time. 

She brought it up to me today and asked why no one says anything. She's asked me before about some of our team's behavior and I don't know how to address that she basically intimidates everyone. Moral here is horrible. I try to pick up the slack where I can and help build the bridge between everyone, but she has no clue how her attitude effects everyone here. 

Is there any way I can address this in a professional way while avoiding hurting her feelings?

Tl;Dr: My manager's bad attitude intimidates everyone in our department and has created a pattern of bad communication.

We still live together. He said he was still okay with it, but I am starting to think I am not comfortable with it.

56," 

I  am currently a Junior in HS, and I play for my school's varsity  baseball team. I am a pretty good player, although there are a decent  amount of players that are better than me, and I am far from the best  player on the team. I work hard in practice, but I have a very demanding  schedule. I often have to pick and choose between activities, and  baseball usually wins. I also get home late, and have to do a lot of  homework, as it I go to a very challenging school.

Last  year, we got a new baseball coach. He is a teacher at my school, and is  EXTREMELY passionate about baseball. He used to go to my school, and  was the star of the team there. Although he brought our team from a 0-18  record to a 6-12 record, I could tell that he took an immediate dislike  to me. I'm a pretty goofy guy, and I also have ADHD and hearing  problems. This, coupled with my tendency to ask stupid/clarification  questions did not sit well with him at all. He constantly yelled at me,  made fun of me, hit a ball over the fence and told me to run and get it,  and once benched me for six games because I forgot to bring my  uniform(my mom had washed it by accident). Even my teammates acknowledge  how much he hates me.

This  year, my schedule is more demanding than ever. However, this is also  ""the year"" for our baseball team, as we have several players who will be  moving on next year. I want to play on the team, but I also can't make  it to practice every day. For example, one day I needed to get a haircut  (a one hour 30 minute ordeal). Because I had time between the end of  school, I went to two dance practices and was able to then get extra  studying done for the two tests I had the next day. Although I told him  beforehand, my coach was livid and yelled at me for the tiniest mistakes  the next practice (ex: not leading off of a base correctly, tagging  with my arms out instead of keeping them in). I have to miss practice  again tomorrow(psychiatrist appointment), and we have our first game on  Friday.

I  really want to play this year, but I also want to occasionally do other  things. My dad thinks that I should not show up to practices,  occasionally leave in the middle, and act disinterested but play super  well at the same time. He says not to ""be the coach's bitch"" and that  the coach will play me if he sees that I don't go to practices after I  am benched. However, I don't want to do this due to social pressures  from the team who want me to go to practices, and fear of getting yelled  at by the coach.

How do I handle this situation? Any advice is appreciated. Ask me for clarification if needed.",20Mar2019,2
57,"I was walking home today and found a wint-o-green life-saver on the ground. I picked it up and forgot about it. Now I’m debating on whether or not I should eat it.

It’s still in the clear packaging, but there’s a little dirt on it and I can’t tell if it’s still sealed.

I remembered how it middle school you would chomp down real hard and the “sparks” would land in your mouth and I got nostalgic for middle school again

I really want to chomp hard on this life-saver but I’m not sure if I’d die afterwards. Is it worth it?

They are only about 75% funded for it and I suspect the dinner is a disguise for asking me to provide monthly financial support for them.

there is a lot of context that I should give but it would take to much of your time. I just got out of a relationship that was the absolute  best (in my opinion base on the guy(I'm gay)) and he said the obvious stuff how we need to improve our selves. here is the the thing, I'm broke. Live in the south Houston area and I worked in a well paying job for years but it was killing me (water mitigation) I've got ten years experience in this so it's hard to find a decent paying job when you have so much experience in a field you don't want to work in so finding a job to earn more money has been hard.

62,"Im going to try and keep this as short and right to the point as I can. I want to give some backstory.

Up until i was 18, i lived in a home with my mom, dad and brother. My mom cheated on my dad (hes a narcissistic shit) that was in 2002. After that they did not communicate all while living in the same house. They would communicate on a sheet of paper left on the counter. My dad did not speak... it was scary to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, with that being said, I naturally gravitated towards my mom. She had me involved in figure skating for majority of my life. I begged to quit here and there, but never could get out of it due to her control. I never really liked it.

Fast forward to when i turned 18, i met the love of my life and moved in with him. we were DIRT poor, but it was the happiest time of my life. My family back at home, they were middle classed, lived in a private community, but my God it was dark and depressing.

&amp;#x200B;

I became pregnant with my first baby, my mom asked us to live with her so she could help (at this point my parents got divorced and she won the house). I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and PPD. Currently, im dealing with it well with no meds. We move to a bigger house and I get pregnant with my 2nd.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW. My boyfriend makes around $45,000 a year, and im a SAHM. we have a decent amount of money. every time ive brought up moving out, my mother will threaten to move into a Nursing Home. She will go on rants about how family is supposed to stay together, say she bought this house so we could live here together forever. Mind you, Myself, my boyfriend and our 2 kids are crammed into 1 bedroom. We want to move out, but she wont ""let"" us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heres where i need advice. I have been flip flopping between cosmetology (im VERY much into beauty, and begged to study it in highschool but she didnt let me) and becoming a physician's assistant. i have a slight intrest in medicine. Having watched my brother have a mental breakdown, then being diagnosed with psychosis, while in college due to stress has only amplified my true love for a more simple life. I am supposed to go on a tour to a cosmo school tomorrow, and shes trying to scare me out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

She is insisting i study something else, medicine, politics, science, something that will bring in big money. Shes constantly telling me about how terrified she is that we wont be able to survive if something happens to her(she makes around $80,000 a year). But the only reason we are still living here is because she throws a hissy fit every time we bring up moving out. She will always compare me to herself and tell me about how her parents never let her study cosmetology because it was inconsistent and not enough money. Yet shes a chemist now, who hates every aspect of her current work. i want more babies. i want more privacy. i want to have loud sex with my boyfriend. He refuses to propose to me while we are living under my mothers roof, and i completely understand that. hes a working man who can provide, and wants to do only that.

&amp;#x200B;

Do i take her advice and go against my will of happiness only for the sake of money? do i focus on my mental health, and true desire of my heart? i feel absolutely ridiculous even having to ask this question on here. Shes scared me out of things my entire life, and at this point i only feel brainwashed. Sorry for the long post.",20Mar2019,2
63,"I have a complicated issue that happened all in one day.
Today my little brother went to school, and the teacher noticed he has a red mark on the side of his head. The teacher asks what happened and my brother says he forgot. For me, it was near the end of the school day, and I was preparing to head home when I was called to the office. A person from Children’s Aid Society was there to ask me questions. I originally though it was a survey so I answered the questions. The person started off by asking simple questions, almost to make it seem I was doing a survey. Here is where I messed up, they asked me if my parents had ever hit me, and I said yes (which can be said the same by every other Asian child). The person asked me how they would hit me, and my parents would hit me, but not hard with these wooden barbecue skewers. At the end, the person reveled she was there because the teacher suspected abuse at our home, which isn’t really true. The person said they were coming to visit our home, and that they already got our address from our school. Now when they come, they interview my parents, and they apparently got into trouble. I remember hearing that the person say to my parents that they hit me with METAL barbecue skewers which I never said. I honestly don’t know what to do, they misinterpreted what I said or manipulated it, and now my parents are in trouble.",20Mar2019,1
65,"I’m on mobile so I apologize.

I am one year out of high school, and I currently work a full time 8-4:30 receptionist job at a nursing home. I generally enjoy my job, mostly because I love working with the residents &amp; people. However, I’m about $400-500 short a month of being able to move out. I’d also like to start taking classes at a college, but I didn’t receive much from FAFSA and can not afford that either.

Last week, one of my coworkers asked if I would be interested in a part-time office manager job at a church he is the pastor at. I have no management experience, and I think it would look great on my resume.

The job would be 12 hours a week with a partially flexible schedule. However, since I am out of town every weekend, this means 3 days a week I would have to work 12-14 hour days, going from one job to the next.

I struggle with depression, and find myself feeling constantly exhausted as it is. I need the extra money, however I’m not sure if I could handle the extra hours at the moment. I’m also worried if it did end up being too much, I’ll be breaking ties with a coworker.

If anyone has advice or experience with working multiple jobs or dealing with depression I would really appreciate it. If I took the job i could most likely afford to move out or go to school- but I feel like I’d be working my life away.

66,"I want to say first that most of my life I lived in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan, though technically being an Asian country, is not really an Asian country in my opinion. 40% of population is Russian, all Kazakhs speak Russian, and we don't have any sort of Asian food that you'd normally think of. 

That being said, I for some reason have never thought of myself as of an 'Asian' because I have never done any of those typical Asian things.

Anyway, 2 years ago I went to study in Netherlands and immediately started to face these jokes all the time. I act cool but I really feel offended every time somebody says one of those stupid jokes.

(Me)- I can't see that guy's face

(Somebody else)- Oh, is that because you have small eyes?

&amp;#x200B;

(Me)- Yeahh, I think you're taller than me

(Somebody)- Yes of course, you are an asian, asians are small

&amp;#x200B;

And it's just a couple examples of what I get every day. 

I can't help but feel deeply offended. All of those jokes just enforce the notion of a 'funny little Asian' or that Asians are weird and should be made fun of. And even though maybe those people don't think this way, I get a feeling they think that they're superior just because they're not Asians. It's almost as if being an Asian means that you're of a lower class or something.

Anyways so the rope actually marked up my neck from what was going on but not too bad just some cut lines and scars. SO i go to work and one of the girls actually confronts me but she asked me just what happened to my neck? i said nothing i just was drunk and had a necklace on too tight and it got caught and ripped so i had scratches. she was like, ""are you really trying to lie to me, ive been abused before i know what it looks like."" Which i get because ive already survived a DV relationship and i guess it did look like that? But i was just like ""no seriously I'm not even f\*cking anyone like I've been alone/celibate."" She just kept going, seeing if i needed help and she said she's going to talk to HR?

I can't cop out because I would get looked at WAY worse and they would all gossip if they knew i tried to take my own life. And then didnt even succeed is terrible. BUT if i lie and say im abused then what type of person would i be. The scratches are a little too high to even be considered a necklace and when i said it that just flew out of my mouth but its not believable. Word vomit i guess.

72,"My neighbors moved in shortly after we (my 2 year old and I) did, last summer. It’s a family of three, and sometimes grandma. Thus far, I never really noticed anything too suspicious until my sister and brother in law came to visit. Granted, I rarely ever see them. They live downstairs, I live upstairs. We have separate entrances. They’re very nice from what I have seen. And their daughter is cute. 

They still have their Halloween decorations up, which although weird, isn’t too fucked up. They have rotting pumpkins outside their apartment that will surely get larvae and other bugs as soon as it warms up. They’ve been there for weeks. No one has picked it up. They have a large front porch, which I don’t have. On their porch, they have empty cans, broken and dirty furniture and some scattered trash. 
They never get their mail. I’m talking bills, letters from the city, everything. They never pick it up. We share a mailbox. Their lights are always off. Their windows are darkened. 

My BIL went to their apartment once to discuss some type of business or independent contracting and he was repulsed. He stated they had a bunny with bunny poop everywhere (on the floor, couches), trash bags just sitting waiting to be taken out, messes of clothes/furniture everywhere and a smell so penetrating that he almost threw up. Since then, we’ve seen the toddler (who is my daughter’s age) with a lot of individual spots— mainly what looks like bed bugs. But I can’t say with certainty. To top things off, the dad smokes a lot of  weed. Like daily. I have nothing against weed or anyone who smokes it. But if you’re gonna smoke I would hope you have the rest of your life at least partially together before doing so. Like— maybe ensuring your toddler has a safe place to sleep. 

Now that I think about it— I don’t believe they turn on the heat. I once needed hot water or a lighter (to put my key in, since my lock had frozen due to weather) they had to boil it first. Yikes.

Am I looking too deep into things? I am truly concerned for that child and this is something I’ve thought about for some time.

75,"An acquaintance of mine recommended me her cleaner after hearing my husband and I were in need of one. She said he was a bit formal and thinks it’s a cultural behaviour thing. He also cleans a lot of her friends houses and everyone loves what he does but says the formality side takes some getting used to. Apparently this behaviour is common in maids/domestic servants some parts of the Middle East/Asia. 

I started booking him for a few hours every other week and he is lovely, but she was right about the formality. 

Facts:
- is an quiet, polite, older 65+ middle eastern man
- works by word of mouth so we have his name and phone number, is not able to be found online
- extremely hard worker, goes above and beyond and actually prefers cleaning on his hands and knees, “old school” ways but does them quicker
- asks us what we preferred to be called (I asked him to use my name, so I get “Miss &lt;Name&gt;”)
- prefers to call his employers by Sir and Madam - i.e. yes madam/yes miss &lt;name&gt;/yes sir
- would prefer us to be strict with him on tasks and also the outcome of the task

Now here are the things that I am looking for advice on:
- kneels down on one knee when you are speaking to him (however, this is usually at a comfortable distance)
- would like us to “scold” him if we are unhappy with an outcome of a task such as speed, quality etc
- refers to himself as a servant (but never corrects you when you use the term cleaner)

Now I think he has great skills, speed and dedication and is a harmless old guy who loves what he does and is a bit old school quirky, but I told my husband about it and he is adamant this guy is getting off to his behaviour somehow and would like to fire him, even though there are other people who have said it’s alright.

87,"I have a female friend who grew up in a dominant and strict household, and who used to be overweight. She's internalised a lot of negativity from her childhood into self-esteem issues and might be suffering from depression or something similar. I know this because, despite having been friends for only about four or five months, I know all about her mother calling her fat and useless as a child, and about her wanting to kill herself and thinking she's ugly and worthless etc. I also know about how all her hair is falling out, and how she feels guilty about everything she does and so forth.

Now I'm happy to be a shoulder to cry on in a tough situation. I like to give advice and provide people with support when they're feeling down. But my friend just won't stop. She has serious mental problems and it seems like every second sentence is about either her self esteem, something bad that happened in her childhood, her depression and the like. It's like a tide that just washes over me and I feel like it's starting to pull me down. I don't know if she even knows she's doing it, or maybe she keeps bringing it up because she want's a certain reaction from me? I really don't know, but the constant stream of negativity is putting me in a bad place.

I have my own problems and self-esteem issues and periods where I just want everything to end, and I'm by no means trying to say that I want her to bottle everything up, but the things she says are almost pushing me deeper into my own negativity pit. I try my best to provide honest, non-coddling advice; recently I tried to be blunt with her and suggested she try and seek out counselling or therapy because she was talking about it so much and it can't be healthy for either of us, but she just awkwardly laughed it off like she does every time and then said this kind of stuff again a few minutes afterwards.

I don't know what to do. I feel frustrated because it just always keeps going, but I also feel sympathy because I know how difficult it is to seek out help for things like this. Then I feel guilty for feeling frustrated because she obviously has issues and I should be more patient with her, but she doesn't seem to be doing much to actively change her outlook on life. I don't expect her to get better straight away, or to be fully cured of depression (?) ever, but is it selfish to not want to deal with her stuff like this all the time we hang out? 

Any advice on this issue would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I'm not her only friend, but I seem to be the only one willing to give blunt, honest advice for her issues. She dumps her issues on her other friends as well, but they're more likely to just reply with platitudes and reassurances rather than what I do.",20Mar2019,8
88,"I need some advice on dealing with a coworker (call him Jason). He comes by my desk often and our conversations usually center around me riding a motorcycle (my primary commuting vehicle) to work. He often tells me I'm crazy that I rode when it's so cold.

I mentioned to him that on one particular day, I had to ride over some loose snow on a side street in order to get to the main street which was clear and that I didn't find it particularly difficult. Somehow the topic of helmet laws came up (I always wear my helmet because it's state law) where I mentioned it would nice if we weren't compelled to wear helmets. He then starts lecturing me about why I need to wear All the Gear All the Time and what would my family think and jokes that he'll buy my motorcycle for $1 after my wife forces me to give up my motorcycle when we have kids (he's making this last part up based on his own beliefs; my wife is fine with me riding a motorcycle as long as I ride safe and wear gear) and basically telling me that if I don't wear a helmet, I'm going to die.

However, I don't debate with him on these issues because there's really no point. My behavior is already in accordance with his beliefs, and I don't know what else he wants from me. My issue is more with the mandatory compulsion, I'm not debating the prudence of wearing gear.

So my problem is I want him to stop preaching to me about motorcycle safety. I've watched the gory videos, read the studies, I know the statistics. I practice motorcycle safety. I don't ride when it's icy, I practice good lane positioning, follow the speed limit, hands always on the throttle and brake in case I need to get out of trouble. Can I just ignore this guy next time he stops by? Do I engage in conversation with him again while not stating my opinions? Do I flat out ask/tell him to stop preaching to me? I just really don't want to talk to him anymore, our conversations are no longer pleasant for me. There are plenty of smokers at the smoke pit outside, maybe he can go find another audience for his save-the-world attitude?",20Mar2019,1

90,"At work we got a new co worker recently who I've worked with a few times. We work very well together and get along well. Once the first day I worked with her ended she wanted me to hug her and she went and hugged me. I thought she did it just as a sign of a friendly gesture and didn't think much of it at the time. It happened when we were alone with no co workers or customers nearby. I worked with her a few more times and she did the same thing at the end of the day and wanted me to hug her. I also noticed she wanted to constantly do things for me anytime she was working with me. I would offer to do something and she would say that she wanted to do it because she didn't want me to feel like I had to do everything since she was new and so she would do a lot of things for me. What really began making me question if it was just random hugs or flirting was what happened after a work meeting.

We had a work meeting and after the meeting she saw me and was extremely excited. She was smiling and asked me how was I doing and we spoke. I left the building the meeting was in and went to go back to my car. As I did she ran out of the building towards me like she was trying to catch up to me and I turned around and she wanted me to hug her. She ran up towards me and pulled me in towards her and gave me a very tight hug that lasted a fairly long time like 15 seconds or so. Afterward, we went back to our cars and left the area we had the meeting at. I noticed she also did not hug anyone else during or after the meeting and I've never seen her hug another co worker. I am convinced this co worker is flirting with me. I have not flirted with this co worker or implied any romantic interest in her at any point. I am nervous about dating a co worker and have generally tried to avoid doing so in general. When we work together at work we spoke with each other and I generally ask people who are new where they're from etc. We spoke a lot and got along well and unfortunately for myself I caught feelings for this co worker. Is this co worker flirting with me?",20Mar2019,6
91,"Hi, so, as the title states, my dads sister has moved in with my family. I do not live with them, I’m about an hour away and in a different state. 

For a little backstory, my aunt and my dad have not spoken in over a decade. The last time I saw her was when she came to visit in 2008 and ruined the entire trip because she couldn’t go 30 seconds without a drink, she harassed and assaulted my friends (we were in middle school), and said some absolutely heinous things to my dad. My aunt is sick and I understand that all too well, being as my dad is also in the advanced stages of alcoholism, as well as his girlfriend (at this point it’s easier to refer to her as his wife/my step mom, she is also the mother of my 5 year old sister). I won’t go into details about how toxic the two have been for each other, but it’s been an incredibly tumultuous relationship for everybody involved. I guess one night a few weeks ago, my aunt and my step mom were chatting on the phone, both pretty buzzed, when my aunt brings up maybe coming to stay with my parents. My aunt has lived in Northern California her entire life, and we live in the Pacific Northwest. Being pretty tipsy, my step mom goes along with my aunts plan, not necessarily encouraging her, but not shutting it down either. The next night I talked to my step mom as she wanted advice on the conversation the night before. Everybody knows people say shit when they’re drunk, and everybody knows there’s like a 5% chance said drunk person actually follows through with their little schemes, and that’s exactly what I said.  I said there is no way she could possibly get up here, she’s homeless, dirt poor, and has never had a drivers license in all her 49 years of life. It’s literally impossible for her to get to you. 

Not even 24 hours after I spoke to my step mom, she calls me again and goes “well, Shannon’s in town”

I was floored. I couldn’t believe it. Apparently she hitched a ride with her boyfriend(?) across two states, and was dropped off at a hotel in the town my parents live in. He left her, she had nothing and nowhere to go, with only one night paid for at the hotel. I ask my step mom what her plan is, as literally nobody wanted her there. Step mom says she doesn’t know, and that the final call is my dads to make. 

This is where it gets sad and this is where I find myself so angry at my aunt that I can’t even think straight. 

December of 2016, my nana passed away. My nana was my dad and aunts mom. She was my best friend, and all she wanted was for her family to get along. My dad and my nana had a rough start, Nana being an (you fuckin guessed it) alcoholic throughout my fathers childhood. Alcoholism killed my nana decades after she took her last drink. Cirrhosis of the liver. In my dads adult life, he had limited contact with nana, being as she also lived in California. When she died, my dad didn’t know how to process it. He experienced so much guilt for not having reached out sooner, and as a result of her death, came in contact with his sister once again. Shannon, my aunt, was absolutely beside herself, and has pretty much been stuck in a psychotic episode ever since. For two years they kept light contact, Shannon would call completely out of her mind, sobbing and wailing that she missed her mom. It was really rough on my dad, who had been through some traumatic events himself in the years before. 

Back to Shannon in a hotel. My dad called me for advice before he went to see her, dad and I have grown apart lately, due to his drinking and my inability to cope with seeing him destroy himself. I was honest with him, though. I told him she absolutely can not stay with them, that he had a 5 year old to think about, and she had already been through so much in her short life (she spent the first 4 years in a roach motel while my parents tried to get their shit together). I was so firm and so stonefaced about it, no if ands or buts. Dad said he was going to go to the hotel and he was going to tell her to fuck off. 

I don’t hear from him for two days, which isn’t out of the ordinary considering we usually go about 2 to 3 weeks without contact recently. But I told him to keep me updated, so I called him. When I asked what was going on, all he said was that he guesses Shannon is staying with them now. I was pissed and ended the phone call pretty soon after, followed with a text sternly asking him to not give my aunt any of my information. I don’t want her to know where I work, what city I live in, my phone number etc. he understood. 

Three weeks go by and I don’t hear from anybody, so I decide to send my dad a text, just to check in. He tells me Home life has been a nightmare, Shannon is hostile and selfish, saying nasty things to both him and my step mom, and constantly bothering and antagonizing my little sister. My dad works 5 days a week, 4 pm to 4 am, spending most of his weekday afternoons sleeping in preparation for his night shift. My step mom is stuck with her for the rest of the time, walking on eggshells and constantly reminding my sister to stay away from her aunt in her own home. Shannon berates my step mom for nearly everything she does around the house. Abuses and harasses her over any little thing. 

I’m so angry at her. I’m so angry that my parents have rebuilt their entire life so that my sister could finally have stability and Shannon just takes it upon herself to barge in and make it hers. All three of the adults living in that house are severe alcoholics, but my parents have nothing on Shannon. She is a cancer, a parasite, and a waste. I want her gone. I personally want to be the one that tells her to go. I want to get her out. My dad can’t do it, or he won’t. He feels so guilty, and Shannon will always pull the “but you’re all I have left” card and it works every fucking time. He’s paralyzed. He’s in poor health on top his addiction, and I’m so afraid for him, im so afraid Shannon is shaving years off his life every day she’s in that house. I hate to see him hurting. He raised me, he gave me an incredibly good life despite his illness and I know he wants that for my sister too. My sister will never have that with that creature slinking around their home. 

Before anybody tells me to call the police, there is a bit of a complication that comes with that. My step mom has two warrants right now. I know she can’t run from them forever, but if she went to jail today, my family would dissolve. I’m almost certain my sister would be put in my care and my dad would crumble. I know it’s something she will have to face in due time, but we at least want to get my sister in school first, and figure it out after that. My plan would be to get my step mom away from the house, probably to my house, and then call the police and report my aunt for trespassing (this is assuming she refuses to leave, nobody has actually told her to go yet). I don’t know what else to do, I don’t know how to help them. I just want them to get back on track. I’m so angry and lost and scared. 

I’m sorry this is so long, I think a lot of it was more for me to just.. get out. I’ve been dealing with this and the anxiety that comes with it for about a month but I haven’t really talked about it with anybody. If you read this all the way through, thank you, and please offer any advice you may have.

100,"My rescue dog has developed serious behavioral issues and I am torn about surrendering/rehoming her.

&amp;#x200B;

I rescued my dog about a year ago. When we got her, the shelter estimated she was about one year old. They picked her up along the side of major highway — no one came looking for her, so there was no information about her past. She was the quiet one in the corner of the shelter hallway. Her cell was right behind the door so we almost didn’t notice her. When we took her out for a short walk she immediately perked up. She rolled in the grass and panted happily. Someone from the parking lot remarked, “Looks like you’re going home with that one.”

&amp;#x200B;

Only problem was... we’d actually come to adopt a cat.

&amp;#x200B;

We ended up fostering her for two weeks just to try it out. A few issues came forward at the time; She cried in her crate, but what puppy doesn’t? She could get aggressive towards larger dogs, but we didn’t know her past so we rationalized that she was just scared. We thought that the more love we showed her and the more we socialized her the better she’d get. When we finalized the adoption it truly felt like the only option. She’d grown so attached to us in the few weeks that the thought of returning her seemed impossible. We thought it could only get worse for her if she were to be returned.

&amp;#x200B;

Over time, her issues have become more apparent and plentiful.

&amp;#x200B;

She has extreme separation anxiety — extreme may even be an understatement. She has broken out of / busted every single crate we’ve purchased for her. She’s gone so far as to physically harm herself in the process of escaping. Every crate has to be zip tied and clipped shut with climbing carabiners. It has to be anchored away from walls, furniture, anything she can chew or damage through the bars of her crate, etc. She can’t be left out of her crate because she chews furniture, tears up trash, and relieves herself throughout the house. The stuff she consumes in her panic makes her sick. On top of that, she throws herself against doors and windows in an attempt to escape. She can’t be trusted not to harm herself, so she must be kept in a crate. We have tried kong toys, interactive toys, calming treats/cbd oil, vigorous exercise, everything short of straight up prescribing her to anti-anxiety medication that I can’t even afford for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

She’s aggressive with other dogs. Dogs that are smaller, dogs that are larger, dogs that show no interest in her or are overly excited. We can’t seem to get it right when it comes to puppy play dates. Everything may seem to go fine and then randomly in the midst of play she’ll lose it and get aggressive. I feel so much shame and guilt about it every time. I feel horrible leaving her at home, but now I am afraid to take her anywhere that she may have to interact with other dogs. 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I stress relentlessly about leaving her at home — if she’ll break out of her crate, if she’ll destroy the house, if she’ll hurt herself in the process. I’ve begun to resent her and I know she can feel it. I resent the amount of money I have spent on toys and crates and treats and care that have seemingly no positive effect. I resent that I have this animal that is so dependent on me, yet every part of my lifestyle is in direct opposition with her personality. We like to go out and socialize — hiking, patios, parks, etc. But I don’t trust her in these spaces and with other more sociable animals. But she also can't be left behind.

I feel defeated.

I feel like we’re not a match as owner and pet.

I feel like a horrible person for not having fostered this end-all-be-all love relationship with my dog that other owners seem to have with theirs.

My feelings about surrendering/rehoming her have grown stronger and stronger. But I wouldn’t even know where to begin with that process...

104,"So I met this guy at the restaurant I work at. I’m a server and he’s a line cook (weird right). I started in mid October and two weeks into me working there we were hooking up. It was casual at first, but he brought up his feelings about 2 months ago and it shocked me. But I felt the same way. So our relationship is weird; we haven’t defined it, but if either of us was to sleep with someone else I’m positive it would be an issue. I have slept over at his house nearly every night since January. He used to make me feel so sexy; he always would make these comments that hyped me up, would always bring me close to him if we were just hanging out, and we had sex all the time. It was great. But now, even though he still asks me to come over every night, it’s not the same. He flirts with me just a fraction of the amount he used to. We have sex maybe  twice a week, and when we do, it’s like he’s not as into it as he used to be. And we just don’t have the conversations we used to. I’m so confused.
If he’s losing interest, why does he still always call me first asking for me to come over? We don’t even have sex half the time, so I don’t feel like he’s just using me for that. There’s just so much passion that’s not there anymore. He has been under a lot of stress with work lately, he tells me everything about how horrible the management in the kitchen is, and it really does suck. Every shift I work with him, I wonder how he does it. He put in his two weeks yesterday, so I guess I’ll see if that changes anything. It’s just so strange how he went from making me feel like a million dollars every chance he got and wanting to have sex as much as I did to us just laying around watching tv and just sitting in each other’s company. 
BTW, we haven’t made the relationship official only because I’m still in school and he is not sure of his plans within the next year. We’ve decided to see where life takes us and then see if it could work out, which I am totally on board with. I’m not clingy or needy, I know when he needs his space and I never ask him to cancel his plans with his friends for me. I’ve never been overbearing. So I guess I’m just trying to understand what I could have done.  I just miss how damn good it used to feel. ",20Mar2019,2
105,"My mom wants us to move down to Oklahoma with her boyfriend and live there. I’m fine with that and everything, I just want to at the VERY least just carry on until next school year and finish out senior year of high school here in Minnesota so that I can then join the Marines, go active duty, and travel the world while serving my country and expressing my patriotism all without having to deal with my whole “family is moving to Oklahoma but I wanna stay in Minnesota” situation. 

But she wants us to move down to Oklahoma this summer. It sounds fun and exciting going to live in Oklahoma, but I want to stay in Minnesota since I’ve lived in this state and my city for over 17 years. I still want to be with my friends since we’re all tight with each other and while we mess around and poke fun at each other, we’re really solid friends. I don’t want to leave them behind since honestly, I don’t want to deal with making new friends, especially friends in an entirely different state and I’m really gonna miss them. 

Also, me being Asian, I want to at least be friends with other Asians. My city has a really big Asian population and most of my friends are Asian. I’m not saying that I won’t be friends with you if you’re white or black since I don’t give a shit what color you are, but I do want Asian friends 

Not to mention that I REALLY like my Marine Corps recruiter right now too. We’re both a specific ethnicity and both have the last name too, so I feel pretty connected with him. Plus, he’s really chill and I’d hate to leave him behind. I’ll definitely start hunting for more USMC recruiters down there if I’m ever forced to move, but I really like my current recruiter since he’s so down to earth with me and my friend (who I plan/planned to enlist together with in the buddy program). 

Plus, I still want to do JROTC here in MN. Yeah, JROTC is a bit of a pain in the head at times and I’m currently pretty worried about it (competition coming up), but even with all its faults, I love JROTC and don’t want to leave my program behind here in Minnesota. I wouldn’t mind doing JROTC in Oklahoma, but it might not be the same.

Is there a way I can complain with management he isn’t in the contract, I can’t move because of the leasing contract we still have half a year to go :(. I’ve told her not to have him over so much once and damn it’s been so awkward ever since. So much for communication something she always preaches but never does since she just does stuff and never takes the time to remember that she shares the place with another living person. &amp;gt;:( I wish I was a mean person that could do asshole things back but I’m such a pussy. Man also talk about their attitude towards me (I also don’t trust him since he has bragged about robbing places in the past) this sucks so much I feel extremely helpless right now.",20Mar2019,3

111,"Hi. For context, there's this new intersection near my house that was put into place a couple years ago when they built the first high rise in my city. It's not at the end of a block like most intersections, but rather just one put into place specifically so people in that building are able to get in and out without having to wait to cross the busy street. But no one takes this intersection seriously. I see pedestrians crossing on red lights, people running red lights, making illegal turns, nearly hitting pedestrians, etc. ALL. THE. TIME. And it's right in front of a community police station, but they don't do anything about it so that doesn't stop people.

A couple months ago I was hit by a car on my way to class at this intersection. While crossing the street, I was hit by a driver turning right. I had the pedestrian light and I looked both ways before I started moving, but he was stopped, looking the other way while waiting to turn. Once he started to move it was out of my peripheral so I didn't see him. It wasn't so bad, he was going slow and I didn't get knocked over, but I am still recovering from an injury from this incident.

A couple weeks ago I was once again crossing this exact same intersection when I was almost hit again. As the light turned green and I got the crossing light I began to walk, and a car coming from the other direction wanting to turn left over the crosswalk decided to not only bolt in front of all the cars who had the right of way, but to also attempt to plow right through me. The woman made eye contact with me but was definitely NOT slowing down, and I had to jump backwards back onto the sidewalk to avoid getting hit again. The worst part, in my opinion, is she then gave me the little wave as if to say thanks. Like, really? She does NOT have the right of way here and it's not me trying to ""be polite"" by getting out of her way, it's me trying to not die. I was pissed.

Now, today, the exact same situation as I just described in the second incident occurred yet again, but this time to my brother. He was crossing, person turning left just CANNOT wait to go, cuts off all the drivers with the right of way and nearly plows into my brother on the crosswalk and he had to run to avoid getting hit.

I've almost been hit on this intersection a few times before as well, but never in quite as close of a situation, generally because the driver noticed me and actually stopped. Imagine that, some drivers actually don't want to hit pedestrians! 

Anyways. I'm sick of it, and I have to cross this damned intersection every day to get to the bus stop, so I'd rather not keep almost getting hit every freaking day. I want to write a letter to someone and beg them to do something about it. My problem is I don't know who to write it to, or what to ask for. Police monitoring the intersection? Cameras to be implemented? I don't know, I have no idea what would actually help and be a reasonable request. I also don't know what kinds of things I wouldn't think to put in to make sure it, yknow, actually gets read and addressed. I don't want to be ignored and I also don't want to accidentally send the letter to someone who can't do anything to help.

Any thoughts, comments, advice, etc. would be much appreciated.

tldr: there's this terrible intersection near me that I've been hit by a car at once, me and my family members have almost been hit at several times, and people frequently make illegal turns/run red lights/cross the street on reds. I want to write a letter but don't know who to write to or what to say.",20Mar2019,2
112,"Hey so I am going to this event tomorrow for school called Relay University but I have to be at school early 7:30 so my mom will have to drive me. Up until yesterday, I was told that you had to be at school normal time to take the bus. I missed a meeting we had literally 5 minutes before the bell rang at the end of the day so I didn’t know until I just texted a friend to confirm and she said I have to be there early.

113,"After high school, I didn’t know what I wanted to do so I took a gap year and worked. My dad helped me get into his alma mater after that year and I loved going to school there, but I wasn’t getting the best grades and it was an expensive private school so I felt it was a waste of my dad’s money. I was also taking out loans- not because my dad couldn’t afford it, but because he wanted me to “have a stake in my education”, as he says. I also got diagnosed with extreme anxiety towards the end of me being there, which also pushed me out of that door and back home for a semester. This was the worst time of my life. My dad thinks that things like anxiety and depression are “made up”, so living back home while being completely agoraphobic was a nightmare. He did try to help sometimes, but he wouldn’t do things like take me to a psychologist (I couldn’t afford it on my own). I then got accepted to another school where my boyfriend went, and my dad REALLY did not want me to go to school there. He thought it was only for my boyfriend. I just wanted to get out of the house and back into school since my anxiety was so much better. I know he was just being a protective father, but I knew I needed to prove to myself that I could move away and that I wasn’t going to let my mental illness control my life. I’ve now been at this school for two semesters and I’ve hated it. In hindsight, my dad was right that I shouldn’t have gone here. It’s in an extremely northern area, where it’s cold around 9 months of the year. I have gotten horribly depressed living here, which effected my grades and I got put on academic probation last semester and I couldn’t even get through this one. I don’t want to come off as I was too lazy to go to class or anything, but I was so depressed I barely left my room for weeks. I’m dropping my classes before this semester ends, but I don’t know how to tell my dad. He pays for my school and he’s going to be absolutely livid when he finds out. I feel awful and like I’m wasting his money and like I’m a huge burden to him, and I’m afraid he’s going to tell me I can’t come home. I have my own job but I’m pretty financially dependent on him as I have been my whole life. Can someone please tell me what I should say or do? He can be a really angry person and I’m just afraid this is going to be the last straw with him. ",20Mar2019,1

118,"Hey everyone, hoping to gain some insight as to how others in both romantic and non-romantic relationships help close ones when they have feelings of low happiness/ satisfaction. 

What is the best way to help someone with what seems like feelings of depression? Characteristics include: loss of enjoyment in once loved things, fatigue, loss in motivation, feelings of hopelessness, no feelings of satisfaction/accomplishment, and when doing something that brings happiness- having that happy feeling end soon after. (Typical depressive symptoms).

As someone going into the field of Psychology, I know the symptoms and signs... and even how they’re treated in a therapeutic setting...but I still struggle on how to deal with it in interpersonal relationships (i.e. not going therapist on them, remaining as friend/significant other/ etc.) 

How do you help others with these issues? Any unexpected tips other than “being there for them” and “troubleshooting”? It sucks seeing them in pain... and especially sucks feeling like there’s nothing more you can do but just be there for them. ",20Mar2019,1

i [17F] am in a fwb/hookup relationship with someone [18M], but as prom is approaching i am in need of a date. this person and i vibe really well and have a fun time together so i figure why not just ask him to be my date? the only stipulations though, are that it’s long distance-ish (we’re about an hour apart, we both have cars except i'm not allowed to drive that far and he never drives to me) and i don’t want him to think i’m expecting more from what we have going on if i ask him to my prom (which implies he’d have to meet my friends and some family, and idk if that’s weird for a fwb type of thing?)


i just don’t know how to go about bringing it up because it would be very out of the blue, and definitely over text since i'm not out in his area super often to talk about it in person, and forget phonecalls/facetime because we both just talk on snap the most. so maybe some male perspectives here could help? who knows. would he think coming to prom with me is worth a 45-60 minute drive, or would i be making a fool of myself if he stood me up (which i dont think would happen if he paid for a ticket and shit but ya kno, just my doubts here) i just don’t want to jeopardize a potential fun summer fling either if he says no (which is fine) and it’s awkward? also i need to figure this out by the first week of april since thats when guest passes are due. please help me bag a hot/fun prom date, thanks y'all &lt;3",20Mar2019,1
121,"I'm an 18 year old guy and I've realized all this past month or so, I've been dealing with an extreme case of brain fog. It's being caused by the stress I'm under. I'm not in a bad place; Just a tough position. I'm taking 7 classes, 4 of them high school to graduate and also to get some college credit. To transfer to the university I want to go to, I have to pass all the classes and I'm struggling badly in 2 of them. I also work upwards of 30 hours a week just trying to make some ends meet as well as to buy a car for college and have some spending money left over. On a daily basis, I'm up at 6am, go to school until the afternoon, go work until 8pm, and go back home to study until sometimes midnight. I may only get 5 hours a night of restful sleep. Unfortunately, I don't get much of a break on weekends because I work a 10 hour shift on Sunday and Saturday is just a short break for myself not to have a mental breakdown. The stress is bad enough physically where it feels like my hair is thinning and I'm also breaking out with acne.

Part of the stressors I deal with I didn't have a decision over while others I have taken the burden of to reach some goals. The big problem is the brain fog. Most recently, I got a bad test grade and going over it, I was blatantly confused on how I got certain problems wrong and knew the answer. Over Spring break, it seems like I've completely forgotten all of the material my classes covered in the past 3 weeks. I also have flashes of short term and long term memory loss where the memory comes back at a later time. I also occasionally forget some responsibilities I have to take care of despite knowing only hours earlier I needed to take care of them. My sleep is also generally restless.

I've been told by some people I should start drinking coffee in the morning but the truth is that I hate the taste. Energy drinks do help but they're terrible for my health and often cause my stomach to get irritated so that's not a viable alternative. I'm not sure what to do. Any ideas? Thanks.",20Mar2019,1
122,"So I’m 16 in school right now planning on going to school for music.

I am a very good student in classrooms but then as soon as I leave my mind wants to do things that I cannot do if I want to maintain good grades in school. I am very smart and do very well on tests but pretty much any take home work is just hard to do as I can’t bring myself to do it. I think it has something to do with the amount of stress in my life. I have become less and less stressed over the years and now at this point I almost feel numb to stress being thrown at me.

134,"Recently I went car shopping and paid cash for a vehicle. First I'll explain what happened, how I fucked up, and then get to my final question which really matters cos I've definitely learned my lesson on this one.
I saw the car online and loved it. Decent price but a bit over budget(first mistake) but seemed worth it given the fact that the car is newer and will appraise at higher.
We get to the lot and salesmanA seems to be anxious to sell it and claims that salesmanC has been procrastinating posting it to social media but also drives it to his home 30 minutes away (but isn't at the lot that day? So yeah, red flag #1)
I test drive the car and the 2 friends I have with me say the car runs good &amp; they don't see any leaks. I'm an idiot when it comes to vehicles and just want to DRIVE because I have my own business and just want to find a good car. Anyway, while test driving I hear/feel a clicking in the steering column.
SalesmanA straight lied &amp; said it was a recall issue(lie) and we called him out on it. He said they'd write it in their ""As Is No Warranty"" paperwork that they'll fix the $5 part (difficult labor for free) and they eventually did.

He also informed us that the front and rear fuel pumps had both been previously replaced &amp; my friend secretly told me the salesman is an idiot when speaking about car parts. My friend also says he doesn't seem like a real mechanic. I'm also freaking out because I don't trust them since they lied to me about the recall which I did a search on my phone for.
SalesmanB comes outside and quickly swipes through the CarFax stating ""See nothing wrong with the car"" and explained to me again they'll fix the part

So we decide I'll buy the car because everything else is new and it is a good price they need to get the car off the lot etc.

I go inside with salesmanB and I use 2 different debt cards to pay for the car &amp; sign their copy of the tiny receipts. I also pay a $100 processing fee for using the card system.

SalesmanA has prepared a simple Buyer's guide and Bill of sale which I am hesitant to sign but my friends show me how they've agreed to fix the non-hazardous issue in my steering column once the part comes in.

::Drama Ahead::
I get the keys and head to the gas station because the fuel light has been on.
Start pumping gas and it spits back out all over me. Friends come and witness it for themselves. Obviously there is an issue but we also notice my fuel gauge doesn't change.
That night/the next morning we also notice the check engine light comes on.
Check the code -- O2 sensor needs to be replaced which doesn't surprise me because that is normal.
Next day I take it back to show salesmanA (and rude ass salesmanC) how the gauge isn't detecting gas in the tank or my ~MPG used screen isn't posting. They erased codes from the car which my personal mechanic retrieved later (I videoed them erasing the codes which pissed me off)

salesmanA tells me I should buy the rear fuel pump (which has supposedly already been replaced) and he will install it. Doesn't explain why. After some research it seems whatever fucking part that detects fuel levels is part of the fuel pump &amp; it will be ~$300+ to purchase another pump for the vehicle. I'm furious. Plus I still can't put gas in the car. Which they knew was an issue because salesmanC was supposedly driving it to &amp; from work.

I refuse to let them touch my vehicle because I don't trust them after so many stupid lies. 

I requested twice they give me a refund for the vehicle and they decline offering again to install parts all while I've explained that I have my own mechanic (whom I very much trust with any vehicle for endless reasons)
I let salesmanA speak with my mechanic. He makes a fool of the salesman and I ultimately decide to be an adult and quit throwing a fit. I plan to budget for the parts and accept that I got lied to.

5ish days later I changed the oil personally with my friend who helped me jack it up in my driveway and he tells me the oil filter is a factory style and claims the oil filter has NEVER been changed. (This vehicle has between 100K-150k miles on it) which also REALLY pissed me off. The oil that came out looked like black glue &amp; took forever to drain out. 

1 or 2 days after this I looked at my bank account to budget weekly expenses &amp;&amp; all the money is back in my account. I contact my bank. They say the business had 5 days to complete the transaction but nothing happened on their end so the funds are now ""released back to me"" 
They also advise me next time I should pay them via literal cash because apparently the business didn't care to accept my money.

I called my friend who used to sell cars and asked why they would've done this. He says they've pretty much forfeited the money and is probably due to poor accounting. I felt compelled to pay them back but my friend says it is Karma from them lying to me.
I'm told if the title has already been released to me &amp; is in the mail I can show anyone my receipts &amp; BillOfSale and the title and it'll basically be a free car.

Or if they notice before they give me the title that they forgot to accept my transaction then they will probably call asking me to come into their office to reswipe my card. I will not me doing this. I'll forfeit the vehicle first.

Is this true? Are these two potential scenarios legit or am I dreaming? I'm sick of dealing with these liars and just want my money back or a decent car. I'm not moving forward with vehicle repairs in case I can truly hand them the car back.

135,"My ex [25] is cheating on his current girlfriend [22] with me [23] should I tell her?

So me and my ex were terrible together. We honestly had a hate/love relationship. He cheated on me towards the beginning and I could never get over it. There’s way more to that story but it’s really not worth it. He’s a terrible guy. 
Anyways, we were together for a couple of years and we broke up about 5 months ago. However, I am an a town by myself so I get lonely sometimes. I would never get back with my ex but I like to entertain the idea that he is still flattered by me. So we have phone sex. I know sounds lame. But we are in different cities so whatever works, you know. I don’t know, I’m entertained by it. We did meet up once since they starting dating and we fooled around a little. 
Yesterday he hit me up being crazy and super sexual so I was guaranteed that him and this girl were over. Yet today my friend saw the girls Snapchat that said “luckiest girl ever” with them at dinner. Man this girl has no clue. Yeah so anyways, what do I do. ",20Mar2019,0

I have an interview tomorrow with a new company and they told me over the phone about how their hiring process works. 

I was told that you initially get hired as a temp. So the position is temp to hire and was told this is essentially a probation period but it is paid through a temp agency. So I would have no benefits until brought on full time by the company I’ve applied for. 

Is this normal practice? Should I be concerned or are there any red flags if I were to accept this position?

145,"I’m 30/m. One friend a little older than me doesn’t work. He asks me to play cards about once a week. I just keep saying oh I can’t today. Truthfully I’m a point where I work 5 days a week and don’t like to make plans because I could just feel like relaxing. I’m much more likely to do something with a friend if it is in advance (more than 2 weeks). 

More concerning is my other friend who is much older than me (by about 20 years) we met through a job. I work at a restaurant and he eats there 7 days a week. He refers to the place where he runs two 1 hour meditations as where he works. He is extremely gifted in computers/servers and can make and has made a high hourly rate ($50-$100 per hour).

Yet he chooses to work contracts that last 2-4 months and go months or even a year without working. He last worked from November to January and before that was the November before.

The only way he is able to do this is to rack up credit card debt (over $30,000), live at home, and collect unemployment. It is getting exhausting seeing him everyday and him being like “we should get together soon” or texting me about the meditation he runs how well it’s going and me holding back my tongue from saying “that’s great but have you considered actually working?” 

I asked him if he was going to go back to computer work and he said “maybe for just one more year” meaning he things he is going to be able to live off of running meditations and occasionally doing acupressure work (he doesn’t own a business he does  these things through a couple of places and maybe totally to 5 max hours per week) I.e. he is delusional.  Since he hasn’t worked the last 3 months he has probably made maybe $400 besides benefits and that is a high estimate. 


TL;DR I have a couple of friends that are really good people. They don’t work and often ask me to hang out. I’m tired of saying no all the time. I also am opinionated regarding them not working and don’t know how to handle the situation to either help them (whether they think they need it or not) and firmly tell them I can’t hang out on a whim anymore without sounding like an asshole.

147,"I’m 18F and my boyfriend is 18 as well. We’re both in our freshman year of college. We attend different schools, but our year long relationship managed to survive the first semester as we were able to spend every weekend and holidays together. 
In January, my family moved from New Jersey to North Carolina. For the time being, I am taking classes online through a community college that was near my old house in NJ; however, I am currently making arrangements to transfer to a 4-year school. My boyfriend is encouraging me to transfer to his college, but I think that’s a very bad idea. 
He’s a really great guy and I can tell he genuinely loves me. We’ve had some great times together but I can’t shake the feeling that it’s time for us to part ways. I’m not willing to go to his university, and I don’t want to mess around with a long distance relationship because it seems pointless. I know he’s not the guy I’ll end up marrying, and our lives are clearly taking two drastically different turns. 
The reason I feel so compelled to end things at this very moment is because I’ve started to notice that he’s way more serious about me than I am about him. He’s offered to let me move into his house for the entire summer and he has even briefly mentioned potential marriage in the future. I feel guilty because I don’t feel the same way. 
I know that I have to break up with him, I just don’t know how. He’s been so good to me and I can’t imagine hurting his feelings. I feel selfish and dishonest. He wants me to fly to NJ on April 16th to visit him. I told him I’d buy the ticket, but now I’m thinking I should just go ahead and end things because I can’t bear to pretend like everything’s okay when it’s not. 
I have no idea how to approach this. Do I just send him the “we need to talk” text. I’ve never broken up with someone who was actually a decent person. In the past all my relationships weren’t very serious and somewhat toxic so it was easy for me to walk away.  
He’s at school right now which means he’s trapped in his dorm with his weird ass roommate. Should I wait until the weekend when he’s in the comfort of his own home? Should I just do it now and get things over with? I don’t know what to say to him and I’m not emotionally prepared for him to call me crying into the phone. 
Whenever I look at pictures of us or we have a funny text conversation, I start to feel like I shouldn’t break things off. But I realize that staying with him is not rational and probably won’t lead to long-term happiness.

151,"Hello, just a quick disclaimer. If you are uncomfortable about the topic of menstruation or blood, then I suggest not reading further. Also, I’m sorry if it seems a bit “ranty”, I don’t want to skip out on details for context. 
In the middle of January, I went to Planned Parenthood to get an IUD insertion. I specifically chose the non-hormonal IUD because it lasts for many years and apparently had less side effects. Before I had it inserted, the clinician warned me that for a couple of months I may bleed more and have more cramps. I said it was fine since she made it seem like the symptoms weren’t severe. I asked if I could take birth control pills later on if I see that I’m bleeding a lot. She said “that’s not very common for women who have this iud, but that is an option”. I took her word for it and went through the process.
However, two days after the procedure, I started bleeding from my period (the procedure might have induced it). I didn’t mind at first but then my cramps were really severe. My period also came a lot heavier than usual. I had to wear two pads at a time and change it three times a day. The cramping and bleeding continued at varying degrees of intensity for a straight month. I always take 800mg of ibuprofen for headaches, so it didn’t have much effect for the bleeding or cramps when I did take it. I got tired of it and went back to PP.
When I went back mid-February, they were reluctant to give me birth control. The clinician and the nurse would tell me various times “we warned you about the symptoms”. I agreed that they did but I didn’t know that it was this painful. They said they would only provide me one month of birth control because “this is all your insurance covers because you already have an effective form of birth control. After that you would have to pay $30-$40 each refill”. I said it was fine, I just wanted to make the bleeding stop. They also didn’t reveal that a “couple months” of adjustment to the iud meant 4-6 months until this visit in February. I was frustrated but I didn’t blame them for the miscommunication. I then took my birth control for a month and was so happy that my cramps were gone and so was my “spotting”. My period even got lighter.
Fast forward to today. I made an appointment with PP to get a birth control refill. However, before the clinician saw me, a nurse was asking me various questions. She seemed confused (almost upset) at my request to refill my bc. She said that she’s not sure the clinician will approve my request. I was confused because last month they told me that it was fine as long as I paid for the following months. Then, the clinician comes in and tells me that she was denying my request. I was upset and asked why. She said because my insurance doesn’t cover it. I told her that I was willing to pay since I was happy with the effects it had. She still refused and did not give me another reason as to why she denied my refill. Instead, she advised that I take 600 mg of ibuprofen a day to control the bleeding and cramps (despite me telling her that 800mg had little effect on it). She also advised me to use tampons instead of pads because “it just seems like a lot of bleeding because you see all the blood in front of you when you use a pad”. I told her that I already know what my normal bleeding looks like and that I don’t enjoy the feel of tampons. She then implied that I’m probably using them wrong and explained how to put one in. I feel that the explanation and advice wasn’t helpful.
I don’t want to experience the same pain and bleeding as before. I’m a student and also work so I’m constantly on the move. I don’t want these symptoms to affect my everyday life. What should I do? Is there any way I can get birth control in another way? The pharmacy asks for prescription from a doctor, which PP will not give me.
TLDR: Birth control has helped me combat really heavy bleeding and strong cramps caused my my non-hormonal IUD. However, a Planned Parenthood clinician is now denying me birth control despite my willingness to pay for it out of pocket.",20Mar2019,1
152,"Okay, so I don’t want to make this unnecessarily long and detailed but I recently have been getting creeped out by a coworker. I work with a guy who is 40 and married with two kids. I’m a 24 y/o woman. He has openly expressed romantic interest in me before and has tried to take me out on dates, claiming he needed to talk to me about work-related matters. There’s a whole lot more to the story but I figured that this was enough information to get the picture. Anyways, lately he keeps referencing pregnancies and how he gets a feeling I’ll be having my first kid soon and he seems weirdly excited when he talks about it. Also he keeps talking to me a lot about his own kids and showing me pics of them, much more often than he used to. Today, he gave me some unsolicited advice about how being with an older man is so much better (than being with a younger one) because of financial stability, maturity, etc.... so... is this some weird hinting he wants a lovechild with me? Does the guy have a fetish for impregnating women? Should I even be worried about it? Is this weird even from a guy’s perspective or what? Idk how to tell him to tone it down about the pregnancy talk because it’s just really awkward for me in general.

153,"Hi everyone! 

First of all I just wanted to say I hope this is an ok place to post this, as I couldn’t find anywhere else where it’s more appropriate. I also wanted to acknowledge that this is a lot of me venting about a shallow problem, and is not nearly as intense as some of the other posts I’ve seen here. 

So a little background; I’m a natural blonde, and I’ve been blonde my whole life. I grew up on the beach in Cali and I absolutely love sun. I’m greek  so I also have blue eyes and pretty tan skin, but because I’m from California, I also have a pretty heavy valley girl dialect. This makes me fit the blonde Californian stereotype almost exactly. 

It wasn’t until I was older that I started noticing I was treated differently. People were nicer, and I generally assumed that’s how the world worked. Took me a long time to figure out that wasn’t the case. I specifically remember saying oh this person is so nice to a coworker and he gave me a look. The don’t be stupid look. And said of course he’s nice to you. Etc etc. this was just the beginning of me noticing these small gestures. The ones that made me feel naive, ignorant, dumb or condescended. I think different things were expected from me. Sometimes very little: I had a boss laugh at me and ask me if I was “having a blonde moment” when I forgot to do something (really it was my ADD). Never once did I notice that me other female coworkers were disrespected in this manner. And sometimes I think many people assume that I’m easy. If anyone had heard any blonde jokes it’s usually about their stupidity or their slutiness. I realize that many women, and almost all woman have experienced some form of sexual harassment. Maybe it’s just my paranoia, but I feel that I experience that a little more because of my appearance and these stereotypes. I’m sick and tired of people being absolutely shocked that I’m a smart person, that I like to read books, or have political conversations. 

The best compliment I’ve ever been given was, “you are so smart and capable you go could go to Harvard if you wanted.” while I’m most definitely not Harvard material, I try to remind myself that I’m not just the piece of ass (something that was said to me after I opened up about sexually harassed to a close friend) and I am a person of substance. 

To keep is short (or not let myself go off on a further tangent) I’m really uncomfortable with attention. I appreciate the compliments and the flattery, but sometimes it goes to far. I once had a woman snap at me saying “don’t you know by everyone gets that kind of attention?! Don’t be ungrateful!” These things get to me.  Do I need to adjust my attitude? Build up some thicker skin and deal with it? Or just accept it for what it is. I don’t want to feel misinterpreted, and I’m more than fed up with the snap judgments.

157,"Hello everyone! So for a context, I am a 24 year old girl who has been diagnosed with anxiety 2 years ago. I know I'm being irrational with my fears but I would definitely want to ask about my chances or ask for an informed opinion regarding my dilemma. Living in a conservative household, studied in Catholic school all throughout my life, I never received any type of sexual education, but I am trying my best to educate myself to avoid more anxiety in the future.

The last time I had a sexual contact with a guy was last September 17 and October 1. No penetration happened. It was purely me and my boyfriend grinding. The only concern is that, on our first try, only my boyfriend was wearing a brief to cover his genitalia or precum, and I was naked. I believe I had enough moisture on my labia, and that's the reason why I am still so scared that something might happen from it. My boyfriend also said that he had a small amount of precum on his brief. On our second try, we were both wearing our undies, and he was also wearing his baseball shorts, so I think I'm cleared on that. I got my period a week after our first try. It lasted for 4 days and it came a bit earlier than usual (my last cycle before it lasted for 40 days, and my next cycle came 10 days earlier). It was, however, red in color and definitely enough to fill my pads, with some observable clotting. My only concern is that my periods seemed shorter after our second try. From my usual 3 days, it shortened into 2 and what's weird is that it looks like it's mixed with some egg white cervical mucus. I got it every month after our last contact, though, and it came consistently every 29-30-31-32nd cycle day.

As for my diagnostic tests, I took a pregnancy test on Oct 1 (a week after my September period). It was negative. 3 hours after I took the test though, I saw a really thin, colorless line. Would that be an evaporation line? Just to make sure about the validity of the result, I also took tests week after week (6 tests in total), but all came up negative, fortunately. And since I still find myself in worry, I also had a transvaginal ultrasound last December 4 (which would be 9-10 weeks after our last contact and 14-15 weeks after the first). The sonologist said nothing about a pregnancy, but diagnosed my ovaries as polycystic. It was also mentioned  in the results that I had a thin endometrium (which shouldn't be the case if I was pregnant right?)

I know I am just overthinking but please help me. Thank you so much. Do you think I should be in the clear?",20Mar2019,1

164,"So my fiancée and I are saving for our wedding. Everything has been going great so far and we have some more to go, but it’s not a problem as we both have decent jobs. I make more than she does, but she has saved more than I have. About 3 times as much currently. Now, I make more money and I’m sure on the surface this sounds lopsided, but let me explain. 

I pay the mortgage, internet, my car bill, my insurance (which is a lot since I’m a young male) and the internet. I pay for every meal and every grocery shopping trip. I pay for everything when just out shopping in general. So far, it hasn’t been a problem. We just treat each other’s money like it comes from the same pot. But she just made comments about her saving more than me and she was doing it all herself. It really pissed me off especially because all of these small transactions add up big time but they aren’t being taken into account. I’ve done all of this and still managed to save a couple grand to towards what is remaining. 

Now, on the surface, this looks shitty. But dig into who is spending every time we go do sometime and makes sense. Logically, I will have saved less money. 

First off, am I wrong?

Second, how can I bring this up in a nice way later on to let her know I’m dedicated and have valid reasons that I haven’t saved as much money.

She’ll be like this for days at a time, then one day she’ll act like nothings wrong and that she loves us dearly and she can’t understand why we were even hurt. She’s been like this since I was a child some 20 years ago, when she was in her 40s. She has recently developed early signs of dementia which has worsened these traits.

Here’s where the issue comes in. After her most recent husband passed, she moved into an apartment. This was about 4 years ago or so. She was evicted a few months later because she wouldn’t pay her bills, as she’d rather horde random assortments of Knick knacks and antiques. She moved in with us, a family of 4 in a 3 bedroom house, and quickly found another apartment to subsequently get evicted from again for none payment. After this, she moved in with us semi-permanently as it was clear she could not manage her money.

She lived with us for about 6 months, and it was torture. She would belittle and berate everyone, and completely destroy her relationship with not only her daughter, but the rest of the family as well. She got sick and was in the hospital for several months, with most doctors telling us she wouldn’t make it. She did and moved back in with us not long after, and here’s where it gets bad.

She got worse, actively going out of her way to say the most awful things, thinly veiled insults. It’s been almost a year since she’s been back, and everyone has to walk on eggshells lest they screamed at for what ever may occur. For example, calling my sister fat and worthless, saying me and my father don’t matter, and saying how much of a disappointment my mother is.

We’ve tried pleading with her, tried sucking up her words, we’ve argued and yelled, to no avail. Any time we try to discuss the situation with her, it’s immediately our fault, no matter who’s talking to her. It’s an absolute nightmare to live with her.

However, the doctors say that her dementia has not progressed far enough for her to have to live in elderly care. She no longer has the money to live separately and we cannot pay for her as well as ourselves. We’re at a loss for how to continue. We don’t want to cut ties, we want to make this work, but she outright refuses to even try. What can we do from here?",20Mar2019,1
173,So I’m a senior in high school and I’m pretty socially awkward. There’s this girl that I think is two grades younger than I am and I think she’s really pretty and I want to start talking to her.

176,"Hello people of Reddit, 

I want to preface this post by saying that I'm going through a rough time aside from this friends drama so this post might be overally  emotional. Furthermore, I have very strong feelings regarding sex and I do not wish to be chastised for being prudish, judgmental, or not sex positive. I do not believe in casual sex or really sex without love and I do not believe that what my friend is doing okay. You can disagree with me but I really don't want to be ripped apart for my beliefs in the comments. 

Anyway, my good friend is 21 and going through a divorce. In the meantime, she is sleeping around with strangers and people we know from high school. I think this is because of deep rooted insecurity and the need to feel wanted by men. Before she got married she basically had zero attention from anyone of the opposite sex and was very quick to latch onto her husband when he began to show interest, even though weeks before they began to date she told me that she found him creepy. She's slept with about 9 people in the past month. I am not God nor am I perfect, so I am trying very hard to not pass judgement. I lost my virginity before marriage so I can't really say anything. Aside from my moral issues with this, I am extremely concerned for her safety. One of these men is a drug addict and the others were mostly strangers she met online. She is driving out of town, late at night to meet some of these men in hotels or in their homes and also in secluded areas for them to hook up in a car.  I also do not believe that she is informing anyone of the fact that she is going out so if something were to happen, nobody would know. Now these hookups aren't  prostitution, but she has a sugar daddy who is twice her age. He has a price that he will pay for them to just spend time together, but when they have sex he throws in an extra hundred dollars as a ""gift"". In my opinion, this is prostitution being passed off as something else. Her sex life is none of my business but I'm concerned for her safety. This seems very dangerous to me but she insists that she's safe and just having fun. I'm also afraid that she is doing this for all the wrong reasons. These men don't truly care about her. She's just a sex toy to them. They aren't having sex with her, they're using her body to masturbate with. She's worth so much more than that. She deserves genuine love and I want her to see that. I also just don't want her to end up dead in a ditch somewhere. How can I help her, if at all? Should I just stay out of it and pray for the best? ",20Mar2019,0

178,"Hello, I am currently a 4th year at a University in California. 

Background: Started off as Physics major, switched to biochemistry b/c professor told me I wouldn't get into med school with a Physics degree. Turns out he was wrong and I switched to Biophysics my 3rd year which required me to take 20 units every quarter and summer classes every year so I could graduate in 4, dropping my GPA from a 3.3 to a 2.7 cumulative. I'm majoring in Biophysics and I was expecting to go to med school for sure all the way up until this last year, but now I will be graduating in a few months and to be honest I have no idea what I want to do. I've been applying to a lot of jobs in my field but if they don't require a whole lot of experience, they would like me to have a PhD. I originally planned to take the LSAT and Physics GRE next year while I work because law school is something I feel like I would do very well at. I don't have any actual experience in the law field, but I have had a few cases against my university, mostly regarding faculty trying to screw me over (yay public education system!) and a few cases where I had to prevent my organization from being kicked off campus, and getting finances from the university when they wanted to give us much less than we asked for. On the flip side I do really love physics but after getting to quantum mechanics, I feel for the first time in my life that I am not as good at it as I could be, but my friends keep telling me that I just overloaded how many upper-division classes I am taking at once and that's why I am having so much trouble. Also I have really bad ADD and I'm the most impulsive person in the world, which makes my decision harder because I'm not sure if I actually want to follow a certain career path or I just want to do it at that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The part where you smart people help me (hopefully): I want to be someone who helps the world in one way or another. While I feel like I am naturally good at manipulating laws to ""win a case"", I worry that I am the type of person who would end up helping companies with far too much money get away with breaking the law because I'm very good at finding loopholes in bylaws. P.S. always read the laws and terms of conditions of everything, humans always make errors and there is always a way to get your way. I don't want to go to med school anymore because it just doesn't seem like I want to do it but my parents want to through me. Finally I look to physics but I really don't know what field I would focus on because my school doesn't offer a single Biophysics class (only 5 of us out of the 35k that go to this school) so I don't know if I actually like biophysics or not, but I feel like this might be the best path to follow so I could work on diseases, viruses, or something having to do with the environment which I am definitely very passionate about. I know this is my life and ultimately I am the one to make this decision, but outside perspective can sometimes reassure or clarify some things for you.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Biophysics major graduating in a few months and don't know if I want to enter law, physics, or med, which are the only 3 things that really seem to interest me. Law makes me feel like I'd be a dick lawyer but I'm good at, physics is confusing but my major, and med my parents aren't shoving down my throat but strongly encouraging.",20Mar2019,1
179,"I will try to make this as clear as possible. Incoming wall of text!


I'm currently in my mid 20's. I am working now as a dishwasher/wholesale driver for my city's local bakery. While not a bad job per se, it's not really something I am looking at doing career wise in my life. Nor is there anything within the restaurant industry that I am looking at as to a career, that includes being a cook/chef.

So, with that said, I have been thinking about returning back to college. Yes, I have gone before: multiple times, actually.


Dropping out has been a huge issue for me. Not only does it put the brakes on my academic performance, it also drains time/money from myself. Making it a costly endeavour! There are several reasons why I have dropped out:

1.) I lacked motivation. I attempted to try going to the local Community College for transferring credits to an engineering degree (parents, specifically my mother, heavily encouraged this.) While I did want to go and learn, I was not really putting any effort into studying in my classes. In fact, if I remember, I took on 20 credit hours of work and got 2 A's (English 100 and Outdoor Rec) and 2 C-'s (Physics and Pre Calc). Not a good start for an 18 year old attempting college. Later on, my second year, I dropped out and was working part-time as a dishwasher (different store.) My mother found out and was pissed. I was kicked out of the house (I had done other things to warrant anger from her.) Subsequently, I was able to go back to Community College again, but while taking one class: Calculus. I was focused on doing good (while working near full time dish-washing.) I got A-, B, and C for Calc I-III. I thank my grandfather for having me housed and taken cared of. The next year, I took on 10 credits of both Physics and Chemistry. Phys/Chem I : B/A, Phys/Chem II: B/B+. I took matrix algebra as well. C+. Not terrific. But not ""bad"".

Now, here comes transferring to University. For some odd reason, I wanted to apply for a Physics degree. I had no real interest in the discipline. Just felt that it would be interesting. Nope! Fucked up bad after realizing I was not only unprepared, but that I had not interest in going to class. I stopped going after failing assignments and tests in my physics classes. This resulted in getting F's in all my classes. So, yeah, fucking dumb-ass me basically ruined any chance of getting a degree!


2.) Money. After getting kicked out of my family's home, (save it for the time my grandfather took me in for over a year,) I was basically vacillating between having money to having none. Money management was a challenge for me (late teens were a bad learning experience in financial responsibility.) Working a min wage job part time was even more so. Add on to that the fact that I have standing principles for my time at CC *plus* having a payment agreement with the university I went to (that was fucking expensive!) Money has also played a part in reason #1: when you are broke, it's hard to pay for classes! Kinda knew that one just by being alive!


3.) Maturity. Let's get this straight: young me was dumb-ass me! I made a few errors in reason and judgement and it cost me dearly. Financially, academically, personally, and emotionally/(ego). I'm not Superman. Looking at my current transcript, what I see is a mess of an academic. NOT a person who is a future leader who will aspire to be anything in life. Someone who thought they could survive academics, but only to become what they were meant to be: a washed-out, worthless, fucking piece of shit that doesn't belong.

I realise now that my attitude must change and I feel that it has changed for the better! I am willing to take on more work, work hard, and show respect. I still have some issues that I need to work on (finding my personal reinforcements to bring self-motivation.) While the times I was going through college I had multiple opportunities to change: I realise now that time was my friend, not my enemy. Instead of seeing academics and my failures as losing battles, seeing them as potential optimisation problems.


+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


I'm older and wiser. Or, so I feel! With that said, it comes to me on occasion that the need to pursue higher learning is a paramount venture that I myself would enjoy making again. However, with what I know about myself, and with what I wrote above, it seems that I am taking on a fools errand attempting, once again, such things as academic achievement. Why though?


Well, for starters: the seer propensity of knowledge from what I find attractive is a prime motivator. ""What is it that you like?"" Well, interesting enough: Mathematics and computers. Specifically, I like learning about applied mathematics and those that follow under computational science (more than just learning a programming language and plugging away. Still fun, but not the whole picture!) What I *really* would like to do is go back for Applied Math and Computer Science. That would be cool! However, there are several issues:


1.) My academic history for maths and maths-related classes is, er, ""lacking support"".

2.) After dropping out of University, I went back to CC and tried to take some programming classes. Did well in some, not all. Dropped out *again*, due to money.

3.) My biggest issue is: I have been away from college (any college) for years now. Going on 4 years to be exact!


So, while there is that, there is also the fact that I am still on academic probation at my old University! Even if I try to go back, I will be facing a big, bureaucratic, brick-wall. Thought about going to a different university, but realising that my record will still follow me and would hurt me not only via GPA, but integrity wise!


This is a big wall of text. If you have read this far: I want to thank you so much for your time! Even if you wont respond. If you do respond, I hope to get some insight as to what I should do. While the thread title is given, I will leave all responses open-ended. Question (within reason) are free to be asked.

181,"I’ll make this a quick one. Basically me and another social circle in my class have had a growing friendship over the last year. I’ve always been the one person to invite everyone over, plan a day at the pool, plan this that etc, since I want to join that group of friends. And I would say I fitted right in. 

Now, right at the end of our last year ( big goodbye ) they are all planning this last trip together and not inviting me. I’ve overheard them say that it is “their” ( as an original social circle from the beginning ) last goodbye. Also I heard that they didn’t want me to come since they know I don’t really like the groups tase in music, nor am I a real party guy. 

Now I’m feeling kind of hurt.. I’ve been trying to fit in for a year now and it’s been a pretty good time with them, I would consider them my best friends ( don’t know about vice versa ). Now I feel like i won’t get to say a proper goodbye to them since there’s not much time left since we all are going to fuck off away to uni.

So anyways, there is a girl in my class, very intelligent and beautiful, and an amazing personality. I really want to get closer to her and get to know her better. I sit beside her in some classes and have gotten to know her a little bit. The thing is, i tease her often and i don’t know if that has botched any chance of a relationship. She hangs out with the popular girls in the class, (I kind of know some of them too,) and she is always around them. I feel like if I make any kind of Attempt to get to know her better, she will most definitely say no if one of her friends were there. 

Oh, I should also mention my place in the pecking order of popularity;
Everybody knows OF me, but I only hang out with about 7 friends, spread out among 4 classes, 2 in my class. 

A popular girl sits next to me in the same classes that my crush does, and I know her probably as much as I know my crush. She is great friends with my crush, and is the one that always is with my crush. I probably tease her as much as I tease my crush.

185,"I am a Junior in CS at a state school with a solid Computer Science program. I have always enjoyed my Computer Science classes, didn't miss a single class and got a 3.9 overall the first two years of college. These first two years I lived at home, had few friends, and was content with just focusing on my studies. Come the end of the second year, one of my scholarships runs out and I now need to work to pay for half my tuition for the rest of college (I am strongly against pulling out loans). I end up getting a job at company X doing technical support chats. Company X is a company that employs college students by having the students provide customer support for other companies. Company X provides half tuition coverage every semester in addition to $10/hr pay. Perfect for saving a bit and covering college.   


I worked doing technical support chats during the summer, made some college friends, and get my fall semester covered. I absolutely hated doing customer support so I was looking for other job opportunities by the end of summer. Company X is all about employing students, so even the IT team of the building where I worked was entirely students. Company X opens a position for IT, I apply and get offered the position. IT gets paid $14/hr and still gets half tuition coverage. Downside is they must work 30/hrs a week. When I get hired on I am also told that my development skills will be needed for some quality assurance work on company X's web-pages and data transfer programs. In the fall I move out into a cheap apartment: $900 split between my roommate and I. Fall semester was challenging but I got a 4.0 and didn't mind the IT work because it was a bunch of small simple tasks (troubleshoot this computer, add a printer to a computer, setup/take down computer stations). 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things start to go wrong. I am given development quality assurance tasks over winter break and I work 40/hrs a week. I spend a significant amount of time just getting familiar with the code, in addition to my typical IT tasks. The lead programmer is a recently graduated student (\~2 years) and is located in another state. She has worked at the company since before she graduated. I try my best writing some tests for the code that she wanted me to for the web page but I found out quickly how much I was not enjoying that aspect of the job. The tool I was working on testing was for streamlining the process of firing employees and I was extremely demotivated and struggling to figure out how I was supposed to test it. Then Spring semester starts with me doing 12 credit hours.   


Fast forward 3 months of slowly getting through assigned tasks. Now I keep up IT tasks and sometimes attend development meetings but I am rarely assigned tasks. It should be noted the lead programmer is very busy and talks to me only when I ask her about my assigned tasks. My feeling of failure at work in addition to school has been draining me and now I am showing symptoms of depression. My class attendance is the worst it's ever been. I've probably missed about 1/3 of classes, and I have procrastinated all my homework until the last moment. I do the BARE minimum in social interaction and my friends/family are noticing I am not the same to talk to.   


Should I quit my job?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  
I work 30/hrs a week doing development work/IT work and I am doing a bad job so it is depressing me. I have performed well in school and been diligent up until now. Could be burnout, accelerated by failure to do work well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have $10,000 saved up at this point from the past year of work. I know if I quit I will improve mentally, but finances will become a concern before the next school year. I can definitely reduce my expenses to about $750 a month. ",20Mar2019,1

* Dislikes: She is young (22), so she could change her mind in what she wants in a guy (I'm 27). We are also both quiet/listeners so I’m getting used to our “comfortable silence” lol. We haven't had any major ""Aha moments"" where we realized this could be the start of something special.

This is kinda stupid and not a big deal but my anxiety is yelling at me for feeling this way so what do y’all think? 

My family doesn’t real do anything at all together and ever since my nephew been born 9 years ago, I’ve kinda been a deal with when you can project, and pushed a side and I understand when because my other sibling have all this other drama (backing and forth with boyfriend, shellfish npd sister, can’t keep a job,and more) so I know I can’t already get attention a whole lot

I understand I’m older and people have to make sacrifices, and I’m Turing 16 so I’m getting to old for birthdays anyway (but then again people always freak about sweet 16 stuff so...) it just they will come will have to watch the kids that always scream and yelling (they’re something wrong with me that I can get migraines very easy and for some reason I say with them can cause not a headache, an actual migraine.) so a hole week including my birthday we won’t get to go anywhere, they also can’t do thing fun with them because  they take so munch work that we can’t do anything (bored games/movie at home) also I strange I don’t know none of us do my sister even hasn’t know him more than a month is sleeping in our home 

I would feel more sympathetic if this didn’t happen so often and like why do have to she’s literally broken up with this guy and moved dozen of times (not kidding)

It’s not interesting to me and I have trouble understanding literally everything. I never really wanted to do it in the first place, but since I gamed a lot my parents pushed me to do it thinking that I have a passion for the computer science area. 

I tried to convey that to them and they said, “don’t worry, you’ll enjoy it over time” and I really couldn’t disagree more. I’ve been skipping my lectures because I’m so depressed about my life and going to campus everyday to struggle to learn something I’m not passionate about. It’s getting to the point where I’m almost at suicide. But my father found out about me skipping lectures and yelled at me. He said he’s giving me a week to sort my shit out or I’m getting kicked out. I’m 18, 0 income, lost my friends in the college transition and would have nowhere to go.

197,"Alright so I'm a high school girl that walks to and from school. To go to school I have to pass by this liquor store that's right around the corner from my neighborhood and there is always grown ass men hanging around from the time I pass by which is around 7:30 to when I'm walking back home around 2:40. I usually pay no mind to them because they have never bothered me or even spared me a glance with the exception of this super weird guy. He is super weird. He's always looking at me when I pass and I stare him down to let him know that like hey fuck you I know you're looking at me creep, but he still looks at me. I never gave much thought to it till now. I'm getting kind of worried for my safety because I have no idea what he thinks and I feel that one day he's going to do something. I told my parents about him always looking at me, but they told me to keep my head up, keep my phone on me always, be prepared and careful, and don't look scared or nervous. I still feel that it's not enough. I can take an alternative route and go through some neighborhoods when walking home or I can carry a weapon, but I don't know what to do. 

Tl;dr- there's a creep by this liquor store that I have to pass to go to school who is literally always looking at me and going out of his way to be where I pass by. He is staring to actually creep me out and feel worried for my safety.

All was good until this past August, when he stopped hanging out with me on the weekends and told me he didn’t want to go on dates anymore. I thought it was weird, and I argued it, but I eventually got over it. Then October came around and we got our own place. Moving in together was hell. He blamed me for his depression and told me that if it wasn’t for me running away from my problems, then he wouldn’t have such a stressful relationship with his family. This hurt like hell. I dipped into depression, but was handling it okay. 
Until I found out that he had cheated on me. He had cheated on me with a girl from his work. He said he was sorry and wouldn’t do it again, but I still asked one of his coworkers (and one of my friends) if she had seen him with the girl. She said they stopped talking so I felt a bit better. 
Then one day he came home and told me he wanted to leave me. I begged him not to and asked if we could work it out. He said, “if we stay together, it has to be an open relationship” and it hurt so bad. With him leaving, me not being able to afford the bills on my own, and me being too scared to go back to living with my abusive mother, I decided the best thing to do was kill myself. 
I woke up in the hospital after overdosing. They put me in a mental hospital and in there, he visited and asked me to be with him again. All felt okay until I got back and noticed he was acting weird. After a few weeks, I did the worst thing and checked his phone (I know, in that moment I was one of those) and I found nudes he sent to multiple women. I woke him up and asked about it and he admitted that he had been having relations with TWENTY different women. All while I was in the hospital fighting for my life. 
Since then he has cancelled the wedding because he just can’t see himself marrying me. He has also said that I’ve ruined his life and I ruined our relationship. I don’t know what to do anymore.

203,"so, sorry for the format. i'm using mobile

let me give some background.

my dad and i have never really saw eye to eye after stuff in the past that had happened like 7 years ago that i'm still angry at him for. we would get into arguments and such, and sometimes we would fist fight each other when things got really bad. like REALLY bad. he's been putting me down pretty much my entire life and even told me straight up that he doubted i'd ever do well on my own and that i had deserved the stuff that had happened to me when i was younger.

so, about 4 or 5 months pass and he tells me that i need to figure out a way to leave because he's basically just tired of me being there and that he's just done with me not doing well in school and that i should just quit and move out. so, i do exactly that. about a month later, after some planning, i tell him about moving to mankato with my now girlfriend and her friend. and when i finally moved out, i had to sign this legal document stating that i was moving voluntarily and that nothing was on bad terms (even though there was a lot). i do so, and we discuss times to call him to keep him updated, which is reasonable to me.

since moving out, almost two months have passed and her friend wanted to kick me out for feeling suicidal about another situation that had happened earlier, and now i'm back at my dad's, with him telling me that he was fine with me coming back. well, little did he know, i had worked out a deal with her friend after we had cooled down, with me basically coming back to her place in a couple days after i get this job at a speedway that's close to my girlfriend's work. her friend and i both agreed to this.

when i got my dad's place, i had told him that, although i'm 110% positive i'm getting this job at the speedway gas station, i'll still apply to jobs in lakeville as a failsafe on the off chance that i actually don't get the job. he told me that this was fine and he would work the chore chart we have so that i can help out around the house. i had also agreed to that and said that that was fine. 

now, i'm finding out from her friend and my girlfriend that he went behind my back and called her friend, saying that i, ""ruined my chance of being on my own and that i can't come back again.""

so my question is this: even though i had signed a legal document saying that i was moving voluntarily, which i think is emancipation?, and i go back for basically a couple days, does he have the right to just keep me there because he can? or can he not? 

i'm scared to ask since we all know how reddit is sometimes, but i just want to be sure since i don't want to start a legal battle or something. i've honestly just scared of him as a person just cause of what he's done since as long as i can remember and i don't want to stay in his house longer than i have to. i thought this would be the place to post about this since i don't know all the legal margins for this stuff and some help would be wonderful right now.",20Mar2019,1

206,"A little backstory first: my fiance and I are getting married next month and she has been taking birth control for a few weeks now just to get her body used to taking birth control. As a result, she has been more hormonal lately and deals with anxiety/ depression in life.

So, my fiance and I are in a same class where we recently took an exam. That day was really hard for her with other assignments, work, projects and classes loading on top all coming to a close with the exam we had to take. She was in no mental state to take this exam as throughout the day she had been having anxiety attacks and spouts of depressic episodes (dont worry, she is seeing the doctor tomorrow to talk about everything that has been going on).

&amp;#x200B;

She thinks she didnt do well on the test and talked with the TA's about what happened that day, during the test and after the test as well as if there was anything to do to make up for it. The TA talked with the professor about this and he said that there are extra credit opportunities to make up for exams we feel dissatisfied about. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the semester he said that he wants to make the class fair to us and if we think something is unfair to talk to him or the TA's about it and see what can be done. So, considering how my fiance was mentally shut down that day we thought it was unfair for her to have to take the test. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do now. Are we in the wrong and she should just accept her grade? Is there a better way to approach the professor when dealing with mental health issues? I just feel that different measures would be taken for someone who was sick and couldnt take the test due to throwing up or something like that.

I feel my professor went back on his word of making the class fair for everyone because my fiance had anxiety attacks and a depressic episode the day we took an exam. How can I best approach this problem?",20Mar2019,1

I think I may have a solution, but I’m not totally sure about the details.

212,"To preface everything, this kid didn't used to be all that bad. It wasn't until his last year of middle school until shit really hit the fan and kickstarted this whole ordeal. I'm also going to refer to my cousin as C, I'm posting this on behalf of my aunt (A), and her son (S), who have a shared custody with his mother (M), who is unable to financially support herself, let alone a child.  


We don't really know how he got started with all this, it was probably usual peer pressure that got him to try it. Though, my aunt thinks it was his mother that got him to try it. He's been kicked out of several schools and is now attending a sort of correctional facility for his education. He has been through countless meetings, therapy sessions, he's even gotten a few talks form police officers that had to come down to the house (I'll get to that in a bit).  
He first started off with weed, then he started drinking, then smoking cigs, then xanax, and according to M, heroin. His behavior has also gotten more violent as his drug habits worsened, it went from shouting back and forth at A and S, to getting into physical confrontaions with S (which warranted police visits, and landed A in urgent care a few times due to all the stress). Now, whenever he doesnt get his way, he breaks stuff, throws things, and only focuses his anger at A, since he knows he can break her with enough verbal abuse.  


Now, A is probably the person who C spends the most time with, as A takes him to school and back, and generally watches him for the day while S is at work. Throughout the day, C will pester A for money, food, or beg A to take him somewhere. A says no most of the time, since she know's how C is. But C does not take no for an answer anymore, before A can give C a reason why she said no, C goes off on A. Pelting her with insults and yelling ""you don't do shit for me"" and ""I'm a kid, you're supposed to provide for me"", things of that nature. All until A either gives in or drives off to calm herself down.

I get along with everyone except one woman who seemingly has it out for me for reason I suspect are due to a guy in our office (27M). 

When I first started the woman in question, B paid me no mind. She did her thing,  i did mine but the office gossip was she had a thing for C. I never noticed much in that regard besides the fact that she paid him a compliment here and there and they laughed together sometimes.  For context, C is from England and he is biracial.

C and I bonded over soccer we both support EPL teams so we talked about games and stats a lot. I guess B noticed because that's when things started to sour between me and her. The first slight came when she saw me and C watching match highlights at lunch, she came to the table and asked what we were doing blah,blah, blah. She then turned her attention to me and started asking about my hair extensions (weave), I'm not ashamed about it so I explained the process when I was done I said something like ""so yea that's weave for you."" She then asks C his opinion on weave and C says "" I don'r care as long as a girl looks good."" She tries to add  a but to her question but she drops it and leaves.

A few weeks go by and B starts monitoring my every move and reporting me to my supervisor if she assumes I'm violating company policy. She also starts spreading rumors about me to the other women saying i bought my ass because ""her waist is too small and it's huge"" when i'm in the gym every morning before work and i'm a size 6 in pants. She was generally picking petty arguments with me over stuff she had no authority over like wanting to know about my leaving for a doctor's appointment. The pettiest thing that even put C on alert was the way she accused me of creating a hostile work environment with my ""constant flirting with male coworkers.""  HR dismissed it but I have no idea what she'll do next and I honestly feel targeted.

218," 

Hi all, i’m sorry if this isn’t the correct subreddit to put this, i’m a mess right now and just trying to reach out for any help. If there’s another sub I should post this please direct me there. As you can see from the title, my baby sister is depressed and is now abusing drugs and alcohol on a pretty regular basis. Only problem is, my parents don’t know the real extent of her drug abuse because she doesn’t trust them enough to tell them anything. Which means, i’ve suddenly become the person she tells everything to. I just am so lost as to how to help, I think rehab is the best answer but my family is trying to keep her in school/her schedule as normal as possible, but I think this is a red alert situation.

Some background:

I’m 26 oldest of 3 siblings, I have my own family now (spouse and toddler) and live about 2 hours away from my parents house. My sister is 14, runs with a completely new set of friends (as of August?) and is a freshman in high school. My family is extremely close-knit, eldest siblings all did great in school (top grades/athletes) no history of mental illness in my family, no drug/alcohol use from any of us so this is all completely new.

The issue:

On January 15 she took a bunch of pills (not sure what kind/how much) at school and was found passed out in the bathroom. Security called an ambulance and took her to a hospital which transferred her to a 72 hour suicide watch facility. While she was in the hospital my mom did some digging (i’m not sure how, i’m assuming through her phone/her room) and found out she’s been buying/selling weed, getting into fights and shoplifting from Ulta, Victoria’s Secret, etc. and trying to resell stuff. 

After she got out of the hospital there were a lot of fights, tears, etc from all sides but my parents decided it was best to seek therapy for her and get some tools to try and handle what was happening. She started up on the therapy, etc. seemed like things were getting better, she still pretty much hated my parents, but at least was staying out of drugs/trouble. 

It all came crashing down two days ago when she drank an entire bottle of vodka while at school and passed out. She was caught on video throwing up and falling in the hallway and the video circulated all over her school and I ended up seeing it on facebook. She was brought to the hospital again where they pumped her stomach. 

After she got out of the hospital I went to see her and had a big heart to heart with just her and me. She started telling me all this crazy stuff about how shrooms and psychedelic drugs will cure her depression, that this life doesn’t matter because we all come back any way/live again and that no one understands her, that the government lies to us about how good drugs are and how they can help people. She kept telling me that she finally found a group of friends that feel the way she does and that can help her see the light and that they provide her all the drugs she needs (HUGE red flag). She also said she’s proud of the video, that she’s popular at school because of it and is making even more friends now. I didn’t yell or react or anything, just tried to hold her hand and talk softly so she would keep talking. She finally revealed that she took xanax along with the vodka which is what made her throw up so much. She also told me that she took shrooms for the first time last weekend at her friends house and that she doesn’t need therapy anymore because she’s cured do to the shrooms. And that she can’t wait to try it again, and that it was such an amazing experience so she had to tell me. She also mentioned that her friends are the ones that supplied her the money, took her to the dealers house and taught her how to use it. I reacted loudly to this last reveal, saying that I didn’t understand why she was doing this and why it was so important to her friends that she participates in this behavior, and she got super defensive and said that if I tell our mother about what she’s doing, she’ll kill herself. Then she kicked me out of her room.

It just completely breaks me to see her like this, she’s such a smart bright kid but ever since she started high school she’s gone downhill so fast. I’m in such a scary position right now, my parents have no clue about the video/the extent of the drug use (they think she just smokes/sell weed, they don’t know about the xans/shrooms) and i’m so afraid that if I tell them my sister will find out and either hurt herself or my parents (there’s weapons in the house). I’m so far away that this would have to be a phone call and I feel so helpless dropping this bomb and not being there to be able to help with the aftermath. I’m embarrassed to admit i’m terrified of her and the power she has in this situation, and that any move I make can potentially mean life or death, or harm to my parents.

I’m just looking for any advice as to if/how/when I should tell my parents, if this is normal (?!?) 2019 teen behavior, if I should call a treatment center or a new therapist or something just anything I can do. I feel so helpless and I just want her to be safe and alive and I just don’t know what my best move is right now.

TLDR: Baby sister is 14 years old and depressed/suicidal, admitted yesterday that she has moved on from weed to shrooms/xanax/alcohol. Said if I told my parents she would kill herself. Need advice on whether I should call them or take another course of action since I can’t physically be there to defuse the situation should one arise.",20Mar2019,15

I'm currently in my first year of University and making friends has never been easy for me, but I knew of a girl from my hometown how also decided to come here, so we became closer, we eventually made more friends and became part of a larger friend group, but me and the girl were still closer to each other then the rest of the group, she would come to me to vent and talk about family issues and I would listen and give what little advice I could, I felt like maybe we really were becoming great friends and they could be someone I could really trust.

So 6 months pass were all perfect I feel great having an awesome group of friends the girl and I were still closer then the others but we all got along really well.

In the background of all of this (I'm the only guy in this group of 9) so not everything gets told to me, turns of the girl I trusted had been lying so everyone even me about was happening, I was being fed false information on the daily, she had said to another friend and I quote ""I'm so good to Tropicpizza (not my real name if you couldn't tell) I'm like a blessing"" but this girl had turn out to be the opposite.

 Everyone of us expect her talked it out and found out the truth, so we had all decided we had enough and wanted to sit down and talk to her.

So we did, last night well all sat down and said what we had on our minds, she admitted to every single thing that she had done, so we had finally caught her, we then talked it out but things became even more derailed, after admitting to all of these terrible things she had put us all through  and flat out said ""I'm okay never being friends again, with any of you, we only have a month left of school anyways."" This fucking struck me deep I can't really go into details about everything she did but none of it was stuff that was okay.

She blames all of it on the way she was brought up and the she was caudled so she didn't understand how any of this was any of her fault. 

I sat their quietly I didn't know how to react in the slightest to any of it, suddenly all I felt was angry and sadness I'm still dazed about it and really not sure of to feel about any of it, she caused all of these problems for people and then just straight up tossed all of us to curb without a single sorry, not single one for anything.

Thank you to anyone that read any or all of this, my mind is still confused and I'm just gonna keep my head down for a while.",20Mar2019,1

Back in August 2013 when I was 15 years old, I (USA) performed sexually explicit acts for an adult (CANADA) over Skype video messenger. The man was a prominent owner of a gaming community in a game I played, and he used his power to abuse and potentially record me performing these sexual acts. 

After all of this time I would like to take action if any would be possible? I realized recently that I do think these events traumatized me, which is why I would like to do something now. I don’t know how these things work internationally but any advice would be greatly appreciated.",20Mar2019,1

225,"Some backstory, my gf's mom kicked her out a little over a week ago while drunk. My gf's mom is verbally, mentally and physically abusive. Two days ago my gf's dad gave her the option of staying away from home for another week to make a decision of staying or moving out. My parents know everything. (Except that she's my gf, my parents are very homophobic and transphopic)

Basically, my mom told me that I can be lucky that I don't have to live like that. But that's just the problem. My mom is narcissistic and manipulative. If there is a problem between me and her, she tries to make herself the victim and gets everyone on her side, and it always works. 

I have now come to realise that PMS causes me a slight bit of depression. It doesn't do that for my mom (although I think she's on the shot now) so she will just say I'm faking it.

But I'm not. I've actually gone into a mindset many times where I just want to hurt myself and I don't like it. The worst I've ever done is scratch my arms so that I break the skin and it scabs over. But still, it's not good. And I haven't gone into such a state in over three/four months. But my mom kinda might've made me go into one again.

This is where the title makes sense. The worst my mom has ever done is verbal and mental abuse. Everytime I try to bring it up and talk to someone about it, they say it's 'not that bad', that I'm 'overreacting', and I nust need to 'get over it'. But she has done this throughout my entire life, and she has even made it so that my stepdad refuses to acknowledge when she does something like that to me. The last time I tried to talk to him about it, he yelled at me, saying that my mother is the only person who really cares about me and that she sacrificed everything. That's a load of bullshit. My mom never spent enough time with me as a kid, she gave me to my grandma to raise me. And then she blamed my grandma for keeping me away from her.

The thing that triggered the pms depression state this time is very stupid when said out loud, but for me this is actually something valid that triggered it. I asked that when she cooks (because while she waits she just plays candy crush on her phone), if she could please wash some of the bowls that she used to make it easier for me to do the dishes. But she just started yelling at me, calling me ungrateful and threatening to stop giving me any food.

This might make this entire post invalid to some people, but I'm 19, almost 20. I don't have a job and I'm a full time university student that studies from home. This is actually a very important factor, because my parents are paying for my studies and I have nowhere else to live.

I just want someone to look at this and tell me that my problems are valid, no matter how stupid it may seem to some. I need advice on how to manage the depressive state I go into. I need help.",20Mar2019,1
226,"I am not sure what to do at this point because I really really fucked up this time. Basically, I had a 5-7 page paper that I was assigned (16 year old in 11th) around 3 weeks ago that I never started. It was due this Monday and I was planning on doing it all on the weekend. Well who guessed that I did not do any of it and I also got sick over the weekend. So I said to myself ""I am going to do it on Monday, and take a sick day"" Well Monday passed and I didn't do anything, Tuesday also passed and I said the same thing again, resulting in me not doing anything. 

So I am stuck in this shitty position where I wasted those two days doing nothing and just  getting more and more behind in school.

227,"Recently, an acquaintance(f16) invited my friend(f16) and I to her church event last Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

Leading up to the event, I asked the acquaintance what kind of event it would be and she said that it would be some sort of carnival to give some publicity to church, so of course, I didn't mind going for it. However, on the day we were going to the church, I asked her some more questions and she gave me really vague answers. I found it kinda shady but my friend, didn't seem to mind so I relaxed a bit and went for the event.

Turns out, it wasn't a carnival, but a christian gathering for teens/youth. Worst part of it was that it wasn't even in a church, it was in a rented room from a shop-house. I decided to stay so I wouldn't seem rude, and endured through the sharing and Praise &amp; Worship sessions. I was quite alright throughout the session but it wasn't so pleasant when the people there tried to talk to me. They had that fake friendliness tone to their voice, and it seemed really forced. It did start to sound a bit more natural after a while of talking to them, but they eventually somehow peer pressured me into giving them my phone number.

The next few days they have been constantly messaging me, asking me if I was free to attend their other sessions. I tried being as polite as I can to reject their offer but they've been very insistent. So far, I have blocked most of them but the acquaintance is the one that seems to message me the most, she keeps trying to get me to follow her to other church events. Its also incredibly difficult to avoid her as I see her in school as well. 

How do I get them to stop?

228,"I am a mentally ill individual turning 30 in a few weeks. I've always felt like there was something holding me back from actually working in groups. I've always felt excluded, and ostracized. One on one I could interact with anybody, we'd get along great, but the second there was more than one person, the dynamic changed entirely. I never really learned to negotiate that. Public speaking, that's another thing - that's talking to a wall.   


I grew up with two older brothers. My mother was of the school of thought that sibling violence is normal and healthy. I don't know if I agree or disagree with that, or if that's bad or good, but I do know that my brothers beat the living shit out of me all the time.   


I grew up fighting. I fought at school. I fought at home. I fought everywhere. I didn't pick fights, but I responded so aggressively to any form of perceived bullying that I got into them frequently enough.   


The point is that I have been conditioned my entire life to respond to aggression with maximum aggression. I know now that's not the healthiest thing in the world.   


Well, after a time, it felt like every interaction I was getting into was just toxic, and poisoned. I felt like I couldn't connect with anybody. Every negative interaction made me feel and that everyone was out to get me. Like there was somehow a conspiracy against me. Well, I may be mentally ill, but I'm not crazy - and I can recognize there's no conspiracy. Nobody is out to get me.   


So then for awhile I got it in my head that the world is the problem. Clearly there is no conspiracy, I thought,  \*everyone is just an asshole\*.   


I'm not sure why I came to that conclusion - because the only common thread in all these interactions was myself. The most plausible answer is that there is something about myself, something about \*me\* that is pushing people to this sort of aggression.   


But I meant well, and I only fought back, and that's why I thought I wasn't the problem - because I had positive intentions. Well my intent doesn't change my language, and people understand me through that language. They can't magically know that I meant well. They can't know my past, or that I respond to what I perceive to be attacks in an aggressive manner.   


How do I get past this need to respond so defensively? How can I get past this primal fear that drives me to posture so aggressively? ",20Mar2019,1
229,"I cringe when every time someone uses the word rape. But that is what happened. It was your stereotypical party event. Where I got really wasted because people kept giving me drinks. I should've known better not to keep drinking. 

And when I am drunk I will literally make up with anyone or anything. It was my friend's birthday. We weren't close but we were still friends. I didn't know if I wanted to go at first but my other friend wanted to go too. So I said why not it'll be fun. I wish I never went. I got really drunk. My friend kept grabbing me to dance with him and pulling me on his lap. I didn't think anything of it at first because he was my friend and I was just really drunk already.  I didn't think anything bad would happen because he was my friend and I trusted him. 

Every time we talked, he didn't show any interest. So I wasn't worried.  He asked for a kiss on the cheek and I gave one because I thought nothing of it. But the next thing I know, we are making out. I just wasn't thinking I was so drunk. I snapped out of it eventually and left and went upstairs with my friend. We both blacked out on the beds and were falling asleep. My entire body was numb and I just could not move. But my friend comes up and just whips me over his shoulder like a meat sack.

 I am so ashamed of how vulnerable I was in the situation. So easily thrown over his shoulder. He brings me to the next room and locks it. I felt everything he did to me but none of it felt good. My entire body was numb and I was so dizzy. But the feelings from that night are so vivid. It happened a few months ago but everyone is starting to find out. I guess I don't even care about people finding out anymore but I just can't get rid of the feeling every time someone brings it up. I feel dirty and I feel like a piece of shit. 

I know it's not my fault. I couldn't do anything. But I just can't help feeling like I'm disgusting and tainted. It just hurts so much more because I thought he was a friend. My mind was vulnerable and I chose to believe that nothing would ever happen to me. I have been doing fine for a while but every time I see him or he is brought up I just have panic attacks and I start shaking or I can't breathe. 

What's worse is he lives like a minute away from me. So the chances of running into him are high. The first few weeks was the worst. I had marks everywhere to remind me of what was done to me. I couldn't even tell my parents because I was so ashamed, I had to cover my neck at all times. He asked if he could give me hickeys and I remember shaking my head but he just went ahead with it. And I didn't do anything to stop him.

234,"So to briefly summarize the problem.

About a year ago me and a girl become really close friends. We sat together late at night looking at the stars, we trusted each other with nearly anything. We still do. We confided in each other about our problems. That's when it happened, about a month ago she told me; She'd been cutting for about 4 months. ( 5 months from when this was posted). I of courses offered her as much help as I could. She could call or text me at anytime, she could always rant to me about her problems. I think I help, but not enough, she still cuts. So the question that keeps nagging at my brain is this: is it selfish of me not to tell her parents about this? She obviously doesn't want me to tell anyone but if nothing get's better and I can't give her the help she needs then I don't see any other viable option. Also, I don't know her parents or have their numbers because I know her through a friend. So I'd have to go through his parents making them know about it. Also, to add more to the problem, she thinks she's depressed, and she also has frequent anxiety attacks. I love her so much and I only want what's best for her. I asked her if she would even consider telling her parents to get professional help and she said no, they'd be super angry and would probably send her to a mental hospital. Whether or not that's true, I know now that I can't convince her to tell her parents or seek professional help/medication. I'm really unsure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Recap, My friend is cutting, depressed, and has anxiety attacks almost daily. (sometimes more often). I can continue on and hope that things get better keeping our relationship, or I could tell her parents, definitely ending our relationship, also her life would be fucked up, at least for a while. I have no idea what to do at this point. I've thought of it a lot and I've reached no decisive conclusion. Please, someone offer some insight into this frightening situation.

He's been talking about renting a house, travel plans, etc ever since he found out about the wedding a few months back. I didn't say anything to him because I was hoping she'd change her mind, and frankly I didn't have the heart to tell him.  He's always been a bit of an outcast (can be embarrassing at times), and on top of this, he got crushed in 2008 and has really been struggling financially since. My Mom separated from him a couple years before his financial troubles started, and both my sister and I lived with her (but still saw him frequently) for the 2nd half of our childhood years.  

I wouldn't say that I'm particularly close with my sister.  She's been dealing with mental health issues throughout her life, and can be emotionally unstable at times, so I've always felt like I needed to maintain a relationship with her.  They were apparently planning on me being a big part of the wedding (her words), but all I've been thinking about recently is how devastating this is for my dad.  The thought of being at the wedding surrounded by his entire side of the family except for him is nauseating.  He's been really down and out lately (before he found out), having had surgery which hasn't resolved his chronic neck pain, on top of his continued financial instability.  I'm becoming increasingly worried that he might try to hurt himself, particularly the weekend of the wedding, which would be rock bottom for him. Other than me, he has literally nobody else in his life, no real friends, and has always been the outcast amongst his siblings.

248,"Hear me out.

I’m the adult daughter of divorced parents—in case I need to refer to them throughout this post, V is my father and A is my mother. My parents divorced when I was a very young child because my father decided to leave my mother for an insane woman (named S) who threatened bodily harm to me on multiple occasions and almost abandoned me in public on multiple occasions. CPS was a big part of my childhood. Clearly, she is a lovely woman.

About 7 years ago, my father had a son with S, named B. B is on the spectrum, is nonverbal, and has issues controlling his behavior. He’s challenging to raise , despite all the resources he receives from school and from my father. While per court orders, custody is supposed to be 50/50 between my father and S, most of the time B is with my father. S doesn’t work and literally lives off the money my father gives her in child support, spending it on boob jobs/other plastic surgery and going to Other City down the state every month. What I’m trying to illustrate is that S is a shitty person, a shitty mother, and lives and thrives off of shitty agreements that my father cannot fight in court. I apologize for the mostly irrelevant rant, but this situation just makes me so frustrated.

Another important piece of information is that, at the time B was conceived, S was most likely in Other City. The timing is off. What’s more, B was born “premature”, but was a normal weight for a baby.

Moreover, my father is a very tall fair-skinned man. S is a woman of average height who is more dark-skinned. When B was born, he looked like NEITHER OF HIS PARENTS. And, to this day, HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE EITHER MY FATHER NOR S. The *only*, and I truly mean this when I say it, the *only* similar trait B shares with my father is his height—B is abnormally tall for his age. But, again, he looks like neither his mother nor my father. He looks like someone totally different. Obviously S is his mother because my father was in the delivery room, but obviously the paternity is dubious for the various reasons that I’ve listed.

I want to know how I can secretly test the paternity of B. I don’t think I can swab my father’s cheek or anything with it being super obvious, but I can definitely do it with B. I do have access to my father’s toothbrush.

249,"I’ll try to keep this as condensed as possible. I have been dating my boyfriend now for over a year. I am 28F, he is 31M. In the beginning we had some issues about his “female friends” and weather or not he slept with them (he said they were just friends, and didn’t think it was important to include those factors.)

He had slept with **several** of his female friends. I tried not to be bothered by it because we are both adults. I asked him to please disclose me of his friends that he had slept with. I did the same. 

There is a particular girl from his college that he hadn’t seen in years, before he met me, that he dated but had been best friends with, dated, decided it wasn’t right but stayed friends. I had no issues with him being friends with her, although he stated several times that he hasn’t seen her in months/years and that they barely speak, and she came into town and she was annoying. We will call her Nat. 

We were driving home and a text popped up on his dash board (linked to his car) and it was from Nat. It read “Happy 4th baby!! I love you!!😘💕 “

I scrunched my brow and so did he. He didn’t respond. A few weeks later was his birthday and he played his birthday messages. The one from Nat said “Hey baby!!!! Just calling to say I love you! I miss you! *kisses* ok baby, bye!” 

I had had enough. I asked if he still had feelings because clearly she does. He said no, He didn’t. He blocked her. It was a peaceful 6 months. 

9 months later she emails him and says

“Hey,
I don’t know why you’re ghosting me like my other ex. You know how bad that hurt me. We have been friends for 10 years!  This is my FINAL attempt to contact you and see if we are still friends.”

I told my boyfriend to respond or not but he chose not to. 

It’s now March, and she just sent him a facebook friend request... he made a new account. Should he send a message telling her to leave him alone? He is kind of creeped out and now so am i. Why doesn’t she get the hint?? Should he sent a message saying leave me alone since ghosting clearly doesn’t register?

Should i message her?",20Mar2019,1
251,"The title screams a bit of a different message than I’m intending. 

I’m on my third term at Community College and I’m planning on transferring to a University in about a year or so. I’m working part time at a job that has absolutely nothing close to do with my major and I’m mostly paying out of pocket for school.

I’m a pretty good student, always have been. I don’t have trouble passing classes at all. My issue lies in why I chose my major and what I consider to be fear of uncertainty. 

I’m majoring in Journalism and I want to become a Sports Journalist. I’ve always been obsessed with sports and finer details I just couldn’t hang with the Varsity guys cause I’m extremely undersized. I want to work in the media. I have a major pet peeve with the inaccuracy of sports broadcasts and horrible takes from journalists and analysts that are just down right wrong. (Ex. Steven A saying Haskins is a running QB.) 

The lack of motivation comes from the fact I’ve never done it before, and every time I earn enough free time to work on creating some sort of media, like Youtube videos or something to work on my craft (i don’t care who watches it’s strictly for experience). I’ll start working, become demotivated in a few hours and end up doing something else. It’s tough because I know I’m capable I just feel a mental block. I have all these great ideas I just never execute. I don’t know how to push past it. It makes me doubt my major because I’m worried if I cant do it out of a hobby I won’t enjoy having to do it for a living. 

What should I do?/ Tips for getting past mental barrier? 
",20Mar2019,0
252,"So my best friend I’ve know since I was 17, we both suffer from mental illness which of course made things a little difficult. But we were absolutely inseparable and had so many things in common. Every time we would spend time with each other it felt like a break.

He was dating one of my best friends when we had initially started to talk every single day, and on top of that made it a point to spend at least a couple hours together everyday. Of course we started to develop feelings and were physically attracted to one another. So, things had started to fall apart in his relationship with his now ex after about a year. We decided to take our friendship eminently and we both loved each other very much.

After a while we started to become very co dependent on one another because we were all each other had. He had moved in with me and I had experienced only living with my narcissistic parents so of course my deep emotional attachment to him had become unhealthy and him to me as well. We started fighting everyday and all I had wanted was for him to commit to me and actually have me as a whole in our relationship. Which for him making it official was “putting a label and excessive pressures on the relationship.” He had always told me “I can’t be in relationships,” which confused me because he had been in relationships before and he was in one with my ex-best friend. 
 
In our apartment I was paying for all the bills, the groceries, necessities for our animals, and even buying him things like cigarettes and clothes. All on one income and I had barely gotten any help from him. He had become very distant after countless arguments and episodes  and I knew it was because of the confrontation happening literally everyday and us hurting each other. 

One night I was sleeping in our room and the patio is right outside the window or the bedroom. He was on the phone with someone else for hours early in the morning, because he knew I was working full time and actually had to get some sleep at night. He was clearly talking to another girl but was saying word for word the things he had said to me to make me feel special and wanted. Of course my heart completely shattered but I didn’t saying anything for a while. I became all snoopy and started looking through his phone and saw pictures and I love you texts to and from her. Which is never the person I wanted to become because I put all the trust I had in him and he was aware of that. I was so hurt that he could tell me to my face that he loved and cared but would repeat the same exact things to another girl and come to cuddle me up at night. 

Certain events took place and he moved out. And I kept asking him “why?” “Why cant you commit to me?” And I got multiple answers, like previously stated, “I can’t be in relationships,” “I didn’t want to ruin the friendship.” And then he says to me “I gave it a shot and i knew it wouldn’t work out.” The entire time we’ve known each other he’s told me those same things. 

Now he’s moved on to a relationship with this same girl he was talking to while he was living with me. He just recently told me that he’s been talking to this girl for two years. So about half the time we’ve known each other, and we both wanted to stay friends because of course we still care and love each other and were positive energies to each other. But the past year we’ve been friends has just been completely toxic and we only say and do things to hurt each other. I just recently found out they’re engaged and I’m having a really hard time on choosing between my individual happiness and my happiness in our friendship. I’ve had him for so long and I’ve seen him almost everyday for four years and it’s hard to think of life without him. But my heart aches every time I see that he’s moved on and found his happiness and it’s not me. I’m so confused and unsure of what to do. I have these boundaries but some of them he thinks are completely unreasonable and to me it’s just what I can and can’t handle at the moment. I knew once it became intimate it would create a whole different situation for us, but our friendship when he was dating my best friend was our best times.

Is there anyway that I can get over these feelings and still have a friendship with him? Or is it really true that once you’ve crossed that line you can never go back? ",20Mar2019,8

I have a full time job as a Warehouse flow specialist so I get 40 hours plus a ton of Overtime (normally 10 to 15 hours a week). They are graveyard shifts but I'm used to being a night owl. I really want to get into the Technical field and work with computers since it has been a passion of mine for a long time. I also would like to learn languages as I wish to travel all around the world one day.I have quite the amount of free time but I can never utilize it to its potential.

255,"To put things into perspective here, I am a Junior in college studying Computer Engineering. I have major ADHD, and take Adderall every day to assist it. 

To start, my inability to focus is causing a number of problems. Most of the time in classes, I don't really learn. I find myself drifting off, not caring, thinking about other things I would rather be doing. I don't check for when assignments are due, and usually either turn them in, or end up missing due dates. I start conversations with family and friends over the phone or email, and suddenly I just stop responding to them. I think it's because I lose focus on the conversation, or I'm not interested, but I cant stop doing it. This reason alone is why I recently broke up with my GF of 4 years, I seldomly responded to text, calls, etc. And often times completely forgot conversations altogether sometimes missing key info. I get the feeling that when I'm not interested in something, or something else more 'fun' or 'interesting' comes along I change focus like a light switch, and I'm finding that I really have problems telling myself ""No.""

I was even offered an interview with a company I had been eyeing for a while, and I missed the interview because I wanted to play games with my friends. The fact alone that I'm aware that I did that, and made the conscious decision to skip out on something life changing is pitiful enough. I find myself waiting till I'm receiving warnings to pay my bills, When I could easily pay them on time. I'm honestly confused how I even allow such a thing to happen. Additionally, my rent was due a month ago, my mother nags me every day that I'm home, or whenever she gets the chance, that I need to pay the rent. I always say ""of course, I will as soon as possible."" And then I never fucking do like WHAT?

I'm finding that my priorities are completely out of wack, and on nights like this where I feel like I need to do something to help/stop, I start taking steps towards solving the problem. I start writing down my assignments more often, checking the website for info, I'll check my texts to see if I missed anything, I'll pay overdue bills, etc. I start trying to solve the problem, but the next day it's like nothing even happened, I either use the thing I setup, and end up quitting. Or I just completely ignore it altogether. It's insane.

I've created such garbage habits, and as the year goes on they get progressively worse and I find myself at the end frantically scurrying to fix it all. I lack common sense and it's infuriating. 

There are a lot more parts to this issue, but I procrastinated on a project due tomorrow, and I feel like if I don't do something now, I won't get it done. At this point I'm up for any options because I'm running out of chances, and while I realize that now, I don't think I'll realize it tomorrow.",20Mar2019,1

258,"This just happened and so I am still slightly freaking out. I am a 19 year old male living in Taiwan for 7 months and today on the way back to my apartment a woman approached me as I was entering the complex. She said that she needed a language partner and I looked American (I am). She said she saw me walking and decided to approach me. She was very nice but kept insisting on seeing my Chinese book because she said she wanted to see what edition I used. I said it was in my apartment and she said she would wait for me to bring it down. When I was coming back down I saw that she was already in the stairs next to my floor. She was very insistent on seeing the inside of my apartment. I am fully aware of how sketchy this situation is but I am a very socially awkward person so I was afraid to say no.

 Once inside she immediately sits down on my bed and starts asking questions about me. I try to play along but am getting very uncomfortable. Finally she starts getting very personable and starts asking me about my sex life. I am a virgin and so I was curious as to see where this would go even if there were a million alarms going off in my head. She starts kissing me, and this finally leads to the deed. She specifically asked me before hand if it was ok and I said yes like an idiot. So after it is all done I immediately feel like shit and am freaking out. She says this will be our secret and she still wants to be language partners. She then leaves.

259,"My daughter, who is a junior in high school, was in the restroom when a couple of girls showed up and grabbed her from behind while she was looking at herself in the mirror over the sink. They began slapping her, punching her, and kicking her. A boy eventually came in as well and started harassing her too, so this had to be planned. This was captured on video and one of the girls stupidly put it on her Twitter. My daughter told us about this when she got home from school, and later showed us the video after one of her friends saved and sent it to her in case it was deleted. She then revealed that the boy who joined in was her ex-boyfriend. At this point I was fucking fuming and asked my daughter where he lived, but she would not tell me, and my wife didn't want her to tell me either in fear of me doing something stupid.

 I then drove to the school to tell the principal because my daughter had not informed anyone there. I explain to them the situation and get asked for my phone number, to which they will call me later. I get a call from the School Director or whatever, and he says that they will review the video evidence and suspend anyone who threw any hits, including my daughter. Now, my daughter did try to defend herself in the video and is seen hitting back, so I am stunned after hearing this. I ask him if he would prefer his own daughter to stay still while being attacked instead of defending herself. He ignores the question and says that he will get back to me later.

260,"I didnt really realize it for about 5 months because of my lifestyle/social life but it has since caused me to lose my relationship of 7 years. 

Once last school year ended in early May I became very lonely as I worked full time in a place where I didnt feel like I had a ton of meaningful friendships so every day was the same; wake up at 8 go to work until 5 or 6 then go home and sit by myself until I was ready to go to sleep. I didn't get to see my girlfriend or my friends from home often so I became very used to being alone. Then in August once school started again I thought things would be better because me and my girlfriend were living together so I wouldn't be lonely. This resulted in me becoming very reliant on her. I cared a lot more about her being happy than I did myself and I stopped doing things that I enjoyed doing. I then became jealous easily which resulted in a lot of arguments. Eventually we agreed that we had to end our relationship before we lost our friendship. So, about a month and a half ago we broke up but we have remained very close. Things have gotten easier on that front as I have since started doing things I enjoy like basketball, running, video games, programming, etc. I eat pretty healthy. I've been more socially active but still don't feel like I have any meaningful friendships. I started to see a counselor at my university and I am on antidepressants but overall things still suck. I still get anxious, struggle focusing, breakdown easily, frequent mood swings, etc.

263,"Hi everyone, 

This is my first time posting on Reddit and I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I just needed somewhere to vent and see other people's perspectives on this situation.

I was baptized as Greek Orthodox as a baby and ever since I was probably around 6, I've been questioning my faith and I definitely lean more towards the atheist side of agnostic. 

So, a couple of days ago my mother (who is also Greek Orthodox but not actually that religious) mentioned something about us going to her uncle's third year memorial this weekend and the whole thing is just so weird to me. 

A few of my concerns are: 

1. I never spoke to the man 

2. I went to his funeral, 40 days memorial and his 1 year memorial so I'm sure he and his family wouldn't mind if I don't come 

3. I absolutely hate going to church. I find that it's a very intimidating, judgemental and stressful place. I've had a few unpleasant experiences including when a random old man was elbowing me because I had my legs crossed (even though all the other old men there had their legs crossed) and people asking me why I wasn't wearing a cross at my own grandfather's funeral instead of, you know, giving their condolences. As a result of this, I only go to churches for weddings, christenings and funerals 

4. The 'memorial' is basically just a priest giving his usual service and then just briefly mentioning my mother's uncle's name at the end, along with others 

5. Afterwards, we have to go to my mother's aunt's house for lunch which isn't as bad but my mother is quite the chatterbox, leading to us getting home at 5:00pm. It's a waste of the day  

I expressed these concerns to my father (baptized Catholic, now atheist) and he agreed with a lot of them. I mentioned how going to the church gives me anxiety and he encouraged me to talk about it to my mother. 

It was on my mind for the whole week and it was starting to make me really nervous. All I could think of was the confronting feeling of judgement and uneasiness and how my pile of homework for uni would accumulate just because I wasted that one day sitting around a church and then a house (I forgot to mention that my mother is taking my Saturday away too due to a distant family friend's birthday party). 

Today, as I was unloading the dishwasher, I mentioned to my mother that I thought I was coming down with a cold (My mother, father and brother had all been sick over the past week). She responded with, ""well you know that you have to go to uni for the rest of the week"" and I said that I was planning on going anyway but that I was hoping to use my weekend for resting catching up on my homework. 

She then said that I had to go to the party and memorial instead and I asked her what the 3 year memorial was actually for. Like does that mean that I have to go to the 4th, 5th, 15th memorials?? And I politely expressed that it was unnecessary for my father, brother and myself to go due to the fact that we didn't really know the man and we had been to the other ceremonies for him. 

She went ballistic. 

She was calling me an idiot for not wanting to go. She said I was selfish for not wanting to support her aunt and her cousins (my mother and her cousins are in their 50s, I'm 18). And she kept talking over me as I was trying to explain myself and give reasons why I felt this way. 

As usual, she won. I have to go to the church this Sunday, despite how uncomfortable I am with it.  

And I wish to know how you redditors feel about this as I'm a bit confused.  

Disregarding the religious aspect of this, am I an entitled and awful person for not wanting to go to church for my mother's uncle's memorial, even though I've already been to 3 ceremonies for him?  

And do you have any advice on how to communicate with a parent who is not interested in hearing your point of view? 

Sorry for the long post, 
Thanks for reading :)",20Mar2019,1
264,"I'll try and keep this short.

I currently work at a mental health charity as an admin who also provides support sometimes although it is not the main part of my job it is/was a requirement.

I am good at my job, no one has any complaints about my work or the quality of it, but I am the only admin and the only staff member under 40 so end up doing anything and everything computer related for all other members of staff meaning that I am overworked.

I have been working there for 3 years my main issues with the job are as follows: (sorry I can't format well as I'm on mobile!)

1) when I started as the admin I was paid £7.79 an hour, the admin before me (I was admin assistant previously and ending up doing most of the work - she was not good at her job and it was a mess.) She was paid £9.90 an hour. I have asked about this and they tell me I'm not likely to ever make that much an hour. Even though I do more work than she did they don't have to pay me more so they don't. I'm currently paid £8.70 an hour.

2) I have said many times that I am overworked and the managers response 100% of the time is to tell me to refuse to do work my colleagues ask of me, right now all colleagues have been told not to ask me to do work for them and if they NEED me to do something they have to go through management. Few are adhering to this, even the managers. General consensus is that I often know what to do and will be quicker, for them obviously, it's not quicker for me to do other people's work. They are all paid more than me.

3) I have mental health problems and have had time off because of them. I have been told in roundabout terms that my mental health (even though it is long lasting and therefore a disability in this sense.) Is not a valid reason to have time off. I have said that the pressure at work compounds my mental health and as a solution they gave me another supervisor (we have two managers/CEOs - now I have one supervision with each a month) to talk about my mental health. If I say I am fine they use that as a reason to dismiss and claim I have of being unhappy in my work. If I say I am not okay they are very defensive and tell me to do less from my colleagues - it never works.

4) I used to be very good friends with one of the managers but due to work difficulties that friendship is strained and even though I see her at work most days, I am not sure we are friends at all. 

5) my dream job has always been to work with teens with mental health problems. I have been very vocal about that. The job has come up at work and they have been working hard to make sure another lady gets it (moving the start dates for her)

I feel so let down and I just want to leave. I'm so upset I can't sleep. I'm scared to leave because, like I said, I am not mentally well (basically I have OCD and some other stuff), I always try my best and I hate to let anyone down. 

There is another job I am interested in but it doesn't have enough hours that I could live on it and it's not like I'll get it with my mental health history.

I really want to to leave because it's become depressing for me to be there, I'm just scared of doing anything big becauae I'm quite fragile to those things. But I am good at my job and I know the sector well, I can do it, I just need to feel supported and not pressured and used.

I also have a mortgage to think about so I can't go on any benefits at all. 

So what do I do? Should I go for the other job and ask if I can reduce my hours where I am so I can earn enough? Do I tell them I want to leave? (I have told them many times before that their treatment of me makes me feel like they want me to leave and I can't stay here, to which they get very defensive and angry). Am I wrong and all my complaints are really nothing so I should just sick it up and stick it out?

TLDR: my job doesn't treat me how I would like to be treated, should I leave even though I might not be okay as the stress will effect my mental health?",20Mar2019,1

270,"I currently live in a dorm on my university campus. It's a suite style so it's 3 rooms (2 doubles and a single) tucked together in a small nook. We all share one bathroom. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if my neighbor didn't completely ruin the place with their horrible body odor. I've talked with my roommate and neighbor in the single about this. The first quarter we dealt with it. Wasn't too bad at first but as the year rolled into winter it became hotter inside which compounded the reek factor of the suite. Like hold your breath in before you go and unlock the door kind of reek factor.

Winter quarter rolls in and I decide instead of making a big deal out of it I'll make a sort of hygiene basket to indirectly let them know that they smell like ass. It's filled with all sorts of nice stuff. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap... altoids. You name it. I thought that would get the idea across without being a dick about it. Aaaand it didnt work. The suite still smells horrible and you can tell they've been through the area because of how badly it reeks. I convene with my neighbor and we get some air purifiers to sit in the suite and bathroom. You'd think that would really make it clear how we feel about the stench but that also hasn't worked. Plus the purifiers don't do much. I'm at a loss as to what to do.

I would talk with my neighbor but they are exceptionally strange. They don't acknowledge you when you try to say hi. They don't chat whatsoever. They sing loudly in the bathroom and in their room sometime after 12am (it's finals week and they did this the other night). They also talk in this nasally high pitched voice that sounds forced as hell if they talk at all. 

If they're any suggestions you can think of then please give me one. I'm not sure what to do. I don't know if their behavior/existence calls for me putting in some sort of complaint with the building RA or not.

tl/dr: neighbor reeks like liquid ass and I'm unable to talk to them directly about it.",20Mar2019,1

272,"So, backstory: I've been in terrible mindset and mental state for the last 7 months. Feeling lonely, worthless, not good enough, exhausted all the time, not functioning properly, can't sleep, selfharm and I'm very suicidal. I knew I needed help, and so I decided to give life one last chance and tell my mom. I couldn't talk to her about it, because I would start crying. She knew something was wrong because I would have terrible attacks in the morning and evening, where I'd cry, couldn't breathe and felt like I was dying. So I decided to write her a letter instead. I wrote everything in there, about my suicidal tendencies, selfharm and feelings. One week later I visited a therapist for the first time. My mom and dad apparently spoke together about my sessions and about me, I don't know what they were talking about though. What I know is that dad was heartbroken.

What I need advice for is how to explain, that I'm not cured even when I'm smiling and laughing. I've been trying to cry secretly, not in front of them, so they wouldn't worry so much. I've stopped saying my suicidal thoughts to them so they wouldn't sorry so much. I've been trying to smile and act happier so they wouldn't worry so much. And I don't think they fully understand that I'm still the same. That one session didn't cure me and that I'm still contemplating life. And thinking about suicide. I don't want to sound rude to them or over-act it, but I genuinely need them to know because I feel like they don't understand what's going on in my head. Every advice is very appreciated!",20Mar2019,1

274,"There's this person I have recently have become friends with. This friend has been very friendly towards me and has always approached me and been comfortable and candid with me, overall a great human being. After a couple of months later today I was told that she's a woman and that I completely mistook her gender.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the reason I mistook her gender, was because she always dressed in boyish clothes and never seen her wear feminine clothing, ever. Also she goes to the gym religiously does engineering (a men dominated field) and has a fairly butch body. She also has a masculine presence from the way she talks and the way she presents herself. Though I wasn't alone, a couple of my friends mistook her gender too, and we were all talking about it recently. Some of my friends made the mistake by laughing at one of my other friends when he correctly referred to her as a ""she"", some forgot her gender and some didn't know her true gender till that point. But the girl was very mature and didn't seemed to be phased by it at all, and truly enjoyed herself for the rest of the evening. At that point I didn't have a clue why those guys were laughing, until recently.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel terrible for mistaking her gender especially when people have teased me for being feminine and calling me a girl when I was young and still rarely till this day. I feel like I should apologise to her, and let her know how amazing she is, and how admirable it was the way she conducted herself. I personally find her to be gorgeous regardless of her gender, so I don't want her feel that she is not.

Should I apologise and let her know, or just ignore and move on?",20Mar2019,1
275,"Hey! I’m a university student [19F] studying Global Studies and Arts specialising in Global Politics and Human Rights alongside Anthropology ang Sociology. Obviously, with majors like you assume that I’m a pretty passionate person with a drive to create change. If that was your assumption, then you are 110% correct. I have spent the last five years of my life entering into highly competitive debate programs, slam poetry contests and volunteering with youth branch of the United Nations for a long time. I have done probably every political and social change gimmick that was available at my high school. 

So after getting into all of these things, when I entered my first year of university - the natural progression would go from participating to planning. So not just getting involved but dedicating a good amount of my time in organising types of events and starting my own. 

The only problem is, I suck at it. Despite all this experience ‘doing’, I can’t enjoy planning and I am terrible at implementing ideas. I spent all of last year in a youth volunteer role that I absolutely despised and tried to organise two of my own events - which both were massive failure. Besides my friends and my sister - five other people showed up. I’m super embarrassed to admit it because everyone expects me to be good at all the different aspects of these things but I’m not. I think I’ve gained all I can from participating and I suck at planning so I’m in a weird limbo.

Now that I’m starting my second year of university, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Sometimes, I wanna stop doing all of these things altogether and give up. Just be a regular university student with any extra load and quiet work away until graduation. But my friends and family keeps saying that I’m talented and that I have so much potential. And I don’t have the heart to tell them that I think that they’re wrong. 

These activities and hobbies have been apart of my life for so long, I don’t know what type of person I am without them. 

So what do you do when you suck at what you’re meant to be good at? ",20Mar2019,1

278,"First and foremost thank you for taking the time to read this post. I am a bit confused on my situation and not sure what to make of it. Hopefully someone can give me proper guidance.

Just some background. Grew up with a large family, played a lot of video games growing up (still do) and spend most of my time playing computer games or xbox or I’m at work. Here and there I’ll go to the club with my friends. When I was younger I also played basketball a lot, I went to college for 3 years, stopped attending because I never went to class. I found a great internship which turned full time. Back in high school I was great academically (straight A’s) regarded as a smart student. People liked me but I had few friends. Was raised to never talk to people when going to school just focus on grades and get out. I did just that as told, but I feel like I missed out on what was supposed to be a great part of my childhood.

I am a 25 year old male that is really struggling with life. On the outside, things look great. I have a great corporate job, my own place, car etc. But on the inside there’s a lot wrong - something I’ve been dealing with my whole life thinking things would get better, but I’m just learning how to cope. Let me get started.

Throughout my life, I always find my self randomly down at times. Every night when I go home I reflect on the day,  it’s disheartening at times. Whether it’s at work, or hanging with friends I have hard time fitting in. What’s even worse is that my job requires me to speak to people daily, so every night I am mentally preparing myself to talk infront of others daily.

My people skills suck and I get very nervous talking in groups, even to the point where my neck feels stiff and fidgets (hopefully people don’t notice), I talk extremely low people can barely hear me. I try to avoid talking to people in spaces with loud noise. Others seem to be able to speak freely and clearly, but no matter how hard I try I always have to repeat myself and stretch my voice to speak louder(which makes me even more nervous) and it just sounds unnatural. A lot of days I just stay home in my room watching YouTube videos, etc.

More on, going into work or any place with a lot of people my eyes begin to water up immediately and I don’t know why, maybe I am nervous being around lots of people, I always think people are looking at me even though I know they are not, I always feel like I’m being judged. It’s hard to hold eye contact, I always feel like I’m staring too long, it’s difficult articulating my thoughts, it’s even hard articulating the speech of others. I’d rather read someone’s message than to hear them say it because it is often times extremely difficult to comprehend. I talk to people and just go blank and don’t know how to keep a conversation, I always butt in with a sarcastic joke or prepare to ask next to hide the fact that I simply lack people skills.

One of the worst of all is eating in front of others. My hands constantly shake when eating at a dinner, at lunch, wherever. It doesn’t matter even if it’s one person. The only person they don’t shake around is girlfriends. With everyone else, my handles tremble noticingly which got me to the point where I only eat foods in which I’ll need to use my hands (burgees) and when I drink my drink I cannot hold it with one hand because my hands still shaking, so I’ll have to hold the cup with one hand while the other hand adjusts the straw to my mouth. It’s very annoying and the only way the shaking stops is if I have a drink or two before hand (which I really hate doing)

At times I feel like I have no emotion. I lack empathy someone could tell a sob story to the group and people could empathize and show compassion but I just don’t have it in me. My girlfriend could cry and I could feel nothing, I’d have to try to force myself to seem concerned. I don’t know what it is. At times I talk so fast to people that my words get mumbled and I have to repeat what I say. 

I really feel so lost. I’m tired of feeling this way every night. I want to be able to experience true happiness, I want to be able to love, be able to speak with people naturally without getting nervous. I just want to live freely.

I am passing out on making new friends at my job, or even networking because whenever I’m approached I keep the convo sweet and short because deep down I know I can’t hold one.

It’s hard to tell people about problems like this. I feel like I’ll be judged. And if I do tell someone I think they’ll think I’m weird or incompetent. (Which makes me more anxious)

I do have a girlfriend and she’s aware of the handshaking thing and some of these items, but she doesn’t really understand the extent of the effect is has on me. I feel like I’m still finding myself, that I don’t know myself yet. I am always putting on a front, acting the way I think I should infront of others always thinking what someone says about me. I just really don’t know what to do.

Anyway any advice would be greatly appreciate. Sorry this message is all over the place. Just needed to get my thoughts out.

Thanks,

284,"Hey everyone, I (24M) have been job hunting, and a friend of mine said the place he was working at was hiring and that he could put in a recommendation for me. It was basically an office / administrative position, which didn't relate to the field I got a degree in, but I thought hey, a job is a job.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I submitted my CV and motivational letter, and then about three weeks later I was asked in for an interview. The interview went well, the workplace seemed nice enough, and the few people I met seemed really nice. There were a few red flags, one being her having me negotiate my salary as opposed to in person, but I did not think too much of that. I was offered the job, and she said she would write up a contract for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other day, I spoke with a friend about the job, and he told me the job starts at 7, which is an earlier start than basically every place I applied to, and he told me that as the office shut down at 16.00, you cannot work later. No option to come in at 8 and leave at 17. Where this becomes a problem mostly is the commute. I would have to take the 5.30 train to get there for 7.00 (due to there being no direct route and me having to switch trains at one point), meaning I would have to get up at 4.45. With leaving, I would have to take the 16.26 train so I won't get home until 18.00. 

&amp;#x200B;

From 4.45-18.00, in essence, I will be travelling to work and dealing with work. I need 8 hours of sleep, so this means having to start getting ready for bed at 21.30.

I am completely fine with spending more time job hunting, and my boyfriend is also saying I shouldn't take a job with those hours and find something better.

As I type this, I am listening to loud music and loud voices through my relatively thin wall that I sleep right next to. They have dorm parties in their room usually like 4 nights of the week. They recently started smoking weed in their room as well (it blows into my room so I get to smell it every time they do it.) There has genuinely been too much that has happened this year to explain since I have now been living with them for about 6 months with a month and a half to go. 

Basically all you have to know is that they are loud until 2am and smoke weed often. 

I know what a lot of people will think. “Hey r/thiccboy7 why don’t you just tell them to stop! Or “hey r/thiccboy7 why don’t you just report them!” First of all, I have told passive aggressively told them they need to stop that shit a couple times now but they are the type of crazy douche bags that genuinely don’t care if I tell them to stop.

I don’t want them to hate me and have things be awkward if I reported them.

If someone has a good idea as for how I can survive my last month and a half here without reporting them or just telling them the shut the hell up, please tell me.

295,"I'm having problems at this new school and it is having problems with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

&amp;#x200B;

Outside stimuli can be very intense for me. When I was younger, it was so bad that I could here someone breathing in another room, and I used to not be able to sleep because there was just so much noise coming from everywhere. If I went somewhere like a store, it can be so intense and certain sounds will be amplified and others will sound muffled. Lights and lots of color can put me off to, so much so that I'll avoid looking  and it can be so enveloping and can distort my vision to the point where I can't rely on sight because what I see is too much. I usually stay close to the person I am with until we go to a place that I can handle. I never really saw this as a problem, and over the years I've found ways to work around them. For instance, when me and friends would hang out we wouldn't go places during the day because the daytime traffic in stores and parks can be too much and it can be too bright for comfort. Nowadays I just ""shut down"", and don't bother taking in my surroundings, so I rely on the person I am with to guide me. I bump into things, miss things that are happening around, lose my sense of location (like where I am exactly isn't concrete, I don't know exactly where I am and lose direction and where I am going). I can't really do textures on most foods either, some days are better than others and I can't stand the way it feels crunching down and the  the sounds are unpleasant. This makes eating in front of people almost impossible because I can't just throw on some good old toons to block out the sounds of chewing, eating, and swallowing and it becomes a chore. This wasn't too much of a problem in my life because the people at my last school (and schools) had been very accommodating and considerate. Having preferences and boundaries was respected (there was an unspoken ""no touching rule"" because there were people there who were either victims of abuse and assault and/or couldn't handle touch/didn't like it), but now that I attend a different school in the same town, these ""quirks"" have now become full fledged problems.

My first day, someone gave me a hug (big no) and even forced it on me (people hug people from all angles here). The walls have too much color, and posters, and projects jutting out from it's walls it is a lot to take in. There is just so much happening. The school is way overcapacity and the halls are small, so people bump into me. I have been going there for some time, and I have been given the nickname ""robot"" because of my not-so-generic coping mechanisms. Someone called me a sociopath because they had ""trouble reading me"". I've had someone romanticize aspects of my personality and call me a tortured artist and ""broken"" and that she was the cure. It's been really difficult because I find myself having even more trouble staying grounded and understand what is happening. All the information overload and the depersonalization and dissociation have made it impossible to understand whats going on at any given time. I've been harassed by teachers for not being able to understand what they are saying. Even one made slight jabs at me for struggling to maintain eye contact, even after telling her that it might take me a moment because I was trying to get better at it and couldn't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically a school can't really change because one student can't handle the simple task of walking to class. I'm wondering if there was a way to get rid of these ""quirks"" altogether. I don't really know how to approach this. Even when I put myself into stressful situations for me, I continue to shut down and none of these efforts ever go anywhere. Or should I go to a trusted adult about this and see if they can help me work around these things? I can't really think of any way the school could change to make me feel more comfortable, and I don't know what I can do to make it easier to focus and get through the school day.",20Mar2019,2
296,"I’m a girl and i used to like another girl too, at first i treated her like a sister, purely a sister. So i opened up to her everything like best friends and i also opened to her that I’m a bisexual. After that as days pass by, she’s treating me wierd like she’s into me and she likes me, and it comes to a point that I’ve already fallen for her and i admit to her that i like her and she said that she likes me too. 

And after some days i feel like that is not right because she’s into a relationship with a girl too and its not right for me to pursue her though I really like her and I know she is to me too. We both decided to come back where we started, as sisters. And its so hard for me and all i do is to hide my feelings for her.

297,Hi everyone. I'm 14 and me and my best friend do some pretty stupid stuff together. We have prank called the local pizza place a few times now and sent pizza to a house across the road from us. However the last time we did it was last week and the pizza delivery guy saw us through the window then started knocking on my door. We where home alone at the time so we just didn't answer and hid. He eventually left. And now it's a week later and we got a letter in the mail saying that it has been tracked that there are prank calls coming from my house. I told my parents it wasn't me and they believe me for the most part. But does anyone know if they can do anything else about it??? I'm so worried. And I'm never doing it again that's for sure I've realised how stupid it was. But I want to know if the company or the police can/will do anything about it does anyone know??

The side job comment I understand, but while I don't have either kids or a sick relative it's just been nagging at me a little. I feel like it may be setting me up for ""this job is going to consume all of your time and you won't be able to do anything else.""

299,"I feel like I'm falling into a pit and don't have the energy to haul myself out.

Long story short, most of my friends moved four hours away to go to uni and I came to uni with a girl I thought wad my best friend but she hooked up with an old best friend of hers when we moved here who was obv a Borderline and did what she could to paint me in a bad light and split us apart but pretending she was on my side and trying to help. It worked and they cut me out and I was devastated. I was heartbroken and didn't know where to turn, I withdrew and avoided people for a while and by the time I came out it was too late to make friends at the over accomodation I moved to and was isolated and alone.


The next year I met a guy who seemed to be head over heels for me and I thought he was going to be a friend or boyfriend...


But he turned out to be bipolar I and cut me off completely after he stabilised. This crushed me and due to a mother who always demonised drinking and made me believe it was stupid, I further isolated myself and didn't meet anyone except my RM and neighbour. I went to one party but felt so alone because everyone already had their groups.


The next year I decided to move off campus and made the bad decision of a place I thought would be nice but turned out to be isolatory with only international students who don't speak much english and no TV or common area. 


I constantly go into superficial FWB relationships exchanging my body for some human interaction outside of classes. It makes me so sad I have to let myself be used in that way but I feel I have no choice if I don't want to be by myself the rest of the week. It feels so nice while it lasts and I pretend they actually like me for me. I do go out alone and usually join a group but it's not the same as having consistent friends.


I'm a bit shy but I generally get on with most people of both genders and through studying a good friend I have made in college, become more mainstream to appeal to most people. (I went to a tiny school and the only options were bitchy superficial girls and asshole guys, druggies and people that weren't that worldly or nerdy guys, I chose the latter).


Although I have made friends with a girl at college, she has her own friends and just wants to hang out with them. There is a big music festival coming up and I tried to hint for her to include me saying, ""I don't know if there's point in me buying tickets because I'll be alone"".


She didn't reply to that and just replied to my second message because she is in a clique group that she went to school with. Everyone I meet already seems to have friends and I just have to pretend all the time I have them to not look like a loser.


I have tried bumbleBFF and get on with a lot of people on there but it never progresses to actually meeting.
I'm so alone and I should be in the best years of my life having fun and partying with friends but instead I have no one and desperately want even one person to do that with.


I feel like every choice I have made in life has been the wrong one and I will never recover and have any friends. I don't want to sound melodramatic or pathetic but I had to get it out and I do feel a bit ashamed about it.



I think I'll try a share for the next half of semester then maybe try being on campus for a third time and make an effort to put myself out there and party to try to make friends.


What can I do?? Can I turn my life around for the better?

301,"Hey, so recently I’ve broken up with my girlfriend after being with her for 7 years as I found out she was cheating on me for a few months and acted like there was nothing wrong about it so we ended up going our separate ways.

A month later I started talking to this girl and from day one we hit it off just like that. Everything I talk to her about feels so comfortable and we get along so well as if it’s like almost perfect! 

Two weeks later, my emotions and feelings for her have risen to a whole new experience of emotions! I’ve never felt such strong emotions towards a girl before and it’s driving me crazy to the point of depression if I don’t even see her for a day or two.

Is it too early to say this is love I’m feeling or I’m caught up in all these emotions I’m losing track of everything? Some days I don’t even want to work because I can’t get her off my mind, she is all I think about and I don’t want to do anything but to see her!

I’m seriously losing my mind because of how much I am attracted to this girl and I don’t want to lose what I’ve got with her..",20Mar2019,14
302,"TL: DR 
I’m crushing on a girl that works at my gym. I know it’s unsubstantiated and I want to know what I can do to reduce these feelings

So, a little back story. There’s this local gym I go to quite regularly (4 times a week). I’m not jacked, but I go consistently just to try and build a little muscle as I currently am skinnyish. This gym was built recently (about 5 years ago) and over the years they’ve had a high turnover of staff. In the past two years I made a decision to start gymming regularly.

During this time a new girl started working there, let’s call her “M”. When M started working there she would do the regular newbie grunt work, like refilling sanitary wipes for machines and such, and rarely worked at the front desk/reception so I rarely spoke to her. I saw her a few times, we smiled at each when we made eye contact and went on about our business. She was cute, but I thought nothing of it (Note, I usually wear glasses at home but not at the gym. My eyesight isn’t bad, but the glasses kind of ‘sharpen’ my vision). 

Around this time I left for a trip abroad for about 2 months. I came back and , not to my surprise, many staff members that I had known had either left or been fired. But M hadn’t, it seemed she got promoted, good for her (must have shown some ambition, which is nice to know).  One day I went to the gym and was wearing my glasses and when I entered the reception desk, M was standing there. I hadn’t been in such a close proximity before and with my glasses it felt like I had the Sharingan (Naruto reference , low key weeb as well ). This was the first time I got an actual GOOD look at her. 
Now, this sounds hella cliché, but it’s actually how I felt. When we made eye contact, I realized that she had these eyes that were and emerald shade of green. She had walnut-brown hair and sun kissed skin (she’s white but looks like she uses a tanning bed). And that’s when something clicked and I felt the immediate attraction.
We exchanged pleasantries and cracked on. She was nice, obviously because that’s her job. But ever since then she’s kind of been lingering at the back of my mind and some days when I’m lost in my thoughts it wanders to her. 
She never really paid any attention beside pleasantries, which was expected, until she heard a conversation between a friend and I, which she happened to be a part of. I live in North America, but am an immigrant from a commonwealth country so I have a British accent (sort of). When she heard me speak, her interest piqued and she suddenly found me fascinating, M, my friend and I chatted for a little and then I left. 
Since then there hasn’t been a conversation of substance, but when I go to the gym I find myself distracted by her. 
I know nothing about her and nor she about me. But, in that second of eye contact, it may sounds cheesy, but I feel something “comforting”. Like if I’ve had a terrible day, nothing has gone right and I go to the gym and happen to see her, that one second of eye contact makes everything else disappear. I feel at ease and that her eyes and smile are one of my main motivations to keep going to the gym so I have a chance to see her.

I know that this means nothing because she’s supposed to be nice and that’s her job. I would never ask her out cause that’s highly inappropriate and obviously she’d say no. I dunno , if there is any advice I could ask for it would be what can I do to minimize these feelings?

304,"My family has a history of mental health and just dropping out of school in general. I became the first and only one of my moms kids to get a high school diploma and go to college almost immediately after finishing high school. I have body dysphoria and generalized anxiety disorder and just couldn’t be mentally into college so I failed TWO quarters and decided it was for the best of me to just drop out of the college I was currently at and just wait until I can attend the other college in my state. I haven’t told my grandma yet because she’s emotionally abusive and will just call me failure and kick me out. So I took it upon myself to TRY and get a full time job (this will be my first job if I get hired) and then finally tell her about my school situation, so she doesn’t belittle me and cause me to hate myself even more. I’m taking a break from school to see where my mind is at and to see if I should continue going to school. The furthest I got on the other school was just online orientation, and it’s in the other side of my state so I won’t be anywhere near my grandma and deal with her shit.

312,"Me and my ex-girlfriend got together in 2013, I was 14 at the time and she was 15. It was my first proper relationship and we were together for around 3 years. During that time though it wasn't very great. I cheated several times and she was extremely depressed. There was really no point of us being together but we just decided to continue it, which we knew was wrong but we just didn't do anything about it. During that time she became extremely close to my younger sister who is around 16 months younger than me.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though we broke up in 2016, I want to leave that part of my life behind me and not have to face it because I've grown up and matured a lot since then. I'm currently in a relationship that's been going on for 16 months and it's improvment on my previous one. There's no disloyalty whatsoever and we are happy together. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, my younger sister is still really good friends with my ex-girlfriend and sometimes brings her round to our house (me and my sister both still live with our parents at the moment). This makes me extremely uncomfortable and it makes my partner uncomfortable too and put's her off coming round and wanting to see my family. Just incase we get there and my ex-girlfriend is there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I brought this up with my mum and said I don't mind if she comes round as long as I'm not at home, I do not want to see her when I get home from work or at any other time in our house,  which she was okay with. She also mentioned this to my sister and she was okay with it too. But recently my sister has invited my ex round and my mum hasn't said anything to my sister to remind her how uncomfortable it makes me. She said it's okay because I'll be sat in my room all night, which isn't the point. I should not have to feel uncomfortable in my own home and feel like I can't leave my room all night. If I want to go downstairs to make food or get a drink I should be able feel like I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everytime I mention how her coming round makes me feel my mum says ""It's been 3 years since you've been together, get over it"". I've tried to explain that I don't want to see a big and horrible part of my past constantly but she doesn't understand where I'm coming from and I tell her I feel extremely unrespected in my own home and that it feels like my family care more about my ex than me and my current partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked every single day since i was 15 and always paid my mum to live at home, even when I wasn't making much money at all. I've not asked her for anything in that time and If I have I've made sure that I've repaid her every single penny. Where as my sister has been working for 3 years part time and hasn't payed anything to live at home. I know the house we live in is my parents but I feel like I should have some say, I never ask for anything and I let a lot of things slide but I won't let this slide because I hate it.

314,"To make a long story short, I am a hiring manager for my company. I have a potential applicant that didn't show up to their scheduled interview, but instead showed up 12 hours later saying that they thought that is when they were supposed to be there. I don't buy it seeing as I was personally there when the conversation was had, and the interview was set up around an appointment that the applicant had in a neighboring city. Fine. The applicant didn't show, and I went about the rest of my day. Since then, the applicant has called every day since then (a whopping two days), and told one of my associates that they would call me at a certain time, which they didn't. Typically, I would disregard this completely and put the application directly into the shredder as I am obligated to do what is best for my company and my staff. I just don't feel 100% about this.

I left things with her on a good note, saying maybe in a few months we could catch back up. We didn’t unfollow each other or anything.

Sister and I live about an hour and a half away from our parents. My sister and my mom talk every day and generally get along decently, with fights every once and a while. I'm very amicable and generally argue with nobody in my family.    
  
-------------------------------------------------------------  
  
My mom, I think, is a good person. She's thoughtful, generous, and caring. She (and my dad, of course) put me and my sister through college, helped us buy our first car, brought us on numerous vacations, and generally provided everything that would help my sister and I succeed. I'm forever grateful for this. I'm not great at expressing my appreciation and neither is my sister. But I do try and thank her for everything she does.  
  
That being said, my mom isn't perfect. She has a drinking problem IMO. Not to the extent that she's day drinking or anything, more that every single night, she drinks. And she's a sloppy drunk.  
  
Where I work, I can't access my phone during the day. However, I can access my email. My family (me, mom, dad, sister+BIL+kids) is going on vacation in a few months. My sister+BIL are paying for themselves, my mom offered to pay for me. I did not plan on this, but I do welcome it, and thanked her multiple times. Yesterday morning, my mom forwarded me some info concerning the trip (flight info and such.) I was at work, so I didn't really look at it. When I got home, I got a few texts later on saying something along the line of:  
  
&gt; Mom: Did you get my email?  
Me: About the trip? Yeah  
Mom: And not a single thank you? Jeez. Whatever.  
  
By the time I had got home, I had already forgotten about it. This was information she had already sent me before, and like I said, I had already thanked her for it before. That's not an excuse, I think, because saying ""thank you"" costs me nothing. And I should've said thank you. I replied something like this:  
  
&gt; Me: I didn't look at it too closely, and to be fair, I've thanked you time and time again for this. But I'm sorry, I was at work when I got the email, and by the time I got home, I had already kind of forgotten about it. But thank you.  
&gt; Her: Your sister and you are so ungrateful. Whatever.  
  
At this point I'm kind of irritated, but I figure maybe she had a rough day or something weird happened with my sister. I asked my sister:  
  
&gt; Me: (attached screenshot of my convo with my mom)  
Me: What'd you do to piss her off?  
Her: She's off the rails...I was home yesterday and used her iPad, logged in to a website and forgot to log out. She called me later on and was hysterical, asking how she can fixes it, how could you do this to me, you need to fix this now, etc etc. I couldn't deal with it then so I hung up. I texted her a screenshot showing her where to log out later on. But she called me back and called me a bitch, ungrateful, etc.   
Me: Wtf? What's wrong with her?  
  
After this, I basically texted my mom back and told her that I really do appreciate what she's doing, I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, etc. She accepted that and I felt that she and I were okay at that point. But she did start saying things about my sister. Saying that she's selfish and that my dad has always said she's selfish. Also that she's mean.   
  
I don't think she was being fair so I said something along the line of ""She may have been selfish at the moment, but I don't think she's a selfish person, and she really is a nice person. But even nice people can be mean sometimes.""  
  
At this point, my mom replies back saying that no, she's mean and selfish, she wouldn't help her with her iPad and she hung up on her. She starts saying that my sister needs to respect and help her parents.  
  
I come back saying that she was wrong to hang up on you, but sometimes people get frustrated. But she did come back and help you, she just needed to calm down for a minute, and she couldn't deal with everything at that moment.  
  
Then my mom starts to rage at me, saying that I always take my sisters side and that my mind is already made up. She says things like my dad, her, and my BIL are all starting to get fed up with my sister.  
  
I'm getting mad at this point. I said something like ""It's not fair to speak for BIL, you should let him speak for himself. You're being unreasonable, you have to realize that other people have feelings too, and that (sisters) intent wasn't to hurt your feelings, she was just upset at the time. Just like you were. You called her names, she said mean things to you, nobody is innocent here. Also, I really think you two need to try harder to get along. If you want to see (niece and nephew) you've got to go through (sister). Maybe you two need to go to a therapist.""  
  
This went on for a bit, me trying to tell her to look at the situation from my sisters POV, but it wasn't working. Eventually, I got fed up and said something like ""I don't really want to talk to you while you're being like this. It's toxic and I don't want this on my mind when I go to sleep. Please don't text me anymore.""  
  
Then she messages back saying that she's hopeless, she'll cut all contact in our lives, she's cancelling the vacation, she's not coming for easter, etc. I had to send a message back and say that she's not hopeless, stop beating yourself up, but at the same time, stop feeling sorry for yourself. I told her that she seeks validation for everything she does and I think she needs help to work on that, that she needs to love herself for who she is and not for what other people think of her.  
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
  
All of that happened yesterday, so I'm still trying to process it myself. I know I messed up and mishandeled the situation. But I got very frustrated. I'm sure she had been drinking during all of this. I think my mom is the type of person who needs affirmation for everything she does, and my sister and I (especially me, I think) are not great at that.  
  
So, reddit, all of that being said, did I mess up? What should I do?

[Backstory;
Everything pretty much started two years ago. I was never popular at school and never had any friends, usually only two people that talked to me (I never considered them my friends). Two years ago, I started getting bullied and it went on for those two years. The second year it got way more intense and physical. I was mentally drained and so tired of living. I was hated in my class, bullied, my relationship with my mom was not the best and I had no friends, no one to talk to. I attempted suicide. Three times. The last one almost being successful. My mom found out about the last one though, and yelled at me. 

Since then, I couldn't enjoy life the same way. No one really knew about my emotions and how I'm feeling, and what's truly going on in my head. I wasn't bullied anymore though, so that was at least something. Things started going downhill last year in September, when school started. Again, friendless, but this time something changed. I genuinely felt like I couldn't do it anymore. I started selfharming, because I felt like I had nothing under control except my selfharm. It felt good and it made me a bit relieved, but of course it was very stressful to hide, especially since I'm not old enough to live by myself. 

My classmates HATED me (and still do). And I truly mean it. All of them would do anything to make me feel like shit and except insults they didn't talk to me at all. I'd be called slut, stinky whore, bitch and many more. It was exhausting to be there six hours a day and be around those people. I didn't wanna live, still. It just never left my head. When they found out about my selfharm, they laughed. They were literally laughing and making jokes about it, even though half of them selfharm too. I don't get how they could joke about that.

No one had no idea, still. But I was getting more and more miserable, more and more unhappy. I needed help, but I couldn't just go to my parents and tell them. I was way too scared to do that, because I didn't want my mom to blame me like she did for everything. What seemed like solution to me was hinting. I started saying things like ""Ahh I wanna die"" or ""What would you do if I was dead?"" But she never got the hint.

In December, I ended up in hospital due to fainting. Before getting accepted to the hospital, dad and I had a small talk in doctor's waiting room where I told him that I don't have any friends and I feel terrible. He opened up too and it made me feel great to talk to someone. At the end of the week after being in hospital, it turned out to be because of stress. My mom still refused to believe that it was true, because it's easy for her to not give a shit whether someone likes her or not. That's just not me. 

And now we're here. Month ago, it started getting worse. I'd have attacks in the morning and evening, where I'd cry so hard and then I couldn't breathe. It was like my chest was being squeezed. Also I was just unhappy overall. My mom started giving me pills for anxiety because otherwise I wouldn't fall asleep at all, even though I was tired as hell. 

 I ended up writing my mom a letter about what's happening in my head. It took me a lot of courage, but I did. I wrote about how unhappy I am, I don't have any friends, I feel like no one understands me, that I selfharm and about how suicidal I am. She ended up talking to me about it and making me believe I'd get through it. I ended up going to a therapist week later where we kinda talked about why I'm there and stuff.

[And now I'm here. The problem and what I need advice for is that I don't really know what's up with me. I cry and I don't even know why, I have those weird attacks when I can't breathe, I'm very suicidal and sad all the time, I feel like something's going to mess up soon and I don't wanna go to school. I've been missing out so much, because I just can't go there. I don't wanna get out of bed at all, nor go to school. I always look for a reason to not go (to convince my mom to let me stay at home) and even if she refused to let me stay, I'd stay behind her back. I had another one of those attacks 30 minutes ago and I almost slit my fucking wrist. The thing is, my appointment with therapist is in a month. MONTH. I don't think I can hold on for that long. I don't think I can live for that long. 

Also, the therapist told my mom she'd recommend visiting a psychiatrist for my sleeping problem, but my mom always refuses. I feel like it'd help me a lot, but my mom says that I would get addicted to those pills they'd give me. I don't know what to do. 

I'm not saying I'm depressed or that I have anxiety, I hate self diagnosing. I'm trying to figure out if it's possible for me to have some mental illness? And what do I do to keep going?",20Mar2019,1
331,"tldr at bottom

I'd appreciate any advice you guys have. I'd like to be in a relationship, but I feel that right now, I just don't have time. It's not the day-to-day that's the issue, but rather the fact that in the last year, I haven't been in one place for more than a few months. I'm in university in Michigan, got a summer job in 2018 in Philadelphia between June and September, since September I've been studying abroad, and I'm going back to Philly between June and September 2019.  I'm absolutely thrilled to have these opportunities, and I've gotten the chance to meet a lot of new people. At the same time, I'd like to care for someone and have them care for me, maybe even start building a life together with whoever that is. However, I feel like moving around so much has kept me from really being able to make that sort of commitment. Much of me doesn't want to start anything until I'm back on stable footing (where I'm not moving around as much), but that might not be until summer 2020, while the rest of me wants to be in a relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

To complicate things a bit, I fell in love with a girl here who's also from the US and on my study abroad program, but she's in a deep, committed relationship and has been for 4 years. I don't want to separate from her too much, because she's also one of my closest friends and I really value and like our friendship. Of my 7 closest friends (including her), 5 are in relationships of some sort. I don't want to be in a relationship for the sake of saying I'm in one or just so I can mark up a tally against my friends. I feel genuinely happy for them and the happiness they've found, but there's also a small pang of sadness and loneliness that hits me. I also find myself thinking about how I might operate in a relationship, not just focusing on the idea of being in one for the sake of it, but actually what it might feel like, and the kinds of commitments and compromises that often entails, and I feel not only ready but excited at the idea of a new relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you have any advice, I'm looking to see how I can get over these strong desires of wanting to be in a relationship at least until I find someone I'm genuinely interested in (and hopefully isn't taken) or until I reach a more stable point in my life where I'm not moving around as much. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; I really feel I am ready to be in a relationship and would like to be in one, but I've been moving around quite a bit in the past year and will continue to until at least the end of 2019. I developed feelings for a girl already in a relationship, and a lot of my friends are in relationships. How can I get over the desire to be in a relationship until I'm in a more (geographically) stable point in my life?",20Mar2019,1
332,"I’m just going to copy and paste a message I just sent a friend about another friend. 

Backstory: about 3-4 months ago I was in a group call with 2 friends last say A and B. A is depressed and while talking to him we got him too open up to us. Now I’m currently going through therapy to help with my depression and I decided I might as well since he opened up try to talk him into seeing one as well. So we had a talk his depression started about 2 years ago and mine started over a decade ago. The issue I saw was that he was just like me in the beginning and that was not something nice to see. So I mentioned my reason to him, told him how long o tried to deal with it and said how I regret waiting this long to see a professional. We spoke from 8:00pm to 4:00am and ended the conversation with something along the lines of (it’s been a while since the time so I can’t remember exactly what it was) “you’ve got someone who’s had depression for a decade and someone who’s got a history of depression in their family. Besides a therapist there are no better people you can talk to if you need help. If you want support of a friend who knows how to support people talk to B and if you want to know what it’s like trying to last a really long time with depression or you want to talk about if it gets worse or better or just another talk about it or even just sharing experiences again you can talk to me.” (I’m not really emotionally developed so I’m not too good at support and I know this so that’s why I said talk to B) after a week I asked him if he spoke to a professional yet and he said no. Knowing I shouldn’t push it I left it at that. After another month I asked him again and he again said he hasn’t. I haven’t really brought it up since (don’t want to push too hard). However I recently spoke to my colleges mental health specialist in a meeting and he came up in the conversation (he lives in another county so my college can’t help him) and she said to try to talk him into seeking help again and gave me some resources and sites to help him. 

Here’s the text I sent to B :


You remember how a couple months ago we had that serious talk with A. I had a meeting with my colleges mental health specialist and it came up. I was given some sites and resources for him and was recommended to have another talk and to try and get him to see a pro again. I’m wondering if:
A) it is a good idea to bring it up now? (As In is it too soon to have another talk about it or has it been enough time)

B) you’d join the call? (Because you were there last time and I feel you would be able to either stop it from becoming too heavy or if you’d be able to give advice yourself)

C) if I’d be pressuring him too much in your opinion if we did have the second conversation about it and me and you trying to talk him into seeking help?(like would it push him away from seeking it)


Side note: if you think it’s fine to all of them and I don’t start the call it is because my internet is currently down. It shouldn’t be but just in case I thought I should mention it. 



Sorry this is so long but I’m unsure if it’s the right thing to do as I don’t want to push him away from seeing a professional as I made that mistake and it would hurt to see a friend do the same.

335,"So, recently I have been going through my parents getting a divorce. My mom is never around, and my dad has already moved on. Things are weird and I don't really know how to handle it some days. I've also recently started a new relationship. Odd timing, I know.

I feel like I just don't get the support or anything from my friends; that friends would normally do.

I'm always there for them no matter what. Countless times I've provided my shoulder and rides to anywhere they pleased. But when I need a shoulder or advice they shrug it off and change the subject or just tell me I'll figure it out ""like I always do"".

For instance, about 2 weeks ago before I started dating my boyfriend, I was really ""giddy"" about cuddling with him and watching a movie. I was telling my friends this and they literally changed the subject when I finished telling the story. I've been single for 3 years and this new guy has me all sorts of excited, so of course I want to tell my friends about him.

I told my work friends the same story they were all sorts of excited and happy for me, they literally jumped up and down and squealed. The difference being, my work friends that I've known for 4 months seem more excited for me than the fiends I've known for 2+ years.

When my friends invite me out, it's always to the bar; or nothing at all. If I tell them I don't want to go out, they get upset and think I'm ditching them. Clearly I'm not, since sometimes I just like to stay home and play games.

As a side note, when they ask me to come out it's not ""you should join us"" it's ""if you want to join"". There is a difference between the two statements, but maybe I'm over-analyzing that part.

I used to go out with them 6 days a week to the bar. I cut back considerably and go out maximum 2 times a week. I feel like they just don't bother inviting me out because I don't like going out every day. Whenever they invite me out to do anything, it has to do with the bar. I cut back because of my own health as well as my new boyfriends well being. He used to be just as bad as I am. So I cut back for him, as well as me.

Do I need to find more supportive friends? Just deal with it? Or am I just being dumb?

________________________________________________

TL;DR: My friends seem like they are upset because I don't like to drink as much as I used to. And they aren't supportive of me in my new relationship, or my home problems.

They literally shrug my issues off and change the subject. As well as my ""relationship progress"", which they always seem interested in, until I actually sit down and talk to them about it. Am I over-reacting or do I need to find new friends?",20Mar2019,1

340,"Okay so first and foremost, I want to go about writing this post respectfully - please correct me if anything I have said is disrespectful or out of line. My brother has high-functioning autism, so any knowledge I have has come from personal experience. I am not a medical professional, and any speculation regarding my housemates’ potential diagnoses has taken place out of love and in his best interest. 

So let’s call him Charlie (not his real name). I have lived with him for two years now and I have noticed he really really struggles socially. He’s never had any friends, and says that in the past the only friends he has had a result of him ‘latching on to friendship groups’. When we met in our first year of university, I often invited him to parties and nights out, which he often attended.  But over the past year I have not seen him leave the house for anything other than attending lectures. 

I asked him why he has not been attending any social events with myself or anyone else. He explained to me that he feels very out of place, and that his behaviours have caused other people to mock him and make fun of him (for example he will try and talk to girls and say things that are really inappropriate, or say things that make other people feel very uncomfortable) and he feels that people don’t value his company or want him around because he doesn’t understand how to behave in social situations. My other housemates often have very little patience with him, when we’re sharing communal areas he often screams and shouts and throws things, which just makes everyone feel very uneasy.

I have also noticed that he makes my other housemates (and admittedly, sometimes myself) feel very uncomfortable because he doesn’t really understand how to use physical touch/body language appropriately/naturally. Now this may not seem like a big thing but I genuinely believe that this plays a vital role in healthy, natural human interaction, and can make people feel very uncomfortable if it is not carried out appropriately. 

For example, he will often come very very close to you when talking to you (so close you can feel his breath on your face), but is always unable to make eye contact so will look past you when conversing. It’s extremely uncomfortable and not a lot of people have any patience with it. Multiple times he has snuck up behind me and breathed heavily in my ear before asking me something when I’m cooking, which confused me. 

Although there is more that contributes to my feeling he could be on the autistic spectrum that draw a lot of similarities to my brothers’ behaviour, if I listed them this post would be way too long.

The reason I write this post is because I’m not really sure how to confront the situation. If Charlie got a diagnosis or were to speak to his GP, I believe he would have access to a lot of support that would really help him. He has noticed people are uncomfortable around him and that he is struggling socially and emotionally, and this has resulted in him isolating himself and becoming very low. If he were to get some kind of diagnosis, or some clarity around what he’s struggling with, I believe that my other housemates and his peers would support him and be there for him, more so then they try to now. But obviously this is a very sensitive topic and it’s not something you can just tell someone you think they have. 

Do you think I am encroaching on his business too much and I should just leave it, or should I encourage him to get the support I think he needs?

344,"I'm just going to put it all out there. I met a guy and we got on insanely well. Like instant chemistry,  he can't keep his hands off me but we also get along so well straight away. Him saying he's never felt such a strong connection before. We would sleep over at each others houses and stay up all night just talking about things, and all the intimate things we did had such extreme passion. I was hesitant at first as I'm normally so freaked out by guys (I don't know why) liking me- it normally turns me off. But I felt the really strong connection too. For most of the time we were together, he would always say how he can't get over how beautiful I am and how unreal this felt- which I reciprocated. We messaged all day every day, and when we weren't messaging we were together. But he was set to move away a month after we met. I knew this, but I'd never felt any form of connection with a guy before and I guess I was blinded by that. We talked about how we wanted to stay in contact as friends after. I thought we could have this really special thing together for a month, something that was mutual. Here's some other things I was blind to- he had broken up with a long term girlfriend maybe 2 months before. I thought because he'd had a ONS in between me and her, and because he commented (only once or twice) that she wasn't good for him, that everything we had was real. I also had my first time wit him. I hate how naive I let myself be purely because a guy I liked was giving me attention and me not being scared of it. When we had our last time together, he stopped contacting me the way he did before. When I was first to contact, he'd respond differently, in a way that showed he obviously didn't want to talk. He'd take hours to respond- and when he did it would be in ways that end the conversation. I started feeling like none of it was real or I was some form of rebound that made him falsely believe he really liked me. I hate myself for this part but I messaged him expressing that I felt it was a bit strange that he stopped caring so suddenly, in a nice way too, and he effectively said he didn't miss me. There was a conversation after that where I asked if any of it was real and he said yes and to stop asking because I'm annoying him. That kind of broke me out of all my naivety. I know now he never meant he wanted to be friends after. I know that i was some form of rebound. And I hate myself so much for allowing this to be my first experience of intimacy. We only lasted a month but I get this emptiness to my core about the whole thing now multiple months later. Like just so much pain. It has driven me to work on myself, sure, but every time I start to feel like I'm doing okay, I feel that emptiness that I can never undo and just cry. I feel unloveable. I would've been fine if he missed me and eventually we'd both get over it, so I know we had this special thing- that's what I thought would come out of the experience. But obviously that didn't happen and him not missing me immediately after our last time together honestly kills me. I want this sadness to go away. I want to feel loveable. But for the final nail I noticed on social media he's got photos of him and his ex back up (they previously weren't on his profile). I don't know if they're back together but that hurts me so bad- like I was just a distraction from who he really wanted. I deleted him on social media after that but kept him on Facebook in the off case he does try to contact me at some point just to check in.  


I sometimes can't tell whether this is really what happened or if he did care. I don't know if its in my head or not. But I think I did get used and that will always be how my first time went. If he did care he wouldn't have said so quickly that he didn't miss me. At the same time, maybe I just started being too clingy with my messages. I don't know.  I need advice on how to stop feeling this pain. I will never let myself get this close to anyone again yet simultaneously I feel like no one will ever want to get close to me because I'm not loveable enough to have a long term relationship- I'm only enough to be used as a distraction for a month.",20Mar2019,1

346,"So my parents have been constantly complaining about how I’m too addicted to electronics, my phone and computer, and they’ve even gone as far as saying “you need to see a therapist,” and, “it’s like you’re not my son anymore. All you do is live in this house but I don’t see you.” 

I do admit to being addicted, and I do play a lot, but not nearly as much as other people. I usually play an average of 2-3 hours a day, I play a lot (5-6 hours) on Saturday, and then I don’t play anything on Sunday. 

My “addiction” is not nearly as big as my parents seem to portray it. They’ve been constantly angry at me.

I try to spend even less time, but I’m having trouble doing that too because video games are my venting. It’s a relaxing, escape from life that helps me forget about my problems and issues and play in a friendly environment with friends, and If I’m not doing that then I sometimes get angry and frustrated, and stressed.

347,"Over the past few months with this one being the worst has been a steady decline in my mental and physical health. I spend almost every day especially since my leave started laying down or sitting all day and night on and off sleeping, I'm always tired, I've stopped taking care of myself as far as hygiene goes, can't do the things I enjoy anymore and get such severe panic attacks and most of the time with no cause that make me feel like I'm dying.

I have a boyfriend that I live with and we're barely making ends meet especially with me out of work and us having to move at the end of the month. I'm being treated for auditory and visual hallucinations I've had my whole life along with manic depression, severe anxiety, ADHD and many other things. They never seem to take me seriously to the point where I've started to break down crying and get more depressed with each visit. 

When I do return to work it's a toxic environment that I can't afford to quit where both supervisors and coworkers make fun of me to one another in front of me or to other customers and get told to get my life together and all kinds of other horrible things. They'll make me serve customers while my face is stained with tears and making me cry more from embarrassment and at this point just the lack of energy for anything. 

My whole body is always sore, I'm always tired, not eating as much, no interest in even the smallest things that used to bring me relief such as baths, music, art, etc. I'm always trapped in this horrible state of sadness, fear, pain, desperation and guilt because I feel horrible that I'm not getting or feeling better when I have no work or income to help my boyfriend and he is the most loving caring guy in the world, I love him with all my being and yet I can't get out of this ocean of sadness that just keeps pulling me deeper and deeper in. I feel like a horrible girlfriend and person in general for not being able to provide or get the help I clearly need. 

My doctor laughs while speaking to me and doesn't take me seriously and only ever tells me to go to the hospital and tries to tell me to go there for help where they'll just strip me of anything that could be remotely dangerous and pump me full of drugs which I don't want. I've made it clear I know that's what happens and where he's trying to send me and that I want actual help in getting better and back on my feet. My psychiatrist doesn't listen to me, we met once so far and he always talked over me, would laugh or smile at things that aren't a joke, came to his own conclusions and had me out the door. He's on vacation now and I can't see him for over a month. 

I made another emergency appointment today for 11:15 AM and I'm hoping this community that has always been a safe haven for me can help me with a step by step plan or opinions on what I can say or do so I can get my life together again. ",20Mar2019,3
348,"This seems obvious but my friend disagrees so idk.

I've been through two relationships, both lasting a few months, and still I'm a virgin. I didn't date them for that reason, I never wanted to pressure them into anything, but at this point I just want to lose it and be done with it tbh. 

I get that it's probably better to lose it to someone I trust, but both break ups tore me up pretty badly. Honestly I'm afraid if I do wait until the next relationship it'll eventually crumble and I'll be in a bigger pit of depression because 'she was the first one'. 

and apart from that I'm just sick of trying. I don't want to try anymore, I just want to wait for a real relationship to come. I don't want to match with some girl on Tinder again, try to force it to work because the 'not single good. single bad.' mindset I have.  ",20Mar2019,2

351,"TDLR got a small cash gift for a birthday but expected more.  I think the money was stolen but I don't know how to ask without seeming ungrateful

This actually happened 14 years ago when I was serving on a 6 month deployment in Afghanistan. It was my first deployment and I was turning 21 while I was overseas. My mom was sending me packages with lots of thoughtful mom stuff like some snacks from Canada, KD, etc.... I was really appreciative of all of this. She also sent me a birthday card that arrived just before my mid tour vacation, where I was going to travel through Europe with my partner for a couple weeks. My quandary is that the birthday card had some Euro in it, to help with my vacation. It was a thoughtful gift, and I appreciated getting anything at all but it was only 20€  which was out of character to be gifted such a small amount. I know I sound like an overprivileged little piss ant for saying it's a small amount, but most cash gifts I received growing up were substantially more, like in the tune of hundreds of dollars (and future gifts were also much more) so I kind of figured someone, somewhere along the line in the Canada to Afghanistan mail route got sticky fingers and stole cash from my card. I never brought this up to my mother because if I'm wrong I'm just an ungrateful asshole, but if I'm correct I think it would really dishearten my mom to learn that happened. I still remember calling her to thank her for the gift, but being very cautious not to be specific about how much money there was. Any ideas on how to approach this? I also realize that 14 years has passed and maybe this can just be a funny anecdote. ",20Mar2019,1
352,"   A bit about me so that you have some semblance of an idea of why. I grew up in a really abusive household, all of my dreams crushed alongside my hope, aspirations, and body. I was beat severely and treated like shit by everyone in my family. There was a period of time, about a year, where everyone in my family was telling me to kill myself because no one would ever want a child like me; I was a monster. I retreated into myself and locked the negativity away, letting it fester. All I had done growing up was to try to protect my family: protect my mom from my dad's fist, protect my brother from the harsh reality of my family. They all turned against me. It got so that my grades were some of the highest in school, but my mother and brother were openly talking about how smart he was (failing in school) and how I would never get anywhere in life. I'd be lucky to get a decent job, lucky to get into school, lucky to even find friends. My dad moved out and started drinking more heavily, resulting in me going to visit him to make sure he wasn't dead. After he beat me to the point I nearly broke my neck, I stopped going. I told my mom and brother about the attack and they yelled at me because I should never had gone over there in the first place. 

   I graduated high school, a vo tech near my house, with a NOCTI degree and 3 years of painting restoration under my belt. I got into Yale, MECA, SCAD, and two others with some of their top scholarships short of a full ride. My brother applied to one school, Neumont, got in, and used the FAFSA to take all the financial aid. I got nothing; I could no longer attend school without taking a few massive loans, which I would never be able to afford. For two years since, I have been yelled at on a near daily basis for failing to go to school and for being annoying. I tell my mother and brother that I love them 'too often'.  I've been told that my dream jobs will get me nowhere, that as a restoration artist I'll die, homeless and alone on the street. My self confidence is shattered. I nearly got a book published and when I showed my mom the papers she laughed in my face ebcause she thought I was lying. I cnacelled the contract after that. On top of that, anything I feel is instantly invalidated. Any time I have attempted to deal with my past, the two rapes (which no one believed), the four molestations, the years of physical, mental, and emotional abuse, I've been told I'm just a hormonal teenager who doesn't know anything. That has been one of the biggest themes of my life: That I'm just an ignorant kid who needs to keep her mouth shut and do her job. By the way, I have severe heart and breathing problems and do heavy physical labour, and stick it out through pretty much everything. This determination to do my job well means nothing to anyone. I did a really fantastic job one day after passing out for a few minutes and I reported how awesome the job had been done, and was told that I shouldn't need a pat on the back for just doing my job. I never ask for validation unless I really feel like I've earned it. I got offered another job that would pay nearly 5$ more and was yelled at for considering leaving. ""People aren't going to appreciate that you jump from one job to another so willy nilly."" I've had this job for 6 months. Lots of jumping, I suppose?

   I've spent my whole life being told that I'm nothing and that I need to die. I feel like dying half the time and I still have no outlet to make anything better. So, what I want to do, is to move away and try a new life. I want to move to Europe, England or something, and try the jobs I wanted when I was younger. I always wanted to be a writer, actor, artist, and singer, but had always been told that I had no skill so there was no use in trying. I can't do this anymore. How do I move away from all of this and start anew? Is it even possible for someone like me, a 20F, with just under 2k in savings, to change her life like that? Will I die here, shunned and shattered? Is escape even possible? What do?",20Mar2019,1
353," 

I'm not sure exactly as to how to word this, but I will try and give as much context as I can so that readers can understand.

For the last 2 years or so, only a few things have evoked strong emotion in me. Not a lot of variance in this emotion: it always ends in tears swelling up in my eyes immediately following the thought entering my mind. Before that, I did not cry very often and when I did, it usually was the result of overwhelming anger/outburst. Sounds like suppressed emotion to me - since I've realized this could be the inevitable overflow of lots of pent up emotion, I decided to start letting myself fully feel things as they come. However, this has led me to feeling like I am wandering in circles trying to chase the root of emotions but never fully catching them.

Here's what is bringing me so much confusion: any time I think of my dad I start crying. Even as I typed that sentence tears began to flow. I do not have a poor relationship with him or have a history of abuse/neglect. We get along pretty well and I truly love him, so I am super confused as to why I get overcome with tears when I think of him. Tears still flowing. Confusion continues as I think about my lack of strong emotion towards most things, so why does this in particular cause something so strong? Why do I not feel so strongly towards other things?

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this type of thing and I apologize in advance if it isn't.

My mother passed away when I was 8 and it really took a toll on our family. I've always looked up to my brother who is like a superhero to me. I've followed all his hobbies and tastes hell even his career. When I was 19 I moved to another country to live with my brother for better work opportunities and just to experience something new. I always try to impress my brother because all I ever want is for him to be proud of me. 9 months later I had to move back home which he wasn't happy about but I had no choice. (note I have an amazing relationship with my father there is no family issues.) When I was ready to move back I decided it would be cool to surprise him, turn up on his doorstep showing him that I could be adult. I ended up staying with his inlaws, who I would regard my second family, without notice. Que a 2am phone call of him screaming at me telling me I disrespect that family name, and that this is his life hes built for himself etc. He has a beautiful son and daughter who i am the uncle of, with his wife.

One night my brother has the opening of his new bar hes built. I decide to bring along 55 year old as she really was a mother figure in my life at that point. After the opening is all said and done he decides to ask me if him and his friends can come back to keep drinking to which I said yes. I couldn't believe it, I was so happy that my brother actually wanted to hang out with me. The next weekend the same thing happens. Even more excited I call my dad and tell him how great it is that we're hanging out and hes so happy. That was until I decided to stay home on a saturday night instead of going out. 55 year old openly told me right there and then with a smile and a laugh that my brother was coming over. I knew exactly what it meant and I felt physically ill. I told her to leave my family alone and she responded with ""we're adults just stay out of and don't think about it"". All I wanted to do was tell someone but I couldn't.(my brother still to this day doesnt know I know) My 2 best friends are my sister-in-laws brother. I haven't been going to family events because I haven't been able to look him in the eye. Then the next day I get texts asking why I couldnt be bothered showing up.

358,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this as I don't necessarily want to take legal action, but would like to know what I could/should do.  I live in an apartment complex on the second floor with my girlfriend.  My neighbor below me and across the hall has 3-4 Chihuahuas.  Thankfully, I haven't heard any yapping or anything like that throughout the day.  What does bother me, however, is that when she lets her dogs out, she literally just lets her dogs out.  She opens the door, and a brigade of tiny animals go running out to do their business.  I am fairly positive that it is illegal to have your dog in a public place (outside of a dog park) without a leash in Charleston, SC.  Regardless, it is definitely a rule at my apartment complex.  Also, she is for certain not picking up after them, as she just yells at them from the door to come back (this can go on for a bit, sometimes).  That is also definitely a rule at my apartment complex.  To make things worse, we have a shelter dog.  I make sure he is always on a leash, as he can be pretty aggressive around other dogs, and sometimes will get too excited to see another person.  He doesn't snarl or anything like that, but will bark/pull on his leash.  Just the other day I was walking him back inside, and we were swarmed by this lady's Chihuahuas.  Thankfully, our dog handled the situation surprisingly well, but the Chihuahuas were surrounding him and yapping, and I could tell he was uncomfortable.  As I walked up the stairs, I said ""I'd really appreciate it if you put your dogs on leashes"" in a somewhat loud voice, as their owner was nowhere to be seen.  If anything happens with our dogs, I'm pretty sure  I will be ""fine"" legally, because our dog is on a leash and hers isn't.

364,"Let's call her Em. You can probably skip all of the context, but I included it anyway.

**What happened (you can skip this if you need to):**

Em and I were friends and roommates the first half of freshman year of college, neither of us knew anyone when we first came to university.  I introduced her to her best friends, we all hung out all the time. Then Em and I proved to be too different of people to live together, her passive aggressive behavior and my weird dark jokes that she interpreted as serious led to me having to move out mid-year. She got to keep our double room to herself the rest of the year.

We continued to stay friends for the sake of our mutual friends, but tensions were high. I had a bad breakup and suffered from depression the following semester. Started to retreat from my friends because I was sad all of the time and didn't want to be a burden on them. Confided that I felt kind of invisible when we all hung out, received an aggressive message from Em speaking for the entire friend group how if I wanted to maintain their friendship I needed to reach out more and being lonely was my choice and blah blah blah. This was a hard blow because I already felt sad and worthless, and what I really needed was a friend to be kind to me in that moment. 

Never really talked after that. Stayed in touch with one mutual friend and basically had to make all new friends from scratch while continuing to battle depression and an eating disorder. Things didn't end on great terms.

&amp;#x200B;

**What's going on now:**

Em recently friended me on facebook and sent me a message yesterday. She has been living like a half hour from me since November and wants to reconnect.  She said ""I know we didn't end on great terms and I'm sorry. I hope you're doing well""

I suspect that part of the reason she waited 4 months to reach out is because she recently left her job to be a stay at home mom, doesn't know many people in the area and is lonely. I'm not still mad about what happened. We were 19 and it was a long time ago, but when she messaged me I realized that thinking about her and what happened and my college years in general still makes me feel sad and anxious. College was a confusing, sad and often lonely time for me, and I really am not interested in rehashing it with someone who contributed to that pain in any way. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my question is, am I being immature here? Should I message her back? I feel like not messaging her back makes me look bitter and childish, when in actuality I just don't know if I want to talk about all that stuff again or invite someone into my life that proved to be incompatible as a friend.

366,"I’m 26 and I’ve been jumping from customer service jobs and I’ve realized that I cannot do this forever. It’s incredibly debilitating - dealing with rude people over the phone, not getting enough money. I’m tired of being hourly and I’m tired of being taken advantage of not only the customers, but also with management. I don’t want to be disposable, I want to feel valued and I want to feel proud of myself. Also - I hate doing customer service, I mean who really wants to deal with rude people everyday?


I’ve tried coding before but I just can’t focus. 90% of the time it’s due to work - I feel drained mentally and physically everyday and not having the motivation to even pick up my instrument and play anymore. I’ve tried coursera for Python and successfully finished that course - and it was a lot of fun. I’ve also tried freecodecamp twice... but also failed twice.  Not because I didn’t do well, but because I couldn’t stay focused and finish. 


The first time in freecodecamp - after the HTML/CSS section I bullshitted the whole way to hopefully get the tech degree - but I didn’t finish because I didn’t want a degree where I just cheated. I tried it again a year later for literally 2 weeks and I stopped. 


It’s not that I’m not interested in programming because I know I am. While I do the course, it’s incredibly fun solving a problem - trying to figure out the solution and getting frustrated for 2 hours and the relief I get when I finally know the answer - usually because I forget to put (“”) and (;). 


I want to desperately learn . But I think I need someone to coach and guide me. I’ve tried to freelance on my own and it’s not working, but that itch to do programming is still there - I just need another solution. I still don’t know how to use Github, I wanna learn JavaScript, more Python, and any other language. I’m not sure what field I want to end up in - so far web development or front end development is the way to go as far as my interests go. I recently started to play my instrument again and I’m trying to mesh both music into technology. 


I’ve reached out to different boot camps but they cost a leg and an arm... I just don’t have the funds to put a leg for a down payment and another leg for after graduation. I fear that I won’t make it and would have to pay that much for the rest of my life. I’ve seen some online courses like coursera again - it’s a great site but I didn’t know what to do after finishing Python. I’ve seen Colt Steele, but there’s mixed reviews about it and I don’t know what to do after. I’ve browsed teamtreehouse where it’s $25/month but what do I do next?


I think regardless I would have to put in some money to get an education for this degree. I know it’s not easy and it’s very challenging. But I want to try or else I’ll be on phones with angry customers, earning $15/hr for the rest of my life. I just want to be successful where I can finally buy the oat milk I wanted and not worry it’ll put a hole in my wallet, a job I’m happy about for once and actually love what I’m doing, where I can’t wait to get to work and feel content, feeling valued, getting perks from the office, not dealing with people, resolve issues and solutions....

367,"This has been happening for 6 or so years. It's caused social exclusion and panic attacks, I want to get over myself. I've had enough. 

Every time I smell it being smoked on the street, in the metro (yes this homeless boy sometimes smokes it on the Paris metro after I get off of work), in parties.. anywhere, I get a panic attack. My body gets hot, hands tingle, thoughts race, heart races.. I want it to stop.

373,"Hello, I'm a uni student right now and I need some advice on career planning.
I am a junior with a double major in Accounting and Finance. Currently, I am taking a course in Investment Theory and I have so much trouble with the mathematics in the course. Honestly, I don't think I'll pass the midterm as I can hardly complete the assignments.

The course is not required (it's a high level course). This course  so far is not only affecting my emotions but also affecting my focus on my other classes and activities. 
However, I'm also worried about dropping a course might harm my chances in getting a job. I know a lot of people that only take classes they are confident in and get all A's. I study very hard and try to take all kinds of classes that require effort, but now I'm getting confused if I made the right decision

374,"Some background story if that is needed to provide some context; I have been in the online advertising industry for around 5 years by now. It is something that I happened to ventured into as my first job when I chanced upon an opportunity to work at an MNC  on a one year contract. As a Public Relations graduate who has a better edge on the linguistics over the analytical end, it initially sounded like a good path to start off with as the job was ad copy related and it looks like something that I can work on the copywriting side. It turns out that it was just a job that only existed because no automation process could take place at that point of time to categorise online ads. From there, I have gotten the opportunity to extend my time in the company and by the end of my 3 years tenure with the company, I have gained some knowledge on programmatic advertising and experience managing accounts within that space. There has been a lot of areas where it has been stressful when it comes to client management or doing anything remotely analytical but I have somehow managed to fake it for so long. Hence i stayed on but the fear of being discovered that ""i'm just winging it"" has always been dancing along side and I have lost count at the amount of times that I found myself crying in the toilet because I fucked up. One day I managed to get a different opportunity to shift to a smaller company but with greater prospects to grow myself so even with the heavy feelings that I would still suck at my job, I took it on once I have managed to pass the interview processes thinking that a change of environment would help to refresh my motivation (was working with a very smart colleague who always had opinions on how he would grade someone at their job so even when i had a boss that i look up, my daily work has been dampened by a very intense feeling that I'm probably talked about behind my back). This feeling has turned into a daily mantra that I tell myself in the mirror that ""I suck so it doesn't matter"" so I do wake up feeling worthless about myself every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present, I'm in midst of working in an analytical role into my 3 year in a different company at the age of 31. Within this company, I have been the only go-to person for a regional office so in some way I have been hired with the expectations that I could bring some new perspectives and hopefully growth to an emerging market. However based on the assessments that I have had with my employers, it looks like I would barely exceed the required expectations at best with some level of hit and misses. I tend to have issues making simple errors and following up with my work on timely basis; not exactly the kind of thing that you would expect someone from an analytical role to be like. At work, our company utilizes a reward system to ensure that any great work done to be acknowledged and let's just say that it would be very obvious to know whether someone has been making great contributions at work with such system in place and it has been very clear that I made very little impact with my work. As an introvert who also has sever self-doubt issue, it has been difficult for me to even strike any meaningful conversations to different stakeholders within the company or even make it known that I have full ownership on any kind of process. There were many times during the tenure where I would tell myself that I need to quit once we have gotten a much better candidate who could be the rightful head figure for the region. After several months of finding the right talent, we managed to secure the right person. I felt extremely thankful that this person gets hired because I definitely do feel that my company deserve to have such talented person to make things right and training this person (Anon) was a breeze as Anon is a fast learner with vast amount of knowledge and experience on the business. Even though I was supposed to the senior in this situation, I have made it very clear that I would like Anon to take full ownership on ""leading the pack"" as I feel that this person would make it work as a leader. It was a good feeling to see that our business improved within 6 months as Anon made a lot of good contributions to fix issues and being a witty person, Anon has no issue making decisions and lead the right conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the business is steering into the right direction, I can see that I'm also being set aside as the one that follows since I pretty much got into the mindset that ""hey we have this talented person in place now so I'm no longer in the need to force myself to lead"" and most stakeholders now reach out to her directly to get things done. The downside to this is that I start to tell myself that I don't matter and I would leave it up to Anon as ""Anon can get things done better than I do"" and my misdemeanour worsened as I am leading myself into self oblivion filled with self deprecation. I would now wake up every day in some mild panic attack and my daily internal mantra would be to remind myself that I'm a trash that couldn't get anything done right so with that heavy feeling, I haven't been able to getting my part of work done correctly because I would self sabotage. I also became quite a self pitying narcissist as I would constantly text my close family members on self destructive bouts that ""I should just work on a more menial job with my level of capability because this is too much for me"" or ""i should just kill myself because i'm such a trash anyways"". 

&amp;#x200B;

After awhile, the self pitying becomes tiring even to myself so I'm doing this one last time here in effort to find if anyone in a similar situation has ever managed to get out from this cycle of self damnation. Is there any self discovery journey that you have done to come to some level of enlightenment? How did you manage to find out that there is actually purpose? How do you end up waking up in the morning feeling that there is purpose in life? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking of looking for a different kind of jobs  or to even start scratch in a different industry but with my last 5 years of doing something at work, I wanted to see if it is still possible to carry forward my existing skillset to do something elsewhere or if I should just start from scratch and accept a lower pay in exchange of a new learning experience. The only reason why I am keeping my existing job is because I do want to make sure that I can financially support my family. If it isn't for that, I probably would gone into a self destruction mode of just abruptly quitting and listen to that inner failure.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried talking to my family members about this but because they aren't familiar with my mental situation nor the nature of my work, they couldn't advise further and just told me to just bear with it while I work a few more years to save myself some future funds. I'm not sure how much longer can I stay objective about this while I continue to feel inadequate.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; a 31 years old have been working aimlessly in the online advertising world for 5 years and is now trying to find a purpose to move forward while questioning whether it is a matter of attitude or aptitude. Advice needed to straighten my act up so I can stop functioning like a nihilistic narcissist.

376,"So my brother had a great job, a house, and a lot of debt. Over the last six years he began skipping work more and more and building debt through credit cards. He worked on an assembly line and had some foot tendon problems requiring surgery. He had two surgeries on each foot one at a time spaced out over two years. During this time he was on disability during recovery. He started smoking marijuana instead of taking pain pills which doesn't bother me as I'd rather not have him hooked to pills. He did see a doctor for a prescription as it is legal in our state. He also informed his doctors of this and aside from their concerns for his lungs they don't object. It seems to me he enjoyed being home and doing nothing all day. But that's just my outside perspective. In reality he sunk into a massive depression and prefers being a recluse. After his recovery and he was walking again he started saying he couldn't work due to his arthritis in his hands. I don't doubt the repetitive nature of his job over the last twenty years has caused damage to his body.  He is trying to take a medical retirement and file for early social security. He filed bankruptcy, lost his house, and has moved back in with our mom who is 64 and on a low fixed income. He's constantly borrowing money from her even though all of his debt was taken care of in the bankruptcy. He also received approximately $30k after selling his house. He has no plan and gets highly offended and defensive whenever I try to talk about it with him. He refuses to go to therapy and denies anything to do with depression. My mom blames the marijuana entirely and though I agree it's a contributing factor I think her accusations about marijuana destract from the real problem. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

377,"I'm 16 years old, living in the southeastern United States. I'm graduating high school this year, and I have absolutely no plans for once I do. I get good marks in school, and have a handful of promising career choices, but I am scared to death of choosing the wrong one.

I have a few years of experience in basic level design, and I'm strongly interested in pursuing a career in the realm of software development. That being said, the field of software seems much more crowded now than when I first had aspirations of being involved, so I've taken some time to consider my other options. At the moment, my eyes are set on automotive and welding. I have a family history of both, and am decently knowledgeable in the former.

I'm willing to do whatever it takes to ensure a prosperous future for myself, and ideally, my family-to-be. I want to pursue the best opportunities available to me, and I've been told on numerous occasions that welding is backbreaking work, but it is a relatively safe bet.

Some other information that you may find relevant: My current GPA is 4.573 and I'm awaiting results for my ACT test. I'm living in the southeast, but I strongly desire to live somewhere up north. Money is tight, and for that reason, I want to minimize risk. There is also a PC repair/general store near where I live, and I stand a good chance of landing a job there whilst I sit on this a bit longer.

So, that leads me to my questions. Am I incorrect about the software industry being crowded? Is there a better career choice given my credentials? Is going to college worth the money, and if not, is going to a trade school really that much better? If anyone could answer these questions, or even offer some general advice for my situation, it would be much appreciated. Thank you.",20Mar2019,1

Whenever I go to my dad’s house, it’s expected that I say hi to my step-mom (I used to not because when I was younger, she used to lecture me for various dumb things so I didn’t really “respect” her). But now I do say hi, and she just kinda teases me for saying “hi, how are you”. She’ll say “good, how are you” but in an attitude/mocking voice. Personally, when people tease me, I tend to stay quiet around them for some reason. Like I couldn’t really care less that they’re teasing me but for some reason I just am quiet around those people. So, last Sunday, my mom was picking up my sister from my dad’s house and I figured I would give them some of my stuff to take back to my mom’s house (laptop, clothes, etc). When we were out there, my step-mom came back from walking the dog. My sister and I didn’t say hi or anything to her because it would be awkward with my mom there (my dad basically cheated on my mom with my step mom). The next morning, my dad lectures me about how mad my stepmom is because neither of us “acknowledged” her on the driveway. I don’t even know what we would’ve said. “Hi! This is awkward.” Is the first thing that comes to mind lol. It’s not like it was the first time seeing my stepmom in forever. We’ve been at my dad’s house for that whole week. So basically, my stepmom doesn’t think we are nice and respectful to her. I really don’t know what to do because we’re probably going to get lectured when we go to my dad’s house again, but I will be quiet because during arguments/lectures, I don’t talk because “I’m always wrong” so there’s literally no point. It just makes the lecture worse and even longer. But then I get yelled at for not saying anything. Essentially, I end up getting yelled at for talking or get yelled at for not talking.

Basically, I had a big crush on a girl in 6th grade, she added me on Facebook the summer after 6th grade and we talked all throughout that summer and 7th grade, maybe 4 days out of the week for a few hours, all on Facebook. I grew too anxious to talk to her in person. We only talked a hand full of times in person. 

Then one day that year she told me she would be moving, out of state. I got really down, but I remember saying, ”Well at least we still have Facebook.” So we continued to talk all throughout 8th and 9th grade. I stopped talking to her because I obsessed over her, I didn’t know if she loved me like I loved her, and she was too far away, I had to move on. Three years of talking only on Facebook, tens of thousands of messages. I was in love with someone I didn’t really know, I feel like I’m living in a Black Mirror episode.

Here's a bit of backstory:

I'm a 18F and I started working at a local fast food joint about a month ago, so I haven't really met everyone yet, or at least, have been scheduled with them. Very recently, they moved me to morning shifts so now I got to meet new faces. One guy came up to me and introduced himself, I thought it was very nice because I haven't really talked to anyone besides him and another girl, since I'm shy, it makes it hard for me to befriend people who don't talk to me first. He kept joking around and stuff, so I was pretty happy about making a new friend... or at least that's what I thought he just wanted to be.

After two days, he asked me for my snap so I gave it to him and he didn't wait to text me, like literally right after clocking out he sent me a message. We texted a bit back and forth before I said I had to go and he said ""Goodnight, sweetie."" and I felt so terrible, so I didn't read or reply. Today, I pretended not to see the message and we started talking about normal stuff, y'know? Nothing eluding to liking him, and he literally said ""I think I'm starting to like you..."" and I closed the chat. I'm frustrated because #1, I only wanted a friend, and #2, I don't know how to come right out and say it. The reason I don't know how is because I've handled situations similar to this one so terribly, and they began to happen after I got in a relationship with my current BF of three years. I also didn't expect this to happen at this point at my job, in fact, I thought it would be the last thing to happen.

I'm about to quit the college and take some free time or do whatever to think about stuff.

401,"So when my sister was around ten years old, she was molested by my father, not her biological dad and it really fucked her up. We grew up together pretty close, since she was almost ten years older than me I idolized all and everything she did, and she did try her best to be a good sister to me despite the huge age gap. We've fallen out of touch and I've thought about reaching out to her again, and whenever I did I would get this immense tight feeling of fear in my chest and I don't know why. The reason why we weren't talking now wasn't really the cause, but all I could remember were those times where she touched me at weird times and me feeling uncomfortable. It makes me even sick to write this. When I was around 6 or 7, my sister would start making me take showers with her, and touch me and talk about my body and how it was so different than hers. More stuff happened, but the worst things happened when we were showering together. I really don't know what to do, I've only really just started thinking about it because I've left my abusive family, and Im remembering things again because I didn't before and that's how I coped. The only reason I remember an age is because I remember her being in high school. I don't know what to think. I don't know how to feel. I just feel really scared right now.

405,"Hello all! I am an average, friendly and kind 50 yr old female living in Florida. I am currently suffering from hip arthritis and waiting to get a hip replacement soon (not soon enough). So, I am visibly limping and struggling to get around these days.

 Last week I was visiting a friend who lives in a very upscale condominium in my city. After being on my feet all day, I was in pain and I wanted to get to my car the shortest, fastest way possible. So I walked through a piece of curb landscaping that was close to the main street and near my car. Now let me clarify - I didn't walk through flowers or smash/destroy any foliage. I would never do that - even with a painful hip. This landscaping was a few sparse shrubs, hearty Florida ivy, and mulch. There was an older woman (maybe 65) and I am assuming a  resident of the condo walking her dogs near this landscaping. When she saw me cut through she yelled very rudely  saying, ""Don't walk on that landscaping  - use the sidewalk!"" I tried to calmly explain to her that I was in pain and just wanted to get to my car. I also told her that walking through the landscaping was not normal behavior for me and that she was rude for continuing to chastise me in public.  She wanted to argue with me and didn't care if I was in pain. I ignored her and continued walking/limping to my car.

 I, unfortunately, have to go back to the condo today. Deep inside my soul, if I run into her, I want to get into her face and shred her - but I don't want to do that - I am a lover, not a fighter. If I do have the misfortune of running into this nasty bag and she starts on me, what can I say to put her in her place and but still keep my pride?  I don't want a scene - but I need to stick up for myself.

406,"This is my first post ever so be gentle :) 
Sorry if the context isn’t super readable-I’m quite upset. 

Recently an old friend came into contact with me again. This person has always been someone who I have considered in my life to be one of my best friends and someone who I could confide anything in. 
Originally we had lost contact due to the fact I was going through a rough time (depression and anxiety). I was in a relationship, and I felt like he couldn’t respect that and just be friends and supportive (making comments &amp; remarks constantly). I stopped talking to him, and distanced myself as much as I could. It was painful because I really cared about him, and I wished things were different but with the massive distance (even before the relationship I was in) I felt it would never work, and I was at the point in my life I couldn’t pursue a LD relationship again. 

Fast foreword to a few months ago, where contact was established again. I was going through a separation, and trying to figure out everything that comes with that-it’s hard when your established with someone. I also have a busy high profile job. Things escalated quickly, after all we have both always cared about each other deeply. We talk about meeting up, and I book arrangements. 

Fast foreword to a month ago. I’m struggling again. My personal life is taking a toll on me, it is painful and emotional with working on the separation and financial decisions. In combination with my high demand job &amp; maintaining a relationship with this person I can’t keep up. My head is falling below water and I’m starting to drown. I make an executive decision that I need to focus on my work and sorting out my personal life before I can continue, because my mental health is important. This person became upset. They could or did not want to believe this was the case. They wanted to work things out, but did not understand I mentally needed space to focus on what I needed to for my mental health and career. I told them I needed to cancel my trip because I just couldn’t deal with everything emotionally right now. They told me they couldn’t talk to me for a long time because they needed time. I respected this, and told them when they were ready to talk again they could message me. 

A few weeks went by, I get part of a drunk message they sent. I ask what it’s about and they tell me not to worry about it. Things escalate and we argue. I try to be kind and accepting, but get upset when I feel they are still pushing me, and say they can be a real asshole sometimes and block them. I spend the next day angry and upset at them, but end up unblocking them, so I can try to find some type of peace. After all, they are still important to me. 

They ask why I have unblocked them &amp; I tell them that I’m trying to find peace with the situation. They tell me they want me to block them, and I tell them I don’t want to. They say they will continue to message me if I don’t because they can’t control that. They say they don’t believe my “excuses” about my mental health and well being. I tell them I’ve always been honest with how I feel which is true. I tell them I am still going on my trip but to another country as my boss has said I need to take some time off. I told them I would be in that country for one day, because they told me ages ago that they couldn’t forgive themselves if they knew I was there and they didn’t see me. I told them I wasn’t expecting anything or trying to hurt them, but I would rather tell them the truth of the situation before than after. 

They reply the next day saying they are disappointed I didn’t do the one true thing they have ever asked of me in blocking them, then proceed to say they need to establish emotional distance, and me not following through with this request, as well as the fact they feel I haven’t been truthful is helping. They proceed to say they have a “list” they have written for closure they want to send me and will give me a chance for admissible discussion before they block me and don’t speak with me or have a friendship with me ever again. 

This makes me very upset. It feels like while I am trying to forgive them for their behaviour because I understand I hurt them, they just keep trying to bring me down more too. I told them I couldn’t block them for 48h because it is physically impossible for me to do that after unblocking them, but I would take my profile down for as long as I need before I can do this. I also told them that I will remove them from any other platform we are friends on or block them so they can move on. 

When I was finally able to log on to block them, I see two new messages. I know I shouldn’t have read them before I blocked but I did. One said I was being a little “extreme” and the other asked if I could bring a special treat that this person likes from my home country and “mail” it to them when I’m there. 

So reddit I ask, 

What do I do? I know this person was just trying to protect themselves and add salt into the wound by saying this but it is so incredibly hurtful to end up not speaking this way. I still care about this person so much. I need to focus on myself and my own self care though as well. ",20Mar2019,1
407,"We’ve been dating for over a year and things have been great, but he has pointed out a few times that I was quiet when we first met and started talking. Weirdly, I didn’t see it that way at all and thought I was actually pretty talkative.

When he introduced me to his friends after a month or so of us going out, we all went out to the bars and hung out and had a really good time!! All of his friends (which consists of a bunch of other couples) were so welcoming and nice, the girls in the group took me along to dance with them and stuff and never at any point made me feel excluded or like an outsider.

His friends that day said they were really happy to meet me and that they were really happy I was there and had a good time. They even reported to my boyfriend later on that they really liked me. We’ve hung out with this group many times since then and it’s always a good time and I really enjoy them, they’re all great people.

But I hung out with them last Saturday for St. Patrick’s Day, and over drinks they brought it up a few times that I was “sooooo quiet” when I first met them and that even now I’m pretty quiet... 

I know they like me anyway and it’s not a big deal but my boyfriend has asked me why I’m “so quiet” before and I just... don’t see it?? Socializing CAN be a big thing for me and I do get anxious about it sometimes but if anything I thought I was doing a really good job stepping out of my comfort zone and these comments kinda knock me down. I DO contribute to the conversations whenever I can, but sometimes they talk about people and places I don’t know anything about and it can be hard - they’ve all lived in the same town and known each other for years, where I’m still fairly new to the group and grew up knowing different people and such. 

So I guess what I want to know is how I can be more vocal around them..? What makes a person seem “quiet” and what socialization cues can help me be more vocal and outgoing? I know it shouldn’t matter that much because they still like me and all, but I don’t want to be “the quiet one” anymore. I don’t feel like I even fit that label and I don’t want to, especially when I’m trying my best to not be that way. Thanks!!",20Mar2019,1

411,"For context I just moved into a two bedroom apartment where I have my own room. Roommate and I are in 20s and she had a 5 year old who is over during the day.

412,"So I have a friend who struggles with self confidence and always confides how he’d like to be able to be “more like us” (his immediate friend group) in terms of style, confidence, and women. The only problem is he is very lazy and unwilling to change/grow himself for that to happen.

Lately we’ve convinced him that exercising is a great confidence booster, and he went to the gym for the first time in over a year using a membership he never used but still paid for. That went on for about two weeks and then he quit again. 

So Sunday we took him shopping. We didn’t force him to go but as we asked about not wasting a beautiful Sunday afternoon indoors he was generally apprehensive as his inherent laziness sat in. I told him he needed new shoes, as he only owns two pairs. One, a perpetually worn pair of flip-flops, and the second a super worn out pair of sneakers that began ripping from the sole that he still wore. 

 Now, in financial terms he makes more than any of us, and he recently bragged to us about receiving a $1,000 check from his parents, so we certainly weren’t pushing him to financial ruin by buying a $35 pair of sneakers. 

After we helped him make his choice and he bought his shoes, we let him know we were proud of him. At this point I asked if he was interested in buying clothes at this point, I sensed he felt overwhelmed because he had never gone shopping for himself without his parents before. He’s 23. He immediately decried shopping as “hyper capitalist bullshit” and wanted to leave. 

Now I’m not sure what to do. I know I’m not forcing him to do anything he doesn’t want to, and I want him to take an interest in dressing himself organically.  (He always wears a t-shirt and basketball shorts at nearly all social functions.) But it’s like why complain to me about not wanting to be a slob but then not want to improve yourself?

It was something to do and I thought I wouldn’t be good at any other sports. Fast forward to mid freshman year, we have a swim meet. I had practiced for freestyle and backstroke. My other swimming styles were terrible, and I was so slow. I get to the meet and for whatever god forsaken reasons my arrogant swim coach puts me in the 200m medley, 100 meters over what I was used to and with 50 m of butterfly and breast. I was freaking out but felt really pressured to do it even though I KNEW I wasn’t ready, especially in front of everyone. I get started and at the beginning of the race I’m already behind and by the time I get to back stroke I’m panicking.. I’ve always been really socially anxious and I KNEW I was dead last and everyone was watching me struggle.. I was freaking out and felt like I would go under (even though I was going to be okay my body felt like I was about to drown) be the time I get to the finish, my form had looked awful, I had gone slower than a snail, and everyone was watching me exasperated and panicked, barely getting out of the pool because I was so tired. Here’s where things started going fast. My mom was timing that day and had volunteered. When I tried to get out she could see how worn out and freaking out I was and started grabbing me... when I’m freaking out and someone touches me... I don’t know I just couldn’t handle it I needed to get away from everyone I was losing it because I was so embarrassed. So I pushed my mom off me.. it was a crazy irrational thing and I can’t explain it. There were so many people watching. She told me how embarrassing it was after and she was pissed. My mom is such a sweet lady and has forgiven me since and I have apologized on two different occasions. But this one event puts so much shame on me and I just can’t forgive myself for it. I hate myself for it. It’s been years and I still know those people still remember it and how shitty and weird I must’ve looked. My mom said she forgives me but I know it hurt her heart. I can’t think about my life and my path to success without thinking about it. It’s been 6-7 years and I just have so much shame and few so worthless because of it. Should I talk to someone about it ?

He's been Baker acted numerous times, arrested for drug related charges, but is always let go and the cycle continues. Recently he wife and kids left him again and his behavior got even worst.

420,"For years people have been telling me how intelligent I am, ""why dont you have your phd yet?"" ""Where is your book why is it not published?"" ""When are you going to finally go to school and start using what god gave ya?"" 

Apparently, according to these people- I have an oddly skilled ability to dissect complex concepts and make them easily understood by an extremely broad audience. Apparently, I have an incredibly unique perspective of the world. SUPPOSEDLY I should be making millions blogging, and helping people. 

Typically I would politely recieve the compliments with a grain of salt, but as I get these compliments from incredibly successful, high up, endlessly intelligent and professional  sources, I cant help but to wonder ""what the hell do i need to do in order to make school realistic? And start getting validation and pay for the skills and insight I have? "". I do think i have an ability to reach people in a way others dont. I know Im good at creating my own tangible examples for complex subjects.  I have a generally shameful and shit filled self esteem, but for some reason in this area, i really do believe in myself. 

Granted i have to play the devils advocate to a degree, so i do wonder if these wildly influential people with brilliant minds just feed me this crap in hopes of lifting my esteem. 

But ive dropped out of community college 3x before finishing a single semester.

I graduated hs with a 1.7.

Yes, I was the bright kid who didnt try and never reached their full potential.

The work i did do, and the things i did study for, typically scored well. Well enough, that if i showed up everyday, and pulled through all the days i left early- i probably could have graduated with a 2.5/3.0. Which is pretty average.

I do have add, and bipolar. 
I did struggle immenswly with depression from 3rd grade on, being mis medicated, the ssris didnt do much. Also, my mother is unmedicated bipolar (from what i can tell) and was consistantly inconsistant, and easily manipulated- so, i never really saw what routine or dicipline or stability looked like, besides- being consistantly there and consistantly compassionate (bless hee heart, honestly.) 

She tried to get me i.e.p's, i would have to take academic assistant classes, i had to have things signed off by all my teachers. There wasnt an adult who didnt have their eye on my or their support right there when i needed it. 

I started voluntarily going to saturday school at the end of grading periods to finish weeks and weeks worth of unfished packets, home work, study guides- in 6th grade.

I would do this till i graduated. 

Nobody forced or suggested it. 
My reasoning was, ""i cant get anything done at my house""

When i moved out and went to community college the 2nd time, i opted for online classea. I nearly finished my psychology and english syllabus in the first month, but peer reviews using the online coursework website, and then the algebra was seemingly impossible.

Having brain that can make complex subjects easily understandable sadly comes with the catch 22. Simply stated questions and reguirements get unterpreted in complex ways.

Its like taking a primary colored 2d image 200pc puzzle and seeing all the hues of each primary color and viewing it 2000pc instead. But when im handed a 2000pc multidimensional multi-colored multi-hued puzzle, and i can finish it with ease. 

So youd think if i can actually do a complex puzzle that imagining the simplw one would make it do able. 

It does not.

I answer questions that werent asked,
I solve probablems beyond their solutions,
I create problems and address issues that arent there.


Has anyone else struggled with this?

Are there any people who suck at school but got through college none the less?

I want to break out of my boring routines of uneventful day to day life, I feel like I haven't acted on this in the past out of laziness or anxiety of what others would think about me but without parents around I feel unbound by anxiety.

424,"Right, so I’ll start by saying I’ve been a huuuge idiot - stops all the internet warriors from coming at me later. 

A little back story... at the beginning of this year I suffered a miscarriage and as a result of having little to no support from my boyfriend of nearly a decade, I asked him to leave the house and stay at his parents. 
We are still in contact but agreed not to be together, but haven’t given up hope of continuing the relationship in the future. 

Not long before the miscarriage incident we took in a male friend who left a relationship, he continued to stay at the house with me while the ex has been away (can we see where this is going now?...) 

Well, we always had a flirty chemistry and one thing lead to another and we’ve been sleeping together. Now, apart from being close friends, there is no emotional side to this relationship. 

Problem I’m now having is, while I have decided not to talk to other people, out of respect for this friend, while we’re doing whatever it is we’re doing (it’s undefined, we never talk about it as we’re both stubborn and awkward) he has a tinder account and is talking to and meeting other women. He tells me he hasn’t actually slept with any of them but did spend a night at one of their houses so I don’t 100% trust him. 

Some days it’s fine and we talk like we’ve known each other and we share everything about our days, but other days we literally sit in silence and it’s so awkward, because as I already mentioned, we live together. 

I just don’t know what to do about the whole situation? Should I call it off, whatever it is? Should I try and talk to him and make myself sound like a crazy psycho? I really need advice, with minimal judgement cause I already know I’m a horrible human being.

426,"Backstory: I'm a (female) cashier in a dollar store. Been there for 1.5 years. I have many regular customers, but the one involved here is a 20s male who comes in a few times a week. He seems a little... Odd, but i didn't clock him as dangerous. It should be noted that i treat all of my customers the same. I am very friendly, and go above and beyond to help with whatever they need.

This guy will sometimes ask a lot of questions about products, and follow me around the store a bit. I figured he was lonely or something. Last night i worked with my store manager, and after this guy had been in, she pulls me aside and tells me ""be careful, he's gotten 2 people fired"". Umm, what? I asked her to clarify. She said he's obsessive. Comes in and wants to talk a lot, gets upset if you don't talk to him, etc. Apparently he even bought a phone for one cashier. Two people were fired over this for talking to him too much and not working.

I'm upset for several reasons here. 1. I was never warned about this person. The store manager knew he was a danger and never said a word. 2. I don't know about past employees, but i for one only talk to this guy about work related things. I answer questions about products and show him where things are located. That is my job. The implication from my boss was that i could get fired for doing my job. 

I'm livid and have no idea how to handle this. My store manager is like family, but i really feel like she's put us all in danger here. This guy should have been banned from the store if he's that bad. Instead the cashiers seem to have been blamed. Do i go over her head and talk to her boss? Call corporate HR? Or should i even do anything? Also, how the hell do i handle this guy now? He's already attached. It could piss him off if I'm not as nice and friendly as usual.",20Mar2019,35

428,"I need an advice for my friend. He wants to pay off his grandma house. 

A little background: she’s really old (I think she’s in her 80’s) and he really wants to buy a house, plus he already lives with her. The thing is, she has to daughters, none lives with her or help her.  His grandma told him before she wants to put the house in a trust, but both daughters would stop to talk with each other in the process.

He found out this week how much his grandma stills owes the house, and she’ll be already dead for years when she finally pays off (she’s giving half of the money to the bank). 

He told me he wants to help, he wants to pay off and everything, but he doesn’t know how to talk with her about it, because he wants to talk with her about she either gives the house to him or part of the house. He can’t talk with his mother about this, or anyone else, I’m the only one giving him advices.

We doesn’t want to say anything to upset her, talk about death or anything like that, he really needs to be smooth during the talk, but we have no idea how he can start this conversation. Help!",20Mar2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I really need some advice or a guide.

I\`m a software developer, and working in the same company for the last 10 years, actually it is also my first place after university. The problem is, that there are not many opportunities to grow. I\`m currently Senior Software Developer and that is all, next roles are management roles, but I\`m not good at managing people and do not want to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to find another place to work. Have tried for some 2 years. But it seems I\`m extremely bad in interviews. Had several interviews, some of them were bad, some was really good, but the outcome is always the same, I got a decline. Have tried to ask about feedback, to understand what I\`m doing wrong, but the response always is the same : ""Because of our policy we can\`t share feedback on interviews"". Do not understand me wrong, I\`m not a bad developer, I\`m one of the top guys in our office, and always receive very good feedback on performance reviews (4 or 5 out of 5). I\`m usually working on the most complex task and always manage to complete them.

&amp;#x200B;

Have tried to study new technologies on websites like Udemy and Coursera, have finished several courses. But I started to realize that I starting forget all the stuff I have learned, as I\`m not using it on my daily work.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I\`m feeling stuck and disappointed in my profession and in myself :( Maybe some of you had the same experience and manage to go through it, your advice may be very useful for me. Thank You!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Some of you may say: ""You spend too much time working in one company and because of that it is difficult to go further"". Yes and No. I\`m from Europe, and always wanted to move to USA. Because of my current work, it was possible, but it required time. First I worked hard and prove myself, then I requested a transfer to USA, then I waited for the green card process. So, I just couldn\`t change job early.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.S. I\`m expecting advice like ""Do, some side projects, contribute in open source"". There is a problem, I\`m working for 8 hours then I have two kids and wife, they need my attention too, also I understand that health is more important than money, and I go to a gym every day. I can\`t imagine when to find time for some side work :(

430,"I have been cashier at a grocery store for a little over two years now but I currently only have my availability set to work for four hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I am a full time student who is graduating in December. 

Back in January the store changed their system to where every person will have set hours for each week and that person will be guaranteed those hours. So technically my guaranteed hours should be 5-9 on Tuesdays and Thursdays but my manager originally lost my paper work and then never allowed me to fill out the paper for these hours. Because he never let me fill out the paper, I am no longer being scheduled. I have not worked in three weeks, but they scheduled me to work during spring break, but then didn’t schedule me for the weeks after. So basically I’m only working now when they really need me. 

I have tried several times to speak to my manager over the past two months along with other managers in the store and no one will listen to me or help me fix my schedule. In addition to this, I have also tried moving to a customer service position many times over the past year, and they have let me work up there a lot but haven’t actually moved me there from a cashier position. Instead, they have let several other people who arrived at the store after me move to customer service positions, even though I am just as qualified.

437,"Okay so I (22F) just moved to a new apartment and have been having a LOT of problems related to mail and package delivery. First off, the metal mailbox next to the front door was (and still is) completely broken but large packages were being delivered inside the building so I assumed our mail/packages would be left there for the time being. But then I ordered a bunch of small things off Amazon that were marked as delivered but never showed up. I filed missing package reports with the USPS and Monday afternoon they finally called me back to tell me what was wrong.

What our landlord failed to tell us was that our mailbox was actually on the sidewalk in front of our building in a metal box. The reason I assumed it wasn't is because there isn't a slot for the apartment number we live in. And since our mailman couldn't find our apartment number either, he was giving all of our mail TO OUR NEIGHBOR.  

So I wrote our neighbors a really nice note introducing myself, explaining the situation, and left my number so they could contact me about picking up the packages. I wrote the note on Monday night and so far I've heard nothing back. Then I remembered how one day I got home and a postcard from a friend was sitting on the steps leading up to our apartment. So this neighbor is getting our mail and is aware of my name and which apartment I live in. Even worse, when the USPS called on Monday they told me two of my packages were still sitting in the mailbox. I ran into our mailman today (Wed) AND NOW THEY'RE GONE. I knocked on my neighbors door and even though I heard a TV inside they ignored me. 

So now I'm worried my neighbors have been stealing my packages and have no plans on returning them. What the fuck do I do here??? Would also appreciate advice as to how to deal with my landlord, who failed to tell me we couldn't have mail or packages delivered. Can this problem be fixed?

443,"Background: I’m 16 years old in grade 11 in a public school in Canada. Last year I went to a fancy ass private school - I had to leave because it made me stressed and a teacher assaulted me. When I was 8 I had a giftedness/high IQ assessment and I was 99.5 percentile with an estimated IQ of 155. Last October I got diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive type) and prescribed vyvanse.

My grades have always been incredible on tests - always within 95 - 100 range if I attended all classes. However, I have extreme trouble motivating myself to do homework. It wasn’t perfectionism; I more so was scared of the prolonged mental effort. This made sense when I was finally diagnosed with ADHD and went on vyvanse. Now I’m able to spend extended periods of time working on things that interest me.

I barely clawed by at my private school and ended up missing weeks of school because I was too scarred of my teachers verbally reprimanding me and giving out zeros because I failed to hand something in. This has happened every October since grade 8 and I have had mental breakdowns. I go on Prozac every October and haven’t been off it for a year and a half.

Public school is way better. Although I didn’t hand things in at the end of last semester (caused a little bit of a panic) the teachers have seen this before and I now have an IPP (individualized program plan). 

I mediated for 3 hours the other day (things I am now able to do with vyvanse). At about the 2 hour mark, I realized that I truly hate school. I’m happy during my summers, but I cry nearly every weekday of the school year. I can’t convince myself to be interested in these things and it brings me to depression when I try. I have to walk around the school after lectures to mentally reset my brain. I require long naps after days of sitting and working on assignments for too long.

I was sure that I was going to go to Ryerson in Toronto, but when I visited it I was shocked that university is just more of high school. It made me more depressed that there was no end in sight. I would be in an amazing city studying awesome media/communications fields but I can barely last a lecture and therefore can’t enjoy the city. Even if I was “interested” in the material it would drain me

My interests come more in the emotional/creative realm. I find acting very easy and rewarding for me, however I don’t have the energy to pursue it during the school year. I’ve been fast in multiple roles in community theatre (they made exceptions for the adult characters have to be 18+ rule for me) but unfortunately I had to decline because of my depression and exhaustion from school. I love film and at one point wanted to go to film school.

My parent are very successful businesspeople with multiple degrees. The private school I went to started university planning in grade 7. I never saw any other option than university.

I currently work at a pool as a lifeguard and swim instructor and I love it. My coworkers highly value me and it reminds me that I’m not doomed to unhappiness. I know they would train me as a head guard if I worked there after I turned 18. That is about $30 an hour. I also make about $500 a month from Redbubble and society 6.

I know I can support myself. I’m a hard worker and without school I know I can work hard enough to pursue acting along with the other sources of income I have. I’m not worried about how I will fare in the world.

I’ve been having dreams about dropping out after my first month of Ryerson and started to actively make plans to do so. However, I realize this is a waste of my parents’ money and if I can convince them to never force me in the first place I will be happier.

Once my psychologist comes back from maternity leave I will share these feelings with her. I’m currently planning to graduate early (January of 2020) so I can be free from school.  I think I will hold on to these ideas and share my feeling with a meeting between my parents and psychologist at the beginning of 2020.

I will still apply to schools in the fall, especially Ryerson. But I’m terrified of sharing these ideas with my parents.

Any ideas? Sorry for the rant. I haven’t seen my psychologist in 2 months and haven’t told anyone else.

Thanks for reading!!

455,"So I go to a community college, and I am in the choir program. there are three ensembles, and the one I am in is very close knit. I don't know everyone very well, but everyone is very friendly with each other, and anyone could talk to anyone without worrying about being judged.

In another ensemble, there is a guy, let's just call him Chad. He is the actual biggest douchebag I have ever seen. You wouldn't know it just from talking to him, he is very good at hiding it behind being a good musician and student. All of the teachers love him of course (they aren't dumb, they just don't know what he hides from them). Anyway, here is a list of some of the worst things Chad has done:

\-Cheating on his many girlfriends of the past

\-Sexual harassment of freshman girls, in the boys dorm building

\-Sex with underage girls (his current girlfriend is a junior in high school)

\-And this is the big one: spreading chlamydia to his numerous sex partners, and when they break up with him and say he gave them chlamydia, he calls them psycho, and not to be trusted. Chad refuses to get himself tested, and knowingly gives these girls an STD without telling them, and refuses to admit he did so.

This pisses me off to no end. I am the type of person who, when I see something that should be done, and I do not do it, I will kick myself over and over. People nowadays just say ""it's not my business, they just gotta deal"" and this ideology pisses me off even more.

So now Chad has started flirting with this girl, let's call her Katie, in my, again, close-knit ensemble. Katie is one of the nicest girls here, and she always sees the best in everyone. She is essentially the ambassador between our ensembles when we have our differences. Unfortunately, this kind of behavior can get you taken advantage of. Katie is definitely flirting back with him, and has been doing so for a couple of weeks. The only reason I think that she hasn't had sex with him yet is because I know she is a pretty devout christian and I'm pretty sure she is a virgin, but I'm not absolutely sure. However, if I know anything about Chad, I know that he will convince her to have sex.

I do not want Katie to get fucked over by Chad. I have a girlfriend, so it's not like I want her to myself or anything. I do not have anything else to gain from this but her well being. Also, he still has a girlfriend in high school atm, so he would be cheating on her in addition to all of this bad stuff. I have considered texting her and telling her all of this that I have said about Chad. Would this be too nosy and not at all my business? Or would it be worth it to do something about the situation? These kind of situations piss me off, because I know people will always tell me that I should just leave it alone, but if I don't do anything, then the same thing will happen over and over again. The only person that would be willing to do anything would be me, even though I don't necessarily have any connection to the situation. I am simply concerned for her. Should I say anything? And if so, then how should I word it?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Douchebag at my school does many bad things to women such as spreading chlamydia and then calling them psycho for calling him out for it, and he is trying to get with a very nice girl whom I know, and I don't want to get fucked over.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I am very bad at talking to people in person, so I think if I were to say anything, then the most effective way would be over text, since I am not terrible at writing.",20Mar2019,1

457,"We have known for 4 and a half years, now. We got really close last Summer, met for the first time last December and fell hopelessly in love.  Met a few times after that, our next meeting will be in 3 weeks.

With her, I feel alive.

We are both very dedicated to one another and want to start a life with one another. We are now engaged, to make Visa related topics easier. We are both 100% certain about this relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that we aren't entirely sure how we will be able to live together. Getting a Visa for Austria would be difficult for me, getting a Visa for Israel would be difficult for her.

I am currently employed with a contract that will end next year's Summer, and so does she. And we aim to make Summer 2020 the date which we will bind our lives together. But Visa stuff is giving us so many problems. 

We have realized that as an Israeli, I can live and work in Germany without a Visa, but I know that it would be a bit difficult for her to get to Germany.

She is willing to live in Israel for a while, but it's extremely difficult to apply for a Visa when you aren't Jewish.

I am willing to live in Austria for a while, but it's extremely difficult to apply for a Visa without a European passport.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like the entire world is against us... And I just hope that some of you out there could give us more options, more ways in which we could make this life ours, together.

458,"Hi all,

Currently I am working a minimum wage job, working roughly 10-15 hours a week at a well-known beauty supplier store. In addition to this position, I work as an administrative assistant within a faculty at my university where the pay is higher and the position requirements and daily tasks are more related to my prospective field of interest. To put this likely, I am working the retail position as a way to make extra money to put towards rent and out of interest as I enjoy hair, nails, and makeup. However, I understand this is not a job that will benefit me long-term and quite frankly, the money is not worth the additional stress. There are several factors that are leading me to consider quitting, but I am worried I would be jumping ship or making a poor decision based on emotions.

Firstly, the company stresses the importance of sales (understandably, well to a certain extent) and our manager continuously nags staff to increase sales, for example: by pushing unnecessary products to customers looking to dye their own hair. Personally, I do not feel right causing a customer, who informs me they are looking to DIY as they need to save money on paying to have their hair done, to buy additional product that they won't even use or will just return later. They also stress the fact that when a customer walks in, we essentially have to be their shadow and again, be very pushy with telling them promotions, suggesting products, or showing them alternative products (just up-selling them). There is nothing I hate more as a consumer than when an associate hounds me to purchase something I know I do not need or want or even when they follow you throughout the store. This practice is something I do not feel comfortable doing, so I do not.

Lately, my manager has been coming to me to ""shit-talk"" other employees, highlighting their personal flaws and work errors. I know for a fact that in return, she is talking about me to other staff as I often hear it first-hand. I want to stress that I work with all females so it is usually gossip central, but I am tired of the back and forth and especially the unprofessionalism coming from both the manager and assistant manager. Constantly, new rules are being made that are not ""across the board"" and the assistant manager has been passing off all her work onto other staff while hounding us to finish our lists. We are all getting in trouble or getting yelled at if we don't follow the rules set in place, despite not being made aware of them. Having previous experience in a managerial role, I understand the difference between sharing the load and simply delegating, as well as constructive criticism vs. criticism in a condescending nature.

Lastly, when our store was being reviewed by top management the other week, I was warned to be on my very best behaviour - a very fair expectation. However, when I arrived for my shift, I received the full head to toe bitchy look from one. Receiving this from a grown female manager, one who I was already cautious of caused me to be anxious throughout the entire shift and quite frankly, have my back up. I was very cautious of what I said to her - saying less, and avoided being in an aisle or in the backroom alone with her. That day, someone close to me was having surgery, so I asked to be informed if my phone was ringing in the backroom (where the managers were meeting), in case of an emergency. My phone rang 3 times back to back and I wasn't told by them, but rather heard it while on the floor. They were annoyed that it kept ringing and made that clear to me when I walked back, knocked, and asked to see my phone briefly. They refused to let me back and I was unable to check my phone. Even though I made my manager aware of what was going on that day, I was later reprimanded for causing a disruption and not following company policy regarding phones. Company policy states the phone must stay in the back room and be used on breaks, in this case, I thought an exception would be made understandably.

As I am still in my probation period, the top manager suggested I be terminated for my attitude towards the one manager and for me interrupting them to check my phone. Clearly, something changed their minds as I am still employed but I did have my hours drastically reduced for what I believed to be was related to my exam schedule with school, but the manager has been telling other staff members it is because of my attitude. I was denied the request for vacation time during Easter (even though we are only opened on the Saturday and off the Friday, Sunday, and Monday) and was told if I keep asking for time off I will be terminated as per the district manager. When I started, I informed them of a vacation from May 22-26th and have been entitled to one weekend off per month due to company policy, and have only requested one day off in March to attend a concert planned since October. I make an effort to always show up on time, in uniform, and pick up other shifts when needed. I have never worked in a company where top management has had such a negative outlook on everything, including their staff. In my opinion, you should want to make your staff feel comfortable and appreciated as they will perform better. The district manager wants to fire a new staff member every other week and I know the stress of it trickles down to my manager who then takes it out on us. Our store sales are rapidly improving and as a whole, we are benefitting the company not costing it.

In sum, I am wondering if I should make the district manager's life easier and quit because I am not looking to take on anymore work stress over a minimum wage job. I hate to be a quitter, but if we are having performance evaluations based on our sales (lowest score = individual fired) and we are not even on commission, the only incentive to up-sell customers is to keep my job. I am not a bad employee and have had multiple jobs working in law firms, working for my university, and working in managerial positions. Maybe I am not cut out for retail but in my opinion, $14 an hour and the 30% discount isn't worth the bullshit that has been going along with this job. Not to demean any minimum wage job or any retail job, but as I already have another job and a full-time summer position, I believe that as I am disposable to this company, they are equally disposable to me. A few of my close co-workers have left work crying lately and I am not about to add to that number. I am wondering what your take on this situation is and what you believe I should do? Open to any comments, criticism, and/or advice!

TIA!

TLDR: going through a lot of bullshit right now at a minimum wage retail job (gossiping managers/co-workers, incredibly negative top management, threats of being fired if sales don't increase while not being on commission, reduced hours) and am wondering if I should stick it out and suck it up, or move on and find another job.",20Mar2019,1

463,"Not sure if this has been discussed before, but the best method of dealing with robocalls from my experience is one of the following:  


1. Simply do not pick up - after a while of just not answering phone calls from numbers you do not recognize the calls slowly fade away as your number will eventually be marked as ""dead"". This can be a double edged sword however as if you do mistakenly start picking up robo calls (This happened to me where I picked up 2 because I thought it was my doctor) your number will be marked as ""active"" and the calls will start all over again
2. Pick up the calls but wait until the end of the message usually these have an option at the end that says something along the lines of ""press 2 to be put on our do not call list"".  I can't attest to the honesty of these scammers as some aren't located in the USA and might not respect DNC lists but it is worth a shot.
3. Do not block the numbers, your number can be spoofed to make robocalls. I've had a few instances where people give me a call stating that I gave them a call when I have no record of it, usually they don't understand how spoofing works. By blocking the robocall number you aren't actually blocking that entity from calling you again, just that one spoofed number.
4. There is a national do not call list you can be placed on but again this comes down to if the scammers are actually local to the United States and choose to respect this.

464,"I feel guilty even writing about this because my mom does so much for me and without her I literally wouldn't exist. When I was a kid I loved spending time with her but over the years that's changed. When she speaks, she's very loud and shrill. Practically  every time we speak, she's either nagging me about something or she's complaining about something. I think I've learned to associate her voice with negativity because of this. I thought once I left for college that I would miss her and be happy to see her when I visit home. But even in small doses, she just stresses me out and frustrates me.

It also feels like she and I don't have a very close relationship. I see my boyfriend talk to his mom and they joke around with each other and they both sound happy. I want that kind of relationship with my mom but it seems impossible to have a happy or lighthearted conversation with her. It's all business and complaining pretty much all the time. Even when she doesn't have something negative to tell me she says it in a bad way. The other day she said, ""Okay, I need to talk to you."" that made me think it was something serious but then she just asked what I wanted to eat for dinner.

Sometimes it gets so bad that as soon as she starts talking my thoughts are literally, ""shut up, just shut up and let me relax."" I want to have a good relationship with my mom before it's too late but I don't know how to change things.",20Mar2019,3
465,"Hi reddit, I have been fighting with a lot of things lately and I have successfully won almost all of those battles but one.

This is very long so for the ones interested, please bare with me. Also I'm dutch so sorry if there are grammatical errors in the story.

Let me try to give the most complete story, it started about 2 years ago. I was part of a little and very nice community of people from all around the globe, we chatted in a sort of ""chill and talk"" livestream every day.

It was a nice time and I met a lot of kind people, one day a new person started chatting with us. Lets call her Megan, Megan is british and was about 2 years younger than me. Megan and I got along well and we started chatting privately on discord.

She was very kind but had some typical ""teen"" behaviour, very clingy, constant mood swings, etc.

I was 15 at that time and she was 13 if I remember correctly.

About a year later we got into this big argument with the community and left that behind very quickly, however Megan was insulted into the damn ground by this one psycho-antivaxxer lady. I took up the fight and thought that I had scared that horrible person away.

I noticed that Megan was very hurt by what that woman had said to her, I have seen people get insulted in nasty ways but this was fucking overboard. What didn't help was that Megan was very easily influenced by those kind of things at the time.

I saw Megan getting very, very depressed. I tried everything to make her cheery and give her hope but I failed. She attempted suicide, multiple times. The thing was though, she didn't know how so she failed all attempts.

She was kept under more and more supervision and then sent to a clinic and then to an even more secure clinic, damn I don't know how she even managed to keep getting more supervision every time.

I was kinda skeptical, but she showed me around her ""room"" live via discord with her phone, the clinics didn't have wifi so she would use her cellular data. Because of her data running out I would only hear from her once every few weeks.

About a month ago she sent me a message saying that they would let her go home, I couldn't understand because she had to get forcefully fed and given medications by force every day because she refused work with the clinics personnel and was very aggressive towards them.

She was obviously still not mentally stable, I have seen her arms. As someone who isn't impressed at the stuff on liveleak and bestgore, I was fucking shocked. Her arms had so many cuts it was like looking at a bloody, infected broom.

I was planning to go to britain with a friend next spring break, but I seriously don't know if she's still alive to meet me by then. She's trying to get me to tell her how to commit suicide lately, I keep refusing to tell her and that there is still hope.

But now, I am out of answers or strategies to keep her from trying again. Mentally I have been questioning myself too but I want this problem to be solved first.

Oh I forgot one thing that may be very important, she told me the doctors found a chemical in her blood that could be the cause of her mental problems. She lives on the coast and I know that she is vegan (some fish naturally have mercury in their bodies, but if she's vegan then idk) and I know that a lot of her classmates also have show some fucked up behaviour so I suspect that there is something wrong with the food or water in the area (Cornwall, Britain).

Please, I just need anything. I just want to meet her next spring break, I don't want to meet her grave. So if you have any kind of advice, please feel free to give it because I have been losing motivation recently. I just want her to live, happily and not think of death constantly.",20Mar2019,1

468,"TL;DR my mother and I have a very close relationship, but I  a little distant from her as a 21 year-old doing my own thing.  She is chronically depressed, semi-suicidal, and living on her own with my 2 kiddo brothers. How can I support her? 

Back story: 
My mother, Lauren, grew up with an acutely schizophrenic mother, rape, without a father and no support. 

My mother and I have a very strong and loving relationship, but we are also a bit distant because we both lead very busy lives. My mom &amp; dad spit up when I was about 1 y/o (they were 19 at the time) my father is a nice guy, he’s still in the picture. I grew up with my mother most of my life, so we were able to really have the mother-daughter bond. When I was growing up my mom got married and had two more kids, my half-brothers, who are now 11 and 9 y/o. My mom and her husband recently opened their marriage, and then divorced, so she is now a semi-single mom again. Additionally she lost her very great, long term job (math professor at a liberal arts college) a few months back, and is still just living off of unemployment. 
I love my mom like any daughter normally does. We live about 10 minutes from each other, and talk almost weekly on the phone or via text. I’m extremely open/transparent about my life with her as well. I’m extremely independent and don’t use any resources from her at all, if anything I help her out sometimes with extra cash. 
Unfortunately we don’t carve out time to see each other as much as we should, but that is something I am working on. She is also taking many antidepressants/anti-anxiety medications. As well as beginning to see a new therapist this week! Her health care providers are aware of this depression.  Her mother (my grandma) is a living in a federal prison due to schizophrenia (side note: fuck the system, grandma needs mental heath care not prison!!) 

Where I need help: 
My mother is extremely, extremely depressed. Sometimes she won’t leave the house (really her bed) for a few days due to depression.. she occasionally talks to me about the logistics of her potential suicide, saying she’s grateful to know that I would take care of my brothers. She battles with self image issues, social anxiety.. the works. She’s extremely intelligent and interesting, but depression definitely takes out her spark. I feel like it’s getting worse then ever before. 

When she talks to me about her depression, she talks about it pretty casually.. changing the subject back and forth, laughing at irony, ending the conversation quickly..  I feel like she does this because she doesn’t want to scare me or “get into all it” with me, because I don’t like serious conversations.  So I am unaware of the intricacies of the issues, where her feelings come from etc. 
I know she hasn’t told me everything, I can tell she is only letting me see a little bit of how horrible this problem is for her. So it must be massive.

How can I, as a distant but also very close, 21 year old daughter, help my wonderful mother through this dark time? I am worried about her, and if she took her own life I’m positive that I would regret not doing more to help her. But I am at a loss of how what capacity I can be her support when I’m in the daughter role.

469,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There is a big step in my life that I could take but I am not sure if I should go ahead with it. Let me explain my situation... Firstly, I am engaged to a wonderful man who is his disabled mother's full-time caretaker. He also works at a Starbucks inside a rest stop which is fifteen mins walking from our house, making $12.75/hr. **I am unemployed** since we live in a very small town with **no car** (a friend takes us twice a month for groceries and such) and cannot find a job that would properly accommodate both my **physical and mental health issues** (I suffer from asthma, chronic rhinitis, bad hypothyroidism, Bipolar II, severe anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, depression, a possible learning disability, etc. Exercising is extremely difficult for me physically and walking the fifteen mins to work in either really hot or super cold weather (**we live in Upstate NY**) over hills and such is not the greatest choice for me) I also think that working a fast-paced job is not good for me due to my health. I have experience as a receptionist and would like to find another job in that field.

&amp;#x200B;

**I have a friend in Southern California**, where I was born and lived for a few years (and really do **love it there**), who has **offered for me to stay with him a few months rent-free** so that I can make some money from a hotel job or something of the sort and eventually buy myself a used car. My goal is to, when I save up enough money, move my fiance and, possibly his mother, across the country to California with me (although I feel the best plan is to get his mother a cheap apartment in Upstate NY with potentially free daily check-ins and meals from state workers. The reason she doesn't get that assistance already is because we are so far out in the ""sticks"" that the state workers will not service our location). My fiance's sister who lives in Florida may help with the cost of moving my future mother-in-law into her own apartment, but we would have to ensure that she would be receiving free state care on a regular basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the problem that arises is whether or not I should move alone to California for a few months and save up the money I'd be earning from my job, possibly two, (my friend there lives right by a mall and many stores so I could easily land a job) to eventually get a used car and then either: **A.** **move back to NY**, get a front desk job thirty mins away in the city (since I'd finally have a car), and try to get an apartment there for myself and the fiance, or **B.** **attempt to move the fiance to California** with me and never have to move again since we'd be living in our dream state with jobs all around. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that two main issues create obstacles here, one being that I would miss my fiance a great deal and I'm not sure if I could handle that (I do have mental health issues and I am quite introverted), and two, that I am not sure if the trip would really be worth the struggle; would I make enough money within those 3-4 months to buy a used car for about $1,500-2k? I have so many concerns, and also so little money. I have zero savings, just $200 on a credit card and whatever small amount of money my fiance makes from his job per week (he usually makes around $300 but $100 or more of that gets put into his mother's bills). **What is your opinion on the matter?** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Just FYI**, I have some family out in So. Cal (aunts and uncles, grandparents) who could probably **help me in an absolute emergency**, but they are **very staunch Christians** who have never really been fond of me, even though I am of the same faith myself (just less radical, you could say). My family also does not wish to aid me in my life decisions due to them not ""agreeing"" with my relationship, being my fiance is thirteen years older than me and none of them but my parents have ever met him. **My parents are Protestant cult leaders** (legit) and abused me my entire life so I have no help from them either. My fiance helped me escape from North Carolina last April, where I was living with them. Sometimes, my mother will send me packages of food in the mail in hopes that her material gifts might sway me to return to her abuse. She paid for an emergency orthodontist procedure today because she thinks that might make me realize just how much she ""loves"" me. After having lived with her for eighteen years (I am nineteen now), I know what she's up to, and it certainly is not good. The reason I mentioned my awful relationship with my parents was simply to demonstrate to you all that I have no support from them. My mother would never buy me a car or anything of the sort if I told her I was going to stay with a friend she doesn't even know and would probably just hate anyways, as she does everybody. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also understand that **California is a** **very expensive state** and that I should be thoroughly prepared for such a big move. As I mentioned before, **I have no savings or extra money** on hand, so it would be a stressful experience. One great reason for moving though would be to heal myself physically for awhile (I never have allergies when in California... I live in a disgusting, old house tbh and the POS just needs to be torn down. It's been taking a toll on both my mental AND physical health for quite awhile now. I told my fiance that I just need to get away from the house for a bit and decompress. He is on board, but is also concerned about my mental state in California and if I would be able to handle the loneliness plus work load. My plan, if I move, is to keep myself super busy with my job(s) and other activities so I do not have the time to think about missing him). I see a lot of potentially great benefits from going out to Cali for a few months, but then I also see the possible downsides. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, do you guys think that going away for a few months would be a good change for me, a fresh start? Or should I stay in this **junky, cat-piss stained 1970s home** and not work a job, waiting for my life to improve? Let me know what you think, and please don't judge my partner or I for the predicament that we are in. My fiance is an amazing person and the dilapidated house is nothing of his doing; his father passed away at a young age, and he has no family besides his mother who could ever help him improve his life. **He has now been stuck giving his mother 24/7 care for over fifteen years now.** His two selfish siblings would not step in, so HE had to. Please, put yourself in both of our shoes and try to be understanding. Thank you, and I really appreciate it. ",20Mar2019,1

474,"Dropped out of college 2 years ago, didnt get a degree been working shitty min wage jobs since then. Currently live with my parents. No friends, no gf, nothing to do. Ive never had friends or a gf. All I do is go to work then site at home on my computer all day playing video games. Feel like I missed out on the ""golden years"" of life. I feel like I missed things like teenage love, partying, chilling at the mall with out a single care in the world. Like at this point there really isnt any point in trying to do anything. I do want to turn my life around though. Im looking to go back to college next year(no idea how I'll pay for it), I have a 2 year degree already so I only need another 2 years. I feel like a POS going back to school at 26 though, seeing all the young kids already ahead of me in life. I've also started to eat better and will be getting a gym membership soon. But even with this it feels like shit knowing there are people younger then me who are way more successful. I know you're supposed to run your own race but my younger brother already has his own house, car, a wife. My other younger brother graduated opened up his own practice. And then theres me the NEET of the family. The once ""bright"" kid who just ended up disappointing everyone. I feel like I'm old uneducated idiot who will never amount to anything.

475,"I’m 18F and as we all know it was st patricks day last Sunday, the day were getting exceptionally drunk is more acceptable than a getting hammered on a random Thursday afternoon. Anyways... 

My 4 friends and I had an idea we would go out and get drinks, this was never set in stone but it was a plan that was most likely not going to flop. However my boyfriend wanted to do something with me, I was torn between my friends and my boyfriend. You’re probably wondering why couldn’t I just bring my boyfriend with my friends so I wouldn’t have to choose between them, that’s a very long long story but simply put my boyfriend has a bad history with one of my friends. 

I was torn between going out with my friends or spending a day with my boyfriend eating food and getting drunk at his place. I chose my boyfriend.. 2 out of the 4 friends were so angry about this that they decided that if I wasn’t going out that none of them were going to (which is so unbelievable). I apologized to them and it wasn’t a simple “oh I’m sorry”, I’m talking a very long paragraph on how I didn’t want to choose him over them and how I’ll make it up etc etc. They completely disregarded my apology... And have been ignoring me and not acknowledging me at all. 

Today I decided to apologize again (yes my second apology how annoying am I) and I got ignored again. I don’t know what to do, I understand their annoyance but I feel that this has gone way overboard and has been made a bigger deal than it actually is. ",20Mar2019,5

Problem is my family is rather poor and can't afford big bills and its going to take my entire Bi-weekly check just to get this exam done.

So she tells me about this Credit place online to apply for, which I then try to do. The credit place declines me as I have never used anything with credit before.

482,"I’ve searched for a really long time on what I need to do and I can’t do any thing but just wait. So here’s the story 
There was this girl {16} that I liked since we were kids as we went to the same school and we were the same age. And so this girl was the world to me because she was a lot like me in so many ways and there was just this spark we had where we could just have so much together but just doing nothing. Anyways fast forward to highschool and everything’s starting to go to shit. I’ve made new friends and stuff but they started making comments about her body as she is a fairly attractive female and so I statutes to tell her the comments my friends were making. I eventually confessed to them what I had been telling her and they were of course made at me but we got over it and everything was ok. But then there was a fight in the group chat and that was the last straw for a lot of my friends. My friends had given me advice as to what to do with this girl as they had helped me threw out my emotions with her because I felt like she didn’t care about me. And I basically didn’t take their advice and went on to date her. We dated for about a month and in that month I lost a couple of my good friends. But there were the ones that stayed by my side even threw all of it. Anyways he break up and whatever and we stay good friends. U know staying in touch with each other and telling each other how our days were going. A month passes by and I’m still talking to her as she one of the only people that still actually talks to me. And all of a sudden she stops talking to me. Like I was literally talking to her before lunch and bam she blocks me on everything under sun. So I go to my good friend, or so I thought he was, and ask him if he knows anything. He says he has no idea what could be wrong so I don’t think much of it until he says something strange. He says “u wouldn’t record her on FaceTime would u? No u wouldn’t do that”. The reason why this really caught my attention was because a couple of months prior I had the same accusations come to me and I had proved them wrong so I started freaking out. So I go to get answers and no one knows anything. She doesn’t talk to me for about 3 weeks and I’m talking to my friend, the same guy who said the shit about face time, and I find out that she thinks that I recorded her on FaceTime. So I’m here like what the fuck why would she think that?? And she had ended up telling some people on my bus this as well so I was really confused why she would say that. I ask one of the people that were on the bus what she had heard and she told that the guy who said who had known nothing was the one who told her this. He told her that I had showed him a video on my phone of her getting changed on FaceTime. And so before I knew this I had him talking to said girl for me like sending her messages for me saying my goodbyes or whatever because it doesn’t seem like it’s gonna get better. So now I’m confused as to what to do. Because idk if she’s knows that I didn’t do it as I have multiple reasons as to prove my innocence, and she said goodbye to me too so now I’m stuck as what I can do. Where to go because I’ve also been really lonely because I don’t have anyone anymore.  ",20Mar2019,1

484,"Hey r/Advice, I need your thoughts!

Recently I was made a job offer that I plan to formally accept later today. Obviously, I'll need to give notice at my current employer, and I will owe them some relocation money back for leaving before 2 years with the company. 

After 1 year, I'll owe them a prorated 75% of the relocation expenses. My new manager encouraged me to submit my notice after this 1 year date, take some time off, then start at the new job. However, to be frank, I want to get the hell out of dodge ASAP (very unsatisfied at work right now) and I'm very excited to start with the new company, would rather not wait. 

Should I give notice 2 weeks before the 1 year date so I can formally quit on that date? Is there any reason for or advantage to gain from waiting to turn in my notice after I've officially been there a year (barring any HR policies in place that require me to give longer notice, I'm currently investigating this)?

Additionally, in the contract I signed at my current employer, I only owe the money if I voluntarily terminate my employment. If they choose to let me go immediately (my boss has been known to do this, responds emotionally without thinking), it is my understanding that I won't owe them any money since that termination of employment wouldn't be officially ""voluntary"".

Tldr: If I leave before 1 year, I owe 100% of my relo back; after 1 year I owe 75%. New boss suggests waiting until after 1 year to give notice, I'd rather give it sooner. 

Any thoughts and advice are appreciated!!!",20Mar2019,1
485,"Hi. So my problem here is that I am currently doing work of 2 people all alone. My collegue left the company about 2,5 months ago and since then I have seen zero progress from HR in finding a replacement. I am overwhelmed with work. What pisses me is that they knew about her leaving 2 months prior. So in sum it has been 5 months to act and find replacement. The company is really bad in general. There are no processes, HR is lead by incompetent, insecure wannabe HR mamager who is doing nothing and I legit hate her as she is spineless and doing nothing. The company is small \~60 employees. 

The situation on the market is almost 0% unemployment rate, who wants to work works. I work in digital advertising btw. Its really hard to find more people capable of doing what I am doing. Even the HR admitted that they have to go for competition and snatch someone from there which strenghts the situation on the market and ALSO my position as I seem to be at the moment irreplaceable. Its gonna be more than 2 months to find someone else.

How could I use this to my advantage? Should I ask for more money? What can I do to capitalize on this.

During spring break, me and my sister are both home, and at one point I said I would start the emptying the dishwasher.

I thought that maybe college isn’t for me and to go look at other options in life.

But last night we stopped by his place after a small concert. I wasn’t going to stay long but he showed me his weed. He told me how to smoke it and showed a few edible things. I tried it and it was great and then I really *really* started feeling it. I’ve never been high so this was a brand new feeling. It’s morning and I still feel kind of high. But last night, right in the middle of it, he kisses me. I could barely kiss back. I also felt like my body was shaking/trembling. I remember the look in his eyes when he watched me involuntary trembly. He took off my clothes and his, then he did some other stuff after taking me in his room. We didn’t have actual sex though. 

I’m not opposed to having a sexual relationship with this guy but not this soon in a relationship. And especially not at that very moment. Sex was the farthest thing from my mind that night. But there were so many feelings going through my mind and body that it was easier to let him do it than to make him stop. It was just happening, my body felt tired and light, and I didn’t feel like what my friend and I were doing was doing was a mutual exchange. I felt like I was watching him and I could feel what was happening but I couldn’t *do* anything.

Bit of an odd question but I've got a bit of a dilemma. I found this Russian girl on Tinder (I'm from the UK and she told me she's here visiting her mum and is on Tinder to fuck whilst over in the UK), hot as shit so I followed her on Instagram (she has a private account), sent her some messages and she's down to fuck me, also she's apparently a model and cam girl. However, she wants me to watch her show before we meet so she can trust me, but I don't trust the website (I'm a web developer), firstly because there's no privacy policy or terms &amp; conditions and secondly the disclaimer for the credit card details form says something about a membership. The site does have an SSL which is promising but that's about the only trustworthy thing I can see, even though she assures me it's secure and safe.

So I offered a solution of me paying her directly for a private cam show on Skype, to prove she can trust me which she doesn't want to do. So my question to you guys is, do I risk entering my details and having my money stolen, then get to fuck this hot chick or just forget about it.

507,"My mom has owned a small farm with mostly sheep and small dogs for years now. Recently we have been told that despite living on 30 acres zoned agricultural and following all other rules, our fenced area where we keep most of the dogs is too close to the edge of our property. We where also told that because of the 6 or so acres of wetland in the middle of our property, there isnt enough space in the correct configuration to allow for us to sell dogs. We (apparently) may not sell a single puppy despite being licensed in every conceivable and reasonable way to do so.

They are mini dachshunds. We have 12 dogs total including our 3 border collies that herd our sheep. 

This is incredibly frustrating as well as not the first time county officials have stopped us from trying to follow this sort of career. Before we had sheep and dogs, my mom had exotic animals. Hedgehogs, Guinea pigs, sugergliders, and rabbits mostly. She was licensed in all the appropriate ways and sold to pet stores exclusively aside from the rabbits and Guinea pigs.

The government made that an issue and forced her to shut down by taxing the ever living fuck out of her small business.

I dont know if theres anything we can even do to try and salvage it for my mom at this point, but this has been a lifelong passion of hers that continues to get shot down at the counties leisure. 

Note: I dont work full time at the farm. I live elsewhere and come to help when I'm not at my actual job as the farm is small enough for a single person to do everything relatively easy. ",20Mar2019,1

510,"Some context first. I am a 23 years old male medical student. Haven't had any relationship for 5 years. So very inexperienced guy here.

 One of my class friend lets call her A and i started pass time a lot cause we are both studying medical license exam of our country hard and now we are good friends at least to me. And i realized i admire her. She is really smart and i am kinda sapiosexual but apart from that she is definitely not my type both as a person and physically so i feel nothing for her. Couple of weeks ago she introduced me her roommate B and A talked about her to me a lot so i said 'so this is famous miss B that i always hear about' and B said 'i was going to said that i hear about you a lot nice to meet you finally' so i know they were talking about me. Total time i passed with B is less than 30 mins and i don't really know her and i didn't really cared at first. She was physically my type of girl but thats it. Anyway last week as we are all passing to the hospital chatted a bit not particularly good or bad and after that day  3 days in a row i saw her in my dreams and i am an one dream per month kinda guy. I am really surprised and i decided that it's my primitive feelings cause i know nothing about her i just ignored myself. And today A and i was going to the library and on the way we talked to B. They were planning a birthday party for one of their friends and i was standing there and waiting chatting at the opportunities. B said 'i am not sure about the hour of the preparations as i am passing on gym for couple of days maybe i will workout at that time' at that point gave me short look and started a very flirty posture and mumbled about something like trekking. Which happens to be one of my favorite but there is probably no way she is knowing it. Anyway they talked a bit more than B looked at me than turned to A with a shade of an interesting smile and said 'let's invite Modchin to the party too' with a very flirty way. I am sadly don't know the birthday person so i am not going. Btw as a person who watches body languages a lot B's body almost always towards me and A is standing next to me so its a interesting posture as she was talking to her mostly.

At this point i am very confused. I first thought she was getting flirty with me optimistically but now i am thinking that maybe the A is into me and B was just being a wingman and pushing her. I was actually wanted to know B more to make a move and ask A to be my wingman but now situation is getting a bit awkward with the other possibility. I am not sure which one is the wingman which one is into me or am i just reading signs out of no where because i subconsciously want a sign. 

So as a very inexperienced and confused young man i need your advice and point of views. Thanks for reading.",20Mar2019,1
511,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for around 8 months now, our relationship started having problems in late December. 

She has an obsession with Omegle, she uses it when she's bored, before we started dating she used to strip for strangers etc. She told me she wouldn't use it anymore, which I really appreciated. On Christmas day I was at her house, she was searching her history to find a previous URL, that's when I had seen she had been using it (which wasn't too much of a problem, I just slightly questioned it and she swore she wouldn't use it again.)

Fast forward to mid February, I noticed she was acting rather distant and I tried absolutely everything to restore our relationship, I spoke to her and she said everything was fine and that nothing was wrong, one night I decided to snoop around at her search history and had seen she had used it in the hundreds since Christmas (I know I shouldn't have snooped around, I was just incredibly curious.) 

We ended up having a massive argument about this, at first she completely denied using it, then I showed her the proof. She starting sobbing and told me how it was a mistake and she swore (again) to stop using it. I decided to accept her apology, this is my first proper relationship and I do genuinely love her. I have reason to believe that she's been doing it again, (this time with a private browser.) Also I can't 100% prove what she was doing on Omegle, but I have a pretty good idea since she lied to me.

One thing to mention, her ex boyfriend told me that she had cheated on him previously, which she did admit to, once I had found out.

512,"Its my first time posting here and on mobile. Basic stuff but sorry for any fuck ups

Also to keep it short, I've left some complex stuff that I'll explain in depth in the comments if you would like me to.

So in short, on the Thursday before the Winter Break, this girl, a senior we'll just name T, who runs a club I'm a part of gave me her number. Over the break, we talked a lot and played some games. I've developed affection for her and during the break, she also did to. We would've dated, but since us two haven't hanged out often, she didn't want to start saying we're bf and gf and asked me to wait. I understood given how i wanted to be compassionate.

Well, 4 weeks later, my good friend, B, told me that T started to had other feelings for another boy, who we'll go by O. 

(Later on that week, I noticed O was constantly with T, almost everytime I actually see her. )

On Thursday last week, I asked if we still do feel the same way as before and she told me she wanted us to be friends. Which left me devasted. And made me presume that she liked O.

Till on Friday the next day, where she told me she actually didn't like anyone and what not. This left me both relieved but also distrustful. 

Yesterday I told T everything. How B told you liked someone else (which now I now think it was wrong to say) and went in depth of my jealousy with O. T told me O and her are just friends and she felt understanding, grabbing my affection again.

Unfourtanly today, my other friends told me she's been hitting up on other guys and even shown a picture of O and T holding hands with T's head on O's shoulder.

At this point, I felt lied, miserable, and wanted to forget her. I've already planned on working out now that the weather is getting better to feel better about myself. Any other ideas to help?",20Mar2019,1

I need to add , they walk a dog through there also, allowing him to bark outside my window and I sleep days and work nights and there is dog poo now.

524,"Hey all,

To keep things very brief yet informative I wanted to share a quick and unfortunate story about myself. 



I transferred to my university as a transfer student and then immediately became ill during my first semester. My illness kept me from leaving my bed in the mornings and bothered me all night but I didn't realize how severe it was until my symptoms persisted for multiple weeks. I began going to the doctor to try and find treatment as it was resulting in me missing a LOT of my classes. I couldn't help it, it was truly debilitating but in weird bursts at random times.



I ended up failing this last semester (fall 2018) and as a result got suspended for one whole academic year (cannot return until January 2020 semester). I tried to appeal and was denied. My dean was sympathetic and supported me in an attempt at a retroactive medical withdrawal. This is something that would have taken my suspension away and let me return in the Fall of 2019 (a semester early). My doctor supported me and I provided TONS of documentation to prove just how ill I was throughout the semester. This appeal was denied on the basis of ""you could have withdrawn yourself last semester and failed to do so in a timely fashion.""




That was very frustrating to hear. I get it. But I was genuinely sick. I was actually unable to go to class. I was actually seeing a doctor and still doing ALL of my homework (had an A average on all my assignments, but missed all of my finals due to being unable to get out of bed). 



I now have one last chance to come back. My dean said I am able to petition a ""committee of early returns"" with a formal letter/case explaining why I deserve to come back to school this Fall instead of serving my full suspension term. This is extremely important to me and I just want to get back to school to finally pick myself up and continue making progress. I've finally gotten better and being at home has eaten me up mentally. I've got an internship lined up for this summer and I also can still graduate on time if I'm allowed to come back this fall. If I have to go back in Spring 2020 both my academic and actual career prospects will fall devastatingly.. Does anyone know if there are consultants/lawyers/writers that could help me write the absolute best appeal possible? I don't want to drop the ball here because I failed to highlight something or wasn't polished enough..",20Mar2019,1
525," This  man molested my sister and I back in the late 1980's. In 2015 he was  accused of molesting a 7 yr old little girl, but after many calls and  conversations with the detective handling his case, he has yet to be  indicted. Probably for lack of evidence.

There  are many times when I fantasize about getting revenge on him. He got  away with what he did to us because well, in the 80's they didn't handle  these cases the same. My mother was living with and dating him at the  time. Her twisted reality kicked in full force once my sister spoke up,  and eventually she convinced my sister (14 at the time) to drop the  accusations.

After his legal troubles  seemed to disappear, he molested me again, while laughing and joking how  I ever thought it was molestation in the first place. (I was 10)

Now,  I'm 43 and have not only seen this guy around town, but know for a fact  he's a manipulative pedophile who dates single mother's, then grooms  their children for his own future perversions.

I've  done some minor things to seek some revenge, and have tried to get this  public, but that only works when your perpetrator is famous.

This  man is still vacationing (his FB has pics of him and his gf at the  beach) and dating the mother of the child he molested. I know this  because the detective, who found old files on my own case told me.

I'm  not scared of a defamation lawsuit, done my research and I have zero  worries. I just want to expose this piece of crap some how. I feel  helpless knowing he's free and still molesting after all these years.",20Mar2019,3
526,"Some background knowledge:

I'm 17M and recently had my first relationship, I was pretty sure I loved this girl. I met her at college and we attended all the same classes. We were very good friends she called me her best friend this is primarily because I waited 2 months to ask her out and we use to message all the time literally never got off the phone. We went out etc and three months later we broke up. I messaged her three days after the break up and she said I'm with my ex I always had feelings for him she still wanted to be friends but I didn't want to put myself through that. I still went to college but as she sits opposite me she continuously messaged her boy friend(he doesn't attend the college) gave me dirty looks and sent off a hateful energy (if you know what I mean). 

After a while I couldn't take it and I didn't go to college it's been over a month now and I haven't been. Sadly the college is requesting for me to come in this Monday and I don't want to see her. My father said if I go through this he would purchase me a motercycle so that's pretty much drove me to going into college. 

I dont want to see her though it's been a month and a half since the break up.

Just the fact that I’m able to post this on a mobile phone puts me above so many others, so what right do I have to even ask for advice?

I’m an attorney who makes shit money and lives paycheck to paycheck. My career resume is so pigeonholed that I literally cannot find a job anywhere. I’ve spent the last few months applying to an average of 10+ jobs a week. I’ve had two interviews. Both jobs would have changed everything; so of course I was turned down for both. I’m stuck in a shitty job that has no progress, no raises, no nothing. I’m a paper pusher. Every time I feel like I’m close to getting out, the clutches of this miserable job dig in. Has anyone made a career change before? If so, any advice on how to do that? 

Has anyone here ever up and relocated to somewhere across the country and started anew? Sometimes I feel I need that, but I don’t have a nest egg. Is it possible to do?

I just want to stop being a walking zombie. It doesn’t help I lost the love of my life a little over a month ago. I know I need to somehow get over that. I don’t know how to even do that, though. I have no support network. Most of my family is dead. I live alone in a metropolis where I have no friends. I’m not using this post to complain, I’m just laying out my factors so people know what they’re working with.

Because I’m so alone here, I can pick up and move anywhere. I have no ties. Hence me looking to maybe move out west.

530,"Tldr, $10k was stolen from my family BY a family member. I need help getting into my mother’s Facebook in order to see her messages while we work on legal action. 

So this past weekend it was discovered that almost $10,000 is missing from our family’s lockbox. My father has always kept some cash on hand, but after the death of my grandfather last year, my grandma was keeping about $12,000 in insurance money with us since she thought it would be safe (I was the only family member who didn’t know she got any money or that it was with us). My family keeps two lock boxes, but only one was know to my siblings and me. It contained important documents and a small amount of cash. It was kept in plain sight so that a burglar wouldn’t suspect a second lock box with more money. Two keys for the big money lock box exist: one on my father’s key ring, and another that went missing last year. Since a large chunk of the money was my grandmother’s, my father wants to pay her back, essentially making the loss entirely on him. 

Pretty much everyone is a suspect except me (I have my own house, so I’m seldom around their house) and my father. In order of suspicion (though either of the top two are likely) are:
-My mother [49]: last year, I caught her cheating with another man. In addition, my little sister has several screenshots indicating it was happening with other men. She recently moved back with my father, but since the start of 2019, has only spent maybe 10 days at home. She’s been out of state with “friends” the rest of the year, despite being a friendless, unemployed do-nothing. It’s very clear that she’s cheating again, but that’s hardly the problem right now. Oddly enough, she was the one who brought the missing money to my family’s attention and is hellbent on blaming my older sister. 
-My older sister [29]: compulsive liar, long history of drug and alcohol abuse, and currently living with my father again. She works as a waitress right now, but previously did assisted living for a disabled man. Over the course of her “employment,” she borrowed (took) between $30-50k from him. She has a boyfriend, but has had multiple guys coming and going from the house in recent months. She was aware of my grandmother’s insurance money being in the house. She thinks it was my mother. 
-My little sister and her boyfriend [17 / 18]: really not concerned they did it, though they (at least my little sister) were aware of my grandma’s money being stored in the house. They also seem to think it was my mother, which says a lot considering my older sister’s past problems. They’re home as often as she is, so I trust their judgement because it aligns with...
My father [48]: he thinks it was my mom. He’s a drug and alcohol counselor, so he’s good at smelling bullshit. Between the cheating, his jobs, and now this, he’s really getting his ass kicked on all sides. Because of this, he’s looking at maybe selling the house. I want to do anything I can to help the poor guy out. If I can get access to my mother’s messages, it can help seal the deal. Which leads me to...

My mother. She’s the main suspect. We’re going to obtain text records from the past week from Verizon, but it’ll take some time, money, and a subpoena. In the mean time, my sister and I have been trying to get into her Facebook to see her messages in the hope there’s something incriminating there. If not about the money, then about the cheating. I know what email she uses, and I thought if I could get into her email that I could reset the password. No luck getting past the security questions, past recipients, subject lines, etc. If I can somehow manage this, I can reset the Facebook password, get in, and see her messages. I’m currently seeing if Facebook, like Verizon, will offer any help with a subpoena, but I figured I would ask in the meantime. 

Please, if you’ve got any advice, I could really use it. My family is in the middle of a full-blown civil war. ",20Mar2019,1

545," 

Hello everyone,

I have finally pushed myself into posting here and ask you guys for help, as I am very much clueless regarding relationships. Here we go.

I like to live in a structured environment. Charts, tables, specific dates, specific time. My whole life has been one massive optimization, partially because of my parents, partially because I enjoy it. ""Do not do this, it's not effective and not the most important thing atm, so begin doing A instead, and while A will be (going through any process that doesn't require your attention and will require it in X minutes, eg. baking) you can begin working on B.""

This type of thinking has gotten me to a great point in my professional life, but has caused great pains in my personal life. Structure is a very attractive thing in business but, or so I've found, unattractive in personal life. In business I do what I consider optimal, reaching the goal is the priority after all. That's why we're working, we're trying to reach a goal here.

My personal life is the complete opposite of my business life. I do not know what I want. I do not know what I feel. I have rewritten this paragraph over 5 times, because I am very emotionally confused. I can be dominant, then submissive. I'll go against the crowd just to walk with it 10 minutes later and then go against it again. Simply put I am emotionally immature. I am a 19 year old male, that is afraid of getting a girlfriend, because he doesn't want her to experience his volatile personality. Or maybe that's just a rationalization for not getting a girlfriend.

I'll cut it here, because I very much dislike delving in my personal issues, especially on my own. If anyone has read the whole thing, congrats and thanks.

Tl;dr: I am dominant in business but a bitch in personal relationships. Then some whining.",20Mar2019,0

I tried my best on designing it but it was still a little confusing. When our teacher was going through the papers he saw that I didn’t follow the directions. I know I sometimes make mistakes, don’t follow directions, or don’t pay attention but it’s not an everyday thing. He argued with me that period saying that I did it wrong, I didn’t understand so I told him I was confused on the directions. Then he starts saying “Oh, this is my fault?” and Im like no it’s not you didn’t do anything I’m just confused, so he very angrily told me what to do and I tried doing it but since he argued with me the whole period I didn’t have any time to make any changes. Since our school really values respect and I give respect to him but I don’t feel like he gives respect to me I don’t know what to do. I feel like I should do something and since this is my elective (chosen class) I am thinking of trying to switch to a different elective (but i don’t know how) I asked my friend if you still can change electives and he said that he doesn’t think so because it’s close to the end of the year. I am also thinking of just asking my dad (because he is like my best friend and is always there for me) to call up the school and ask for me to change classes.

550,"I'm might sound confusing and if you want more details feel free to ask.  
Just to give some context as to way I'm not too bothered with the cat and what actually bothers me more.  
My parents divorced and because of that my mom stayed at the house that (mostly) her side of the family built. My dad bought an apartment with a loan. Few years back, at the time I was with my mom at the house and we got a cat from a friend and the cat lived around the house. We let him go around free to do what he wants. Later on my mom moved in to an apartment that she rented with her new boyfriend and the house was left alone (because it was 6-7Km away from the city so it was inconvenient since we didn't have a car). The cat and dog where left and one of my parents would go very day to feed them.  
Anyway, two weeks ago my cat was missing. He would often go away for good amount of the day or 2. I wasn't too worried but than week and half passed and we came to the conclusion that it was probably dead. I easily moved on because I knew it had to happen eventually and it was normal since he wasn't a house cat (we didn't even give him a name all those years). Today my died told that he thinks he found him dead near where he worked (he is in military so the location was close to the house). At that moment the realization hit me that he is actually gone.   
Now my problem is that I think I might get over it too easily. What I mean by that is that I will forget about it as I go trough the day and I mean completely forget. It was like that when he was missing for a while. I feel like I don't care enough about it. Maybe it was just my way of dealing with things like that but I think I'm way too easy with it.  
I also never experienced death of a relative or someone close and I'm scared that I'll feel similarly in that situation. ",20Mar2019,1

Firstly, my girlfriend who I think I see myself with in the future is there, and it is a much better engineering school, so I will have better job opportunities in the future. 

The only thing that is making my decision tough is the cost. The cost to go to Virginia Tech will be maybe about 10k more a year more than my parents are paying now.

Although I live the field of psych and have a general sense of what I want to do (clinical), I don’t feel like I recognize myself or even know myself well enough. I can’t answer genera questions about myself and I drop a lot of hobbies that I test out because nothing seems to captivate me anymore.

I’m drained, lost, and have no idea who I am anymore.

565,"Ok, so my boyfriend and I currently rent a 570 sq ft 1 bed apartment. We are really starting to hate it there. We pay $930-$950 for “rent”. Actual rent is $865, then add water, pest, renters insurance, and trash. They are raising the rent to $885 if we renew. I remember when we first showed up to apply, I saw a man in the office complaining about how they keep raising the rent every year. We signed the lease anyways because we had 1 week to find somewhere to live. 

I just don’t think the price is worth it for what we get. Tiny space. The walls are PAPER thin. I can hear my neighbors on all sides and below me all the time. We have no washer dryer or connections. We have to use communal washers (yes, they cost money) and it’s annoying having to make 3 trips across the apartments to the washing machines to do one load of laundry. We have a dog and whenever we leave she barks for a few minutes until she gets bored. I can hear her barking from our bedroom LOUD AND CLEAR standing on the sidewalk below my apartment. That makes me think that everyone on our fucking block can hear me and my bc fucking from the sidewalk outside. That’s ridiculous. 

Besides that, my neighbors are annoying. The people next to us are constantly banging shit on the walls, the people in front of us pray so loud we can hear it and yell about Jesus constantly. The guy next to and below us is a cross dressing constable who does weird shit like lay on his living room floor naked with the blinds open. The dude directly below us has called not once, but TWICE to complain about us playing “loud music”. We only play music on the weekends and sorry.. no matter how low the volume is, hell always hear it because the walls are so goddamn thin! Are we supposed to just not enjoy anything? I’m afraid he will call and complain about our dog. We have not paid a pet deposit or told the apartments we have her because we plan on moving in 2 months. Sorry, don’t think it’s necessary to pay a $400 deposit and then move out in 2 months and owe someone else a deposit too. We can’t sit on the balcony for 2 minutes without 5 people driving by, car doors slamming and cars locking, people walking by, etc. I know my fucking neighbor brings like 3 people a day to his apartment to hook up because his building is RIGHT across from ours. Like... there’s 0 privacy. 

So we are thinking of getting a roommate and upsizing to a 1,144 sq ft 2 bed 2 bath in a nicer complex. The roommate would be my boyfriends coworker. She’s really chill and laid back, she comes over and hangs out sometimes and I hang out with her without my boyfriend so it has become more of a friends situation than her just being a coworker. We all liked the complex we toured together last weekend, the rent is within our range. I used to be totally against roommates, but I think for the sake of having more space, privacy, and nicer amenities, it will be worth it. The balcony was facing a field and a walkway, I heard literally no noises while I was in the apartment or on the balcony. When me and my boyfriend were in what would be our room, we couldn’t hear the other people talking in the other room. Nice. This apartment has washer dryer included. Something that I now consider a requirement. 

-Do you think we would have trouble adjusting to living with a roommate after living alone for a year? We have dealt with roommates before, it didn’t seem to be an issue in the past, but that was college and we weren’t paying bills. 

-how should we split the utilities, WiFi, and groceries? Rent will be split even. Should groceries be a separate for us and her? 

-now, for pets. When we toured the property I stupidly told the leasing agent our dog is 35 lbs not knowing they have a weight limit of 20 lbs.. seriously who’s dog is that small. That’s barely bigger than a cat. Anyways, she asked if we would be bringing the dog (obviously they wouldn’t allow it) so I lied and said no. Would it work to tell them upon applying that we got a different dog who is under 20 lbs? Or if she doesn’t ask about the previous dog, I’ll just lie and say our dog is under 20 lbs. but she wrote it down that the dog was 35 lbs and then wrote that I said we aren’t bringing the dog. No way I’m leaving my dog behind. My friends who live there say they see German shepherds there all the time. If they have a breed restriction against dogs mixed with pit bull I guess I will have to lie about that too. She literally is shorter than my kneecap and is the sweetest dog ever.

I realize she’s a virgin and me being one too I freak out and we go to the bathroom to washing it off. Then it hits us that we cheated on our s.o.’s in the worst possible way and we’re yelling at each other that we won’t ever talk again or mention this to anyone (I’m only posting this because I won’t name anyone) I get my clothes on as quickly as possible while she screams at me to get out and storm off to my apartment and get in the shower scrubbing myself down completely and stuffing my bloodstained clothes deep in my dirty laundry. I quickly call a friend and confide in her all that happened (she’s a friend to me and my girlfriend) and she tries to reassure me it’ll be okay and that we won’t tell my girlfriend ever.

Last summer, my brother had gone to my dad to disclose the fact that he was going to attempt suicide. My dad immediately took him to a hospital, and he stayed overnight in inpatient services for about a month. During his time, he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, as well as a type of eating disorder that’s attributed to the fear of gaining weight. My brother has an extreme fear of gaining weight, and whenever he would eat too much he would purge. For the next six weeks after coming back home, he would go back to the hospital five days a week up until they felt he was ready to go off without any medical assistance. 

After coming home from school today, I heard something strange from his room. After some investigation, I’m positive he was purging. Recently, my brother has been showing signs of relapse but I wasn’t sure up until now. I am aware I should probably tell my dad, as he’s the one that closely monitors him, but I’m afraid that if my dad confronts him about it it’ll push the tension that’s already there too far and he’ll hurt himself or even kill himself. I’m terrified of doing something wrong, and I have no clue what to do. 

I understand this might be a common issue or something along those lines, but this is becoming more and more real for me. I talked to him and asked if he was okay, but he said he was fine and told me to leave him alone. He and my dad get into arguments a lot, and I don’t want to have them end up crossing the lines.

We're all friends now and I have no problem with U. 
Whenever we hang out and in our group chats U normally responds to my comments or jokes with a really sarcastic comment back. She's a sarcastic person anyway but i feel like i get a lot more of these comments than anyone else in the group. 
I wouldn't call the comments malicious or like personal attacks or anything but i can't help but get the feeling she does mean a little harm by them. 

I would consider that U and I get along quite well. I think she's very witty and smart and i enjoy when we all hang out together. But these remarks sour it a little for me. 

I don't want to call her out and i don't want to start any petty arguments or bad feelings. 

I just want to know what's the best way to respond? Should i ignore them completely/take them as if they were sincere and she means the complements/ throw some back?

I really just don't know which direction to go in, but I can't stay stagnant any longer.

577,"I have a very close friend who was in and out of foster homes, was sexually abused, beaten, and forced to take drugs form the age of 7-19 by her older brother and father.  She has made such a great person of herself by overcoming the awful things that has happened to her.  However, 2 weeks ago a video was found of her older brother doing awful things to her.  This video is shown on tons of different porn sites with mostly the same titles and was uploaded almost a decade ago.  In the 3 clips (one video), she is age 15, 16, and 17.  Needless to say she is devastated.  So much that she's expressed giving into suicide.  I've flagged and reported as many of the sites as I can found and have reported to CyperTip Report.

579,"Me and my soon to be wife are capped on 200k€ mortgage for at least few years, up to 5. There’s a 3-bed house in very popular area that would use great as investment property as well as living spave. With our current earnings and earnings from renting empty rooms we could cash out this mortgage within 6-10 years. Should we go in and do it or not. (This would require taking personal loan and private loan to top up the deposit) We would’t stay here forever but we would always have nice cashfow from this is how I am thinking. The rent we pay is same as mortgage. Double room rent here is ~750€. Its an easy rent.

1. She told me she liked being on top but when she got on top she clearly had no idea what to do.

2. She told me I was the biggest she’s had but I’m average to slightly below average in that department.

3. She told me she’s never tried doggy before and kept telling me to stop and give her a sec when I started to get a rhythm going.

She actually gave pretty good head so maybe she’s got more experience there idk. But my question is how do I help her make it better. We’ve hooked up a few times and I feel more comfortable maybe giving her some tips next time lol

590,"So, in an incredible stroke of luck, a girl asked me out. I really like her a lot but as the title says I think I might have made a mistake in ending the relationship. In lieu of getting into the specifics I'll share what I'm comfortable with sharing and I'll try to stay unbiased. So I was initially really skeptical of the relationship because I know that I am bad at them and I don't trust people. Cut to the other night, we were talking on discord and she says that she's talking to a guy we met on Snapchat and that she really likes his dog. I already didn't like the guy when we met him because she started acting weird around him so I guess I felt threatened. But, after a while she asks my opinion on nudes, I said I have no real preference either way, if she's comfortable with it feel free but don't feel obligated. This goes on and she showed me a pic. Shortly afterwards she said that she just accidentally sent that to someone. I took this as ""I just sent that to (name)"", she gave no indication of who she sent it to and it turns out it was to her best friend. Shortly after she said that she just got a dick pic from the same guy and showed me an wanted me to screenshot it for her. This is when I got upset but I didn't say anything and I just came up with an excuse to leave and think for a bit. I decided that between this and the inconveniences in some stories she's told I just couldn't trust her anymore and I ended things. I tried to be mature about things and sent

""This is all probably a mistake but I just don't know what to do. I'm sorry I left tonight so sporadically I just needed some time to think about this and not be so irrationally furious. I don't think this whole thing's going to work. Between what happened tonight and then the inconsistencies I found in stories from you I just don't think I can trust you anymore. You say you'd never cheat but you sent me a tinder profile while you still with your ex and the day after you rant to me about him and how he cheated and you would never cheat, you say in discord ""he cheated on me but that's okay because I cheated on him and he doesn't know"" who's to say you won't do the same to me? That coupled with the way you treat me and I just don't want to deal with that either. I put up with this treatment because I thought you were a nice girl with a great personality just a little bit in the wrong headspace. I see now I was wrong. If you didn't truly want a relationship then why would you even ask. I just don't understand. You don't accidentally send that to someone I know the steps on how to send picture from your gallery and its hard to accidentally do that, I'm not that dumb. And then the audacity to make the requests afterwards. I just can't. The fucking audacity to do it with me in a call too, Jesus, (name) if you don't want a relationship just say so because I know I don't, not if shit like this happens. If you want to talk about this like adults we can tomorrow but I'm not sure what there is to discuss I'm not going to block you or anything I just don't think that we're both fully committed to this relationship. I know being friends after something like this is hard but I don't hate you and I'm not opposed to staying friends. I just don't know what to do or say anymore.""

It took some time but when I got a response it was a lot all at once. I was in class and couldn't respond because if I'm on my phone the professor will drop my letter grade. But I took the hit because I quickly saw something about ""nothing to live for"" and I don't want anything bad to happen to her, I still very much like this girl as a person. I gave a quick response and I tried to explain that I will give a better explanation of my feelings when I get out of class. I did this as soon as I got home, just things along the lines of I still like her as a person and I don't have any hard feelings after hearing her side of the story. We planned on taking about it later but the time came and went and i was told that she was studying, it's finals for her so I let it go and understood that school is more important. We rescheduled for today or tomorrow. Today I sent an apology explaining that I overreacted and I understand if she doesn't want to speak to me again. I know that I hurt her and I feel terrible but I just don't know how to express that sentiment in a better way. She lives halfway across the US so I can't realistically tell her in person but it all seems so fake when I say it through a screen.

Ultimately the question is how can I express that I'm sorry for hurting her. It all seems fake through a screen but I really do mean it",20Mar2019,1
591,"I'm 23M, I met her in an online game community. I'm a Moderator of this game and she's working under me. The first time I met her (virtually), I admired her matured mindset and perspective in handling complicated cases. She's independent yet not. She lives just a few meters away from her direct family. She lives alone and has the freedom to do anything because no one is limiting her. Fast forward, I fell in love with her and she reciprocated it. We shared ""i love yous"", stayed super late just to talk and know each other. We're like a couple but without label. I know for myself she's the one. She has the qualities I really admire. Matured. Open-minded. Intelligent and we really get along well.
So again, just an addition, this online game has a 'group system' where she's part of a certain group. So, there's this 17 year old kid that has a crush on her. I appreciate her honesty and opened it up to me. Well, it'a pretty obvious. So, she usually play with this kid late night until dawn - early morning (5-6am) She's aware of his feelings but saying that she don't take it seriously since that kid is too young for her. And, she's playing with him because she enjoyed his company and has freedom to choose which character to play. She's always telling me that he's just a kid. And, I'm here felt uncomfortable with the current setting. When I tried playing with them (us 3), she told me that I should temporarily stop calling her ""Love"" (its our endearment) because it might hurt the feelings of the kid. And, here I am, so understanding or stupid followed her own selfishness because I love her.

 But, I witnessed how she treat him. She treats him like someone so special; saying I love you and so proud of him. Which she can't give to me. She's always saying we shouldn't make our relationship public because it might affect my image  or she'll be bashed because I'm a known public figure of this game (given I'm a Moderator). I'm just conflicted what to feel. We have already talked about this and she said she loves me truly. She's investing to me because we're already old. That she wants to enjoy this freedom because once she's in an official relationship or we got married her behaviors will be restricted. But, I'm so afraid that she might fall in love with this kid. Considering, they are always playing everyday while I'm sleeping soundly because I can't sleep too late anymore. I don't know if love blinded me already. I have already given her all my sincerest understanding. She's saying that she's having a hardtime adjusting we're a miles away from each other (considered LDR) but I can go at her home in 1-2 hours travel. We're still not yet official. We're just saying I love yous. 

I don't know what to do or what to feel about this. We've already talked about this, she said I just need to trust her and she's not doing anything over the line. But, this whole situation is messed up on my perspective. Why would she even entertain someone regardless of age when she already have me? That's one big question mark for me. She's asking for understanding. She's telling me I understand her. And don't want to take advantage of me but SHE'S ALREADY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MY OPENESS AND UNDERSTANDING. She's telling me that I'm an investment for both our future. She's serious with me. But, I don't really get it. I'm so confused. Can you guys please share your opinion to this. I need some clear enlightenment. ",20Mar2019,1
592,"Let me start this off by saying I am under 18, so to any older users this may seem like pointless drama, but I’ve been told by many people including adults that some of the stuff happening to me is illegal.

There is this kid at my school, and he had a crush on me. I politely declined because I didn’t like him, and I’m not that into guys. We stayed friends. He asked me out again, I declined again. After the second time, he continued to try to flirt with me and harass me in some attempt to get me to like him.

After one of my friends telling him this made me uncomfortable, he flipped. He made a few reddit posts (no, you cant see them) not using any of my personal information but if you knew me personally it would be easy to know who he’s talking about.

He went on a few rants, I responded explaining what happened, and tried to calm the situation down. This spiraled off into a huge argument. I tried to end the argument by ceasing to respond.

After this, he posted several poems written about me (very creepy) and a few more rants. Still I did not respond, although I had a friend ask him to drop it and leave me alone and stop posting about me. I also blocked him.

He agreed and said he would leave me alone. He has not. Instead, he has continued to harass and insult me on my religion, gender identity and sexuality (I’m bisexual and transgender) and, this morning, spammed every one of my comments.

He has made several comments about my genetalia and how surgeries for my dysphoria are mutilating, has called me many slurs, and even told me my dad was justified in verbal abuse. The situation is ongoing. He refuses to leave me alone.

He has also screenshotted several comments I’ve made and posted them on some joke subs without my permission.

I want to tell my school what’s going on so I can get him to leave me alone, but that might out me to my parents so I haven’t. The situation has gotten so bad though, that telling my school might be my only option since no matter how many times I tell him to leave me alone and stop harassing me, he still responds.

One of the messages I sent him literally says “leave me the fuck alone and stop responding to all my comments.” He had admitted that he understood I no longer wished for him to contact me, and stated that he wasn’t going to listen.

If you need any more in depth details or screenshots of things he has said, feel free to comment and I will answer any questions/provide evidence (personal info covered, of course.) I’ve read that the comments about my orientation and gender constitute as hate speech and that him continuing to harass me is sexual harassment due to comments about my genitals.

I just don’t know what to do and I’m sick of this whole situation.

Also, even if I do tell my school, there’s a high chance this kid is going to get away with it because he has autism, despite him admitting he full well understands what he’s doing is wrong and continuing to not listen to me. ",20Mar2019,1
593,"So for some background, I’m pretty fresh out of college (less than 2 years) and I’m at a job with VERY flexible hours, great pay, great benefits and a really good work/life balance. The issue is that I absolutely despise it. The other issue is that I have a one year old child and another baby on the way. So I really need the flexibility, the good pay, and the benefits....even if I find somewhere with equivalent pay, finding somewhere with those benefits AND that flexibility will be nearly impossible.

But the job is draining the life out of me. It’s very easy—but that makes me unmotivated. I constantly put off tasks until they can’t be put off anymore, and then I half ass them and don’t give it my all. I feel depressed most of the time when I’m at work and just generally hate the boring monotony of it. 

What should I do? Suck it up for the sake of the perks? Look for something else and risk instability right when I need the most stability? Try and make the most of it by finding ways to get on top of my tasks, get organized, and be a rockstar at a job I hate? I don’t know what to do. I’m honestly not sure if it’s even the job itself or if I’d really hate any office job. Ugh.

595,"So this is my first time using this page and I wondering if there is anyone who has been in this predicament before or would be willing to help. My best friend (age 22) is currently single after being broken up up with his girlfriend, also this is his first major girlfriend, they have been on and off for 2 1/2 years. This is the second time that she has broken up with him, the first time being because of their 2 year age difference, and this time, his words, ""She wants to work on finding who she is and what she wants without using a boyfriend as her definition of herself and the person to fall back on."" This raised some red flags for me because I found this to be an invalid reason to break up with someone because our relationships with others are heavily used and influence us in our development as human beings. I would have been fine with this if it stopped there but, the plot thickens. 2 weeks after this ""break-up"" they make a video online for their youtube channel that give viewers the idea that they are still together, and when I asked him about this he said, ""We are not dating but we talked more about getting back together and we’re definitely closer as people. We decided that we are both going to write the other a letter outlining the things the other needs to improve on and ourselves too, so that if we date again we’re not dealing with some problems that we encountered prior. I did stay over last night and on Saturday and we say “love you” so it’s definitely not a clear answer of yes or no haha. It’s complicado."" To me it seems like a lot of work for someone who has broken your heart twice. The final part of this saga comes when he tells her that she is moving to Florida and wants to follow her there. He says that, ""I’m still considering moving down there If it’s possible in any way because I’d want to be with her even if it means working a crappy job."" Im all for following your heart but i just don't want to see him get his heart broken for a third time and I let him know that I support him and his decision and that he shouldn't take her breaking up with him as a brush off. So I guess I am asking what would be the best way to let him know that I think he should move on or what you would recommend i do in this situation.

598,"(Throwaway)
This is no big deal, like it's not a major life,  death or prison scenario. 

There's a girl (U) in my circle of friends. She used to be best friends with my best friend (P) but they fell out a couple of years ago around the time I met P. 

We're all friends now and I have no problem with U. 
Whenever we hang out and in our group chats U normally responds to my comments or jokes with a really sarcastic comment back (e.g.""OMG, you are absolutely HIL. AR. IOUS."" but without so much as a smile) 
She's a sarcastic person anyway but i feel like i get a lot more of these comments than anyone else in the group. 
I wouldn't call the comments malicious or like personal attacks or anything but i can't help but get the feeling she does mean a little harm by them. 

I would consider that U and I get along quite well. I think she's very witty and smart and i enjoy when we all hang out together. But these remarks sour it a little for me. 

I don't want to call her out and i don't want to start any petty arguments or bad feelings. 

I just want to know what's the best way to respond? Should i ignore them completely/take them as if they were sincere and she means the complements/ throw some back?

601,"My life is suddenly fast paced and it feels like I’m oddly numb to my surroundings.I have so much going on and It feels almost nothing is being processed and I am very apathetic about the whole operation.

I have had a very lackadaisical and lacking life for the longest time. Rough upbringing and an odd childhood that left me with an awful mindset and self esteem. However, I’ve accepted the reality that it’s upon me to make any changes to my life, and took matters into my own hands.

I firstly started constructing routines. Morning and bed time. Getting into healthy habits. Focusing on my priorities and doing them before anything else, as much as I possibly good. 

It’s all going well, it feels good. I see visible progress. My grades, my social skills are greatly improving, I am making effort to make friends and maintain a degree of bonding with people. But still. It isn’t right.

Mum was diagnosed with cancer and it’s all too soon to know anything just yet. I also ended an odd relationship that was somewhat toxic and I genuinely loved the person. And I a constantly battling all these inner negative thoughts and just push through and keep going to keep up my progress. 

It all leaves me feel so worn out and drained, I don’t know what to do. All of it. the studying. The enjoyable socialising event. Working out. Positive habits. It all feels like so much effort. I am doing it because I want to be normal. I want to be okay and happy.

Staying home all day on video games and shows never did me any good either. It was comfortable, but it never left me feeling fulfilled

I just don’t know what the next step is. 

How do I balance a healthy life a healthy emotional state and not feel so burnt out all the time? How do people do it? It feels so mentally exhausting.

602,"So I just moved into my grandmothers for 10 months while I go to school. I brought a lot more stuff than I expected but it’s mostly because I had a lot more clothes than I thought I had. My grandma has a... spacial issue. I wouldn’t say she’s a hoarder because most of it isn’t hers but she still doesn’t get rid of it. I moved into my aunts old room and she kept it as a guest room/store some clothes/ throw random crap in. There is 2 dressers and a closet, and two medium sized bed side tables with small drawers. So she asked if the one dresser was enough, I said maybe this dresser is bigger than the one I had at home but I will have to see. She said I could also use the closet. She didn’t say I couldn’t use both end tables but she made me leave an abhorrent amount of old TV guides in one because “they’re your fathers”. Now I cleaned out the one dresser and I haven’t put all my clothes away yet but with the dresser and the closet I don’t need to put any clothes in the other dressers. But I brought some supplies for school and some other things to occupy me while here for 10 months (DVD’s, books, some decos but not many) and I also have my daily care stuff as well.  Don’t like having a bunch of stuff on my surfaces unless they’re decorations, and I like my room to be tidy because I don’t like my space to feel crowded with random crap. So I emptied the three bigger drawers in one of the dressers, and I was going through to organize the rest of her things so they fit better. But she came in while I was doing so and got upset seeing her books out. They were placed on the bed and all together. They all slid out of their piles cause their old thick paperbacks that grandmas read. She said she doesn’t like her books being thrown around. I said I was just cleaning the drawers so Things would fit better and I could use the extra drawer space for the rest of my things. I even messaged my dad earlier and asked if her wanted the TV guides and he said no, then she said “oh I just keep the ones with the pictures of people I like”....? Um I thought you didn’t want to throw them out cause they were dads? Then later on when I was putting some more of my decorations out, on the dresser she said I could use mind you, and she comes in and says, “what are you gonna do with my bowl that was on here?” I said I was going to put it on one of the small tables in the room because I didn’t really want it in the room but I didn’t want to upset her more. She said I couldn’t put it there. So I said I’d put it on the other dresser and she said fine. Then as she was leaving she said “I’m not happy that you went through that other dresser, you said you didn’t need it. Now I don’t know where to put all this crap.” I just said yup and she left. I’m not the greatest at confronting my family but I don’t want her to walk all over me. She said I could live with her and said I could have the room. I said I wasn’t sure if I needed the other drawer and I would have to figure it out as I went. I just feel like she doesn’t want me here because I can’t put my stuff anywhere.

She teaches in district 150 in Illinois, it’s a poor district. The students are poor, a lot don’t have role models.As a teacher isn’t she supposed to educate these young kids in academics and life? She never tried helping this kid. Kayla then goes on to say “it’s the same as rape” and “this is what the me too movement is all about”. Shes “lost sleep for weeks because she’s traumatized by this predator”. Yet she does the same shit to me! She’s done it way too many times to me. 

I confront her about it and she says I’m a guy so I wouldn’t understand. I think she is sending this kid down a bad path. His mostly likely not well off family is gonna have to pay court fees they can’t really afford. I’ve tried to get get to drop it but she won’t. Her friends can’t get any sense into her. Is there anything I can do to try and help his kid not get charged?

607,"So I went to a rap concert last night and it was at a smaller venue where it was standing room only. Me and my friend were very close to the front, and standing next to us were two girls and the one directly next to me was really cute. While we were waiting for the show to start my friend kept pointing out how he swears the girls were looking at me but the pre-show music playing was really loud so I couldn’t talk to them at all. Once the concert started the cute girl got really close to me and was dancing even though she had a decent amount of room in front of her. Also she left before the last song and as she was leaving she put one hand on my arm and the other on my chest to support her getting through the crowd. I get that it was a packed venue but it just seemed very intentional. I didn’t get a chance to talk to her at all, because the show was extremely loud and she left before it was over and I didn’t see her outside. My question is, would it be creepy to post on this artists subreddit looking for this girl? I have a feeling it would be weird but I have no idea. 

TL;DR saw a really cute girl at a concert, want to find a way to contact her by posting on artists subreddit ",20Mar2019,1
608,"So recently my step-mom has bought a computer set up over $1000 for my step brother (I hold no ill will towards him) for his birthday. I have been asking for laptops well under $800 for about 3 years now. Cause she dropped and broke my laptop while I was at school. Yet I tried to buy my brother's old one and she told him not too cause they could sell it online for a good $100. (I was offering him $150 for it)

Now, I do admit the laptop still functions but it needs to not be moved a single inch or else the screen will fall forward. The hinge is also snapped in two and I have to lift the screen and place the hinges together and then lay the screen over them if I want it to even stand.

It isn't like I got it recently either. I have well had this laptop for 5 years and it had no problems until one day I came home to find it like this. I confronted her and she played it off like it was my fault I left it under my bed and my fault she picked it up carried it around the house and dropped it in the kitchen.

I really don't know what to do. I don't have enough money to buy one fully by myself and there isn't any places near me u can work at (Stores are about a 2 hour bike ride away).I do chores.

612,"To start I recently was diagnosed with anxiety and that makes a lot of sense because I feel like I suffered from it during my first years of college which made me struggle in classes. I took 4 years to get a two year degree and then ended up changing my major which set me back even more. Now I’m 24 with at least two more years of school taking classes online to appease my anxiety.

I’ve always felt like getting married and having kids was my top priority. But man relationships have really kicked my ass. My first ever girlfriend was depressed and manic, threatened to cut herself everytime we fought. I stayed with her and she dumped me. My next girlfriend probably the most sane one went away to school and the distance and my anxiety caused us to fight a lot. She dumped me, I was heartbroken. But then the next summer she came home and we became friends with benefits, then she left again and said we are done permanently, I was heartbroken again. Finally my last ex, I was head over heels for her, but she put me in really shitty spots. She recently admitted she never got ever her ex before dating me. She dumped me. Talked to her ex, but then got back with me. Dumped me again. Came back as friends with benefits but then one day just wanted nothing to do with me, and now I’m figuring she’s with someone else.

Like I said I want to get married more than anything, so I guess that’s why I let these girls walk all over me. But I honestly feel so hopeless that I’ll never find anyone, I let them do it. I feel like if my last ex texted me now I’d take her back even though i know it’s wrong.

Given my anxiety, my school situation, and my hopeless love life I just don’t know how to move forward. I’m struggling. I feel like this is going to be my life forever.",20Mar2019,1

I have an interview for a serving job (Job B) in 2 days. It’s a big restaurant in the city where I would get amazing tips. I would like to have to both jobs, but don’t know how I’d keep them sorted out. 

Do I tell each employer I’m only available on certain days? Or certain times every day? Since Job B will probably pay more, at least until I advanced some in Job A, I think I’d like most of the hours to be there.

615,"It’s kind of a long story, ever since I started working my retail job I haven’t been around to see any of my friends really as much as they, or one in particular, would like. Now mind you age ranges involved here are 31 (me) and soon to be 29 (her).

I also have a pretty severe anxiety disorder and depression. I’m not on medication currently, just therapy. I’m not unopen to meds just to throw that out there. Over the past year my anxiety has turned itself towards our friendship. Her not understanding that I have things going on and it’s nothing personal and getting shitty with me about it makes my anxiety think she hates me. Every time this happens I have to sit and exert a lot of mental willpower so to speak to fight these feelings. I’ve asked her to work with me, to check on me more because when the depression hits I won’t reach out sometimes and again it’s nothing personal, and she will for a time then it goes back to what it’s been. I should also mention my friend has an almost 3 year old daughter who likes seeing me and is close to me. In one of our conversations my friend and I had about all of this she implied I didn’t come around because of her daughter and that really hurt. I’m not that type of person. I don’t come around because I have a lot of things going on. My friend is surrounded by kids (her sister has 3 kids, she’s watched two friend’s kids for an extended amount of time) I don’t understand why she would think her actual flesh and blood child would be the one out of that brood that would make me say “yup fuck you don’t want to be around you because I hate kids.” I went from a horrible full time position to voluntarily stepping down (taking a major loss of pay because of it, in terms of hours) to go back to school doing an accelerated medical assistant program, I also stepped down because the job wasn’t working out and wasn’t worth the stress I was enduring. Every three weeks while I’m in school, until my externship, I’ll either be taking a midterm or final. I only have one day a week where I don’t work or go to school and that is reserved for chores, errands and just general rest as I am exhausted by the end of the week usually.

It all hit a head back in February. My dad was in town and I had a tire needing repair. I had called my mechanic to set up an appointment for that Saturday to have it taken care of. She calls me Friday and asks if her and her daughter could come over to see my cats on Saturday because she loves my cats. I said I had to get my car taken care of but afterwards yes. Saturday rolls around and I take my car out, it took way longer than I thought for them to address my car, and while I’m waiting for the car to be done my dad starts showing the signs of bronchitis. So I finally get home, get him settled and in all honesty completely forgot about our plans. I didn’t remember about them until 2 days later. I sent her a text profusely apologizing (I sent a text because I was on my way to work and didn’t have the time for a long conversation) and explained my car took forever, my dad is sick so they wouldn’t have been able to come over Saturday anyway, and that I just plain forgot and said I was more than happy to come over the next day since I had off work and see them. My friend never answered me. I started to go through the same cycle I always go through of freaking out and thinking of how I can make it up to her and then just thought “I’m sick and tired of feeling like this. I’m not perfect, I have a lot going on with mental illness on top of it. I’m trying to get my life together and truly be happy and I’m tired of answering to someone who doesn’t seem to want to understand that.” I was also pretty mad because she could’ve picked her phone up and texted me asking if we were still on. In the past she’s done shit like this to me before (making plans then never letting me know anything, or hours and hours later saying she can’t do them, or me having to text and ask are we still on) and I’ve never held it against her. When she got married and moved out of state for a year I wholeheartedly supported her as much as I didn’t want to see her go. I feel like I’m on a one way street with her. I’m tired of it. I’m ready to let the friendship go, and we’ve been friends since I was 7 and she was 5. But I’m tired of my anxiety being triggered because I’m not perfect. I’m not excusing me forgetting our plans that isn’t cool at all but I’m human and shit happens. 

The other day her daughter called me and she said “mommy we need to talk to nukevelvet now” and her mom hung the phone up. She gets mad I’m not around and her daughter misses me then hangs the phone up.

I’m really perturbed now because she posted a “vague” post on Facebook the other day that was basically aimed at me about how she doesn’t understand how someone can just ignore a child and she’s tired of having to make excuses for people when her kid is hurt. I really had to refrain myself from calling her and chewing her out over it. She makes me out to be the worst friend ever when I’ve been there for EVERYTHING. All of her other close friends have either dropped out of her life permanently or temporarily then eventually came back and I’ve never done that until now and it’s because I’m working and in school, her friends have done it over drugs and piece of shit men. I’ve lent money out that I didn’t have or didn’t want to lend, I’ve never hounded her for it back she’ll pay me when she pays me. My dad loaned her a large sum of money and I’ve fought with him defending her when he’s gotten pissed about the situation, and in some of the situations my dad was completely in the right. For every one of the highest highs and the lowest lows I’ve been there. She owes me $400 now for my birthday present from a year ago. I don’t say anything. She’s said things that have truly hurt me over a lot of things, things that cut me like a knife, that I’ve never been able to address because of my anxiety disorder. I feel like a friend shouldn’t be triggering symptoms and making them worse. She’s usually a huge chunk of my appointments with my therapist and whenever I get back on track and am starting to do good and manage everything better she comes along and does something like this and it unravels. A friend shouldn’t be toxic. 

My anxiety was so bad at one point, the job I have now is my first job (I’ve had it for a year). I just started driving ~2 years ago. All the things I want in life I am finally feeling able to achieve. I want a career that is fulfilling, I want to meet a man and settle down, I want a child of my own. I’m pouring everything I have into school in particular because I want this. I NEED this. I expected more understanding from her, more support. Not childishness. We’re not 15 anymore. I have some friendships with people I deeply care about where we only speak for about a week, don’t speak for months, then pick back up like we talked yesterday. Cause we have lives and things to do. 

I’m posting this because I want other people’s opinions. I feel that I am right but I am questioning myself. I know there will be people with possibly the same experience that may read this, mother’s and women without children who can offer me insight. Maybe give me a different way of thinking. I also know the best thing to do will be to talk to her, I’m working myself up to that, I have a hard time communicating. It’s something I’ve been actively trying to work on. To be honest though I really don’t even want to talk to her. I’ve been through verbal and mental abuse from a past relationship and I have become very protective of my peace and self worth and I cut him out of my life quick and would have no problem in the end doing it to her if she keeps negatively impacting my peace, which right now she is.

I just want some opinions first. Help me kinda organize my thoughts since I’m pretty mad and they’re all over the place.

I also want to add, there’s also a lot of tension in her house. I’ll come home from seeing her and her family and sometimes will literally be trembling from the amount of tension and anxiety I feel from being around it. I think that’s some of what is fueling this too.",20Mar2019,1

617,"I go to a small barber school about half an hour away from where I live and to be honest I’ve been having trouble finding a little motivation. I go to school from Tuesday-Saturday from 9am to 3pm. 

Just a little background 
From kindergarten to about freshmen year of high school I’ve had near perfect attendance. Sophomore year I discovered weed and dropped acid once. Needless to say, dropping lsd changed me as a person. I’ve became more self aware , able to think for myself, and cared less about everything unimportant (like drama and the latest trends) I started to question everything and I didn’t care about anything unless it affected me. It made me realize not to take anything for granted and especially my time here on earth. So I started skipping classes in high school. I graduated somehow. I took a couple classes at a community college and still found difficulty in attending as I was not interested in any of the classes I was taking. I also did not have a career in mind. I was going to class to just go to class. 

I wanted to be a film director since freshmen year. Due to family issues I needed to find a career FAST that I didn’t mind doing as a day job whilst still pursuing entering the film industry and I fell in love with barbering. Now to get your barber license in Illinois you need 1500 hours before you could take a state board exam. I’ve been at school for about 3 months and go to school for about 30 hours each week. I have around 200-300 hours right now. My school has only been open for 2 years and there are barely any customers to practice on that come through. If they do come through they go to the other students because they’re more experienced. I just can’t stay motivated. I’m there for hours a day doing nothing. My brain needs stimulation. I try to keep myself busy. I journal, play word puzzles, talk to my classmates, watch them cut. I just feel like I’m not learning anything and only there for the hours. I learn more by cutting my friends outside of school and learning from my mistakes. I didn’t go today and my teacher texted me saying we need to talk about my attendance. 

Whoever read this thank you for listening. I probably sound like a little kid complaining, but any advice is welcome. ",20Mar2019,1

He asked her if she’d like to talk once a month. He wants to talk in secret. I got upset the other day when she called him cause she used to harass me. 

She would die to be with him but he refuses. 

He also said he’s confused about what he wants to do with his life and where he wants to go and that he is satisfied for now in his life but he can see himself getting very bored with it later on. He told her he wants to change some things in his life and he doesn’t see himself being happy where he is for long.

He declined to talk to her this time but said he’d want to discuss those details later once he got it all sorted out in his head.

I am a 20 y/o F, living with my parents, younger brother and grandmother. I am currently dating a guy, also 20.

I’ve told my two best friends from high school and my younger brother, and boyfriend knows. I’m not shy about it at all, but I just don’t necessarily feel the need to tell my parents. I don’t think they would react negatively, they probably won’t care at all, I just don’t think it’s important to bring up as I’m currently dating a guy and honestly might end up marrying him. 

Is it important to share my preferences at this point? Obviously if I break up with my current bf and ever date a girl I’d tell them, but should I do it now? I’m not not sure if it totally matters tbh

626,"Hello everyone and thanks for taking the time to check this out. I've worked for myself the better part of the last decade, running a company and generally avoiding being the interviewee. Recently I've been applying for jobs in tech side of corporate America, as a way to grow my income and diversify - it's terrifying since I don't have a squeaky clean history.

I had a few misdemeanor mistakes in my past, marijuana violations (possession and a disorderly conduct was written up as such, no selling always possession in non-rec legal states) but the worst is an Assault on Female that occurred 10 years ago. I have to say that it looks WAY worse on paper than what actually happened. In reality, I grabbed someones wrists in an attempt to stop an argument (hey! calm down! sort of intention), this made the argument way worse, police officer saw. End of story. No strikes or anything ever occurred, not that what I did was ok - by any means, but charges were still filed and there it sits on my record as the biggest mistake of my life. The 'victim' even feels like it was blown out of proportion and wants to help remove it..if that matters. The most recent incident (weed, disorderly) was about 4-5 years ago. I haven't even had a parking ticket since then. My entire life is set up in Colorado because here, in this state, everything I do abides by the law.

My original plan was to just lay out my history for an employer whenever they finally mention 'background check', but I also don't want to out myself and make a bad impression if it's not going to show up. I'm torn between being brutally honest and also saving face. ANY advice is more than appreciated. I'd love to remove this massive stain from my history if at all possible.

627,"Throwaway just because my wife knows my Reddit account, and I don't want to cause her needless worry.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working for a great nonprofit organization for five years. I earn $52K annually--which I consider fantastic for my area, for my age, and for my lack of a degree--and the benefits are remarkable. The work culture is great, I get along with everyone I work with, and I'm not being treated unfairly by any means. Despite that, I cannot shake a very real, very pressing urge to throw it all out the window and quit. I don't know if I'm depressed, or what, but nothing about my situation feels right to me. Despite it being secure, and treating me well financially, I am not content with it. I feel extremely unhappy at work. It has been affecting my productivity, and I notice I'm no longer giving it my all at work; my peers have taken notice as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I'm not able to pin why I'm discontent with my situation, I guess. It's not like I'm working for someone's private pocket--I work for an organization with a good mission. It's not like I'm being harassed or bullied by coworkers--I'm treated well and get along with everyone. Asking for others' perspectives, they say this sounds like the dream job to them. And when I hear that, I think there must be something wrong with me since I'm feeling the way I am. I even work with my wife. (She makes more money than I do, and if I were to quit, we would be able to stay afloat comfortably.) But despite all that I get a sinking feeling in my stomach when I walk into work, and I just feel like I'm doing nothing with my life. As ridiculous as it may sound, I feel like a failure somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what advice I'm asking for here, exactly. I guess, do you think it would be unwise to act on the urge to quit? Unhealthy? I feel like if I walk away, I could take some time to spend thinking about what I truly want. Maybe go back to school. But then I would be placing some burden and pressure on my wife to stay put where she is. Perhaps it's worth mentioning that we have no kids, although I desperately want kids and she's not ready yet.

I work as a personal care assist for a family for their daughter who has severe disabilities, leading her to need constant care. I love my job and the family is nice but sometimes it's hard. I'm basically a part of their family structure three days a week, and I see both sides of every situation. This week the mom was away for a couple days because her grandmother is dying. While she gone her husband drank (he has problems with alcohol) and then the next day didn't send their son to school because he fell back asleep. He moved around their furniture and when I got there he stayed in bed only coming out when I asked him to. Now today I'm here and he called out of work because if another depressive episode. I sympathize with this but with everything his wife is going through it seems as though he is being extremely selfish. I'm not sure how to deal with it. I want to put all the furniture back so when she gets home it won't be so stressful but I don't want to upset him. Im not sure how to set boundaries so I just come and work with their daughter and leave when it seems like they need me in other areas of their life as well. Has anybody been in a similar situation? When the mom is upset her husband she usually doesn't come home until later and it can be hard.

630,"I am a recent graduate from a master’s program, and I have a dilemma. I currently work part-time as a waitress and part-time in a grant-funded position at an institution and in a position that is in my field, and that I absolutely love. This last job will have a full-time position opening up this year (hopefully this summer), and I am hopeful that I will be a top candidate for the position, since it is what I currently do as a grant-funded employee. 

I recently interviewed for a job that’s within the field of my Master’s, but in a position that I am not excited about. Furthermore, this offer is part-time, and pays quite a low rate. 

My dilemma is that while this new job offer is a great opportunity to gain experience in my field, the hours it requires would force me to quit my waitressing job. I’ve been a bit embarrassed about returning to serving (because I took the waitressing position AFTER getting my Master’s), yet I love the environment of the restaurant and I have so far made a killing there. I make twice an hour waitressing what I would at this newly offered job, and I work less hours.

Essentially my question is: should I prioritize money or experience? 

I asked my dad this same question and his response was, “Why be embarrassed about waitressing? You didn’t get your Master’s in waitressing- I would be more embarrassed to take a job in my field that is part-time, low-paying, and has no benefits.”

I am stuck with my parents fighting. The only reason my dad is still with my mom is because he doesn't want to leave me. My dad has faults but doesn't do anything bad to me. If we go legally to court and stuff, which has happened twice, my dad won't get custody. Thanks to the system. My mom also gives the silent treatment. It's really scary. Just coming from school everyday is hard for me. I don't know what to do. If I go to school counselors, they won't do shit. They'll just tell my mom and my mom will yell at me and cause a big problem. To top it off, my mom acts like an angel in front of her friends, and employees. When she gets home however, it's another problem. However, sometimes my mom is actually really nice to me and she loves me, but when I get on her bad side, she gets pissed. I asked my friends, but i'm also scared to tell them. My best friend recommended me to come to his house as often as possible. However, my mom doesn't like me going to other people's houses. Every time I come home, she yells at me. To top it off, she's a hypocrite. Anything I do wrong, she's done before. Then she yells at me. I don't know what to do. There's a lot mote I'd like to say but I feel like if something happens and she finds out about this post, she'll be furious. That's why I try to keep things anonymous. None of my friends understand my problem, but I'm hoping that someone out there understands. But the worst thing, is that I don't want to leave her. My dad doesn't either. Without us, she's not stable. She needs us but we can't deal with this crap anymore. She makes us give her our passwords, information, and gives us no privacy. My dad tries his best but I feel bad for him. He needs a break. There was one time when my mom got into an argument and blackmailed me by saying she won't talk to me if I talk to my dad. She blackmailed me for months on an end. When situations get extreme, she comes back. She's also disconnected my dad from talking to his family and his friends. She also tracks our phone records so everything is shown. I hope someone can give me good advise. And yes I talked to a therapist. Who did nothing",20Mar2019,1
632,"It might be a cyst. My mom told me it's common, since this was my first ever piercing. It's weird, though; it wasn't there when I got the stud, then when I replaced the stud with the ring, it just kind of appeared out of nowhere. I wish it would go away soon - I want to get a smaller ring. It looks weird and it makes me insecure.

I got the piercing around 2 months ago, but had the ring in for at least a month. Some complications rose with the stud so I got the ring about 2-3 weeks after, which is apparently extremely early to get it replaced.

I am a 23 year old single mom, and I've been observing my mothers parenting decisions for the last 10  months, and it makes me sick.

&amp;#x200B;

She pulled my 11 year old brother out of public education due to all the issues he was having there. I have no issue or problem with homeschooling if its the best alternative for your kid, but there has been no structured educational plan put in place. he sometimes does different online programs here and there, but its basically nothing. He watched tv in his room day in and day out. his hygine is horrible, and if you ask him to shower or truth his teeth you'd think you were asking him to haul hay for  hours. his social life is extremely lacking, yes he does see some kids his age from school, but as far as i can tell only has one friend I've seen consistently come and pick him up, they always go to his house. the house is always a mess, not hoarder status but enough to b uncomftorable in there, its definitely not somewhere anyone would want to hang out. when i was about 10 or 11 myself is when my mother made this really intense transition from attending school/working to ""working on festivals"" aka partying, and getting pissed if anyone called it partying because its ""such hard work to build a festival, people don't understand"" i get it, but come on. I distinctly remember having to watch my younger brother, who at the time was about 5, way more han appropriate, being left with family members for days, no stability, financial crisis every month. just basically a shit show. for the last couple years I've been doing my own thing, traveling and what not. now that I'm back here I'm just so disgusted at her indifference to my brother. he's overweight, smells constantly, she'll just straight up leave in the middle of the night to go party, and my brother will wake up having no idea where she is. theres been no food in that house for at least 3 months. and her attitude is whats the most shocking. I grew up with a lot of this same stuff, but looking at the situation right now, I'm just starting to see how bad that really is. it became my normal. but its not.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought all this up to her this morning. it escalated really quickly, she basically said "" i do everything myself no one helps me, if someone wants to step up that would be great"" and how she's ""de programming"" my little brother from school, doing thinks the way they ""come to her"" and if anyone has a problem they can basically fuck off. then she said how she would never approach anyone with the bullshit i approach her with, granted i was upset at this point, i had started to yell, but you try to keep your cool when your mom is standing there not giving one shit about what your saying, no caring about your concern for your own brothers well being. then she said "" i could flip this whole thing on you, you stood over my bed, pregnant any crying about your boyfriend, i told you he was gonna hurt you and look what you did."" just so uncalled for. so hurtful. so fucked. I'm at the point where i feel like my little brother needs to get out of there. but she pawned off my other brother to my cousins, and some spiteful part of me thinks "" you can't get away with giving all your children up halfway through just because your over it"" she makes comments all the time about yeah it would be great if i could take brennan when i leave, how i don't even contribute to his well being now ( which is b.s)

&amp;#x200B;

is this enough to call CPS? i don't even necessarily want him taken into the system, i want someone to get her to see some sense. that this is not ok, how brennan is being raised is other peoples business, and she can't just neglect basic things like school because she ""has her own plan"" just looking for some advice fro fellow parents on how to approach this.

This behaviour keeps on repeating.  Whenever I don't date someone I can hardly bare to be alone with myself.

okay so a bit of background, i had a “fling” with a guy a few months back that didnt really end properly and i never got closure, so its a bit awkward between us but he still talks to two of my friends, but not when im around. i considered these two friends to be the closest people to me and the ones i can trust the most.

i had a couple days off of school a few weeks ago and my friends told me the day i came back that the guy had talked to them and he had mentioned me about something small and irrelevant me and my friend had done, the details are unimportant but he apparently wasn’t slagging me off. however, i found out today that that wasn’t the case, my two friends told me that he did actually start slagging me off to them which obviously i’m a bit upset about. but what hit me the most was that they didn’t stick up for me or tell him to stop or anything, and then didn’t tell me for ages despite the fact that they’re supposed to be my friends.

part of me wants to go to the guy tomorrow and tell him to stop talking shit about me behind my back and tell me to my face instead of being a coward, even though i havent spoken to him in ages, and also tell my two friends that i’m hurt by what they did. but another part of me thinks it’ll just be easier to be the bigger person, forget about it and move on. but i don’t want to get walked all over at the same time. i’m not too sure what would be the best option, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

648,"This is quite a long post. I'm sorry, but a lot of things have happened and I'm really frustrated. 

I'm a guy as well, same age.

So we've been friends with this guy for over three years now and he's one of my closest friends.

Recently, we semi-planned (it was on and off for about a week at least) a small day trip to a nearby town for a festival with a guy we've been hanging a lot the last couple of months (let's call him David), because we had a few days of from uni.

Initially, I was very into the idea, because I thought it would be fun and I wouldn't get another chance to attend it. But as we were unsure if we're actually going to go and because I had some work stuff to do back home, I was thinking of going to my home town for a a few days instead. So I was torn about what to do.

The day before we would get our tickets for the trip I learned that an old relative of mine died. That made making up my mind a thousand times harder. My family advised to go on the trip, but I also wanted to attend the funeral. He might have been really old and it was a bit expected, I wanted to go because he was close to grandma  (her health is not that good either so I was really worried about what effect that might have on her) and frankly because that man had lived a very sad life and I wanted to be there for it.

Now let's jump ahead to the really stupid thing I did. As we were waiting in line to book our tickets I still hadn't made up my mind and I was still debating what I should do. I finally give in and get a ticket for the town with the festival. BUT through the day I regretted my decision and decided that I wanted to change my ticket's destination for my hometown instead. So the next day I went first thing in the morning to ask if that is possible. Turns out it's not so even though I got sad at first I got over it. Now I could have hid that fact from my friend because frankly it was a d*ck move, but I just couldn't keep it a secret. So I told it, he got a bit mad, but soon got over it.

That probably isn't the main reason he's acting cold, but it surely didn't help. Let's get to what I think is the real reason because he only started behaving like that after it. 

About a week later from the festival some girls we met invited us to a house party for later that day, but I was unsure if I was going to go because I can't drink. I've been getting some medication for a dermatological issue I've been dealing with for years. The pill I'm getting prevents from drinking any alcohol. So when I'm on that medication I generally avoid events where drinking is involved.

I've cheated sometimes by not getting the pill for a day so I can drink, but I had already done that twice recently (once for the festival and once more the week before that for another local festival). So I didn't think I should do it again for quite some time. The fact that I had already done it twice already seemed to have an effect because I'd feel nauseous and get stomach aches.

The girl that invited us sent me a text about the house party but I told her I couldn't go (to be honest, I was considering not taking the pill, but she texted me quite late so I thought she had forgotten us and had already taken the pill) but that should sent a text to my friend because he can still go. She never did sent him one.

He got mad when I told him I wouldn't go and hang up on me and after she didn't text him he's barely even talking to me.

I saw him today after a lot of days (which is rare) and he would barely respond to me and had a very disregarding tone. We went for coffee later on with him and ""David"" and he was about the same. It's like he's put me at distance.

I know that from that overly long story I don't come off as a particularly good person. I always put myself in dilemmas so I sometimes end up making mistakes and disappointing my friends. I'm not saying I'm perfect. I recognize I made mistakes.
My friend is not perfect either. He's very hot headed and stubborn sometimes. He gets easily mad in all his relationships in general.

I just don't know what to do from this point on. How do I resolve this? This is making me really anxious and it has caused me a massive headache for days. I don't like confrontation with my friends at all and I have it when stuff like that happen so I usually try to avoid them even if it means hurting my ego.

To be honest, I'm a bit mad at him too. I've been there for him all these years through every hard thing he's been through. We've talked hours and hours about his issues. I've tried to help him in whatever way I can. I always try to do that with my friends. Frankly, he hasn't been the same. I don't easily talk about the stuff I'm dealing, but even when I do we don't really discuss them. He has tried to help very few times on his own. I had to point out that I was really struggling with a problem and tell him that I needed some help for him to give me a small piece of advice.

I just feel like I've invested a lot in this friendship and that some mistakes that I've asked sorry for, shouldn't justify his attitude. He thinks that the medication is just an excuse, but it really isn't. Not only it's probably not health to just stop it whenever I like, but it's also important to me because even though it's not only a dermatological issue, the medication helps me fight it and feel less shame about it and get some confidence back. Why is it so hard for someone to understand that? Is it so hard to put yourself in someone else's shoes? Am I just being unreasonable?

Ps: About ""David"". He used to text me a lot in the past and he wanted us to hang out, but my friend kept teasing me that he wanted to go out with me (something I had no interest in) so I felt uncomfortable and that made me keep him at a distance. We would be friendly in texts, but we never hang out properly. About a year later he texted my friend and after a while they stated hanging out. I pointed out his hypocrisy and reminded him of the stuff he used to tell me about him, but I started hanging out with him as well and we've all become friends. Obviously David is a bit closer to my friend now. I have the feeling though that the last couples of days David helped drive an edge between me and my friend. I saw them exchanging some looks when I mentioned that my friend is mad at me lately. I might just be reading too much into it. Then again, David doesn't have many friends and he's tried quite a lot get in our group so it wouldn't really surprise me if he'd do something like that to get a closer friend. ",20Mar2019,1

We live in one of 26 attached town house built in a U shape. The center of the structure is a courtyard with trees, paths, and gardens in front of each house which is 'common area'.  There are many families here with multiple children. One of the neighbours has three kids 10, 6 &amp; 4. They run wild.

Gardens have been destroyed, decorative edging rocks removed and used to smash things, branches torn off to beat eachother, and innocent bystanders, with. Holes, and broken toys litter the courtyard. They yell and scream from 7am to 10pm. They throw things at people trying to enter/exit their units. Bringing the poor behaviour to the attention of their parent brings zero results. The parent goes out of it's way to mock complaints and praise the kids.

Bringing the constant flux of incidents to the condo board has netted zero results despite several bylaws being broken. The parent is quick to play the race card to 'white cis' condo manager despite the fact that this place is a mini U.N.

I don't know. I just felt this sense of dread wash over me, and I couldn't stay. I know I'm such an idiot but I just knew this attack was going to hit hard.


He let me leave and asked me to email him about it. but i don't know what to tell him. should i be honest?",20Mar2019,0
664,"My wife has some unresolved mental health issues and shes serving in the military so its very hard for her to get help without the fear of discharge (she enjoys her job.)  I think she has borderline personality disorder but I'm not here to play arm-chair psychiatrist but to ask for help.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I met her, she's been very sensitive, she'll get upset if I follow attractive people on social media, she'll get upset if I don't say I love you to her before I leave to work on the weekends, she'll get upset if I don't regularly talk to her or call on facetime when shes on deployments, when we're together its so nice but she'll still get upset over little things but show it less consistently, she goes on long deployments though and these are when they start to shine. To frame too, we started out as a long distance relationship, so we're very familiar with long distances, she still hasn't gotten used to it at all through the years. She used to tell me when we were married and thousands of miles apart, ""I hate this, I want to die cause I can't let go of small things"", and that was over me following someone on instagram who I had not talked to in four years and she was attractive by my wife's standards. This is not normal, at all. I am someone who is bipolar and in my worst days I am like this but I am definitely not suicidal for months on end cause of my significant other following someone else. I am happy I am with her and with her I have experienced a life of joy, she is also pregnant with our first child and it is something I am definitely looking forward to but I don't want to live knowing that its dysfunctional cause she can't get over the fact I'm a human being and I miss telling her I love you before I leave somewhere or I don't talk to her for 15 minutes when I'm watching a show.

666,"So I moved into my flat in London in December, which I rent. Landlord said he owns the place and is moving down south for work for a few years. This evening a few letters arrived addressed to him. Bunches of them have arrived every few weeks and I've just passed them on when he's been in the area. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of them hadnt been sealed properly and the letter was half out. I would have put it back but I saw in big red type 'last notice - arrears' and thought I'd better look in case it affects me. It was from the place he pays rent to (it's a tenant management co-operative so he kinda owns the flat and kinda doesn't), saying he owes them rent. He basically hasn't paid any since before I moved in. It was his last warning before they seek court orders to repossess the property - they evidently don't know he doesn't live here anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I see this other letter that looks like a court letter. I had to deal with the court last year (previous dodgy landlord avoiding returning my deposit...it's always the landlords...) so I recognise the layout of it. So I open it all panicked in case it's actually a court summons cause I need to know if bailiffs are gonna be knocking on my door.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out I was wrong, BUT... it's an official letter from his employer (no idea why his address is listed as here but he does remote work a lot) saying his employment is being terminated due to theft and police are investigating. And I'm just like...this landlord is such a crook. But more importantly, am I going to have my flat repossessed because he's not been paying rent? Should I tell him? Should I contact the organisation he rents from and try to fix it myself? I'm kinda freaking out.",20Mar2019,1
667,"Hello, 

This is my first post on Reddit and I felt like I would never post anything on here. Now I want to start this off by saying it is probably going to be long and that there is no evidence to believe that this woman is going to do this yet she probably will. I also want to say that I started to write this in r/legaladvice yet, I don't think that will ruin this person's life enough if I just sue her now if I'm wrong please tell me. I am quite young, still in high school, and I live down some dirt road in a small house with about 40 acres of land or something. We have one neighbor that lives close by and he is a very old man with three hostile dogs. Recently everyday a very young child has been walking down the road all alone with his mother far away. Now my family who knows who this child and woman are. The child is most likely mentally disabled and the woman sends him or just lets him walk over to the neighbor's house like I said all alone. While the child is walking down to the end the dogs will come out and bark and snap and tug on his pants all while the woman is saying shit like ""it's alright don't worry about them,"" if she is even close to him. Apparently, this happens every day. Until now I thought she was just a horrible parent who needs to have her kids taken away. Today my sister, who is older, told me that the woman owns a lot of property along the road to our house and sold it to her own construction company to build houses. She also told me that the woman went into a long legal battle in order to take her sister's inheritance after their mother died. Knowing this we have almost concluded (she could just be a horrible parent and person) that she is sending her MENTALLY DISABLED CHILD down there to get ATTACKED by the dogs in order to sue the old man for his property so it can sell it to itself to get more money (again we are not 100% sure but it fits this disgusting creature's past behavior.) Now if it is going to do that to an old man it is most definitely going to come after us next. I, being in high school, can only think of ways to ruin, and I mean RUIN, this thing. Nothing I can think of is legal I mean unless skinning alive and letting run away on the raw flesh of its feet is legal however that would definitely be animal abuse. anyway fucked up tangent aside I want to ruin this thing before anything bad happens. I do NOT want the child to get attacked any further but I want to ruin this things life. So very long story short how can I make this thing devolve into becoming a crack whore so that it won't be beaten by its pimp for the week. I do not care how long but I want its life ruined.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR 

disgusting creature (probably) keeps sending its mentally disabled child to get attacked by dogs in order to sue an old man out of his property. Luckily nothing bad has happened yet but it will most likely will come for us after and I want to ruin its life forever.",20Mar2019,1

One of the big reasons I wanted to come back was to enjoy my friends and family that I only got to see every so often.

Me and 2 buddys are like the 3 amigos. We were pretty tight when I was younger, and I missed out on a few things while at school and working.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my buddies is dating this girl and it feels like I am losing my best friend. It has my frustrated and annoyed about things. He started dating her round when I moved home, and slowly he has made himself less available. It went from him demanding I make plans in advance with him, to him never being able to hangout on the weekend because he is either with her, or with her friends. If i try and make plans to do something, he says he cant nail down the date (cuz he leaves it open for his girlfriend and her friends).

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself getting pissed at my friend. Why can't we chill? Why can't us three amigos chill like old times? It has me super angry. Sitting around i feel inferior. Like cuz I can't date, I am not welcome to hang out with my friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a hard time dating. It does not come easy to me, so maybe a big part of it is envy? I have other friends with girlfriends, and I am used to seeing them often and getting to know them. With this buddy of mine, I feel like I am being cut off.

In short: I feel like im losing my friend to this new girl he is dating and her friends. It is making me angry and I want to validate it as some douchey bull shit, but I think all my anger comes from envy.

670,"My girlfriend and I are in a healthy and loving relationship. It's all quite new for me since I'm quite young so I could use some advice. The main issue is that I'm really insecure. Whenever I want to text my so, she is almost always already online before I text her, eventhough everyone I know she talks to isn't online. I'll check in on her an hour later and still see her online. She never talks about it, she hasn't mentioned it ever. I just want to ask her who she's talking to. I want everything to be perfect. The only reason that she's with me, eventhough she's a soldid 10/10 and I'm nothing more than a 6/10 or 7/10 (no insecurity here, just honest), is my confidence. I'm not a ""Chad"" in any way, I'm just always a happy guy that's easy to talk to and I think that's why she likes me. Deep down I'm very, very insecure about everything. No one knows this, no one. And now the insecurity is just playing the same doom scenario over and over in my head. I'm affraid that if I'll ask her that she then (over a longer period of time) falls out of love with me because I don't trust her or that I care too much. She never questioned me when I was online for a long time, but I don't even know if she notices it.

674,"TL;DR at bottom:
So here it goes, I like to post controversial things on my Facebook page, if I come across something I agree with, I share it or leave a comment, nothing wrong with doing that.. Or so I thought.. So last night I shared a post that read ""some mothers are the reason their sons are toxic or narcissistic"" Something of that degree and I agree with that. I hate the saying ""boys will be boys"" To excuse shitty or abusive behaviors. 
Now my mother in law has told me this multiple times when my S/O has left me alone with our infant to go get drunk with friends, or go spend the last of our money for the week on weed. I've taken it with a grain of salt and stopped reaching out to her for advice or help. 
A couple weeks go by, everyone was over the incident, I forgot about it to be honest, and I come across this post, I share it with the caption ""boys will be boys is just an excuse for shit behavior"" This wasn't directed at her (although the shoe fits) I didn't have her in mind while posting, I saw something I agree with and have an opinion about and I shared it, on my personal Facebook page. Didn't think anything of it and I had no intention on starting drama or stirring her pot. 
Well this stuck a nerve with her and she came into our apartment, (my family lives in her finished basement, I've thanked them endlessly for that opportunity) looks me right in the face with the look of pure hate and says ""I'm not playing your game""
Confused, I ask what she's talking about and she reads my post. I immediately tell her the post wasn't directed toward her, I just saw something I agree with and shared it. She continues to glare at me, so I say ""but I mean if the shoe fits🤷‍♀"" Because she's just waiting for me to say something. 
She goes on to say ""you're on thin ice, don't piss me off, don't forget I'm in charge here. "" Now my own mother doesn't threaten me or talk to me like that. 
I fully understand how she could think that was about her, but the bold assumption I directed it to her and the threat was crossing a line imo. 
I've never disrespected her, talked down on her or done anything to deserve a threat. I'm not sure if she was threatening to kick me and my son out of her house or if she was threatening to put her hands on me, either way, now I feel head shy and nervous to even go home to face her. 
My S/O didn't back me up, he took her side and tried to break up with me... Over a vague post that wasn't directed toward any individual. 
I'm not sure whether I should try to confront the issue and work things out with this family or just cut my losses and move on. Am I wrong here? Or could she have handled that in a better way?

679,"I’m new to drinking and I recently had an experience with a friend (23f) that left me with some questions.  
  
First of all, I took her out with my friends so she really didn’t know anyone there but she seemed real comfortable anyway (very extroverted, etc.)  
  
That said she really got pretty drunk pretty fast, so we didn’t get to talk for long...   
  
My question is more about the end of the night.   
  
First: some guys really wanted me to “go for it” and take her home. I said she was too drunk and she wouldn’t have gotten so drunk if she thought I would do that.   
  
Ergo: does it mean anything she was so comfortable around me (and a group of strange men) or is it more likely she’s a bit reckless or something?   
  
Second: a little while after I assume she blacked out, shortly before the bar closed, she invited her friends from school to the bar. Mostly girls, but they hung out by themselves and kept taking her away from the larger group. 

Eventually she got sick of them and came back to the “party” where she tried to call herself an Uber. Her friend ended up taking her home tho.  
  
My question: did she call her friends because she was scared/nervous around me and my friends? Did she think I was going to try something with her?  
  
If so why’d she try to end the night with me after inviting her friends???
  
Did I do something wrong to make her feel some way at the end of the night? Should I be worried about the odd behavior.   
  
**Tldr:** not sure if I make a girl feel nervous or scared, or on the contrary safe. **Does getting blackout drunk with someone have anything to do with how much you trust them?**

683,"Bit of background info (TLDR at bottom): I'm 17f with 2 siblings, 5m and 11f. Dad cheated on my mum back in 2011 and things have been rocky since then but got worse in the past few months. 

Mum and dad have been arguing for about 2 years now ish, I've honestly lost track of how long its been. It pretty much all started when my brother and sister were fighting, so my dad's response to that was to shove my sister into the wall, where she hit the wall with her cheek then fell to the floor with a black eye, split cheek and lip and a bruised face (his reason: ""she needed to know what it was like"") so my mum told him to get out of the house then, but he refused and she just kinda let it go. 
Then a few months later they had another big argument, this time about me. I was coming up to some important exams that I had to revise for so they needed my undivided attention. Dad had told me to do the chores he was supposed to do, alongside taking my dog out and tidying my bedroom AND revising, so i blatantly told him no because i was too busy. His response to that was to take my phone off me and scream in my face, so I went out to stay at my aunts for a bit and when my mum got back from work she went ballistic at him. ( also think now is a good time to add in that my dad straight up refuses to let my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years anywhere near the house, never lets me have any friends over and hides food from me like bread and stuff that i might need for lunch the next day, for no reason other than he's a wanker) 
Mum and dad have started arguing a lot more recently though, but each time it gets progressively worse. He has walked out on us a few times after calling my mum ""ugly"" or a ""psycho"" or a ""bitch"" and other stuff like that, that obviously leaves my mum in tears and she doesn't want any of her kids hearing. She's asked him to leave loads of times and he refused and then said she was the controlling and abusive one (when he used to stop her going out to see her friends etc). Even when shes threatened to report him he still wouldnt budge and I honestly just dont know what to do. Its not nice for any of us to hear or be a part of but mum doesn't seem to want to do anything about it and dad refuses to leave. I don't want to report him in case it upsets mum and causes more trouble. I just need some help, anything will do even if it is just how to cope for a bit longer. I've spoken to friends and family but theres nothing they can do so I feel like i need to take things into my own hands, but in all honesty i am terrified of my dad and I'm too scared of upsetting mum or doing something and then it not working then dad getting worse at me too. I've always been a sensitive person and have a habit of being too judgemental of situations then coming to the worst conclusion, but this time i feel like its just more than me overthinking.

TLDR; my dad is a wanker but i can't tell if it's abuse or me overreacting to situations. ",20Mar2019,3
684,"I'm an 18 year old guy, and I'm gay. I've been on a few dating sites before, mainly Tinder and Bumble, but I don't use either very much. In late October 2018, I got a new follower on Instagram and a DM request from that follower. The conversation went like this:

Him: Hey

Me: Hey, what's up? Who's this?

Him: Not much, I saw your Instagram on Bumble

Me: Oh true

He then asked for my snapchat and we talked for a little and got to know each other. He's a year younger than me, and doesn't live very far (from home at least, he's a bit far from my school). Anyways, we stopped talking and then early to mid November, he snaps me again. I don't remember the conversation at all, as I was still drunk from the tailgate earlier that day. We then stop talking again. Fast forward to mid-December, I'm on my way home from school for winter break when I decide to snap him to say hi, planning to ask if he wanted to hang out. He opened it, and didn't respond. I thought that he lost interest, and got over it (it took a little bit though, because I'm pretty into him). We still continued to follow each other, watch each others Snapchat/Instagram stories, etc.

Fast forward again to a week and a half ago, beginning of spring break. I was surprised to look at my phone to see a snap from him. I open it, and he asked if I was home for spring break. I said yes, and he suggests that we hang out. It was pretty clear after a bit of talking that he wanted to have sex, which I was 100% down for. We talked about all that sexual stuff, and it turns out that he's bisexual. He's into my body type (on the larger side with a little muscle, working to lose some of my chubbiness), and even though he isn't my usual type, I found myself getting more and more into him. I was a bit disappointed to realize that neither of us were able to have each other over (my parents are almost always home, and I still haven't told them that I'm gay). I suggest that I drive to him when we're both free and pick him up to just chill in my car, and he agrees. 

Thursday rolls around, and my parents are BOTH going out for the night, leaving me with the house all to myself. I snap him asking if he's free to come over, but he's not. He had to leave for a vacation the next day and still needed to pack. I was so disappointed, because I was really looking forward to hanging out with him. He left for vacation, and a few days later I had to leave for school. I sent him a snap, asking how his vacation was and making a lame joke in the process. He opens it, and doesn't respond.

Now, here I am, unable to stop thinking about him. My friends think that I should just give up on him if he isn't going to respond to me, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. He seems kind of shy, telling from the fact that he doesn't post many clear pictures of his face on Instagram, and only sends me half of his face. Since he's bisexual and most likely still in the closet, I can't tell if he only wants to have sex with me, or if he's interested in pursuing a relationship. I don't want to seem clingy by continuing to try starting a conversation, but to be fair, I am posting this whole story here so I'm probably already there. I just don't know what to do in this situation. I've never dated a guy, and I've only had sex once, so I'm not really experienced with guys in general let alone bisexual guys. I don't know whether I should snap him again, or just let it rest either until summer break or until he snaps me. Any advice helps. (:",20Mar2019,0

689,"Context:

A girl that I used to work with got kicked out of her boyfriend's house when they argued/broke up.  She had no where to go so she was sleeping in her car in 15 degree weather with her 3 dogs. 

Since I knew her, I offered to let her crash in my spare room for a few days until she figured things out, which she took me up on.

Everything was fine, and we ended up getting involved so to speak, but after a few days she moved in with her family.  This was about 2 weeks ago.

Today, the x bf who kicked her out of the house tried to contact me on facebook, acting all innocent like he just wanted closure, etc.  Bullshit, if you wanted closure you wouldn't be contacting people you don't know trying to ask shit that isn't your business.

I haven't responded to it, but I'm concerned.  She told me during their relationship that he was very controlling of her internet/computer access.  This makes me think that he has access to her facebook account.  The only way he would know who I am is if she told him or he read our messages.

If he read our messages, he knows everything that went down and has my address.

So now I'm sitting at my house wondering if some controlling x bf with a chip on his shoulder is going to come by to try and do something stupid.

What can/should I do in this situation?  If he ever did show up and broke in and I wasn't home, I'd be very worried about him breaking/stealing shit or hurting my dog.

If I was home when he broke in, I have no real weapon to defend myself with.

How can I be prepared?  What actions should I take?",20Mar2019,1
690,"Hi everyone, I'm new here. I've been reading for a long time but never had the courage to write. I read a lot of posts like mine but kinda had the need to vent a little and get some more ""personal"" advices. 

I'm 19, gonna be 20 in a few months and I feel so  upset and sad about life. I graduated from high school last year in July (I'm Italian, we do 5 years of high school so we're a year ""late"" compared to other countries) but I didn't want to go to University like most of my friends. 
-First of all I felt drained mentally and physically because I gave my best for 5 years, just to be considered less than other classmates just because they had connections.
-I wasn't sure about  what to do with my life, what career path to take, and I didn't want to enroll in a random Uni and do nothing. 
-I never really thought I would've made it until graduation.(had suicidal thoughts for the past six years, but I stick around for my family because I know they would take the blame since I don't really like to talk about my feelings and I've never asked for help,  just kind of dealt with it)
And So I decided to take a gap year. As far as I know it's pretty common outside of Italy, But here is seen as something that will ruin your life, like you won't be able to go to Uni ever again in your life.

Anyway, to make my gap year meaningful I decided to go abroad to volunteer for six months. I was really happy and exited about it. I had almost everything ready. My parents were finally supportive after months of arguing. I was genuinely happy after a really long time of feeling miserable. I finally had something to look forward to. But then the agency dropped me. They had to send me visa documents but I never heard from them again.
Needless to say I was devastated. Until that moment I felt good, I had a good routine, I worked out regularly, I was learning the language of the country I was supposed to go to, I was cooking and helping my mom. Everything went straight to the trash. Suddenly I was crying everyday all day, waking up late, not  working out, didn't clean anything, went whole weeks without even showering (I know it's nasty), and it didn't help that my best friend moved and my other best friend didn't really care about me so I basically stayed at home for more than three months straight.
I had random burst of energy where I wanted to take my life in my hands but never did anything.

I started getting better these last two months, but now I'm kind of getting bad again. I just want to do something. I can't stand anymore staying at home. I volunteer at a local dog shelter and I love it but it's not enough. I can't get a job because I live in a little town and there's literally no job. 
I don't really like to say that I don't have aspirations but I think that that's the case. I don't really know what job I want or what to do with my life. When I think about things that I want to do as a job my mind goes completely blank. All I really know is that I really want to travel and discover new cultures and if I can I want to help people. But I don't know how. I was planning on saving money for 2-3 years and then volunteering or traveling on a budget but I don't know how since I can't even get a job. I have no experience or uni degree.
I feel hopeless, like I'm wasting my time and everyday it's too late to start something.

Do you have any advices? What should I do? Have you ever went through something like this?

I'm sorry if it's too long and I'm sorry for grammar mistakes!



TLDR
I'm feeling really helpless because I can't find a job and I don't go to Uni. I don't even know the career path I want to take because I can't really think about things that I like enough to be a job. The only thing I know is that I want to travel.",20Mar2019,1

694,"Long post.  TLDR available at bottom.

I have about a month and one week left living in my college house with 4 other guys. The layout of our house is a little odd; the landlord has created as many bedrooms as possible. To get to my bedroom, I have to go upstairs into my roommates bedroom and there is a door that leads to what used to be the attic, but is now a bedroom. That's my room. We have to share closet space in my room. Thus, he and I are only separated by a single door and I am forced to go through his room to get to mine.

This guy is NUTS. Picture a slightly overweight 6'2"" ex-football player who is obsessed with sex, takes a ton of pride in sports to the point of putting other people down if he doesn't think they know anything about them or if they play worse than him, and is super prideful in what he thinks is his good ol' boy/real man/real woman pleasing identity. He has a HUGE bluetooth speaker that has a handle built into it that he blasts country music on. He takes it around the house with him and literally screams to it. He comes up behind me often when I'm washing dishes and pretends like he is humping me. He likes to grab me, kiss me (not on the lips), and make tons of sexual motions and comments toward me. I can't stress this last part enough: it is literally about 9/10 times I pass him he makes a move or comment. His motions often involve what you might call man handling me and grabbing me. He has a ""Magnum condoms"" hat that, ironically, he has worn to church. I'm trying to paint a picture of what this guy is like for people.

I will often be in my room doing something and he will enter the room naked, flop his junk around while holding his bluetooth speaker, and tell me to suck his dick. Otherwise he will enter my room while I'm doing something and physically touch me and make sex remarks.

Let's be clear: I am partly to blame for this situation. He has increasingly been like this and in previous months over the past two years, I used to think he was hilarious and would encourage his behavior with my laughter. I saw it all as a joke and made jokes back at him that were similar. If you're a boy who has been in a sports locker room, I think you understand where our humor kind of comes from. I haven't laughed at this behavior in months, but I haven't said anything about it because I naturally thought he'd get the hint that he isn't funny. Lately, he has been getting more hostile with me. I would say we were friends at least up until fall semester 2018.

In December I went through a major breakup that brought my entire world down. A month later, he and I talk to address that elephant in the room and he absolutely chews me out and calls me all sorts of curse words. He used the term ""dumbass"" on me about 12 times. He told me my depression was nothing compared to his or his pastor's, told me I should have come to him instead of going to a therapist, and demanded that I grow a pair. I didn't fight him because my goal was to get the conversation out of the way, not fight. I told him he was nuts for saying he didn't trust doctors or therapists to which he replied ""I'm right you're wrong!"" Since then, he has had some increased hostility towards me. He got furious at me for going to TN with my family for a weekend and not spending it with him (even though he worked all weekend) and another time came into my room unannounced and got mad at me for walking through his room for not saying hi to him. Before the breakup, he had spent about the past 4 months asking me *almost every day* when I was going to propose to my then girlfriend. This is not an exaggeration. He lied to her and told her behind my back that I had said I wouldn't propose for another 8 years. Even though she and I are broken up, we are still good friends. We never took what he said seriously and knew it was just BS. Another thing that needs to be clear is that he has never actually physically hurt me, though our post-breakup talk has left me extremely stressed and boiling with anger ever since then.

The other roommates either like him (one has severe insecurity issues and sucks up to him and takes his side on anything) or just don't care because they're too timid and quiet and passive to say anything.

You're probably asking why I put up with this shit and why I haven't put him in his place or moved out? Well, I knew I had one semester left in this house. Now I have just a little over a month left. I'm almost gone. I know I'll survive and be fine; I don't feel physically threatened. I don't *want* to kick him out because of how much effort and trouble that would be. I have put up with all this to save trouble and to just let it go so I can focus on what's important, and then just forget about him when I move out. I have only broken the surface with the crazy stuff with this guy. He has done many other just as insane things, if not more insane. There have been instances where I've asked him just to do his dishes and he screamed outside at the top of his lungs that he was being bullied and needed help. He clearly is mentally ill.

One last key point you need to understand: if we make a bell curve of size of a dude, he's towards the right end. I am way on the left. I'm 5'1"" and 130 pounds. Don't get me wrong: I did martial arts for years growing up and am comfortable putting someone in chokes. But this guy is so much bigger than me that I can hardly even get my arm around his huge neck.

I am going to tell him his jokes aren't funny and that he needs to quit being obnoxious. I have little doubt he'll comply. What I am wondering is this: is it known that it is better to let something go or to confront someone who has hurt you to get something off your chest, even though the conversation will be bad and intense? As much as I want to just sit and chew him out maybe the day before I move out to call him out on everything he has done wrong to hurt me and warn him that he will destroy his future relationships if he acts this way again, do we really know if that's going to do anything for my mental health besides give me a temporary relief high? Should I just let it go and forget about him upon move out? I don't know if there's a right answer on this. Let me know what you think. Please no ""GET OUT NOW YOU'RE IN DANGER"" comments, I've heard plenty of that and have an emergency plan if something were to actually happen.

TLDR: Huge roommate with massive inferiority complex (amongst other mental issues) severely hurt my feelings and left me feeling super insecure and hurt after a world-crumbling breakup. He is huge, I am tiny. He does not take criticism well and in the past has completely freaked out and screamed and run out of rooms when criticized. Often fights back with very hurtful and petty things as well. Don't know if I should just wait out my last month in the house and then forget about him, or would it somehow be good for my mental health to let it all out on him before I leave? ",20Mar2019,1
695,"I normally I don’t like anime. In fact, I REALLY don’t like most animes. but I was recently sick at home, and I was going through my hulu. I couldn’t find anything to watch, until I came across the anime “monster musume”. I remembered my friend ( who a massive weeb) telling me about it. I turned it on thinking I’ll get a good laugh out of how cringey it is. But to my surprise, I actually started to enjoy it. Shoot, I blew through the whole season immediately. and dare I say, I felt a little empty when the one and only season came to an end on my tv.

I'm very pro-LGBTQ+ because most of my friends are gay, bi, asexual ect. I'm not sure why I have so many friends who're part of that community but It's made me very passionate about their rights and treating them equally. One of my bi friends is currently looking for someone to date and one of my boyfriend's friends is looking for a girl to date. I asked my boyfriend if I should try to set up a date for them and he said that his friend wouldn't want to date someone who's bi. I didn't see that coming but I was like okay.

But then I got curious so I asked my bf if he would still date me if I were bisexual and he said he wouldn't. That one surprised me and kind of hurt my feelings. I asked why and he said that he would never feel like he's enough for me if I'm attracted to both sexes because he could only give me one.

That makes sense to me and I want to be understanding but there's another layer to this. I'm kinda bi-curious and now, I feel like I have to hide that from him or he'll leave me or get upset. It just feels strange that he tells me he loves me but he also says that If I were bi he wouldn't date me? What do you guys think?",20Mar2019,2

I selected the submarine electronic computer field as my rate and everything was set. The only thing was I sucked at running. I failed my initial run and got set back.

708,"Hello there,

This topic might be extremely weird to talk about since many people may not have considered such a dilemma. But I'll try to make it as simple as possible.

I've been a competitive person my entire life. When somebody tried to be better then me at a given thing, I'd always try to be better than that given person. The same went for the goals that I had in the past. For an example, I would always try to be the best at a game or obtain the highest marks in a subject that I would find interesting (pretty normal, right?). The problem occurs when I began to ""tweak"" different variables in order to maximize the process of success. If I were to be the best at a given game, I would buy the best gear (monitor, mouse, computer (graphics card, processor) etc.)) to minimize lag and improve comfort so that I would achieve my given goal quicker (again, pretty normal stuff). Everything would go accordingly, until I began gathering some extremely basic information about light (I'm using quotation symbols since I wasn't really researching the given subject to the degree that real researches would do). Different non-scientific articles expressed how sunlight can increase productivity and regulate the circadian rhythm. Because of this information, I spent all of my time in daylight. Furthermore, I spent lots of hours in front of a monitor which resulted in headaches and eyestrain. Usually I would have my brightness levels of the monitor set to 100% because it looked better and details were much more clearer. But when I found out that eyestrain and headaches are caused by blue light (that my monitor emits) and the high contrast ratios between the monitors brightness and its surroundings, I began lowering the brightness level of my monitor. Changing the brightness was okay at first, but it was something that I didn't like (same goes for increasing the amount of light/sunlight in my room). Additionally, this change in variables made me think and act differently. I would not care as much about things anymore, and I found it more difficult to express myself and argue with individuals about the thoughts and opinions that would occur in different subjects. I felt that I would lose more arguments and my beliefs weren't valuable anymore. But when I changed the monitor's brightness level to 100%, I would feel that I'm able to argue with people again and be my real self that I were before this incident. Some of my initial enthusiasm that I had about my beliefs, enjoyments and goals would reoccur. Though something changed. I was not the same individual as I once was. Meaning that I would associate how my behaviour and performance was based on the different values of the variables. This became especially true when I had to decide between whether or not I should enable or disable ""Dark Theme"" on YouTube. It was something that I couldn't decide. I used to have ""Dark Mode"" on 9GAG and I used to think more clearly, but when I turned ""Dark Mode"" off, I had an easier tendency to acknowledge my responsibilities etc. Anyway, what I'm trying to express is that different variables do affect me, but I don't know if I'm affecting myself due to my personal interpreted effect a given value of a variable should have on me or if the actual value itself has an effect on me. So what is the right thing to do? Should I chose a preferred value for a given variable or should I ""tweak"" the actual value of the variable in order to positively affect my physical and mental state? An example of this could be whether or not I should enable ""Dark Mode"" on YouTube and what my process of thought should be when a value of a variable that affects the given user is met. Here I'm asking what my line of reasoning should be when I'm choosing a given value. Should I chose the value of a given variable based on my liking or based on the value's effect (or maybe something else)? Lastly, should I pick a value even though it can worsen my mental- and physical state? I might be asking very complex philosophical questions but that's because I've been thinking about this dilemma for a year.

I live out of state, so I spent the spring break with her at her mom/grandmother's place. Now we're back on campus and going back to classes, but she hasn't felt the same since we got back.

 She was never extremely outgoing or cheerful, but she was always happy to chat with me over our daily lunch. Whenever I'm with her or go visit her in her room, I try to start up a conversation, but she only gives flat, one-word answers when she used to join me in complaining about professors or mutual friends. I was thinking that she was just stressed for our test yesterday, but at lunch today she wasn't talking at all.

I don't know what has her acting so distant from me, but I don't know if it's something I did? Could she be sick of me after spending all break with me? Is there a subtle way to ask her/figure it out?",20Mar2019,1

712,"I attempted to get certified in A+ 901 back in September of last year and failed miserably after a solid year of studying on and off. I had convinced myself that I would gonna pass and kept going as time came closer. Then come the day; I bombed it spectacularly. Being the majority financial backbone in the house while my fiancé goes to school to become a nurse hasn’t been a big deal because I love her and our child we have together...

But that being said, until she’s out of school and is working as a nurse, every little dime and penny is always a help out for us and given that A+ costs so much for both tests, bombing one and wasting so much money is cause for misery and frustration. For some background:

I graduated from college years ago with a degree in Mass Communications but haven’t been able to do anything with said degree since leaving school. I got into some tech jobs for different companies, web producer here and web editor here but nothing impressive outside of HTML/CSS. I need something tangible to make money and give my family the life they deserve but ever since failing I just... Can’t look at the study material. I sincerely try but all I keep thinking is I’m just going to fail again and waste money that could be used towards car payments or dealing with bills or so on. 

Even going on and studying I can’t do it for long because negativity swallows me up. I just don’t know what to do or how to handle this. Worst yet is that my parents, while they meanwhile ask about it time and time again, reminding me that I work a dead end job that won’t provide for my family or do anything in the long run and that I’m basically stagnant, and I need to do better. It’s tiring enough being down on myself but getting it from them LITERALLY every single time I visit them to the point of I barely want to see them. Why? Just to be dragged through another lecture that even makes me feel like less of a person and more of a general failure.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I want to take these tests. I want to study. I want to pass instead of just telling people over and over again that I’m going to but I’m mentally paralyzed by this self doubt and frustration that no matter what I’m going to do or how I go about it I’ll just fail spectacularly on what’s supposed to be the introductory certification for getting into IT.

Suddenly, I have absolutely no desire to either have sex or wank. At all. I can do it, but it's honestly clinical. This has been going on for the last week or so- I've also felt far more depressed than I usually do. Honestly, it's like my mind has suddenly just lost all motivation to do anything as well as sex. Can't be fucked with A levels or anything.

Just been spending my time playing sax really- that's the only thing giving me any sort of pleasure.

My music taste has also been slightly altered- though neither negatively or positively. I'm a lot more into avant-garde jazz than I used to be. I now prefer it to be-bop, which I still love but not as much as the freaky shit. I feel like this could just be a natural progression from listening to enough though.

I want to seek help from her, to address an issue I've only recently been able to properly identify the cause of.

I've been having problems enjoying intimate relations. I originally thought this was due to some related incidents that happened to me in the past and it may still be. However, I've recently identified that I struggle to enjoy things with my partner due to my perceptions of myself. 

I am disgusted by the way I look. I avoid photos and mirrors in order to not think about it. This doesn't work in intimate situations as I think about what is going on. this causes me to feel disgusted and very much ruins the time we spend like that. I often end up crying.

My partner is very understanding, but he wants me to enjoy things as much as he does.

725,"Sorry it’s so long but I felt some background needed to be written first..

I have been friends with her since the beginning of high school, she has always been my best friend. After school naturally we went our separate ways but never stopped being friends and met up regularly and always texted etc however I’m not very good at making friends, in fact I have very few, I guess I’m just quite shy whereas she is totally the opposite and makes friends wherever she goes so naturally in her life there has been many friends that come and go and whilst they were around I was pushed a little to the background and then when they went sour she would always come back. 

It upset me a little but I also like my own space and even if we didn’t speak for awhile whenever we caught up again we just always picked up where we left off, like we hadn’t even been apart. 

However over the last couple of years I had been going through a hard time and I guess her disappearances got to me a little more, I never said anything and just tried to be a good friend whenever she would come back. I made her a really special gift at Christmas by using all of our notes we wrote in school and silly things I kept that reminded me of good memories together and put them into a frame for her and she got me nothing. I didn’t mind, you don’t give to receive right? Our birthdays are days apart and on hers I made her a little hanging decoration out of clay (I like to make gifts) that I gave to her when she came over to mine for a catch up and after she left I realised that she had just left it. She never even mentioned to me how she forgot it or anything after either. It really upset me but whatever, people forget things I guess. 

The point where it all came to blows is when I moved in with my boyfriend about an hour away from her so I wasn’t just round the corner anymore, she kept asking me to come over for nights out and I did around 3 or 4 times before I suggested she should come over to mine for the next one since she hadn’t even been to see my new place and she agreed. 

We eventually set a date and I was so excited! My boyfriend had planned to go spend time with his friends and so we would have the house to ourselves for a girly night and to go out. I had noticed over social media that she had been spending a lot of time with this girl from her new job but I was used to it and started hearing less from her however whenever I texted her about our night at mine she would tell me how excited she was so it was all great. Until a week before where she text me saying she’s not been feeling great lately and wasn’t sure she could make it, I told her to see how she was closer to the time and if she wasn’t well then we could rearrange it for another time it’s no problem but she reassured me she would be fine. The morning of our planned day she told me she had had a panic attack the night before and was feeling really wiped out so I listened to her and tried to help her anyway I could and told her when she came over we didn’t have to go out and we could just order some food and watch a movie and relax for the night she agreed and told me she would let me know when she was setting off. I text her later asking when she was going to come as it was getting late and I hadn’t heard from her and she replied and just said she’s not up to it so I replied and asked what was wrong which then she replied and said the truth was she went out with this other girl the night before and she was so hungover she just didn’t feel like driving. 

I felt so let down and I probably shouldn’t have but I sent her a long message how id been really trying with her and just feel constantly let down. I wasn’t mean in the text at all and at no point did I say I didn’t want to be friends but I let it all out for sure. She never replied. 

It’s been a year now and I still haven’t heard anything from her. I think about her a lot and wish I could just talk to her like we used to however she wrote a ‘New Years post’ about how ‘some people decided to walk out of her life this year but how this one is going to be amazing with her new friends she could never have imagined finding’ and it seems clear she’s not interested. 

Should I just try to move on? Or should I try to reach out? And if so how and what do I even say?

728,"Warning: Big ol read. Summary at the bottom.

Now before I really get into this, he isn't my real dad. He's my step dad, he's from Bulgaria. They met over a video game 14ish years ago, and my mom flew over there to visit him. Crazy lady, I know.
Basically, he ended up coming back after the 2nd or 3rd time of her visiting because they got married in a fling and ended up staying married for 14 years. (While my mom was away for months I stayed with my great grandma.)
No one liked my dad. I call him my dad because he's the one who raised me, my mom wouldn't let me see my biological dad for a long time, but I'm on good terms with the cool guy.
Anyhow, as far back as I remember he's been an abusive piece of shit towards my mom. Physically and mentally. And of fucking course she couldn't do much because showed her this side AFTER they got married and he was in America, living with us. 
He wasn't a creep or a perv, but he was angry. Always about something. I can actually recall one of my earlier memories of him picking up a glass bowl and smashing it into my mom's face. She still has the scar on her nose. And all they were doing was arguing.
He's manipulative, and has gaslighted her, me, and my little brother (aged 10) numerous times.
She's tried leaving him before, about 3 years ago(And a couple of times before that), and halfway to our destination she turned around and went back. I love my mom so much, and I hate watching how this piece of shit man keeps destroying her piece by piece.
He never cleans after himself, he yells at her if his socks don't match, he'll yell at her if she asks him to fix something more than once. She's always cooking for him, always cleaning after him, doing the yard work, the hard work, everything. He. Doesn't. Help. (I do the best I can with having high school. My little brother is useless in doing any work. He's definitely his father's son.)
He hasn't physically hurt her recently (That I know of), but he cheated on her (not an affair, our knowledge) right around Christmas time of 2016. And I catch him in the act of trying to gaslight and manipulate her still CONSTANTLY. I can't say anything or else he'll get aggressive and he'll threaten me with vague, empty threats and insults. No one can defend themselves when arguing with him, even if he's in the clear wrong, or else it's sheer disrespect and he'll spew insults like a fucking sprinkler. He can be fucking terrifying.
There's so much shit he's done to us, and I want to help her get away from him. He's recently been made an American citizen, his name is on the new car they bought AND the house they bought.
 My mom told me she'd stopped loving him long ago, but she doesn't know how to escape, that she wants to leave but she keeps digging herself deeper and deeper into the Situation. My dad has no family in America so I'm sure that makes it harder on her to get the courage to leave. Also an incident happened in which she might not be able to take custody of my younger brother. (She did NOT hurt him or anything like that, but I don't want to go in detail.) So if she leaves he might get her son.
I don't know how to help her, but I don't know how much longer I can stand watching him make her feel pathetic, ugly, and worthless when in reality my mom is a gorgeous, strong lady who just needs help.

729,"I live in an older house with two roommates. Our bedrooms are all the same size, however my room has an asset none of the others have: a private deck accessible only through my room. 

My roommates and I all pay an equal share of the rent, however as I make more money than my other roommates put together and require specific internet and electricity needs for my job (I work from home), I pay a couple hundred bucks more a month towards the bills than either of them. Considering my personal belongings also populate our living room (furniture, TV, and more that we all share) and my access to this small private 4x10 deck, I consider this a fair trade-off.

However, my deck is desirable space. When the weather is nice my roommates and I all sit out there, and sometimes I don’t mind one or both of them being out there without me. But lately one of my roommates has been accessing and using this space without asking, often playing music or sitting out there at night so there have been times I’ve come home and gone in my room expecting privacy only to suddenly realize someone is essentially in my private space without my knowledge.

This gives me great anxiety. I dislike my room being a high traffic area, and I resent being made to expel him from my space when I want privacy. He does not respond well, getting gruff and moody about it and it’s an unpleasant experience that I often sacrifice my privacy to avoid. 

It’s not a matter of trust - my roommates are my partner and my oldest friend. I have no worries about either of them being in my space except that I have very little private area and private time since my partner sleeps in my room even though she has her own (which I don’t mind at all) and they both work schedules that mean I am basically never ever alone in my house - and also meaning the private porch is often my last refuge where I can be fully by myself. 

We also have a much larger front porch which is accessible to everyone, but it lacks the privacy of my deck, which is on the back of the house away from the street. I don’t want to be a selfish dick about it, but I really need to communicate to my roommate that my personal space is not a public area that is freely open to all without it being a huge confrontation and I don’t know how. Am I the asshole? What do I do?

TL:DR: My roommate keeps hanging out in my highly desirable personal space without asking and it’s causing me anxiety over my lack of privacy.

731,"This might be a long one. So thanks if you decide to tune in tldr at end. 

My (19f) parents have been divorced since I was about 8 and my little sister was 3 or 4

Before then it was constant fighting and it even got physical at times (both parents are guilty) so it was certainly a good thing they separated.

Even though they were such a horrible match they really tried to get along for our sakes. And they both loved us dearly. For that I’m grateful

Anyways. Recently my dad got married to a woman he had been dating for only a few months. 

Some backstory on this lady. She’s about 10 years younger than my father. But they have known each other for most of their adult lives because she was married to one of his close friends who is now in prison indefinitely for reasons ill leave unanswered. 

We knew my dad always found her attractive and she knew too. So as soon as her hubby got sent to prison she was with my dad (within weeks). I assume she did this because she has never worked a day in her life and has no other means of support, so she latched onto my dad as he had the means to support her. (Not saying he isn’t a wonderful genuine nice man) but her intentions were not love. Especially so quickly after her husbands betrayal.

My father. He’s so nice and so good but that results in gullibility. He has not had any success in relationships since my mom and I bet he feels like his time was running out.

Now to this woman... oh I loathe her. I tried with her I really did. I gave her every effort I could. I tried everything. Inviting her out. Going to art classes and book club. But no matter what I and my sister did. As soon as we left our fathers (we live with our mom most the time) she would turn around and complain and act offended by something stupid or minuscule we did to our father which always resulted in us getting lectured by our father about how we need to treat her better. 

Eventually I quit trying and just kept up the basic civility you would treat a distant relative. Which resulted in more lectures. Eventually I got so tired of it that I found reasons not to come around. Selfishly forgetting about my sister. Since I’m 19 and she’s 13 I’m no longer required visitation while she is. 

Well recently my sister has been coming back in tears from his house every weekend because she constantly sasses and ices her out (won’t make eye contact or talk to her when dads around, makes snotty comments to her when our father can’t hear) and then if my sister says something back lady goes and tattles and my sister gets yelled at. She’s 13 and doesn’t know how to defend herself. 

As a result I have been going with her everyday I can because I don’t want her to be alone with that witch. And she’s less bitchy around me because I have a voice and will say something. but I can’t always be there due to my work and school schedule. 

I can handle her hating me because I’m almost an adult and am able to separate myself but the fact that she’s targeting my sister (A FUCKING KID) I can’t take anymore.

I haven’t done anything drastic because I want to keep the peace. And I just want our dad to be happy. He loves this lady. For whatever reason. And if it takes him never seeing me for him to just be happy I would be okay with that forever. It hurts. But if I knew he was happy I could cope. 

But more than just her attitude towards us she’s emotionally abusive twords my father. She constantly threatens to leave. and insults his abilities in front of his family, for Christ sake. She makes a scene every public outing. And I worry about him. 

I feel trapped because he is lonely. He needs somebody. And I’m afraid if he loses her he could harm himself. But at the same time she’s toxic and i know if I make an issue of this she might walk out. And then he will blame us for it. 

Plus I love my sister more than anyone in the world and I will NOT let this continue. I’m about to not let her go over there anymore (idc he can get the cops involved no sane judge would make a 13 go to a place they feel unwelcome) 

My mom is very involved in the situation but legally right now she has to give him visitation. 

And we love our father to death. We want to see him. But we can’t bare to do it with her around anymore and I can’t give him an ultimatum. Because that’s just wrong, plus I’m afraid of his decision. 

TLDR: my toxic stepmom is trying to make our father turn against us and wants us out of their lives. And we are about to quit because he won’t fix it.

Sometimes I have people who are suicidal and upset, often the suicidal ones make 'jokes' about suicide or talk about feeling suicidal, but sometimes it's not just talk and they are a serious cause for concern. 

Today a client was distressed, had a panic attack and couldn't breathe, then started talking about suicide. I'm worried I messed up - I put my hand on her arm/shoulder and hand on multiple occasions to comfort her, when she was having trouble breathing I told her to stop talking as she was struggling but it turns out she was trying to say she wanted her inhaler (it was in her car, maybe if I'd known I'd suggested she grab it), also I noticed she'd written down the name of the local therapist so I inquired about it as I wanted to know if she had support and I asked if she had friends to support her but I worry I was being too personal with my questions. I was in no position to get her information on mental health support groups/she was in no position to self-refer, I think she rally just needed to go home to rest a that point. 

I'm a caring person but in the sense that I'm good at sorting things out for people/helping them help themselves, I'm empathetic but I'm no good at knowing how to show empathy or how to deal with people upset like this to try to comfort them. I try to validate their feelings but I just feel fake with the 'there there, it's okay' kind of talk. 

I'm suicidal myself and know the standard spiel is to give a suicide hotline number, which I can't stand as it's not real help, but I'm not sure what else might help - if she was in a better state and I'd had access to my computer I'd have given her some details of local mental health charities that may have been able to help while she waits to see a therapist (very long waiting list for the local therapy). Also when I'm suicidal I look and act no different to any other time, while this woman was clearly incredibly distressed, I don't know how I'd like to be treat if I were in her position. 

What could I have done differently/better?

741,So I was going on dates with this one girl and we stopped seeing each other. Found myself without a prom date so a friend in our group paired me with one of her friends. I got her number today. What are some good/funny ways to start conversation and getting to know each other ?,20Mar2019,1
742,"My best friend of about 20 years (we've been very close friends since we were 8) told me a few months ago that she is jealous of me because I have a child and she does not. She told me that that is why she ""hasn't been around lately"" (ya know...since I gave birth 19 months ago). This, of course, hurt my feelings (cue [Flight Of The Concords, *Hurt Feelings*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuJzSTNDUGI)) . Am I worth so little to her that me having a child can cause her to drop me out of her life almost completely?   


Also, now she is doing things to purposely try to make me jealous of her. It is very obvious what she is doing (she'll say things like ""haven't you always wanted to buy a house?"" after she messages me about her having bought a house) and I don't want to play this game. I am not jealous of her and I feel like she is constantly comparing our lives and trying to feel like she is better than me. I don't care to participate in any of that. What should I do? Ignore her? Try to understand where she's coming from? Keep my distance? ",20Mar2019,1
743,"Hi I am 18M and i am currently in me 2nd last year before I go to collage, I believe I want to study Game design and coding but I know i also can do way better in school and on top of that go back to gym and even learn how to play the guitar which I have been meaning to do. I find myself often writing homework down and never doing them and I haven't gone gym in weeks if not months because I simply just don't care enough to do any of those thing but I know in a year especially with Study I am going to seriously regret it. How do you guys keep yourselves motivated?",20Mar2019,1
744,"I’m using a questionable account right now because I don’t want my friend to find out I posted this (she doesn’t use reddit but she knows my main account).

I’m so panicked right now because I just heard my friend say that she doesn’t want to live anymore. I’m sure there is no way that asking here could help but I’m running out of options

My friend, who is in high school, found out recently from the doctor that she has depression and anxiety. She confided in me, and I gave her my support, making sure she knew I was there for her. I asked her about her symptoms and what I could do to help and she told me that while she never believed she had it, she constantly goes through depressive states. She also told me yesterday that she is going through a depressive state right now. She told me that she feels useless; her grades have been slipping, she’s more conscious than ever about her weight, and she feels like nobody really cares about her, no matter the appearance they put up. I did my best to reassure her, and especially made sure she knew I cared about her. But if I was concerned and worried for her yesterday, I’m scared out of my mind today.

I always knew that her parents are of the super strict type, and from her description they had seemed like “tough love” kind of parents. But today she told me that she had had a horrible day, and when I asked her what happened, she told me these things:

• Her mom had just finished yelling at her for something like 45 minutes that her condition wasn’t real, and it was just an excuse for her to be lazy.

• Her family constantly fat shames her. She doesn’t exactly have the figure of a spaghetti noodle, but she sure as hell isnt morbidly obese. But because of the constant emotional abuse, she believes that she is. Even her twin brother makes fun of her. It’s horrible.

• Her mom HIT HER before school started, and called her a useless bitch while yelling at her in public.

• Her family is extremely sexist towards her, and not only is her twin brother allowed much more freedom (She has never been allowed to stay at someone’s house, or have anyone over), but he is encouraged to think she’s inferior.


She told me today that she didn’t want to live anymore, and quickly followed up by saying she wouldn’t act on it. Not ok. I panicked, hard. I strongly suggested that she go and get help from someone that could do something, and she was opposed to it, as she didn’t want to be a burden on anybody else. Additionally, she told me that her parents had threatened her with “things you don’t even want to know” if they found out she had talked behind their back.

Please, someone, anyone, tell me what I can do to help her out. She stopped replying to me, and is just reading my messages so that I know she’s ok. But I’m scared. Somebody please help me I don’t know what to do.",20Mar2019,1
745,"Kind of a funny story, but part of my job is Esports broadcasting, and I like to have a bit of a coffee boost to stay alert before I get behind the casting desk. 

Unfortunately, I can't exactly get bathroom breaks while live. It can be mildly uncomfortable and distracting while I'm trying to commentate, particularly during long games. Bless the gaming chairs, many a cheek has been clenched upon them.

I'm not super strict about it, but I generally avoid caffeinated and sugar loaded items unless I know it's gonna be a long day, it's a social situation, or I need to be particularly energetic.

Either way, tea is a but mild for what I need, and things like coffee and energy drinks just make me need the loo while live. Any suggestions?

TLDR: Caffeine makes me poo, and I dislike secretly clenching in front of a live camera for several hours.",20Mar2019,1
746,"So here’s the thing, I accidentally liked a girl’s pic from a long time ago, it’s a problem I have, and I’m super nervous. It’s Spring break so I’m hoping that she would forget about it, but it’s also a girl I have one class with. How the heck do I stop this? ",20Mar2019,0
747,"So, I'm 17, next month I'll be 18. I've recently been diagnosed with dysmenorrhea that may be endometriosis. And as a result of this I've missed so much school I'm talking weeks every month because of the chronic pain and medication. My grades have completely went down and I'm thinking of dropping out to do an online GED program in hopes that I can work at my own pace. I'm a senior and it sucks to have to do this but I don't know what else to do. ",20Mar2019,1
748,"I am working really hard to improve my social skills and make friends. But it still feels I am not doing enough. As I child, I failed to find a group of people, with the exception of my early teens. Still today it feels that everyone belong to groups: gamers/ computer geeks, party people, musicians, sports people, and so on. I am having issues choosing a group. I am still searching for my place despite being 24 years old. I lost most of my teenage years to depression and loneliness, autism is really a curse. Some people say you don’t have to be in a group, just be nice in general. How do your circle of friends look like? Should I focus on just socializing or make an effort to fit in a group? Thanks in advance for advice!",20Mar2019,2
749,"So first some background information. I(18M) live in the Midwest and she(19F) is in Washington. We haven't met in person yet and now I kinda doubt that we will. The relationship was only a thing for about 2 weeks before I ended it. 

If I had to give a quick explanation of what happened it would be that I ultimately ended it because I didn't fully trust her and I overreacted.

I don't know how to proceed from here, I've texted her an apology and I acknowledged what I did and how I was feeling when I did it. It doesn't seem like there are many hard feelings but she hasn't talked to me seriously since it happened. ",20Mar2019,1
750,I’m in 8th grade and have strict parents. Throughout all my years of middle school I always have gotten a 3.5 GPA and higher. I feel like they expect too much from me. Yesterday I failed to get a 3.5. My parents are furious. What should I do?,20Mar2019,1
