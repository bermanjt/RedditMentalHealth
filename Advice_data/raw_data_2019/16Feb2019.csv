0,"So I joined the release team at work a bit over 6 months ago (a gaming company). Not long after I joined, my new co-worker 'H' convinced me she was my boss, and began gaslighting me to try and get rid of me. I guess I didn't fit into her 'clique' collection of humans in her team - and I do mean collection. It nearly worked, I broke down in front of our real boss at one point, after that she backed off some. His advice was just to own my work... whatever that means but said he'd help me move elsewhere in the company if I wanted.

I found out from someone else she'd done this to one of her team mates before to control her and she's too afraid to talk about it now, doesn't want to rock the boat because she's calmed down. It was only then I realised what she was doing but had no proof.

I only found out last week she isn't actually my team lead, we're on the same level, she said 'I don't know why you think I'm your boss, you're just very pliant I guess'. My impression was that she was a team lead, and our real boss is a manager and no one questioned it or corrected me. She's manipulative as all hell. She actually keeps the real boss in the dark on most things, and stays friendly with the upper management. She'd even started making me write up my specialist knowledge justifying it as 'for training others', I'm sure she was trying to ensure she could replace me somehow.

**Today I Screwed Her Plans**

For months H has been flat out refusing to learn to use a core piece of company software (git hub), everyone uses it except her team. She's been getting a tech team to write their own crap version of it from scratch that does what she wants it to do. It's costing the company a lot, wasting everyone's time, and the product is terrible to use - I know because I'm the one who has to use it almost exclusively. No one else seems to realise it's even happening and I'm only barely involved.

It's in my objectives right now to provide suggestions and improvements for the software so I wrote a solid constructive email on why the new software is not fit for purpose, suggested some simple changes that would legitimately make what we have now work really well applied to another task, salvaging it completely for the company, bridging the departments, and making my life easier - albeit at the expense of completely wrecking her intentions.

**No Idea What to Do Now**

I don't know what will happen come Monday, I didn't call out how she's been wasting company time and money on a frivolous task but it's a challenge to her control of everything. I'm sure she'll begin making my life difficult again and trying to mess with me to 'put me back in my place'.

I honestly don't know how to fight her, or even if I can. I don't think I can prove anything or that anyone will believe me. I'm not much of a fighter, and honestly I think I'm scared of what's going to happen now I've stood up for myself in some way.

Sorry it's a long read, but any advice would be appreciated.",16Feb2019,1
2,"Recently I took a new job, migrating from consulting in to a front end software engineering role. One of the biggest reasons I left consulting was because I didn‚Äôt feel technically stimulating day to day, but I had an important role at the company and I was well respected. Now, a month into the new job and I‚Äôm realizing that most developers here are just grunt workers, tasked with doing work that has already been designed and decided on by someone else. So far, seems like there is very little creativity happening by any of the devs, particularly when it comes to the look and feel of what they are working on. To top it off, it‚Äôs been pulling teeth trying to get anyone on my team to help me learn the codebase. I feel like I‚Äôm on an island, and I feel like dead weight.

3,I would like to get a summer job but I'm not sure how (I'm in canada btw). I know I can apply here and there but im just not sure about the right methods to use to get a job. It's hard because im a student in college and I just want a job so I can get a car. I already have a car but it's not really mine it's my parents I just use it all the time. I guess my mom also wants me to start pulling my weight a little bit. I dont want to work at a restaurant cause I've worked at one before and its sucks. My mom said i should be a lifegirad but i got my qualifications for that a while ago and there's one step missing i haven't done so i cant even apply for that. I also dislike people alot so I'm looking for a simple job with little human interaction or a small scale business that I can work at. I know this is far fetched cause everyone wants a good minimum wage job but still. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks yall. ,16Feb2019,1

Him: Well I do feel more at peace now and it was clear that resentment and ill will had decreased but we didn‚Äôt necessarily talk about that stuff directly is what Im saying.

Me: Oh well now we kind of have talked about where we stand. Just kind of thought about it recently and was like wow that felt good to be nice to you and understanding for a change. I wish you the best in the future and thanks for agreeing to chat, I appreciate it!

9,"I'm 23M, recently graduated and staying home to save money while I work. We have lived in this house for 21 years, it was built in the 70s I believe and it's in rough shape now due to our climate (Canada). With the massive snow recently, the house is beginning to leak through the ceiling and windows in some areas. We had the ceiling fixed a few years ago but the amount of snow is too much and it can't handle it. This is just one of many things that needs to be done. The house's insulation is no longer adequate and it gets very hot during summer with AC on and very cold in winter with heat on. The poor insulation causes ice dams to form on the roof which is likely the cause of the leaks. We've had no shortage of work done to improve the house but there's always a few things that come up. 

My mom has been wanting to move out for years but my father has been against it for whatever reason. Not like wholeheartedly against it, but I've received pushback when I bring up the things that we need to do (e.g. selling off old stuff we don't use, getting X or Y fixed). It has gotten to the point where my mom is seriously talking to me about moving in with her sister across the country. She feels trapped in this house and I can't do anything about it either so I feel insanely stressed.

I don't know the financial details so I'm not sure if my father's unwillingness to move is due to money or just the sheer amount of work that would have to be done to allow us to sell this house. We have LOTS of stuff in our basement that would have to be sorted through and thrown out in order to accommodate for a new house. Not like hoarders or anything but there's a lot of stuff, whether it's just old business files to family stuff.

I seriously don't know what to do. I've talked to my dad many times about what needs to be done and that we need to start getting work done but this is as bad as I've seen it. I've never seen my mom seriously consider leaving him but it's gotten to that point. How do I deal with this? I have no fucking clue what to do. I feel powerless. I can't help financially, and telling my dad that we need to do X will only cause him to get angry and stressed. My siblings don't really know the full extent of what's going on since they don't live here nor do they know what my mom has said to me. ",16Feb2019,1

11,"A few weeks ago I was in a Walmart parking lot sitting in the car with a friend. We left and a middle aged bald white guy with Oakley sunglasses started following us in a big truck. We made some weird turns and he kept following us so my friend decided to park. I don't know why. He was gone for a little but then he suddenly pulled up next to us and he was recording us with his phone. Then he went down to some friends of ours parked a ways down and recorded them too. We weren't doing anything suspicious or illegal neither were our friends. But I didn't think anything of it. 

A week later I'm leaving guitar center. It's pouring rain and there's no one in the parking lot. Except one car that was parked and had it's lights on in the distance. I leave and it follows me. It was a little grey sedan and it followed me all the way to about a half mile from my house and recorded me with their phone the entire way. I also made weird turns to make sure and again I wasn't doing anything wrong. 

Today I was driving back to school to get something I forgot and a black Tesla started following me with about 10 minutes left of the drive. I hurried to the school where I figured I'd be safe with there being so many people. I got to school and parked in the back. The Tesla parked towards the front where I'd have to pass right by it to get inside. At the time I thought maybe since this guy didn't record me he wasn't one ""them"" and that he was just picking up someone so I went inside. I saw that it was an old dark skinned guy that could have been any race. When I came back out he was still there and he went on his phone as soon as he saw me. There was a long line of cars trying to get out on the side so I started my car and started to drive towards the exit. So did he. I pulled back into a spot just before getting in the line and he got stuck in it. I went a different way home. And now I'm writing this

I'm fucking scared what the fuck is going on.

14,"She basically wants laser surgery for eczema scarring and jawline reduction botox. Shes extremely awkward and has no friends. She has tantrums and makes my mom and dad listen to them over the phone. Apparently pur dad forces her into computer science which is true she wanted to be a marketing major. She isnt doing too well in her upper div classes and flunking out which i also think has to do with the fact she spends wayy too much time researching plastic surgery and having tantrums over that. Today she gave my parents an ultimatum to either pay for lasering away her eczema scars and jaw botox or shes dropping out of college. Our dad tries to make her understand she only has 1.5 years of college left and she can do whatever she wants with her body as long as it isnt invasive and nothing unnessary like lip fillers. But she doesnt want to listen she feels like she wasted her teen years and early twenties being scarrerd and is on the verge on giving up on life.  We dont really understand how to keep her in school as she really doesnt really have anything to keep her afloat i mean she has no friends so its not like she has anyone to feel ashamed abt dropping out.

Also she has this dumb notion that being prettier means she gets to be more dumb.

18,"First off, if there is a reddit page I can use to reach out better about this, please let me know! :)

Okay so to make this as short as possible I have been referred to a Eating Disorder Clinic in Canada, (Yes, I'm Canadian, just to clear that out of the obvious way, but hey people travel for health problems). Due to multiple traumas and PTSD I have picked up the ""un-named eating disorders"" diagnosis. I'm just curious as to how the professional who handles the sick people goes about helping them. I would prefer a one on one, not a group kind of thing. I'm incredibly shy so definitely wanting to talk one on one. How hard is/was it to switch eating habits and feel healthy again, mentally and physically, how long does/did it take?

About me: I'm just over 5'1"", 23 going on to 24. I'm naturally quite petite but I'm severely malnourished, dropped nearly 20 pounds in just over a month, closer to two months. I went from 128lbs to 112lbs. Still fluctuating in weight as I am trying to get better with my diet. I have just started to document (as of today) what I eat/drink and my exercise to see my progress.. Hopefully progress. I have not been below 115lbs since elementary school. Which was over 10 years ago. Usually I am around 120lbs-125lbs. But because I am quite short and how my body adds and loses fat/muscle it is quite hard to notice I've dropped so much weight. You can only really tell because of my torso showing too much bones, i.e. collarbone, spine, ribs, hips. I also love baggy clothing so my family never really noticed my weight. Just how little I could eat. I'm incredibly anxious for change and how well my body and mind will handle the process of getting better. But I'm excited to feel human again. Any advice is appreciated or even a guide to a reddit page I can post on for more advice/help? Not sure where else to post besides here.

Thanks Redditors. :)",16Feb2019,1

20,"So I go to a university where everyone who goes to it has to go to Germany for one year to study and do an internship. In my 4th year a girl started approaching me but I use to ignore her most of the time, she wasn‚Äôt my type and all of her conversations have no meaning and full of bullshit plus she has eating disorder, daddy‚Äôs issues, some chronic diseases plus she was really short, but she kept going on following me asking for random stuff, she even used to skip her lectures to just talk to me. So in the end I said I would give her a chance. At the beginning everything was going well and great, but she was too clingy she would keep texting me 24/7 and to call me all the time even if I was with my family or my friends or studying for an exam, later on she started telling why do your parents hate you, why your friends are shit and so on , we used to fight about this shit. Later on she started to get so naggy and with mood swings she started telling how depressed she is and how her dad treats her ‚Äì even though her father was treating her well- and he doesn‚Äôt trust her and how she developed trust issues then I started to figure out how she keeps lying to me and hide stuff from me, and I confronted her about and we moved forward. Now it was time to pick in which city in Germany we are going to go to (we were not from the same major so we had a few cities in common to pick from) she went like a self cunt and picked a city that‚Äôs I can‚Äôt go to and she asked to pick a city near her and cried about it and acted like she would die without being near me so I picked a city with a really hard university, just to be somehow close to her (3hours by train) and I ignored my friends who asked me to go with them. After few months she was really depressed because she stopped doing yoga and some of her hobbies, and started to blame me for it, later on she said let‚Äôs take a break from each other for a while so she can get her life together, and I agreed. At this point for some reason I was madly in love with her so I didn‚Äôt wait for too long and I started to talk to her again but she was cold and kept giving me hints to break up for good after a while I was pissed and told her okay let‚Äôs break up if you want to that bad, and I blocked her on WhatsApp and Facebook then she  started to call me time after time so I blocked her number then she took he  sisters number and started calling but I turned of my phone. The next day she came to me at the university while she‚Äôs crying begging me to get back with her, and like a retard I did and everything went back to normal, a few months later she went to Germany before me after that she turned into a fuckin cold bitch barely talking to me and shit after her in a week I went to Germany, I met an old friend over there and hanged out with him and every time I go out with my friend that bitch starts to call me. And when I call her while she‚Äôs out with people from her university she starts a fuckin drama about how I don‚Äôt let her have fun with them. Later on every time I call her she starts telling me that shes busy studying and shit even though she didn‚Äôt study a shit and she would only call me before she sleeps and she doesn‚Äôt say a shit. During that time I started to have suicidal thoughts because I was struggling with the university and couldn‚Äôt pass the tests, I was alone , my German is shit, my old friend left for over a month. It was hard for me to create friendships due to language barrier. After that I told her about my suicidal thoughts she told me don‚Äôt come to me go to one of your friends. I was really struggling with having a reason to live, I was too depressed, I only left my room to buy cigarettes other than that I didn‚Äôt do anything. And I couldn‚Äôt tell me parents about it so they don‚Äôt worry about their son who‚Äôs far away from them. So I called on of my friends he was 6 hours by train from me and I went to him and stayed there for a while after that I went to that bitch and we talked about everything and we made up the next day me and that bitch went to get pizza then out of nowhere she no longer wants to eat and started acting weirdly and out of nowhere she mocked my suicidal thoughts, I was furious and burned out and told her to fuck off she walked away for a little bit then came back to me and started apologizing. We made up again after a while she went back to be moody af and asking for stuff. During this whole time I bought her shitloads of stuff, took care of her when she got really sick, stood by her side when she needed me. At the beginning of August I found a good offer to go back home because I wanted to go back to visit my family since I haven‚Äôt seen them in like 6 months, plus my sister in law was going to give birth to the first grandchild in our family. And when I told the bitch about my plan she started to beg me not to leave her and to stay with her  and the we can go somewhere for fun somewhere in Germany or  around it for a  cheap price because she didn‚Äôt has enough money to go back home . So I listened to her like a retard after 10 days she called me and told me her father booked a ticket to go back home to see her family and the cheap ticket that I have found was gone. I  was really pissed but I let go 3 days after that she called and broke up with me. After that she started to call me and cry how she still loves me, later on she sends me please don‚Äôt rape me and shit like that then she would call to check up on me and begs me not go clubbing and drink  a lot, I blocked her but she kept finding a way to get to me. At this point I was really mentally fucked up I failed everything at the university, I‚Äôm in the middle of nowhere with no one near or besides me I wanted to kill myself so bad but that bitch stopped me, until now I‚Äôm still mentally fucked up even though I‚Äôm traveling around meeting new people here and there.

Where to start?? My mum and I didn't have the greatest relationship when u was growing up, even as an adult I view lots of the stuff she did as unfair or wrong. It culminated in me being kicked out whilst still in school and having to live in a hostel (as an aside it wasnt my behaviour that made her kick me out she did it as a choice between me and my abusive step dad). So as u can imagine I didn't have the best of starts to adult life but I can honestly say I have done my best. I am a single parent and work lots of hours to take care of me and my daughter.
I went to uni to better myself and make a better life for us-worked my ass off, got my degree and some stuff happened which meant I couldn't work as much as needed to, and this combined with the rising cost of living meant I got into a lot of debt Very quickly. After suffering what I think looking back was a bit of a break down due to the massive amounts of anxiety debt collectors and court judgements bring I made the crazy hard decision to move in with my mum as I was drowning.
Now it's important to mention that my mum and I have done a lot of work on our relationship and she has helped me as much as she can in recent Years, and I have forgiven her for the past. Now I'm super super grateful to my mum for her incredibly kind offer of us living with her and I don't underestimate how hard it must be  for her too to have to live with us but my issue is this- I work 70+hours a week atm and I have 6 more months before I'm in the clear, but the living situation is becoming intolerable. My mum never ever tells me if she is unhappy with anything I have done (she is very passive aggressive) but when I'm not there she takes everything out on my daughter. She shouts at her/speaks to her horridly, and is very unfair in what she says. My lovely daughter must be one of the only teenagers ever who cleans the house regularly without being asked-she tidies up after all of us!! Today whilst I'm working she has cleaned everywhere beautifully, my mum came home and shouted and swore at her for the house being 'messy' (it really wasn't) and then later admits it's because she has had a bad day!!
I 100% do NOT want my daughter to have to go thru what I went thru as a teenager, and I feel so unhappy and uncomfortable there. If I move out now I'm still in debt and back in the same situation killing myself to make ends meet-working so much I never get to spend any quality time with my daughter (I'm painfully aware my time with her is finite); whereas if we stay I can be debt free then have the mental energy to persue better paid roles, get a little cash behind me and start out in a much better situation.... I just don't know what to do!! I'm sorry if this is vague or disjointed ita just quite hard to explain it all!!
So-stay and see my daughter suffer or leave and be back in a situation that made me an absent parent due to my mental health living with such massive anxiety.. Which impacts on her also! Advice pls xx",16Feb2019,1
27,"I'm a 9th grader, and I wanted some advice in how to become a stronger, faster, and overall a better, healthier person. What I want to ask is how. I know there are recommended things to do, and workouts, but I think I need it directly from someone in my ‚Äòextended family‚Äô - reddit. So I'm asking you guys, please help. I am a dancer, and this is part of the reason I want to get stronger/healthier. I dance for two hours three times a week. I have two other days during the week in which I can stay and workout for about one hour. I'm relatively thin, yet I have barely some muscle on my arms, such that I can't really flex. My core is not strong really, I can run a mile in like 9-10 minutes. I really want you guys help so I ask you this: can someone create me a schedule according to my free periods in the picture and my after school times that I can run, again in the picture? I do have access to a gym with tons of equipment, if you name it I probably have access to it. The school also has a track. Can you also tell me what I should be doing, if I want to be able to run cross country next year, and to get some muscle on my arms. It would also be great if someone told me how I should eat, my parents are pretty lenient in that area, I can eat food that is good for me at dinner and breakfast, or not eat at all, and the lunch at my school has a ton of great options (I go to a private school so they have a great lunch menu, so tell me something to eat and I can most likely eat it). Even if the workout it somewhat grueling for me, I'm great at making myself strain pretty well, to the point where someone else may collapse. Also, if you want to give me just one aspect, like the schedule of my workouts or food or types of workouts, even just what I should do for breakfast/lunch/dinner, or what I should do for working out my legs or arms, it would be great. I will post the schedule, including the workouts and food, when I'm done making it, or if someone makes the whole thing, I'll take that. Redditors, I really love this community, and have been apart of it for so long, and I would go to only you guys for advice. Thanks so much to everyone. By the way, I'm not in it for the karma, I'm in it because you guys are awesome to go to for advice. Thanks so much!

30,"I'm currently a sophomore in college and I've been really down lately. I just moved out of the dorms cause my roommates and I were having problems. Since then I realized that I don't really have any good friends. I have a bunch of acquaintances from classes and other things but I only have 3 people that I actually hang out with and none of them are helping me succeed in college because two of them are more distracting that anything and the other one is really controlling. My first semester I had a couple of really good friends that not only hung out with me but also would help me to do better in school. But after that semester, one graduated and the other dropped out. Ever since then I haven't felt like my friend group is what I wanted it to be. I feel like everyone else has their group of friends and always get along and help each other but I don't. I've tried making new friends by going to clubs, being friendlier in class, and trying to tag along with my friends' other friend groups but it hasn't been working. Because of all of this I've been feeling depressed a lot of the time and my grades are suffering for it. I currently have below a 30% in 3 of my 4 classes and I honestly am not sure if I want to do college anymore. I know that getting a degree would help me reach my goal of being a software engineer but I don't feel like I can stay unless I start feeling better again.

My husband is gone all the time, and I feel like I just need more people to talk to. It's really hard to make friends, and working from home doesn't help. I'm not fond of apps that are for meeting people, because that usually turns out weird or suspicious. So...yeah. what should I do? There aren't really as activities where I live designed for meeting people. I feel super isolated and lonely most of the time, and I don't want to be like this anymore.",16Feb2019,1
32,"Hi guys, 

So for a bit of context I‚Äôm a senior in HS with Asian parents. I‚Äôve always gotten good grades, etc and my parents never really let me go out with friends until just last year. I always had to be home by 9PM, then 10PM by the end of the year. By the end of last year they were comfortable with me going out until 11:30 PM which gave me a lot more flexibility with hanging out with friends, going to some parties etc.

About a week into 2019 I was driving back home at 11:00 and hit a deer. Luckily I was okay and my car only took minimal damage which I got fixed within a few days for $500. However, since that day my parents have gotten all paranoid about me going out late. My dad suddenly thinks it‚Äôs too dangerous to go out at night and immediately told me that if I am out past 8PM. Of course I argued a bit which just made things worse and I just got my phone back after over a month of losing it. 

I simply cannot convince him that an 8PM curfew is ridiculous and is really messing things up for me. For starters I go to the gym on weekdays at 10:30-11:30 daily. This is because I get home at 2:30, do homework until 5ish, then work from 6-10. Now I have been working from 4-8 instead, and then doing homework at night. Haven‚Äôt been able to go to the gym in a month. Additionally I haven‚Äôt hung out with any of my friends since then, as we always do stuff from 7-12 essentially (and they stay out later) and being home at 8 really messes things up. 

This has really been causing me some distress and I haven‚Äôt been able to even reason with him without him yelling and taking away something (like the keys to the car I paid for) for a few days just for ‚Äúarguing.‚Äù I‚Äôm going to be going to college at Northwestern in basically 6-7 months and the fact that he is being more strict then ever and not letting me enjoy my last few months at home really sucks. How can I reason with him and go back to how things were? ",16Feb2019,1
33,"So, backstory: dated this guy on and off for several years. Got along amazingly, but we were just not to be. We were better friends than lovers, and he really got upset when I brought this to his attention and he cut ties with me completely.

Fast forward over 2 years. I‚Äôm dating someone I have amazing chemistry with and I love dearly, and the ex is going through a breakup that is causing him to be miserable. I know he still hates me, so on anon, I wrote him a couple messages prompting him to talk about stuff he likes and saying kind things like I hope things get better and that he has many people that love and care for him. Just stuff that may cheer him up or make him less focused on his heartbreak.

He‚Äôs a wonderful person and a really sweet guy, but I know he still harbors a ton of anger toward me, and I wanted to send good vibes without being outright cause I think that‚Äôd ruin the message. I just want him to be happy, but I don‚Äôt want him to think I want him back, because I really don‚Äôt.

Now he is asking if it was me. I have no idea what to write back because I really didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd figure out it was me. What do I write back? Do I at all? Help",16Feb2019,1
34,"So towards the end of sophomore year I basically ruined all of my friendships because of a mistake I made. Junior year so far has been really hard for me because I don‚Äôt really have any friends any more. It honestly makes me feel like shit and I wanted to transfer in junior year but I wasn‚Äôt able to because the other school didn‚Äôt have the courses I want. 

I can now transfer to the other school but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have one really good friend that goes there so I‚Äôm not super worried that I‚Äôll have no friends. Plus they have way better courses than my current school that I‚Äôll be able to take. So the main reason I want to transfer is because I have no real friends and I guess the smaller reason is because they have the courses I want. Should I transfer? I feel like transferring in senior year would be difficult. I do know one really good friend there but we won‚Äôt have any classes together just because we differ in what we pursue. So for the most part, I won‚Äôt know anyone, which I‚Äôm kind of scared about. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do because on one hand maybe my relationships with my friends at my current school can get better. They always leave me out of things and it makes me feel like absolute shit. Also my school is really small so there‚Äôs not really a way to make new friends as I already know everyone and it‚Äôs kind of hard to find a new friend group at this point of high school.",16Feb2019,2
36,"I (26f) am falling. I‚Äôm falling hard for a coworker. My coworker (30m) and I both work at a production company in Denver. I‚Äôve known him for a year. My coworker and work on the same team, so we already work pretty close together. He‚Äôs an amazing person to be around. He‚Äôs really smart, absolutely hilarious, and it helps that he‚Äôs good looking. I‚Äôm just as hilarious. I make him laugh, but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm too good at my job or as good looking.

I‚Äôm not for sure if he likes me back. He likes me on friend terms, that‚Äôs for sure. He does try to get close to me whenever he stands by me. He laughs at (most of) my jokes and he has even invited me to hang out with him a few times. He‚Äôs even motivating me to be better at my job. He‚Äôs not my supervisor, but he‚Äôs taken on a mentor role with me and it‚Äôs making me fall even more for him when he‚Äôs showing me the ropes of the job we do.

Everything in me is telling me to ask him out. But my fear is too strong. I already have a friendship with this person, and I‚Äôm afraid of ruining that. I‚Äôve tried dating other people and it‚Äôs not helping me get over him. I just keep thinking about him. My anxiety stems from my past. I‚Äôve made the first move many times and I‚Äôve  been rejected. It hurts too much to be rejected. I‚Äôve tried ignoring my feelings and getting over him, and that didn‚Äôt work for me either.

Dino seems to be selfish, Righteous, and a snoop. but gets mad at me when i show a bit of any of those traits, here's a few of the minor actions:  
\- Makes fun of me for not talking

\- Yells at me to not look at him, talk to him, etc.

\- Bumps into me when i'm actively avoiding him

\- Gets mad at me for staying home from school.

\- Makes fun of me for not having many friends.

\- Looks at my computer while i'm gone

Those don't seem actions to come to this sub for, but there's 2 MAJOR Factors. 

For one, he exploits my Anxiety to entertain him, belittle me, and of course, get his way. He also makes fun of my Anger Issues and even going ""Waah! Waah!"" Tauntingly when I lose my temper. I thought he grew out of it but he still does it.

And Two, the most alarming part of this, he used to Assault me, No major wounds, just some bruises. it has been brought to a point where i'm actually scared and have to hide when ever he acts up. I'm using ""Used to"" lightly, he did it about 3-4 months ago.  


Its just seen as ""Dino being Dino"" and I don't bother telling anyone anymore. What should I do about this?

  
Let me know if you have any questions details:

My sister told me a couple years ago that our cousin (he is only a year older than her) sexually molested her 30+ years ago and told her ""it's ok because we aren't really related."" My mom knows about it now, although, I don't know when she found out, but I do know that when she found out she told my sister not to tell anyone including our aunt and uncle. I am not close with anyone in my family and honestly do not want to have them in my life at all anyway. To this day, when I see my cousin I just act like everything is normal, but am secretly thinking ""I know what you did."" My mom told my sister not to tell anyone for fear of how the family would react, which I think is bullshit. We are all adults now and I really just want him to know that he hasn't actually gotten away with anything.  He is 43 and still lives with his parents, has no job, is on disability and is severely overweight and has no social life. I'm aware that something must have happened to him in his life that caused him to do this and be the way he currently is. But that still doesn't mean it is right. My mom is too passive to stand up for anything even if she knows it is wrong. Even if it is for her own child. I am stubborn and will call you out on your shit if I see it with no fear.  I grew up with a verbally abusive dad and my mom never stood up to him a day in her life and neither did my sisters. I was the only one who ever stood up to him and I don't regret it. I really want to call my cousin out and let him know that this isn't a hidden secret. But I also wonder what the point is? What should I do if anything? I feel like our family is so fucked up and broken that it's like, who cares? But I know my mom and aunt would be devastated. But I also feel like someone should stick up for my sister who feels she can't do it for herself. What should I do? Say something or keep my big mouth shut?",16Feb2019,1
63,"So my former employer from my unpaid internship is trying to screw me by weaseling out of writing a reference, but he's one of my only 3 legally viable options.
And most good jobs require a minimum of 3 references.
what do?
(other than doing something that we'll get him to write a crappy reference that is)
As much as taking a nailgun to his spine would be satisfying I need him alive and in tact to make the job reference.
im just not sure how to approach this because he may have accidentally given me legal recourse to go after him
because apparently he's leaving his company in a month and not telling anyone
and he asked me to keep it quiet
even though
1)- he's offered me no incentive to keep this quiet, like giving me my damn reference.
and
2)- even if he was leaving the company it would have no bearing on his ability to give me reference, as he was my supervisor and as such qualifies to be a reference
I think he might be banking on the fact that im autistic for me to not to notice that he's trying to fuck me over

64,"im a 22 year-old sophomore college student, who works on a weekend part-time job and also loves music. 

So, my college journey hasn't been the brightest, I had some personal issues on my first year and really didn't study enough overall.  

I tried to introduce some discipline in my life, so I decided to buy a bullet journal and plan my schedule there, track expenses, and even write my own thoughts, which helps a great deal. 

But my problem is that whenever I plan things, I never get them done, and it leaves me devastated and senseless. I watch videos on how to get stuff done and organize my life better and stuff like that and I feel motivated for a couple days, then it all goes down the drain because I can't stick to a good routine, and its driving me insane. 

I want to study in my free time, organize classes and do some research, and I know I should do this every day. 
I want to do music, I play guitar and I sing and my main goal is to finish college and pursue music (won't go into details here). 
Also wanna spend time with my girlfriend, and not be stressed about how deorganized my life is. 
Then I have college friends, they throw parties and I feel like I'll lose all the fun if I don't go, even if I have due work. 

It's like my discipline is below negative. I can set goals but never work toward them. I have books to read and I like to but it's like there's always ""something"" else to do.  Then I feel like trash all the time for not doing anything productive.

Am I the only one like this ?

73,"
There's this extremily manipulative, victimizing girl who is trying to drag me into her shit. Let's call her Hanna. I used to know her in highschool when we went to church together, and she was the epitome of a perfect ~god fearing daughter of christ.~ She even thought Yoga was a sin because it had the potential to include a type of spirituality that wasn't Christian. 

So she was the pure one and I was the spawn of satan who didn't dress nice or have many friends because I'm introverted and prone to anxiety. I also enjoyed yoga. She played mind games with the boys, and for me if a guy was playing hard to get, I wasn't playing the game. She was the type of person who would crawl of the backs of others to get attention and validation, then turn it down. Why? No idea. But it often manifested in the form of hard to get. 

Anyway, I leave the church and two years later I meet my first boyfriend - we'll call him James. I also got to know his best friend who we'll call Will. Will has a crush on Hanna and tries to persue her. No big deal. Except for the fact that she already has a BF and is obsessed with the idea of forbidden love, so she strings Will along and says ""I'll break up with my BF,"" over and over but never does. Now, Will is obviously not making the best decision because he keeps going back for more, but she keeps feeding him hope. 

Hanna and I never talked during the time James and I were going out, and I was fine with that. She was actively hurting one of my friends on the side while posing as being perfectly happy with her actual BF to the rest of the world on social media, and her family and friends. It's like Will is her badboy fetish. He's got a really shitty life, and James is his only friend. They share an apartment together and just live in their own little bubble, doing what they love. 

So far the only thing I ever kind of heard from her was when she told Will I was ""weird,"" and it eventually circulated back to me. Alright. Not the worst thing to be called, and at least it was actually true. I was a weird depressed kid who painfully struggled to socialize back when she knew me. But damn why you got to try to make me look bad? It's not the worst thing ever, by far. But it made me aware of her intentions.

Once James and I broke up, I get a text after all this time of avoiding each other that says she wants to meet up and have drinks at a coffee shop. 
 
I'm annoyed. I set a date with the intention of confronting her about her toxicity. 

(Btw James and I are on good terms. We don't hang out because we don't have a lot in common, but we still care about each other's well being.) James can't stand her because she's using his best friend. He also told me that she started coming around the appartement, giving him vibes that she pities me because we broke up. He completely supports me telling her that she's not a good person, because that's what he would do. 

But the thing is... I've never confronted anyone in my life! I'm an extemely anxious, nonconfrontaional person. I tend to go with the flow, and stay out of anything that takes too much emotional energy. She could have just stayed out of my life instead of trying to powerplay the whole situation. And she's betting on me not bringing up anything sketchy she's done, because she's the manipulative type who plays mindgames while appearing perfect on the surface.  I think she expects me to be the same way. I'm worried that if I bring something up, she'll pretend to be shocked, and hurt that I would ever think such a thing.

And I don't want to be like, ""You're a bitch ass hoe etc... Etc..."" No. I want to lay out what I see she fools everyone else on, in a short and sweet but concise way. Let her know I am not going to be manipulated, and I can see that she's not more righteous than anyone else, because she doesn't give 2 shits based on how she uses people and tears them down. 

Does this sound like a bad idea? I feel like if I ignore it, she's going to have won her control over me and my image. Or is that just my pride trying to reason for me? Should I just ignore it? I definitely don't want her befriending me for whatever reason she's got goinf on in the back of her mind. Especially if she thinks she's ""winning"" because she's got the attention of James and Will, and thinks rubbing it in my face will make me jealous. Or if she's acting out of pity. 

And if I do confront her, how do I keep my emotions and anxiety at bay? The last thing I want is to get flustered or passionate about it. Ideally I would be able to handle the situation in a calm, collected way, while not getting beat by her victimization. 

Also a side note - I don't want to speak for anyone else like Will or James. I understand they've got to make their own decisions on the matter, and I shouldn't use her cheating and my dislike of her hurting my friend as a reason to bring this up. I think I'm aiming to just use my expirience with her, and the observations I've made to call her out if/when she starts sending subliminal messages of bitchy passive aggression. ",16Feb2019,1

78,"hey. so this post is probably going to be a big one. recently i got into some shit with my parents which has gotten pretty extreme. right now my situation is ( or was ) at  a extreme point which ill explain really soon, so it's gonna be a little bit of a story so im sorry if its along. i dont know how to explain this and im new to using reddit so if this is in the wrong spot i heavily apologize. i apologize if theres alot of mispellings, i type fast and i don't proof-read my shit lmao.

I am a 15 year old boy ( 16 in 7 months but thats irrelevant) and i've recently gotten into a situation thats so awful that legit two of my friends think it's abuse. So, two days my mom found out ive had more than one instagram account. she is p strict on it and has gotten mad at me in the past about it so that day she scolded at me about it and showed my dad my contents of those two accounts ( mainly my art account) and saod how much she hates society and that its disgusting and how a lady was right that you have to check a kids phone. Dinner rolls by and my mom thought it would be nice to tell me that i'll be the ugliest bot but the prettiest girl ( i hate to admit it, but im a trans man) and went on saying how i never had sex so how do i know, that she'll never ever accept it, that i need to figure myself out, how im too scared of anything to be a ""manly man"", how lgbt shit is banned from the house, etc.

now honestly, i've came out to my mom before and she didn't take it very well, mainly came out mad and told me the most negative yet confusing the response that i'm still confused about it to this day. but she wasn't this negative about it to outright say  that i can do whatever i want when im in collage but ill be an ugly boy and shit. That's all this is right? Me crying about my transphobic mother? Nah, wrong. 

So after that and my dad trying to talk to me about my identity saying stuff like kids thinking they have to be something and one gender and all that. the next day rolls by and nothing really happens expect my dad telling me my mom is crying thinking she fucked up and telling me to give her a hug or talk to her. ofc i didn't since 

1. i was pissed off at her for saying such things to me infront of me and my dad
2. i was afraid of her. i dont know why but i was

and spent the rest of my day in my room. Today goes by and my mom kinda mistreated me for the stuff that happened two days ago like being a smart ass about how i said a question and shit. So after my mom left the living room me and my dad were watching a movie on netflix until my mom told my dad to pause the movie just to show me that i blocked all my family members on my art account and went on to say stuff like "" how can we trust you?"" 

A lot of shit happens today. **a lot of it**

so much that i hate to say it but my mind is FRIED from all of it and how much crying ive been doing.  so ill try my best to explain what happned and try my best remember stuff.

my mom scolds me and then says she's had enough and literally throws my phone in the garbage. im not joking. if i could  go and dig for it i would but it's literally covered in piles of food. My parents then try to get me to talk. I dont due to how afraid i and embarassed i am to talk to my parents and they get frustrated. I am and still pissed at my mom for many things other than literally throwing my phone away so i give her the deathstare and mom is constantly saying stuff like "" why are you looking at me like that? why are you crying? what's there to cry about? if you're crying over your phone honestly i feel so sorry for you"" etc.

My mom leaves the room back and forth, my dad more chill than her and trying to get me to at least speak to him but once again im afraid. 

i know my father, he's a blabber mouth. if i told him stuff he might tell my mom. plus he's still new to me, he's my step-father and has only been with me for a few years so obviously i don't trust him as much yet as i used to with my mom whos been with me forever. 

My mom still scolds me and later then gets so pissed that she told me that she'll fucking strangle me and starts crying saying how she fucked up raising "" a bitch"" and said how even my family memebers say that my behaviour is ""shit"" as if i literally act like a fucker even though i think its just me being the average teen and being on my phone too much and acting as if we are rich motherfuckers and living in a mansion and im being ungrateful, etc etc. and saying how i have everything a girl would want, how evrything i have is my  mom's now and how im now not allowed to close my door, how she'll keep my dumby acc she follows but implies that she'll change the password and I HAVE TO ask for it to use it ( she wont, she always says she'll do something to me but never does it) and how to get me to speak she has to go crazy. she called me a lot of stuff like a bitch, a motherfucker ( including calling my dad that) and other things that i don't remember.

she also said that ( or at least i THINK she said in a way) that she doesn't care anymore and she doesn't care if the state takes me and how she won't go to jail for being my ass. i did try and explain stuff like how the reason why i made multiple accs and still do and blocked my family members is because my mom is controlling. she controls both me and my dad a lot,  and one time my dad kinda joked saying how she's literally the man of the house for how she is and she didn't like that. she controls how we dress, what she wanted to watch on the tv, etc. in the past of having that dummy acc as a real acc, my mom heavily monitored what i can post which really restricted my freedoms. she wanted me to remove what SHE didn't like, which was either harmless art work of my ocs who were homosexual to things she just didn't like, and she kinda made a big deal out of it, mainly the gay shit. and sometimes she actually bothered to COMMENT on my posts to tell me to remove it.

i remember one time she literally said my birth name in all caps with a ton of exclamation points on a post back in 2014 so no shit i'd kinda secretly get away from all of that, especially if i can't post harmless content that people actually like of my two gay ocs hugging. but that's kinda in my fault.

i was so upset that once she left, i spoke to my dad. i told him that my mom fucking scares me and how i actually wanted to stay in my room for a while and only leave when she's gone and my dad straight up said he knows she's scary. My mom somehow heard all of this and came out from the other room and in the calmest voice she told me to pack up my stuff and that she's sending me to my cousins to stay. obviously my dad didnt like that and went to go convince her to not do that i found out she was serious about this and was literally starting to pack a bag for me and that apparently she didn't like that i was scared of her.

honestly? thers a lot to add on why im saying this. i am used to my mom mildly mistreating me when i've done something, i heavily remember in the summer of last year after i came out to her a few days were shit between us and she guilt tripped me saying how she wants her kid back when i said i wanted a game for my ds and literally asked if i needed a psychiatrist., so all i had to do is deal with the next few days until she stops being a bitch and is all nice and decent again. I've literally tried talking or telling stuff to my mom in the past but all i remember is most of the time her being pissed off like me coming out to her as trans, so i've lost all my trust and developed the fear of speaking to my parents, mainly my mother. my mom claims that she loves me and supports me but once i say im gay and a guy she gets pissed and pushes me down saying the most negative shit you shouldn't say to your child and would literally threaten leave them if they didn't get off an escalator in the past all because they were afraid. 

she has threatened me pleantly of times saying she'll stomp a hole in my ass, send me to the nut house for my bad over-reactive behavior like crying in the corner at school, etc.

She has called me a bitch and spoiled brat multiple times for different reasons like me getting an attitude or just. i dont know? one time she literally said "" i've realized you literally are a spoiled brat"" in a restaurant after we left my grandmas house; probably because i was on my phone a lot instead of hanging out ( my grandma is a hoarder and my mom told me we were literally doing nothing back then, all they did was clean up grandma's house and fix stuff. the only fun things we did were go to the movies and play on my switch, my mom and grandma didn't come to the movies and it was only me and dad like usual, so no shit id be on it a lot if we were technically at her house for kind of no reason.) 

she has also said i looked ugly or looked like ""a homeless kid"" for even looking the slightest bit unpresentable to school...to HER. she has also verbally abused my dad. one time she got pissed at him and called him a dumb bastard multiple times. hell, she even called ME  a whore and a hoe in the past and told me to leave her house and threw away all my drawings all because she found out i drew porn.

at this point, i dont know hwat to do. i am numb to the point where i dont know what to feel. i feel kinda bad, and i am unsure of if all of this is my fault and im crying over nothing or if this is all my mom's fault. if it was i wouldn't be surpised. i never meant to be such an awful shit of a kid and i know that i'm really sick and i need to talk to my parents ( or anyone for that matter) but i dont know how due to mistreatment from my mom and the fear of anger over anything i said my mom may not like and that talking is literally just fucking terrifying. it's scary. and apparently i can only at least talk to people i have a decent amount of trust with.  and i wouldn't be surpised if they're mad at me because i won't talk to them but i can't, it's too scary and too hard.

so please tell me, are my friend right that this isn't just some big punishment and just literal abuse, or is this all my fault and i need to shut up, stop crying, and deal with it?

if it is abuse, what do i do? should i call a hotline? get a therapist or find anyone to talk to to get away from my mom? im trying to find a good online hotline since ive lost my phone and dont have access to one atm but a bt hesitant since i am afraid of getting kicked out or scolded again. please be honest and if this is in the wrong place, please tell me where to put it.

im also sorry if this was long, i just gotta give some backstory just so ppl can have a better understanding and maybe a better opinion.

82,"     Hi! I am in desperate need of guy advice, and this is going to be quite the story. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice at all, so thank you in advance :)
     I‚Äôm a freshman in high school, and basically, there was this boy in two of my classes who I never really talked to, but I‚Äôd always wanted to because he seemed like the greatest person. However, it‚Äôs hard to just start randomly talking to someone in a different friend group, so we never did. Until one night, I decided to do something spontaneous. This is probably going to sound creepy, but just know that I had no intentions of the situation going anywhere.
     I had this old Instagram account that I never used and it was completely anonymous, with no name, posts, or information. From this account, I dmed him a wholesome meme, telling him I just thought he was really cute and funny. I was just a teenager drunk off of sleep deprivation, expecting to be blocked or something. But to my surprise, he actually engaged in conversation. 
     On the first day, he just asked me for a bunch of hints about myself, and I was honest. The next day, he told me he still hasn‚Äôt figured out who I was, but it was a Friday night, and in total, we talked for six hours. We just talked about the most random topics and sent memes, and I guess we started to learn about each other‚Äôs personalities. He said things like, ‚ÄúI obviously really like your personality, so you should lemme know who you are,‚Äù and ‚Äúplease just tell me what class we have together I like you bro.‚Äù He asked me if I had a boyfriend, and I told him I didn‚Äôt, and his response was ‚ÄúAnd why is that? You seem so uwu.‚Äù I didnt really know what was happening, but he seemed at least somewhat interested.
     About three hours later, he convinced me to tell him who I was. I don‚Äôt know why I did, but I decided to take a risk. Of course it came as a shock to him because we barely talked in person and weren‚Äôt even acquainted with each other. After getting over his shock, he talked about how I had the most beautiful handwriting in our geometry class when I put answers on the board, and then he said, ‚ÄúWow I was about to interview random people, never thought it was that one girl with the sexy ass handwriting my gawd.‚Äù At this point, my adrenaline was still racing from actually telling him who I was. But afterwards, I asked ‚Äúwhat happens now?‚Äù and his reply was ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm really bad at girls, but seriously, you still got a shot.‚Äù This was a huge relief, but I was still confused about how all of this had happened so fast.
     He seemed to want to keep the conversation going, so we just talked about anything and everything for another three hours. I told him how I thought the jokes he made in class were really funny, so he thought of some more for me, and I loved it. We started sending memes, but then he said he was scared I wouldn‚Äôt be as interested if he exposed his memer side. This made me laugh, and we stopped talking at around midnight. 
     The next morning, he initiated a conversation, and this made me so happy. The next day, I decided to initiate, and asked him if he wanted to play 20 questions. He agreed, and we learned even more about each other. I‚Äôd say it went pretty well. We exchanged baby pictures and he got an 8/10 on my ‚Äúbuddy meter‚Äù quiz, which is relatively high. However, the next day was a Monday, and it would be the first day of school where I‚Äôd have to face him with my identity exposed. I wasn‚Äôt exactly looking forward to it.
     That Monday, I was sitting down in the one class we have together. He arrived after me, and gave a subtle wave, so I gave one back. However, we still didn‚Äôt talk at all. Luckily, later on, he initiated another conversation, and asked how my day was, which was really nice. When I said it was ‚Äúaverage,‚Äù he said ‚Äúbut you had the privilege of saying hi to me üòâ‚Äù
     At this point, there was no denying that I liked him. A lot. The next day, I waited for him to initiate a conversation, but it never happened. So I ended up texting first, and we had a really short conversation. The next day I gave in and initiated again, but we had a pretty long and nice conversation. We sent a bunch of memes and he really liked them. After around an hour, he said ‚Äúsorry I have to go finish my hw, but ttyl babe.‚Äù I was so confused, and responded with ‚Äúwhat??‚Äù Then he wrote ‚Äú*bro.‚Äù The thing is, I genuinely don‚Äôt know if he was joking or not. I really wished he wasn‚Äôt. 
     The next day was Valentine‚Äôs Day, and nothing special happened. He didn‚Äôt text at all, so I just sent a meme before bed with a ‚Äúgood night.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt see it until the next morning at 8:00 and wrote ‚Äúgn.‚Äù A few hours later, I wrote ‚ÄúI love when it‚Äôs night at 8 am ü§©‚Äù But unfortunately, he left me on seen :(
     I really don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I initiated conversations for practically the whole week. And I understand that things get crazy during the week, but I just want to go back to last weekend. I want to talk to him again because it‚Äôs always so great, but I don‚Äôt want to seem desperate. My fear is that he‚Äôs never going to text first. Last Friday night, we talked for six hours. It‚Äôs Friday night again, and I‚Äôm just waiting for a text that I know I‚Äôm not going to get. I know it‚Äôs only been a week, but we‚Äôve talked every single day so far and I really don‚Äôt want to break that streak. He could have left me on seen by accident, but I just don‚Äôt know. And if we don‚Äôt continue talking everyday, it‚Äôs going to be very awkward in person. 
     We have one mutual friend and my other friend suggested that we could hang out together through the mutual friend, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs too soon. Remember, we hardly ever talk in person and we‚Äôre just relying on text here.
  So, do I text him again or not do anything?

Problems came when he got depression. You see, my brother has bipolar disorder, and I think he got depression after an incident. Any one know that old black ops group faze? For a while, he was a part of there team. He was really good at the game yet also really young. Sooo fast forward a few years. He's 19. He does weed and might be popping pills. He got kicked out of the group after just a few months. Any once of joy he had towards my family is gone.

90,"Hey all,

I am seeking some advice on a student affair related issue with my fraternity and the university I attend. We are likely facing a multi-year suspension. Basically, a pledge(who dropped the fraternity) sent an email to the university highlighting all illegal behavior conducted at our house.

We are facing 4-6 charges related to hazing and 2 charges drug related. The hazing charges have been proven to be true, but the drug charge is where there is a gray area. 

The pledge stated that large quantities of marijuana are being sold from our house, in addition to members making pledges purchase drugs. He provided zero pieces of evidence the support these claims.

We are in the ‚Äòinformal resolution‚Äô process with the university meaning that they will just use the email and their brief investigation as the only pieces of evidence to charge us. We can move to a formal investigation, but that would require police getting involved etc. 

Does the school have the power to prosecute us for the drug charges even though they have no proof besides a poorly written email? I‚Äôve been losing sleep with this situation since I hold a high ranking leadership position and could be held liable so this drug thing is freaking me the hell out. ",16Feb2019,1

I recently got promoted in the small family-owned business where I work. I‚Äôve been meaning to move on for a while because of the way I and others have been treated during my several years of employment, but hadn‚Äôt found anything appealing yet.
I have a hard time standing up for myself, and over time this job has turned me into a bitter person. I hate who I have become in this job. I believe I still do an above average job in most things, though the input my bosses provide often leaves me confused and second guessing myself. 
Today I found out that I had not gotten a raise for the rather large increase in duties. I went in to talk to the owners, only one was present. After some of the usual back and forth of their diversion tactics, I told them outright that if my efforts weren‚Äôt enough to warrant a raise, I would be moving on after their upcoming two week+ vacation ended. 
(Honestly, I would have been happy with even a ten cent raise, because while more money would certainly help ease my budget, more importantly it would help fix some respect and chain of command issues that have been occurring with certain other coworkers ‚Äì issues they left to me to fix despite my being a directly involved party and asking them to handle it!)
They then told me I would get my raise, but to be sure to tell the other owner I had put in my two weeks. My exact wording earlier had been, ‚Äúafter your vacation is over and things have settled a bit‚Äù, but they chose to play dumb and force my hand because they were angry at me. (I know exactly what I said because I was nervous and had practiced, and also because I rehashed it all immediately because my brain hates me.)
Now, I realize it isn‚Äôt a binding two weeks notice, but they tend to cut hours when they know someone is leaving, and I expect to find myself with no income in about two weeks. 

Thus I end up here, unsure of what advice to ask for, let alone where to ask it. I‚Äôm sorry for clogging the subreddit with a wall of text, but I am extremely grateful for any assistance you can provide!
I am already working on updated resume, cover letter, etc, but I had hoped I could receive some helpful input here.
I‚Äôm sure I need to get help sorting my real strengths and weaknesses from the ones they have told me I have, as well as finding a way to gain confidence for my upcoming job hunt.
And as for the job hunt, does anyone have advice for finding a good(ish) job so quickly? I do have options as I live near a college and a major city, but I don‚Äôt even know what direction to go in with the skills I have. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have any degrees or certifications, but I do have ten years of customer service, IT, and management skills, among others. I can provide more detail as needed.

I personally don't have as much patience as my parents and would rather kick them out and save them the trouble.

I put a clause on the contract that we can kick them out or end the lease at any time and I would like to evict them using that clause.

99,"I'm desperate, I'm 16 and I struggle with bad anxiety and PTSD, it's been something I've been working on for a while now and over the past year I've been able to open up a little bit and start dealing with tougher situations. 
My brother has a boyfriend of 6 months who makes me feel uneasy whenever he is over, usually that's every weekend and he spends the night. Ever since the beginning of their relationship I've tried to avoid him because he reminds me a lot of my abusive father (who is in prison on unrelated charges) my father stored a lot of weapons in the house and at one point tried to kill my mother so having weapons in the house makes me very anxious. 
My brothers bf does the very same thing, he brings knives or home made bb guns (they don't work) over. He has a controlling atmosphere to him he walks around the apartment like he owns the place, frequently half naked and him and my brother have a lot of ""fun"" even while people are im the room. Walking in on my brother like that by accident is weird but when it's constant it's just uncomfortable. They are both irresponsible and don't respect privacy, they've had sex in my bathroom while I was fostering sickly kittens they managed to overflow the toilet and flood the bathroom, throw a few towels down and leave the babies in there with the door closed. No ventilation, surprise they got sicker.
He's made comments when I've come out of the shower and makes my girlfriend uncomfortable, she doesn't come over when he does because he's been weird with her, and threatened her because she found out he cheated on my brother and forced nudes out of a friend of hers, he gloats about the sex he has with my brother at school and my brother had a reputation for being a ""whore"" at his own school and had to drop out. 

I've practically begged my mother to just not have him come over I've had breakdowns because the trauma from my father is still fresh in my mind with their recent divorce, my brother has the opportunity to go over to his place and he does 1-3 times a week but my mother doesn't want to restrict him. Two weeks ago my mother said that she'd ask her friends for advice on what to do and then acts like my breakdown never happened, I lock myself in my room and she treats me as though I'm angry or jealous when she knows otherwise. She says that if I don't want him here I can spend the night at HER girlfriends house and it just feels like she'd rather kick me out than not have him over. 
This kid has done other things than what I've listed too but I want to keep it short as possible, I have no idea what to do, currently we live an hour away but in April we'll be moving about 15 minutes away from him, so I'm worried he'll be able to come over more often and I'll just have to deal with it.

I have taken loss after loss after loss until I'm in a state of frustration so fierce I have to have space and time away.  I have put every extra hour (willingly, I wanted to) into this goal and I've been at it for close to half a year....

...and here I am, 6 months later and I'm no closer to my goal and in fact I feel like I've gotten worse in my performance.  

...I tried so hard, I tried so so hard...

My goal is no longer something that inspires me, its something different now.
     Today, it's my main source of frustration.  Its now a reminder of how I'm simply not good enough and that I have no control over that fact. 

I'm a 23 year old male and I had a dream to be a top tier First Person Shooter player.  

    I've played ever since I was young (12yrs) and always loved the competitive aspect of online FPS's.   After a boring college degree that I didn't have much passion for I decided to go for what made me FEEL the most...and that was competitive online play.  I never felt the same about anything else in life, something about it pulled me in more than than anything else could ever manage to do.

  So with that in mind, I shifted my life into hibernation mode and pulled my cost of living down to as low as I could manage so I would have the most time to play while being able to sustain myself, the first of many sacrifices towards my goal.  I thought that if I made this goal my priority for enough time I would be able to work my way up and eventually be good enough to play professionally, because anything is possible with enough dedication and resolve right?  
  Well, to shorten this post a bit I'll skip forward.  I hit a mechanical ceiling (meaning my in-game ability wasn't improving for extended amount of time)...this is something I wrestled with for a while because I've always thought you could master anything if you practiced enough, but it doesn't seem to be the case in reality.  It seems to me some people are born with it and some aren't (cognitive ability).  Anyways the truth became apparent, I will never have the mechanical ability to keep up with the pros no matter how many hours I spend in training simulators or in game.  And ya know, that sucks...It just really makes it hard for me to believe the phrase ""anything is possible"" anymore which also kinda sucks because that's a comforting truth to believe in.
  I don't need to give examples of how much I gave to this, but just know I tried the hardest I've ever tried to do something, I tried so hard.  

Anyways, I guess what I'm asking is....are my feelings justified?  Am I going about this right (to leave/give up)?  Do you have any similar experiences or advice for me?  I'm just at a point where I feel like I need a wise old mans words because I don't know what to do anymore.",16Feb2019,0

108,"I will do my best to make this clear and concise. 

On January 1st I proposed to my girlfriend. We set a date for May 11th. 

My mother, who has been battling cancer for three years, expressed joy but told my father behind my back that she didn't expect to live that long. 

Two weeks ago my mother was rushed to the hospital with a bowl obstruction. Monday of this week she was placed on hospice care and given 1-2 weeks to live. Tuesday night, she began vomiting blood and began bleeding heavily from her vagina. I rushed to her side and she managed to live through the night. She still has a short life expectancy, however. 

Today I spoke to my mother and I asked her if she wanted us to move the wedding up so we could get married in front of her. I ensured her it would not complicate anything and she didn't have to worry about anyone being inconvenienced. She began crying and expressed that she just wanted to be a part of it but she felt selfish. I spoke to my fianc√©e, who has been by our side the entire time, and she thought it was a great idea. We thought maybe next week, which would be great given her health. Much longer and it may not happen. 

And then we spoke to her family.

Her sister called her, requested to speak to her in private and told her she should reconsider, that she should stick with the original date because she didn't want to her to regret her wedding and also that she might not make it anyway because she ""has a meeting"". Her sister may, in fact, have a meeting. But here's why I'm upset: I sacrificed vacation time and took 2 days off from work to help with HER wedding last year. She takes a day off if she has the sniffles. She took 3 days off a few weeks ago because she lost a cat, while high, that she had adopted 1 day prior. She has absolutely no problem missing time from work, except for this. 

Her mother didn't come outright and say not to do it, but she went out of her way to make it known that it would be very hard for her and everyone else to come down on short notice. Except: she does not work. She has nothing going on. Her father does not work and has nothing going on. I've already explained the situation with her younger sister and her older sister teaches painting classes and literally makes her own schedule. There is no reason they can not make it, yet she wants to ""push it back at least"" to ""maybe 2 weeks"". My mother may not have two weeks. 

All of this led to a fight with my fianc√©e, because she defended their behavior, while I see it is disgusting, selfish and unforgivable. If the situation were reversed, my parents would drop literally anything to make it happen. When I told my father, who lives just as far away as they do (3 hours) and has been separated from my mom for 18 years, said it was the right thing to do and said he would be there no matter what, despite having his own health issues that have given him a life expectancy of 1-2 years. 

Am I in the wrong here? Am I blowing this out of proportion? My fianc√©e says if I can't forgive her family then we shouldn't get married and maybe we shouldn't be together. I don't want to lose her. I love her, and she's a wonderful woman who has been by my side through all of this, but I can not forgive her mother and her sister for their words or actions.

110,"Im sorry if this story sounds too eDgY but im serious about this and its starting to reach my mental health. I had kept this to myself and never told ANYONE. I just couldnt help it because i just had a breakdown out of this.

Honestly at first it was just having sleep paralysis about seeing demons and at first i was scared but i managed to keep calm and close my eyes in my dreams, even though the ""red demon"" is still appearing whenever i close my eyes in that dream i eventually woke up.

That was 3 months ago, but since then everyday ive had the same sleep paralysis but different demons and ghosts... It kept repeating until it reached to the point where i can move in my dreams. Every person i talk to in my dreams was either a damn demon or ghost and i get used to it and just think ""well fck another dream"" in my head during those events.

There was one particular dream where when i went to the bathroom there was a pregnant girl beheaded in the bathroom, turns out she aborted her child and the child was just in the toilet. Her head was on a bucket in infront of the bathroom. (i couldnt remember her face though) During the dream i was not fazed too.

Then when i woke up that day, you know the girl that got beheaded and the video spreadout through 4chan? Yeah that one. Being a dumbass i searched and watched the video, i repeated it about 3-4 times till it got to me and started feeling eerie and disgusted on the video. 

The next day, my mom sent me a news about a 12 year old girl beheaded by her uncle and said that i should be careful. I was starting to get scared during that time. By the way the ghost and demon dreams were still continuing but i didnt mind anymore. 

The only thing the dreams were doing to me is making me feel alone and be conscious whenever people are around me. My friends were still talking to me but i didnt feel like it and end up always alone.

Then comes yesterday where we had a recollection. Im in eight grade about to be ninth in  a month. The recollection was going well, it talked about family and faith to god and im okay with it since im catholic, now i know that this part was sOoO eDgY but the whole time i was thinking the type of thing ""oh thats just blind faith to cope and rely on nothing just so you can be reassured by something that isnt true and believe something good will happen whenever in a though spot""

After lunch, the brother started talking about abortion, and people beheaded by isis. I dont know why they allow those pictures but maybe its to open us about reality and the real world. There were pictures of aborted babies, and pictures of men posing and showscasing the heads of people the had killed. I did feel nasty but i was used to those pictures by now since they kept appearing.

Obviously i wanted to talk to the brother about my constant dreams but it was too late because we had to go back to the bus. 

That night i cant sleep because those pictures kept reappearing and the scream of the girl from the 4chan video kept sounding in my head (ouch! Ouch! Mommy!) &lt; that exact scream is fcking me up during the night.

Then when i slept i woke up about three times because of those ghost dream. Each an hour within each other (because yes i check my phone for the time) like 3:03, 4:07, 5:08 am. The third dream was the one that made me fcking crawl back to my mother and sleep beside her, because out of all the dreams it was the one that made me remember most.

I was swimming with my friends and theres this jackass coach that kept screaming with us. I got annoyed on that dream and went to the coach and scream at him, then his face just morphed into a demon. I wasnt surprised and just walked away, i blinked my eyes and was put to a room there was a child who just came out of a bathroom and she was like 3 yrs old but for no reason i just went and hugged her and she hugged back. I looked at her again and her face turned into a pale ghost and her head just fell. I turned around to reach help and tried shaking them but they were the same people from my 1st and 2nd dream.

I realized they were either dead or a ghost and then at that point everything turned red in my vision i kept slapping my face left and right repeatedly and i couldnt feel anything because obviously it was just a dream, but my last attempt to wake mysef up is to just scream ""ANOTHER DREAM!!""  but the face of the little ghost girl appeared then i finally woke up.

I had already woke up but my eyes kept resisting it wanted to go back to sleep but i know i shouldnt. Then i slapped my self really hard and i was barely awake but had the very little energy move next to my mother. Then i just slept because i knew i was already safe. I didnt have any dreams during that sleep.

I woke up and my mom already went out for work and i just cried and cried until i was done. When i woke up i instantly prayed and regret everything that went through my head during that recollection, in the end i couldnt help but believe in the ""something that isnt true"" i talked about. Now i am just writing this down. 

I need to seriously get this off my chest and ask for help, i cant let it happen to me over and over again. I need ideas pleasr help!!! ",16Feb2019,1
111,"I'm searching or a room share in a city that has high rents, so its very typical for the area. I've lived with two other guys for about a year - not a great fit - but centrally located, full set of amenities and relatively cheap split for downtown neighborhood ($950-$1,000 my share). A 1BR in the area with similar features starts at $1,550, at minimum.

I can afford this $950 rent level but I have good chunk of credit card and student loan debt. I also haven't had a ton of purchases for myself over the past year, so I would like to have more money to make big outdoor purchases and the like. I've also been living in the city for year and half and have yet to make any guy friends. So that's a factor to consider too. 

I have plenty of options. What it comes down to for future share decisions is:

* Paying more ($950-$1,050) for a nicer place, typically has amenities or updated interiors. Usually these people in these places are more straight edge or yuppy, which I'm okay with. I tend to have chameleon personality that mixes well with chiller/artistic/into music types, but also can easily pass as a yuppie.  So as almost 30 years old, its big crossroads decision. I lived with yuppies for past year and didn't work well. But I think these guys were the exception. Everyone in the yuppie type range have been much better than current roommates.
* The cheaper places ($700-$850) don't have any amenities, typically smaller rooms and no off street parking (but at least no parking fee). But these roomates are more communal. They hang with each other a lot and usually have a big social network. But not as sucessful career wise, but I don't think at my age that I'll suddenly become swayed to quit my job and have more fluid work. 

There are plenty of people out there that are mix of both of the above personality types, especially in my city, but hard to find. I foud some that are a good mix but these have had upwards of 30 people trying to get the room. 

So, what is the smartest decision for my situation? What should I priortize? I should know what I want, but I'm sort of overwhelmed by the myriad of factors. Also, given my age, decisions seem to hold more weight.

Thanks

113,"Hi! Im (18f) a freshman in college and I am struggling to find friends. I have two roommates who have been passive aggressive since day one. I got bangs my senior year of Highschool and all of my friends absolutely loved them, and 2 girls told me they were inspired to also get bangs because of me, but my roommates seem so against them. They have made rude comments asking me when I‚Äôll grow them out, and constantly joke about hiding my scissors so I can‚Äôt trim them. Over Christmas break I finally decided I‚Äôd had enough and I told my parents I was growing them out. This made my parents sad, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable or cute anymore with them like I did all last year. My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù question me about if I‚Äôm as religious as them and judge me for being catholic. They are Christian and don‚Äôt seem to understand that Catholics are also Christian. I‚Äôm tired of comments about me being ‚Äúlazy in my faith‚Äù because I only go to church once a week, (they go 4). I am a huge Disney fan, and I love stuffed animals and things that make my dorm feel like home. My roommates and friends tease me and say I‚Äôm like a five year old. Recently I‚Äôve been eating every meal alone because I‚Äôd rather be lonely than be with them and feel judged. In high school I had a lot of friends from band, theater, cross country, and classes. I‚Äôm so used to having a broad variety of personalities in my friendships. But every girl I‚Äôve met at my college seems to be a replica of the last except me. I‚Äôm so homesick all the time and I miss my old life. My roommates make fun of my for crying when I‚Äôm homesick or for calling my mom more than once a day. I‚Äôm mostly posting this because today we got an email that we needed to send in our roommate request for next year. I had a melt down. I don‚Äôt have a single person I‚Äôd want to room with next year, or who would want to room with me. I am so used to having friends who I text and share everything with from high school, but they have all made new college friends and we don‚Äôt talk as much anymore. I‚Äôm not my fun high spirited self anymore, unless I‚Äôm at home with my family. Which is about every weekend at this point. I used to be so bubbly and an extrovert but now my favorite place to be while at school is my desk with a blanket and a movie to distract me. Am I the only freshman going through this???

114,"First and foremost, people do what they like, and I understand that. However, the smell is strong enough that it affects me - it makes my entire bedroom stink. I've had to leave my bedroom and stand in the other side of my apartment before because of how strong it gets.

 

A few months ago, I would smell weed. The smell was strongest in the bathroom, which is directly connected to my bedroom. It went on for several weeks. My roommate could smell it as well when she came into the bathroom. I wrote a letter to the tenant directly across from us, and he said he was having problems with them as well - strong scent of weed and music so loud that he could ""Shazam it thorough his floor"" - I kept the letter that he sent in response. Because of the way the building is laid out, it is either the person below us or below our direct neighbor, and as he's had worse problems, we can assume it's the ones below him.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where things get hairy. My roommate texted the landlord several weeks ago, and the landlord did nothing. I texted him again with more details and have not yet received a response. I tried to talk to the tenants, but their hallway door is locked, which makes that impossible. The smell is so bad that even with the bathroom exhaust fan running, it gives me a headache. If I can't talk to the tenants and if the landlord has not done anything in weeks - he didn't even respond to her text - who do I talk to?

&amp;#x200B;

It's okay if they don't, I just don't want to ruin their fun by sticking around.

119,"Im a 19F and im in my second year of college, and i haven't dated very much at any point in my life, due partially to insecurity with myself, being more interested in other things, and part having been in a few relationships that were generally pretty abusive and messed up. Within the passed week, I met someone at a club i enjoyed talking to one night and we quite quickly hit it off, and decided to hang out the next day. (we were clearly interested in eachother). I wasn't positive if it was a date or not, and accidentally mentioned it being, and he seemed fine with the idea (which kinda boggles my mind, but i guess thats irrelevant) but it being nearly around valentines day, he asked me at the end of our date if I was doing anything that day, and i wasn't, so we decided to go out that day. The date was pretty normal and not overly aggressive, but he remarked frequently how much he enjoyed my company and how nervous he was about the whole ordeal. He was very romantic and respectful the whole night and didn't touch me or do anything without asking permission and treated me wonderfully. Over the next couple days or so, we've been texting rather frequently, and he always says very sweet things to me. After that night, (we only met a week ago) he said he likes me quite a bit and would want to ask to be my boyfriend the next time we see eachother. Awkward to admit, but ive spoken to my parents about it and they think he isn't moving too fast or isnt crazy, but due to my past relationships, I think he might be due to the short amount of time we have known eachother, how sweet he is, and how affectionate he is, im terrified that he's going to end up being insane in some way, overly clingy, or like many of my passed relationships, cling to me like crazy and never let me do anything independent of him. I can't tell if im just overly sensitive and used to craziness so much i expect it, or if this guy is being /way/ too intense and i need to cut this off so it doesnt become a problem.

I am in 3rd year of university living away from home. However I have had difficulties ever since moving out. I am depressed and have been for the last 2.5 years. I don‚Äôt take care of myself and my meals, sleep etc. are super messed up. I don‚Äôt tidy my home and can be a mess. My parents have advised and tried to help me in many different ways however I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me. 

I go home during my holidays and this week spent time with my family. I hadn‚Äôt eaten a proper meal for about a week before coming and it really took a toll on my health which my parents noticed. Initially when I moved out they were super encouraging etc. 

Now however my dad said that after I graduate, they will move in with me. He said he really regrets leaving me and thinks being around my family would be best for me. He also said that I shouldn‚Äôt move out until I get married (I‚Äôm 20 atm). He said that I am not able to take care of myself and will need support. 

I have had a lot of anxiety for the last few hours since then. I liked having the independence, even though its financially responsible harmful. I also don‚Äôt want to have pressure to get married as I don‚Äôt have any friends, let alone a SO. 

Am I being selfish? Should I say something to my parents? Any books o advice on how to take better care of myself?

121,"I started this job about six months ago. I was hired on as full-time, but was never given full-time hours. This was okay for a while, but once I had to start paying my student loans back it became impossible. 

I took a second job and it was working out for a while. All of my managers were happy to work together and my schedules fit together perfectly. I ended up getting laid off due to budget cuts though.

Shortly after I got laid off, the full-time person in one of the departments I was in quit. Since I was the only one in the building trained to do her job they made me do it. They informed me on Christmas Eve, that I was getting another 40 hours that week. Despite the fact I‚Äôd already worked 20 hours that week. They made me work 56 hours the next week. I threatened to quit, which was the only reason I didn‚Äôt end up working 56 hours for two more weeks. 

I ended up working this position for two months. I request the position permanently but they denied me. Saying I wasn‚Äôt good enough for the spot permanently. Instead they hired someone who legally couldn‚Äôt work there. They made me train her and then fired her on the last day of training. I‚Äôm not good enough to do the job, but good enough to train my replacement. I don‚Äôt see the logic in that.

So we were back to square one. I requested the spot again and was again told no. The department manager was fighting for me to get the spot but upper management was insistent I not get it. I have no idea why she is so against me.

So they hired another person and waited until she finished her two weeks at her old job. She also had a week of online training she needed to do before she could start here. She was supposed to be done with it this week. She has refused to work on it for more than an hour or two a week though so now nobody has any idea when she will be done.

I asked what my hours were going to be once she started. Upper management refused point blank to tell me. They got rid of my part time spot in that department so I only had the department that gives me 12 hours a week to fall back on.

My old job offered me a new spot they had come open so I took it. I was under the impression that this week was my last week being full time at the current job. So I said I could start next week. Because the new lady is taking her time getting the training done my current job is demanding I work there next week, even though they knew I had prior commitments.

I told them I couldn‚Äôt do it. They told me that I needed to decide which job was my primary job because if I couldn‚Äôt ditch off my new job at the drop of a hat then I wouldn‚Äôt be getting any hours there. They plan to cut my hours, but then get mad when I refuse to quit my other job to fill in when they need me.

I can‚Äôt afford to quit but I don‚Äôt know what to do. Neither job will pay my bills on its own. And if they cut my hours at my first job I won‚Äôt be able to pay my bills even with two jobs. I have no luck job hunting at all. I‚Äôve been looking for a new job for months with no luck whatsoever.

Any advice on what I should do? Its legal in my state for them to do this to me so I don‚Äôt know what i should do other than hope to god I can find something before my bills come due.

I‚Äôve decided to reach out to the internet for advice and comfort. My therapist, friends and family don‚Äôt seem to help me(i‚Äôm not really keen on asking them though), my main issue here is that i‚Äôm disliking myself and really feel useless. 

Although my life i‚Äôve bounced from friends to friends, i‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù that i‚Äôve been best friends with, not even one person. During high school i found a couple people who i really liked and hung out with, we do nothing and have basically no relationship. Maybe i‚Äôm the one with the issue not trying enough to have a relationship. But my whole life, people have drifted away from me within weeks or months of knowing me. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that it‚Äôs not them or anything around us, it‚Äôs me. 

I think i‚Äôm a narsasstic self cantered anti social awkward person who no ones wants to socialize with. I have the tendency to fall into these ‚Äúsad moods‚Äù at work or with these people. I feel exhausted from doing nothing and i become the person i have learnt to hate.

Can i work on myself or help me become a person who you would like in your life. I don‚Äôt wanna be ‚Äòthe guy‚Äô, but i would really like to be a guy that people say, ‚Äúyeah he‚Äôs a chill guy, we went out for X a couple X ago‚Äù

But now I'm left getting upset and hurt by it years later when I think about it, when it didn't even happen to me.

This isn't just for stuff that I'm very close to, like family. Ialso tend to take things personally when I worked in customer service.

So whenever I got someone who was rude and disrespectful, it would make me feel terrible and that I was horrible for saying/doing what I did, when A) I have no control the rules, I just have to enforce them, B) I don't care about this person at all, C) The job doesn't mean much to me, I just need the money. I have since left that job to better things, but thinking back on those encounters I still feel terrible even though I know points A-C above.

I went to my parents home yesterday to try and talk about this and re-establish contact. It didn't go well.

I basically laid it out all for them, that i missed them and was really hurt by how they were behaving, that i am not expecting them to be friendly to my partner (they've never actually met before), but to at least accept that we're together. At this point my father interrupted and told me to not even say his name in his house. He called me selfish and told me that he thought ''he'd raised me better than that''. He had been bottling all this up for a while so just took it as an opportunity to let it all out, they thought that my relationship wouldn't last as long as it has and that they see it as me picking my boyfriend over them. 

I know my father well enough to know that when he is ranting like this, there is no point continuing or trying to have a conversation, but the utter vitriol he spoke to me with is something i've not experienced before. A lot more was said, none of it good and ended with him telling me that ''as long as you're letting that ****** into your bed, you'll not be let back in through this door''.

My boyfriend lives in a town about 30 minutes away and i left and went to his house and stayed there last night and only came home tonight, not wanting anyone to see me. He feels horrible it is causing such a rift but it isn't his fault, he did nothing wrong. I'm seriously contemplating moving, i work far away and the only reason i have stayed in this area is because my family are here. I just don't feel this is something that can be resolved with talking, if it is going to ever improve it will take time. I'm not even sure how i would feel about that now, i'm really resenting these people for trying to exert this much control over my life and who i see. 

The advice needed is really from anyone who has cut off/been cut off from family before. How do i deal with the loss now?  i honestly have no idea, before i had hope this could be fixed but i don't think it will happen any time soon if at all.",16Feb2019,3

I got really upset, and eventually I ended up crying in a corner (yes, pretty pathetic, I know). I also got really angry and punched the wall for some reason.
I know the whole toxic masculinity and that it's ok to cry but I'm sure we can all agree there's a point in which it's become excessive.

Now, she‚Äôs being acting a like a clingy bitch to people. She‚Äôs too clingy, she lies a lot, she‚Äôs been accusing people of things they didn‚Äôt do. And she always pushes her internet persona into her school life.

The first thing she did was fail my friend who had high fever. There was a major project that gave 50% of our grades, during the week we had to do that project she got a high fever and had to stay home that week. However she was willing to edit the video project in her house, she she told the YouTuber girl to send the videos to her so she can edit it. But she never received any videos and during the weekend she got her phone confiscated by her parents because they got her card and the grades were low. Also the girl who was sick texted her,

‚ÄúHey I went to the doctor and I think I might have dengue...‚Äù 

The YouTuber girl just answered with,

‚Äúe‚Äù 
Nothing else.

The YouTuber girl told the teacher to fail her for not helping and she failed that major project, even though she tried to help from the comfort of her house. 

The 2nd she did was accuse the same girl and another girl of bullying her, even though they didn‚Äôt do anything. They just avoided speaking to her because they don‚Äôt want to cause any trouble. The YouTuber girl said that they‚Äôre bullying her for being bisexual. That isn‚Äôt true because that both of the girls she accused of being homophobic were friends with a lot of gay people. And no one in our school gives shit if you‚Äôre gay, it‚Äôs becoming a common thing. 

She also said that the same girl made her shoved a pop tart down her crush‚Äôs throat.
No that didn‚Äôt happen, she wouldn‚Äôt do such a thing. 

She also told the teacher that the the same girl and the same other girl were cutting classes for staying in the clinic or guidance. The thing is, they‚Äôre required to be there in the clinic and guidance. For being sick a lot, and in the guidance so they can take the test they missed out there.

She also called the two girls plastic and over dramatic even though they didn‚Äôt really do anything.

She keeps telling this bullshit to her fans, and she uses their internet names so that her fans could attack them, I know that she says not to but if you don‚Äôt want them to be attacked then why mention their names in the first place? 

Did I mention she records people without their consent to put on her videos or live streams? She doesn‚Äôt even blur their faces nor the school‚Äôs logo. She‚Äôs also extremely rude to her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and tries to hangout with the popular kids but fails miserably. 

I told the teachers one time but they all sided with her. 

The girl‚Äôs YouTube channel is called Admin-Chan. 

Don‚Äôt believe her YouTube persona, she‚Äôs not as nice as she seems to be in her videos. She‚Äôs not some tall, pretty, kind, brown haired girl as she displays to be. 

No she‚Äôs a tall, awkward, petty, pimpled face girl in irl. 

I‚Äôm only mentioning this before she makes another video or live stream where she cries about shit that didn‚Äôt happen. Just like how she cried over her non existent pills that she never told the teachers or students she had to take. Not even the clinic. I‚Äôm mentioning this as well because I need help on how to deal with this girl, and also if her fans start attacking me and my friends again for doing nothing, you guys have our side of the story.

134,"So 2 weeks ago my apartment had an issue where the sink backed up (we're the bottom floor and everyone elses stupid crap put down their sinks eventually backs up ours). Normally they fix it within the hour and all is well besides a little clean up.

&amp;#x200B;

This time it took them 2 days to stop the constant backing up and water leak whenever an above neighbor used their sinks and a full other day for repairs. The water was black and had started leaking into the room and all in the carpet. They told us they would fix everything. I think they just replaced the bedding under the carpet (the first guy who took a look at the sink ripped it out to avoid problems) and put back the carpet that had gotten soaked (even though after they stopped the leak they brought a huge fan to dry it out). 

&amp;#x200B;

So my problem is the water that leaked was almost pitch black. It looked like sewage (even though they kept denying that). There is a smell that was not there before and now Im worried black mold may form. Should I get a mold inspector without telling them? Or leave it up to them to get one.",16Feb2019,0

I had gotten into what is now evident in my eyes, as a toxic relationship my freshman year of college which left me riddled with emotional strain. When coming back for the next semester, somehow she still was able to emotionally hurt me. But as with rainfall on a shitty as day, there‚Äôs sunlight that follows and shines light over budding flowers for a sunny day. 

I found someone that is by far, the most perfect human being for me and I‚Äôve never been happier which i met by finals week (who gave me the motivation to come back next semester as I was unsure). After a while of talking we have been going on dates, she‚Äôs been staying nights and we‚Äôve been exclusively seeing each other. We even celebrated Valentine‚Äôs Day together and she has told her roommates AND family members.

The only problem is she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship and I do. 

She has said it numerous times on how she knows she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship, but her actions say otherwise. I‚Äôve never been happier but I only see 4 paths in the future;
1. She ends things and finds someone else
2. I end things and find someone else
3. We end up getting in a relationship 
4. We are together exclusively forever and ever without moving up or down in the relationship scale

What should I do? I don‚Äôt want to end things but I don‚Äôt want to be in utter torment for being in love with someone in what I feel like is relationship purgatory.

141,"Hi guys

&amp;#x200B;

I just became an assistant manager at my job and I love it. I work with and supervise some really great hard-working people. But it is draining to supervise people and I cope during my lunch break by having my laptop in the break room and writing Star Wars fanfiction. No one can see my screen and for one hour I just want to eat my lunch and write. I live for writing dumb fanfiction sometimes. Will it ever see the light of the internet? No, it's just for me.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the people I supervise is a nice person but really loves talking to everyone they see during break. I've pretty much been good at going ""Yeah"" and ""Uh-huh"" and indicating that I'm not really interested in talking yet being polite. I think she's picking up on that.  Recently she's been asking me very obvious questions about what I'm eating. Like ""Cheekylibrarian, what are you eating?"" or ""Is that chicken good?"" so I have to give her an answer that isn't ""Yeah"" or ""Uh-huh"" 

&amp;#x200B;

If I wasn't her supervisor I'd tell her ""Listen, I really just really need to work on this, okay?"" But now there's the added layer of being a supervisor. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I tell her to please stop but also respect the fact she needs to be social? It seems that she does this because she doesn't like sitting in silence during breaks.

145,"I won‚Äôt leave this up for long because it‚Äôs so detailed! Context: I‚Äôm a 15 going on 16 sophomore in high school.


So I met this girl (Liza) about a year ago. I immediately developed a crush on her. For context, she‚Äôs 6,0 thick as hell, short black hair, glasses, dresses full vintage style, bright smile. Liza captivated me just by her... energy. Unfortunately due to some complications with a girl in her friend group who mutually hated me, I never got the chance to talk to her one on one. This was during February of 2018. As the new year started, I got to talk to her more. I found out how chill she was. Just so... lovely to be around. 

December rolled around and Liza complained about how she couldn‚Äôt find a girlfriend. Despite the size and progressiveness of our high school, the lesbian population is quite limited. She goes on tangents sometimes about how lonely she was, ect. We‚Äôre all moody art/preforming arts kids by the way. I just felt wrong for hiding my feelings for so long. So I decided to rant/confess to my friend, Katie. I‚Äôve known her since 7th grade. She‚Äôs our mutual friend. So I told her at lunch just as a need to get things off my chest. This happened on a Friday.

Come next Monday and Liza had messaged me on dm. She asked to go to the movies. Me being not dumb as hell I knew what had happened. Katie had told Liza what had happened. I wasn‚Äôt mad, just thought it was funny because of how not slick they were. I agree and we plan for Saturday night.

I‚Äôm hella excited throughout the week. Liza invited me to sit at her table despite there not being room. So I‚Äôm sitting HELLA close to her. We both like art and theatre. She‚Äôs into chorus. Liza is so PASSIONATE and it ruins me all the time because she‚Äôs just so perfect and lovely. I‚Äôm getting for excited, starting to plan my outfit, ect.

Saturday shows up! We go see a movie at 6:00 pm. I was a little late because of my parents. So when I pulled up I was looking around and such. Finally I found her. She was so stunningly beautiful. Just a photo from the 1940s she was. Her father greeted me and dropped her off. We go up and I pay for her ticket, she insisted she could but you know... ;)

We‚Äôre watching the movie. Mary Poppins. I notice her hand on the cup holder rest. It took me 5 minutes but I worked up the courage and took her hand. She immediately clasped our hands together. Her‚Äôs were cold and mine were sweaty, but it was perfect. As the movie started to end, I remember the makeup wipe in my pocket (she wears red lipstick). So I ask her if she brought her lipstick, she said yes. The movie starts to end and I look at her. I tried but we started laughing. I pull back in a fit of giggles and she kissed me on the cheek. I feel myself turning bright red. Then we do it, sloppily. But we did it none the less.

We talked during dinner and overall, it was a magical night. I lost my first kiss and I felt my heart fluttering. We texted the next following days.

About a week after of flirting and just being really sweet to each other, I asked her to be my girlfriend. She said yes and I felt like things were just right. Unfortunately about an hour later, she texted (we were in separate classes) that she didn‚Äôt want to hop into a relationship right now. I freaked out, but then I calmed myself down. We talked in art club and came to the conclusion that we should still be in the ‚Äúdating zone‚Äù. 

January 25 rolled around and I received another text. She just wanted to remain friends. I admit, I felt betrayed just a little. Like I felt lead on and used. When I pour my heart into something, I give it all I got. It didn‚Äôt help that I was starting to realize I wasn‚Äôt bisexual, and in fact, I was gay. So I started to freak out. If my parents found out, something bad would happen. I just knew it. I felt alone and confused. I still had Liza, but it just seemed awkward to me. Even though we still talked constantly and hung out. I just loved being around her.

The weeks roll by and we‚Äôre still the same. Just friends. I was starting to rely on hope and prayer, but most importantly; Valentine‚Äôs Day. I had a plan. When my Nana was staying with me for a week, I went shopping with my cousin. I brought a heart shaped glittery box and filled it with a lavender essential oil (her favorite), body glitter, a face mask, pink marshmallows, and most importantly; B√©same lipstick. She‚Äôs been talking about it for awhile but how it expensive it was. So I got it for her, because I love her. The day rolls around and she loves the oil, like it was cute how she kept smelling it and smiling. With the lipstick, she was a little shocked. She kept saying, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to do that‚Äù over and over again. Liza was grateful though and she thanked me a ton.

After school that day, we talked in art club. We got real. I just asked why we were like this. This weird thing where I was confused and she was vague. Liza told me that she felt terrible. Me being dumbfounded, I hesitantly pressed on. She told me how she thought I was amazing, pretty, and how much we got along. But she weirdly saw me only as a friend. Then she said how she had dumb lesbian syndrome. That‚Äôs when you only fall for straight girls and unobtainable girls. She even said how she felt dumb for not being attracted to me since I‚Äôm gay, I leave feelings for her, and I‚Äôm her type.

I told her that I just wanted a conclusion. That we were by no means exes. I asked if there was a possibility that we could try again. She sheepishly shrugged and said that she‚Äôll see how she felt in a month. I immediately laugh and said, ‚ÄúI meant in like a year or something!‚Äù Then she got a little flustered and said, ‚ÄúYeah yeah... in a year!‚Äù Liza told me how she just wanted to be a thot for a little bit, and that‚Äôs what she was looking for. I finally understood. Then we just walked out while talking.

Today I drew my friend, Isabella, in art class. She decided to put a picture of me with the piece on her story via Snapchat. Apparently one of her lesbian friends thinks I‚Äôm hot. My question is do I try something new and risk the chances of losing Liza, or do I thot it up some with the new girl? Advice would be lovely!",16Feb2019,1

154,"Hi guys.  I lurk r/advice a lot.  Unfortunately I don't think there's anyone on here who can help me with my personal issue but I want to take a shot.

My issue is that I am suicidal.  I'm suffering.  I fail at everything I love to do.

I have spent years trying to be successful creatively drawing manga and making videogames.  It has been my dream ever since i was 10 and I've been making games and drawing since 12, so 20 years.  I've made over 200 videogames, engines, and libraries in a variety of technologies and I have about 30 drawing books of comics, artwork and paintings with many different art styles.  I'm pretty good at programming and I am a mediocre artist.   I can't live without either of these in my life (especially drawing).  It is to the point where, if I do not draw something, or make games for an extended period of time I start thinking about suicide.  

I have severe OCD.  Drawing, painting, or writing games (or just code) gives me some focus which calms me down.  If I am not focused then I get irritated and do crazy things.  I can't live without this stuff. 

The OCD has caused me to fall behind at work, for years.  I hate being an engineer.  I have quit work before just so I can focus on self-absorbed tasks and alleviate suffering from the disorder.  I feel like this is going to happen again soon. 

The thing is, if I were able to be successful in making Manga or Videogames I'd be happy.  I'd be able to satisfy the behavior.  But I can't be successful in comics and games because I also have serious social problems.  I have social aversion, abhorrently low self-confidence, and difficulty making connections.

I have realized recently that my crippling social disorder is preventing me from ever getting the leverage I need to work all the time on comics and games.   It is preventing my success as well.  I need a team to help give me some support and also help spread the word.  

Making hundreds of little things on your own doesn't get you anywhere unless you have people that see them, promote them, and like them.   I DO post my artwork on Artstation, but it never gets more than 1-2 likes.  I post my games on Twitter, and on Itch.  None of my programs, games, or artwork ever gets any likes.  And, not to be pretentious, but I believe that my work is at least good enough to entertain a few people.

So, to the suicide part.  Because of harsh criticism and years of failure, every time want to draw something or make a new game I get very very sad.  Not that I wouldn't enjoy doing it, but that it feels pointless.  If nobody likes what i make then the pleasure I get from creating it would be nothing but a superficial waste of time in order to suffocate my social averision and reinforce my obsessive compulsive disorder.  The cycle makes me miserable.

It doesn't matter how much you love doing something.  Because your work will never be popular to anyone.  SURE!, you're going to feel good about it when it's done.  Maybe it's YOUR new best.   But it won't match up to ANYONE's work on artstation.    That's about it.  30 years from now when you are dying from cancer, maybe you'll feel good about it.  But it'll just get thrown away by your kids.  

It is an utterly pointless pleasure that you could better spend your life enjoying something else like watching TV, playing videogames or doing drugs, instead of working hard to no end.

I feel like, eventually I'll kill myself.  Not sporadically like a person who ""just got dumped"" sort-of-thing, but as a logical conclusion that it is more beneficial to me to be dead than it is to continue living sad all the time.  My purpose is just about as much as nothing.

For the last few days I thought everything was cool: he understands we‚Äôre just friends. But today he asked me to lunch as part of a challenge (who‚Äôs the fastest eater). I want to accept since I enjoy his company, but I don‚Äôt want to lead him on. I don‚Äôt want to hurt him.

Admittedly I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before so I‚Äôm really not sure how things go. I could be making something out of nothing, but knowing that he at least once had feelings for me is making me feel hesitant. I don‚Äôt want to tell him again we‚Äôre just friends because I don‚Äôt know if that will hurt him.

Is this whole thing platonic or does he think this is a date? What‚Äôs the best way to approach this (if there‚Äôs anything to approach at all)?",16Feb2019,1

For context, I have an... ""acquaintance"" I made last semester in college that identifies as a trans man. They prefer ""he/him"" pronouns, which I am more than willing to oblige, but at work he still goes by his birth name, doesn't correct people on his pronouns, and gives no intention on changing them anytime soon. Two days ago, he posted a photo of him and a friend in a restroom on  Instagram, posing in dresses.

Now, last semester he was all about correcting people on his pronouns whenever anyone referred to him as ""her"" but at work he doesn't care, even though we have another trans male that works with us and has many of our mutual friends working with us as well. 

I know there are some people who think it should be okay for men to wear dresses but I usually only see men as wearing dresses when they want to feel more feminine or for cosplay.

I've never had a job and it's going to be at least 2 years before I get my degree. Might get a job before if I'm lucky.

I was reading about this 5 year scholarship where I'd learn Japanese the first year. Then study a 4 year degree at something of my choice. 

Btw the age limit is 21. What do you think?  Should I do it? / Would you do it?

Downsides:

I'd be throwing away 3 years of college.

I won't be seeing my friends or family or people very often. If at all. I'm not sure but this could affect me highly.

Pros:

I've always wanted to study and live abroad so this seems like a solid chance to do both.

Ending up with an advanced level of Japanese.  And meeting a lot of new people.

I‚Äôve (21F) been dating this boy I really like (21M) for the last few months and have really got to know him and care about him.

My parents are very conservative Christian, and refuse to even think about sex. 

My parents don‚Äôt know I have sex, and there‚Äôs no way of even telling them because I know they‚Äôd be devastated.

This boy i‚Äôve been dating has met my parents, and I genuinely believe they really like him. They get along really well with him, and he gets invited by my dad for dinners all the time. This is the first time my dad has been like this with any boy i‚Äôve dated.


I sleep over at his house all the time, but lie to my parents saying that i‚Äôm sleeping over at fellow female friends‚Äô houses instead.


**How do I tell my parents that I sleep at his house? I‚Äôve tried asking them if I could, but they refuse to even consider it, and immediately tell me no.**

Please keep in mind that I‚Äôm a student, in an intensive program in which they are paying for, rent free as well.




TL;DR: My parents are conservative Christians and aren‚Äôt open to the thought of sex at all. I‚Äôm dating a boy i‚Äôve been seeing for a little and want to sleep over at his house, but they always say no. They also pay for my schooling.

I've been close with my adopted brother for my whole life. He's way older then me and my biological brother has been out of my life for 21 years now. I've known since I was 15 that my adopted brother has feelings towards me but we've always been able to keep as siblings or so I thought until yesterday.

Now, I'm married and he's married. I've never said or given him any indication that I would want our relationship to change from brother/sister to anything else. 

Yet, his wife calls me up in tears and tells me about how he's been telling her that he's leaving her to be with me and that in the past we ""hooked up"" a lot and have always had a sexual relationship... I was shocked! I've never ever done anything more than a simple hug at holidays with him. We've never even kissed on the cheek before. I have no idea where this has come from. 

I'm scared to ask him about it and my husband has demanded I cut off all ties with him as he's worried that he might do something towards me. Now my adopted brother has had his troubles mentally in the past so I went to see my mom to ask her about it.

When I talked to her and told her it all, she wasn't shocked. Seems he's told stories like this in the past and they just didn't want to upset me by letting me know anything. She said she knew I'd never have any other feelings than one of a silbling for him as I was a baby when they adopted him and grew up only knowing him as my brother until he turned 18 and I was 10 when my parents told us all.

Anyway, we submit maintenance requests about the issue regularly. Maintenance comes, adds more steel wool to any cracks and leaves. There‚Äôs also a monthly pest control that comes to bait the building and help control the issue. Despite this, the frequency that we see the roaches never changes. 

For extra context, the lease does say that management will take care of pest control.

176,"*warning: this is long, messy, and worded poorly. 


I‚Äôm very lost and confused about what decisions I should be making right now. I‚Äôm a current college sophomore in my second semester. I‚Äôm at community college and I‚Äôve been taking gen ed courses.

During the entirety of last semester, I was debating if I should change majors. I was intending to major in psychology and go to grad school and so on and so forth but I‚Äôve really been getting into russian culture/language. And I‚Äôve made up my mind THIS semester that I want to change my major to something revolving around that. 

Now, there‚Äôs a few issues with doing this. 

- First, I‚Äôve been taking the gen ed courses for PSYCHOLOGY that would transfer and add  to the PSYCHOLOGY program at my local school. 

- Second, the local school I‚Äôm most likely to transfer to doesn‚Äôt offer russian as a major or a minor:(

- Third, someone just a few weeks ago brought up the idea of majoring in international relations which I thought was an interesting idea(and is an option at the school). The only problem is, again, I‚Äôm not taking the classes for that major. And I, honest to god, don‚Äôt really know what an international relations major entails. I‚Äôve only taken ONE government class 4 years ago and 2 history courses in the last 4 years. So honestly, I‚Äôm kind of frightened to change to a major I‚Äôm (1) unfamiliar with and (2) would be taking at an advanced level in (3) a new environment. 

- Fourth, I have the option to apply to a college in DC(out of state, but used to live there).
This may get confusing:
- It‚Äôs a little more competitive.
It would cost A LOT more. BUT thankfully money isn‚Äôt too much of an issue BUT I do worry about $$$ for grad school. And if I wasted money in undergrad, when I had the option not to, I think I would feel guilty. But at the same time I‚Äôve kind of been dying to get out of the town I‚Äôm in right now where my community college is and the local transfer college is. I feel very trapped here and there are hardly any opportunities for‚Ä¶ anything. Although, at the same time, I don‚Äôt react well to change and new environments. 

- And finally my last and final option, is to continue with what I‚Äôve been doing all along and obtain a psych degree at the local transfer college even though I don‚Äôt want to study psychology anymore.


Maybe I should have also mentioned that one of the colleges deadlines comes up in 3 weeks‚Ä¶. Lol I need so much help

It goes the same with another friend of mine, she now hangs out most of the time with a different group.

197,"I have this weird problem where I perform incredibly well under pressure. I get into a zone where I just feel completely under control and physically and mentally feel very present and sharp. 

Problem is, when I'm not under pressure or stress of deadline or bad outcome I underperform or simply procrastinate or don't care.

For example, in sports, while practicing, I'm unable to play at a full optimum level, while in an actual game the nerves and pressure put me in the zone. Unfortunately, if someone sees me during practice passively(without my knowing), they will think I'm not very good and won't ever think I can play well and undervalue me until they see me perform under pressure in an actual game.

You can think of a similar analogy at work. I'm a programmer, and I can solve problems and write code effeciently and quick, sometimes even amaze myself how good I am. But well before deadline, I'm coasting very slowly knowing very well I can get this done easily at a later time. If someone sees me during the early process they will think I suck. 

Similar analogy during actual presentation and mock presentations.  I do well in conference calls and team meetings when I'm put in the spot, but end up not caring when I'm not put in the spot.

This shit happens in all walks of life, including dating, where I do very well in the early part of dating and struggle to keep a good relationship after that. One would think this is an awesome trait to have and I do agree it is awesome, but there are many situations where it is not good at all. 

My question is how to tap this level of performance when I'm not under pressure, because technically I can do it, I just need to do perform the same way when there are no stakes or stress, so I can save a lot of time and stress, improve more effectively overall in life. Also when I'm in the zone I'm unable to multitask. E.g: break focus on main task to do something else and then come back.

In sports I have learned to simulate pressure by tanking and then coming back from behind during practice, but I want to know how to simulate pressure in all walks of life or how to solve this problem I have. I'm unable to convince my mind by faking pressure and motivation. My mind knows there is no real pressure. I just want to conquer this part of my life and my life will change big time. Living life like this also puts too much stress in my life since I'm constantly putting myself under pressure unnecessarily. I know in the back of my mind, that I'm under utilizing my talent and time and it gets depressing. Also, I smoke a lot of cigarettes while stressed, and even more when I accomplish something and happy. I'm working on quitting, but I end up smoking again during stressful situations.

I'm pretty sure there are other people who have or had the same problem as me. If you did, how do you handle it and how did you solve the problem.

I have tried working on discipline to force myself to work on schedule but even still my performance is nowhere close to it when I'm under pressure. But it has definitely helped a little as after some ramp up time I'm able to get into the zone.

Also do you think a psychologist would help? Is there any medication that can help me? One of my friends said I might have ADHD. I have taken the online test and it didn't seem conclusive.

I'm never a guy who asks for advice or never approach people for help, for reasons I don't know why.  Maybe because my parents always freaked out/overreacted when I approached them with problems thinking I was unstable. It's understandable because my brother developed schizophrenia at 18.

199,"Tonight, I got a random call from a number that had a caller I.D that was near my town. I picked up the phone and it was a girl that sounded really pretty. I was playing xbox at the time and put it on speaker so my friends could hear me talk to her. 

She told me that I had supposedly called them twice early today (and later sent me a screenshot of the call log) but I never did this. We eventually figure it‚Äôs just a misunderstanding and we hang up (this is after my friends almost convince me to ask if she‚Äôs single, but I decide not to out of respect). 

We hang up and my friends convince me to call the number back by telling me that this was all meant to happen and that she might be the one for me and all this crazy shit.

I start to contemplate the idea and call the number back, but it says the number *ISNT EVEN IN SERVICE*. We start talking about how fucking weird this whole thing is and then when we thought that we had reached the peak of the Twilight Zone, **SHE CALLS BACK**. 

We talk a little and I tell her that I feel like in some way, we were meant to speak to each other and this was all meant to happen and she actually AGREED WITH ME. 

She tells me her name and I tell her mine and we talk a bit until she says she has to go do something. Next thing you know, she texts me a screenshot of the call log with my number. That call isn‚Äôt in my call log at all.

Now we‚Äôre texting back and forth and just found out we were born a year apart. 

This is all so weird and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. My friends keep telling me that she‚Äôs the one by some crazy universal coincidence, but I am skeptical as fuck. None of these friends live anywhere near me btw.
 
The fact that I called and was told her number was out of service was weird, but somehow she still got the call and called me back. Another weird thing is how easy she is to talk to. She seems genuinely interesting and it all seems way too perfect.

Something isn‚Äôt right. I thought about sirens and how this could all just be a lure to get me into some human trafficking ring. Part of me really wants to meet this girl. Maybe by some chance she really **IS** the one, but my primal instincts are telling me that something isn‚Äôt right and that I need to steer clear of this entire thing.

Everyday  you can ask someone if they did their homework and the answer will always be no. I remember the first semester in this establishment, still had good grades. Every semester my grades would get worse and worse.

Yesterday I was listening to music, and looking back at my old self, and noticed how bad im doing now with my grades.
I want to drop out of school, and just to stay in my bed all day. 
The thing is i want to be an English teacher, and for that i need to graduate.

The first thing that came to mind was, when i were 15 i had a lot of depression and anxiety attacks, i just wanted to stay in my bed all day playing videogames, didn't gave a fuck about school. I've been seeing a therapist  for quite a bit now, and feel like i can get my shit together again,  but i don't know how...

How do i get rid of the ""what's the point of doing homework anyway?"" mindset? I think my classmates are making me think i don't need to be responsible. I just want to start all over again. I want to finish all the homework i didnt make and work from there.

206,"I have a new product (a wooden case for a tech product) that I have recently  launched and sent some free samples to some instagrammers and influencers who had Approached me and requested a free sample to review. 

One of these influencers received the product this week and added an unboxing to their Instagram story.

Two days later I have been sent a photo of the product broken. Apparently it broke when he was reinserting the tech product into the case. 

(I don‚Äôt know why it was being removed and reinserted but I guess people like to play with new stuff.)

Now this clearly could be a problem 

Would appreciate advice on how best to handle this?

It‚Äôs worth noting the case is more decorative being made of wood and not described as shock proof, but of course one would expect a case to be durable and not break with general use.

But I‚Äôve tested the product countless times and never managed to break one, 

I imagine a great deal of force was used or perhaps the product inserted into the case was placed or pushed in at the wrong angle, but this is also a problem as some people skip reading the instructions leaflet which directs you how to insert your product into the case.

So what is the best way to handle this? Bearing in mind he is an influencer but he didn‚Äôt pay for the first sample.


1. Send another freebie sample to him / but no guarantee he won‚Äôt break the next one / all products are identical. 
2. Ask him to send it back for us to investigate
3. Pull product from marker and redesign a stronger case / costly but possibly necessary  decision if this happens repeatedly in future.

222,"In my family there is someone who tells dangerous, fucked up beyond belief lies 24/7. She is in her early twenties now. These are only the few lies we actually know about/found out over the years:

She told everyone in school when she was five years old that her mother was her older sister and that her mother had died in the desert. When she was a little bit older she told everyone in her new school that she had a little sister, which she didn't, she is an only child. and she would go as far as to tell children that her little sister was around the corner or that they had just missed her at events that the 'sister' should have been at. She told constant lies about the people in her classroom and invented other students and created situations with the fictional students that never happened. She told her school friend that her aunts husband was cheating on her and that the aunt was trying to find a way out of the horrible situation. She would even rope the school friend into coming up with 'plans' for her aunt so she could get away from her husband. She would make up dramatic stories about statements school teachers supposedly said ie she told her parents her teacher told the classroom he was leaving the school, which her parents brought up at a parents meeting and it never happened. When she was a kid she was actually a very good singer. She sang Somewhere Over The Rainbow solo and was given a lot of solos at school after that. Fast forward a year or so and I remember her having a out of control meltdown that included her throwing school books into the fire because she was so angry that her school friend was going to sing 'her song' at a talent show. The petty lies go on forever so I'll get onto the more serious ones. 

She has said she was raped by a bunch of men and named them. She has made up that she suffers from serious llnesses. She told her boyfriend (who was equally as fucked up as her) that her uncle who she's never met molested her as a child. She faked a pregnancy and miscarriage then went on to have an actual pregnancy and miscarriage. She literally still invents people and whole life stories attached to them. She told her boyfriend that her father was the owner of a hotel and she even booked a bunch of nights for him and her to stay at and got him the whole works paid for. Best room, breakfast, lunch and dinner included. She has told people her father was a drug dealer from Germany (he's not). She had lied that she has four older sisters. She passes people on the street and pretends she knows them and creates stories about them. Again these lies could go on forever. 

Even things that HAVE actually happened to her, she bends the truth. Things I have experienced WITH her that I know for a fact happened to her, she usually doesn't even tell the straightforward truth for no apparent reason. She has LEGITIMATELY had some seriously bad shit happen in her life, and oddly, she usually doesn't even talk about those things. She is an attractive girl who is a dangerous violent psychopath who is incapable of telling the truth and I wanted strangers opinions on this. I have seen her start physical altercations regularly including with her own parents. This girl has driven two boyfriends to severe depression and the brink of madness. I watched her isolate one boyfriend and weirdly 'mother' him buy him endless supplies of food, a PS4 a large TV she even started stealing games for the PS4 although she had the money for them?

229,"I have this weird problem where I perform incredibly well under pressure. I get into a zone where I just feel completely under control and physically and mentally feel very present and sharp.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, when I'm not under pressure or or close to a deadline or bad outcome if I don't complete the task, I under-perform or simply procrastinate or don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, in sports, while practicing, I'm unable to play at a full optimum level, while in an actual game the nerves and pressure put me in the zone. Unfortunately, if someone sees me during practice passively(without my knowing), they will think I'm not very good and won't ever think I can play well and undervalue me until they see me perform under pressure in an actual game.

&amp;#x200B;

You can think of a similar analogy at work. I'm a senior level programmer, and I can solve problems, architect and write code efficiently and quick, sometimes even amaze myself how good I am. But well before deadline, I'm coasting very slowly knowing very well I can get this done easily at a later time. If someone sees me during the early process they will think I suck, and I'm paranoid about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Similar analogy during actual presentation and mock presentations. I do well in conference calls and team meetings when I'm put on the spot, but end up not caring when I'm not put on the spot, and I've come to realize that people do notice that.

&amp;#x200B;

This shit happens in all walks of life, including dating, where I do very well in the early part of dating and struggle to keep a good relationship after that. I would like a stable long term girlfriend, instead of dating again and again, and eventually get married. One would think this problem I have is actually an awesome trait to have and I do agree that, in some cases, it is awesome, however there are many situations where it is not good at all. I want stability, consistency and stress free life.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm trying to attack my root cause and so my question is, how to tap this level of performance when I'm not under pressure, because technically I can do it, I just need to do perform the same way when there are no stakes or pressure, so I can save a lot of time and stress, improve more effectively overall in life. Also when I'm in the zone I'm unable to multitask. E.g: break focus on main task to do something else and then come back. If i'm in the zone working on something or doing something, I simply ignore everything else which works for some situations but terrible in some cases.

&amp;#x200B;

In sports I have learned to simulate pressure by tanking and then coming back from behind during practice, but I want to know how to simulate pressure in all walks of life or how to solve this problem I have. I'm unable to convince my mind by faking pressure and motivation. My mind knows there is no real pressure. I just want to conquer this part of my life and my life will change big time. Living life like this also puts too much stress in my life since I'm constantly putting myself under pressure unnecessarily. I know in the back of my mind, that I'm under utilizing my talent and time and it gets depressing. Also, I smoke a lot of cigarettes while stressed, and even more when I accomplish something and happy. I'm working on quitting, but I end up smoking again during stressful situations. 1 pack a day on and off for almost 10+ years now.  Smoking too much causes ED for me and I have to cut it out for a week to stop ED. Again if you notice, I'm able to quit smoking for a week easily to stop ED, because there is a pressure that I won't be able to perform sexually if I don't stop smoking. But if I can just stop smoking, without encountering ED, I'll never have ED at all and its overall good for my life too. Deep in the back of mind I'm worried that there would come a time when it won't be reversible, but I'm unable to convince my mind of this, because everytime I encountered ED, I've quit for a week and it reverses.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure there are other people who have or had the same problem as me. If you did, how do you handle it and how did you solve the problem. I do want to point out that I enjoy pressure and feel happy when I'm experiencing it. Please don't confuse it with stress.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried working on discipline to force myself to work on schedule, but even then my performance is nowhere close to when I'm under pressure. However, it has definitely helped a little as after some ramp up time I'm able to get into the zone.

&amp;#x200B;

Also do you think a psychologist would help? Is there any medication that can help me? One of my friends said I might have ADHD. I have taken the online test and it didn't seem conclusive. I find it incredibly embarrassing to go to a doctor and talk about these things, especially since I'm a man and I should be able to find solutions and handle these things easily. I don't know how some men are so comfortable in revealing things like this to a psychologist without feeling like  complete loser. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm never a guy who asks for advice or I never approach people for this kind of help, for reasons I don't know why. Maybe because my parents always freaked out/overreacted when I approached them with problems thinking I was unstable. It's understandable because my brother developed schizophrenia at 18. I'm their hopes and dreams. They need to see me as a strong and confident person. My parents are very accomplished, my mom's a CFO and my dad is a successful businessman, and its a status issue for them among friends and family that I succeed and excel in life. They are almost always disappointed in me, especially my mom, because I'm not super successful yet. My dad is patient. Talking to them does help me ramp up my motivation, even though its a little negative sometimes. This does make it seem like they are bad parents, but they are not. They have worked hard to provide me with a lot of opportunities, freedom and independence that many of childhood friends didn't get. So there are a lot of positives among the negatives.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't ask my friends for advice, cause a lot of them look up to me, and asking them for advice makes them invariably lose respect they have for me. So I don't have a lot of outlets to ask for advice except for the internet. Thought I'd ask reddit anonymously.

230,"Six hours a day for a week was absolutely torture so I managed to convince my mom to let me do homeschool, this was around exactly a year ago. I always got amazing grades during class but I cheated all throughout primary and middle school so I'm dumb as fuck basically. SO now all the schoolwork I get from her to do is like two years above my level and I don't understand anything. Despite being 15, I am probably around a 7th grade level in school work but every time I ask her to give me easier stuff she always says, 'Oh, but you're such a smart kid, stop acting stupid and just do the work I give you.' I used to have motivation to do schoolwork when I was around ten and for some reason she still treats me like I was five years ago. I can't complete any of the work she gives me because A, she won't help me, and B, it is virtually impossible. If I don't do an hour a day, she will force me to go to school but I haven't been to school in so long and I won't understand anything there either. 

What I'm asking is, is there anywhere I can find people to encourage me as I have no motivation, just thinking about going back to school is bringing tears to my eyes. I need to stay home but the second I miss one day of work, she's going to force me to go back. I haven't done any work yet, thankfully she forgets about it a lot but now my (abusive) father says he's going to drag me to school if he has to. That isn't an exaggeration unfortunately.

I have grown up in a Western, first world country and I have never experienced Eastern culture before. Recently I went to Vietnam on a two week long holiday and I absolutely fell in LOVE. The culture changed my entire life perspective. I had never before experienced walking down the street without a few males leering/harassing me, I have never experienced simply being another human being walking down the road and minding my own business. This is because where I have grown up, (and this may sound familiar to most living in a western country) women are treated like 'meat'... even wearing short shorts in the summer time attracts so much attention. So far I have thought about this intently and realised there is a difference between appreciation (glances) and actual negative intent (leering/rapey jokes/cat calling/unwanted touching). For whatever reason, BOTH of these things are creating such an unease for me in my mind and soul to the point where I am scared to walk down the street, and I am scared of men who I do not know personally. This may sound absolutely ridiculous, and I am quite annoyed because I have grown up in this culture all my life and navigated such things as we all do. However the way I am treated is killing my insides. Unfortunately I work as a waitress which doesn't make life much easier. I thought that I should turn back to Buddhism, and try to find peace within myself by following the basic principles of a) being one with humanity and appreciating everyone for who they are and b) trying to change my life perspective even more to achieve a balance between spirituality, materiality and happiness. This all isn't going well for me. I am a survivor of sexual assault which has taught me ways to navigate my anxiety, but this growing anxiety I feel is of a different sort. I need advice on how to overcome this weird unsettling feeling of not being able to accept my own culture anymore for what it is. I just don't know what on earth to do because it's gotten to the point where I have now called in sick to work because I am too anxious to leave the house. Please help internet community!

240,"Just to clarify, i havent gotten tested but im pretty sure I have genital herpes. Actually, im certain. I havent hooked up with many people and ive only had unprotected sex twice. Once about 2 months ago and once about 6 months ago. So maybe got it from oral? Last time i had oral was about 7-8 weeks ago so it seems possible to me. 

I found out i had herpes today. About 3 maybe 4 weeks ago i saw i had some small bumps under my mouth. Honestly kinda hard to notice and i just shaved the day prior so i didnt care much about it. HOWEVER, the thing that alarmed me was when i saw a couple bumps on my genital area. However, i shaved down there recently and thought it was razor bumps. But, today, i took a shower and noticed there were more bumps. At this point it has been a while since ive shaved. So theres no way those are razor bumps. Ive never had anything like this before.

I cant bring myself to hiding it from them. I know at this point i have to have sex with protection and i cant have sex during outbreaks, but thats fine.

241,"Hi there,

so, I don't post to reddit too often but I've come across a dilemma and I'd like some outside advice on it. I feel like my family vet neglected my dog and basically watched him lose an eye. I'm having some pretty big feelings about it, and my mom wants to take it to the veterinary board. I've never really dealt with this kind of situation before and I'm conflicted because I feel like it's possible that I'm just really upset about what happened and looking for someone to blame. I'm going to try and be as thorough as possible with this explanation so I appreciate if you take the time to read it and give me your two cents. Bonus points if you work in animal medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

So, about two weeks ago in the middle of the night on the third of September I noticed my 4 year old Siberian Husky, Odin, had his right eye closed. I didn't think much of it and went to sleep, but that morning he still had it closed and upon inspection it seemed a little cloudy, but there was no redness. I took him to my primary vet immediately, who I have seen regularly since Odin was almost a year old.

The first thing my vet did was check the pressure in Odin's eye. He said the pressure was normal and therefore **he ""was ruling out glaucoma.**"" He looked in the back of Odin's eye and said everything appeared to be in good shape, there was no sign of a trauma or obstruction. He said he imagined that Odin was wrestling with our cat and she scratched his eye in a place we can't see. He gave us some anti-inflammatory/anti-biotic eyedrops and sent us home and told us to come see him at the end of the week for a recheck. 

Tuesday, Odin seemed to be feeling better. He was opening his eye more but it was still a bit cloudy. He didn't want to eat his kibble, which is pretty common, when he's feeling crappy he goes on hunger strikes. So I gave him some canned fish. 

Wednesday was really worrisome. Odin did not want to leave the bed, he didn't have any interest in any food at all. I called the vet and he said to bring him in Thursday morning. I almost took him to the emergency vet at this point but his eye didn't look any worse and late that night he ate some canned fish so I felt a little better about it. 

Thursday morning we arrive at the vet. Vet checked the pressure again and said it was normal. I told him I was concerned it was getting worse because there was some redness developing at that point and he seemed like he was in a lot of pain. They checked his eye again and said that he wasn't concerned Odin being in a lot of pain **because his eye was not dilating, if his pupil were very small, he said, that indicates pain, but his pupil was just stuck very large and his other one was normal so he was probably fine.** 

He noted that he could no longer could see the back of Odin's eye, but he said overall there was less inflammation and it had improved. I asked him if the cloudiness in his eye/not being able to see the back of it was an emergency, and he said no but he was going to refer us to a specialist. He said he would call the specialist and get us in as early as possible. 

Vet also did a blood panel and said he didn't think the not eating was related to the eye. The panel came back normal and he said the next step would be to do x-rays to check for a blockage. I said that I felt like it did have something to do with his eye, and wondered if maybe we could try a mild painkiller or something for it. **He said he didn't feel the need to prescribe a painkille**r and if Odin were any other breed he would insist on the x-rays but huskies tend to be dramatic and the ""small discomfort"" his eye was causing him probably put him off eating, but to come back if I couldn't get him to eat at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, at this point I'd like to point out that I'm the annoying dog-mom who googles EVERYTHING and annoys her vets and family/friends with all the information and studies I read, which is exactly what I did that weekend waiting to see the specialist on Monday. Everything I read said ""glaucoma, glaucoma, glaucoma"" which I was like ""OH THANK GOD the pressure in his eyes were normal and it's not glaucoma."" I really tried to stave off my instinct to just rush him to another vet to get a second opinion, but I figured we were going to see the specialist on Monday anyway so as long as he was drinking and going to the bathroom normally it could wait. 

&amp;#x200B;

Monday morning arrives and within ten minutes of seeing us the specialist informed me that Odin had glaucoma in his right eye. He said the pressure was 60, and normal range is 15-25. He told me that Odin had no vision left in his eye at this point and we would have to remove it to prevent any pain or discomfort. He also said he wasn't surprised at Odin's lethargy and lack of appetite, as glaucoma typically felt like a chronic migraine. He prescribed us two pain killers, one of which is a narcotic, for Odin to take before his surgery. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kept asking him how it was possible as my vet had told me the pressure in his eye was fine. The specialist said that he wished he had an answer for me, but my vet didn't forward him any of Odins test results or medical history. The only thing that was said in the referral was ""assess cloudy right eye."" 

He also told me that glaucoma is common in huskies, it's a hereditary disease that is caused by the drains in their eyes not forming properly, so basically they get backed up and cause an increase in pressure in the eye, which then can destroy the optic nerve in a matter of hours if it's not caught. He said he was confident it was glaucoma even despite the symptoms of the right eye, because he could see the drain in Odins left eye is also malformed, so it would develop there, too. I also learned that his pupil being stuck large and not dilating smaller is a sign of optic nerve damage. 

&amp;#x200B;

I booked the surgery for the following day, and I asked the specialist if **I had brought Odin to the emergency clinic the week before if we could have saved his eye and he said yes, probably.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even explain how devastated I was at this point. And also like a complete idiot. I feel so much guilt, I should have trusted my instinct and taken Odin to the emergency clinic on Monday when the vet said he couldn't see anything wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

But at the same time, I don't understand how my primary vet watched the condition of my dogs eye decline, and didn't recognize the emergency ? 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that sometimes people make the wrong call, and not everyone is perfect. But the second time I brought Odin in, with not being able to see the back of his eye, and the obvious amount of pain he was in, and he still brushed it off even though he wasn't sure of the cause. I thought that the pressure being good meant it wasn't anything too serious, but if he had of informed me at any point that there was a still a slight possibility it was glaucoma or something else just as bad, I would have taken him to the emergency vet immediately. Furthermore, after the second visit, if he had of told me the blood pooling in the back of Odins eye was cause for alarm and his optic nerve was in the process of being damaged, I would have rushed him in then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Typing this out makes me see how obvious the signs were that I should have just listened to my gut and taken my boy to the emergency vet right away. I also feel like my primary vet care ignored some pretty obvious signs there was something seriously wrong, whether he really believed their wasn't or was just being negligent. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the surgery, I spoke about my concerns to the specialist, and asked if he thought my feelings were justified and he said that the equipment he uses is different and far more accurate that the ones primary vets typically have, as they see 1-2 cases of glaucoma a year but he sees them every day. He said the tools they have are also very sensitive and can be inaccurate at times, especially if a vet isn't used to using them all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

His defending my primary vet sort of gives me pause to reporting him to a veterinary board, as I can somewhat understand, but at the same time I went to see my primary vet twice, and the second time there were signs to indicate permanent damage had been done to Odins eye, but he told me there had been an improvement. 

&amp;#x200B;

If he's unfamiliar with eyes and glaucoma and the signs it presents, I feel like he should have admitted that and suggested an emergency visit or maybe asked another doctor with more experience take a look at it at the clinic, instead of waiting the extra 4 days for a specialist. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all that, I can't believe my primary vet didn't forward the initial test results to the specialist. I don't even really have words for that. He even called the specialist and didn't explain what was happening, maybe if he did they would have recommended to  see us sooner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Almost just as bad, he wrote off obvious signs my poor boy was in pain. I feel so incredibly guilty and baffled that he overlooked Odins symptoms and let him suffer for over a week with a constant migraine.

&amp;#x200B;

The specialist told me that the important thing is now I know the warning signs of glaucoma for myself, and know to bring Odin into emergency right away if he experiences those symptoms with his left eye. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel like if my primary vet couldn't recognize these signs, what's even the point of going to them? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am searching within and I am doing all I can, I don't know what else there is. 

I don't have any bad habits, I eat healthy, I have a great work ethic, I'm positive, upbeat....but still here I am.....

I grind away online looking for more freelance clients, remote job opportunities so I can continue auto travel and work on my music (I get the safety factor in jobs - but you're only 25 once and if i'm going to reach my goals now is the time to take those risks....when you're 35 and living on a couch its a little different)......might as well give it hell while i'm young.

We really hit it off and found out we were both from Colorado and knew the same people so I started texting her a lot (maybe too much). Regardless, things started to turn out well and we cuddled (nothing more) with each other occasionally but then I had to get surgery for a medical issue I had and I started texting her a little too much and she kind of backed off. She stopped talking to me and I thought things were pretty much over like most tinder experiences go. 

But then, right before our school break she texted me asking to go skiing with her when we both went home. I said yes, but we never ended up making a time or texting each other after that. Once break ended I texted her asking if she still wanted to hang out and she yes. We met up to get dinner and we were just talking and then she said she had to go babysit. I walked her back and that was it. I saw her screensaver on her phone which was her and a guy that I‚Äôm guessing is her boyfriend and on valentines day she posted a snapchat story of a guy opening a present from her.

246,"So earlier I was talking to my friend in class. He sits next to me and to my left is this quiet girl who doesn‚Äôt talk much but can be pretty interesting once you get to know her. Anyways, me and my friend were talking and he tries to talk to the girl. The girl didn‚Äôt respond much but her reactions made it funny and my friend says to me ‚Äúsee, (girls name) is more fun and interesting you should be like her.‚Äù  When he said this I was taken aback and responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to respond to that‚Äù. I tried to brush it off and not mind too much but I can‚Äôt help get offended with what he said. I know I‚Äôm not the most interesting person, I am somewhat shy and I haven‚Äôt been feeling my best since last year because of personal problems but I still try to put in the effort in making friends. I am aware that I need to practice my social skills and confidence basically I have a lot of things to work on myself. 

I dont want to be resentful but he has compared me to alot of people. There‚Äôs this other friend who is outgoing and can tell the most interesting stories then this guy says to me again. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt u be like that. You should be more interesting‚Äù.  

The reason I can‚Äôt easily leave him is because I value the friendship we have. There are times where he has been helpful to me and vice versa but when he says things like these, i cant help but feel that I am not enough. 

Sometimes I regret transferring to this school because I already had a solid group of friends in my old school. Those group of friends never made comments like that about me and always made me feel like I am valued. I understand that everyone is different but hearing this from a person who I value alot makes me think that I might not be considered a friend by him at all. ",16Feb2019,6
247,"So first my older sister's MIL started talking bad about her last week, calling her a selfish princess and saying she doesn't care about anyone. Jesus. She had drunk too many beers and mixed them with her pills, and my sister had had a long day, so I forgave her and didn't say anything about it. 

Yesterday my sister got her a rose for Valentine's Day since her husband died years ago and no one else was going to get her one. It was really sweet and it made her happy. But then she does the beer-and-pills combination again tonight and starts talking about my sister's ""bad parenting"" to me while she's in the room. Whispering. While she stood there and watched. 

???

I want to make it clear I had nothing to do with the conversation and I would never talk bad about her, but I have no idea how to approach the subject. 

That's not all. My nephew only gets to come over every other weekend, and he's started doing this thing where he talks to his mom for ten minutes before he comes to the living room and hangs out with me all night. It bothers me that he wants to see me more than my sister. It's fun having a kid around, and I love being the cool aunt, but my sister barely gets to see him and I don't want to take up what little time she has with him. How do I nicely tell a five-year-old he should be spending time with her and not me without making him upset?",16Feb2019,1

250,"I have currently been doing an internship at a major multi-national corporation. 6 months ago I asked about doing an extension which last week I just got the extension letter form and that was when I enjoyed the work as it was related to my major. Now... I started to HATE it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reasons for hating it**: I hate it because of the work that I am doing, it has basically been me trying to develop something and there is just one problem that has prevented me from completing it. I have been doing this for 5 MONTHS. So i spent nearly half my internship wasting my time. Then there's the supervisor... oh boy I really HATE him now. He just won't shut up, he talks SO MUCH and he just wastes my time. Every meeting we have which is 2 times a week he just asks me to repeat what the problem is WHICH HAS BEEN THE SAME FOR 5 MONTHS. He just asks me to repeat the same thing each time and what I am doing to try and fix it. Then there's the task manager, of what we use to allocate tasks. At first we were using a very simple program which was easy to use. Then because he could not understand it for some reason (the program is extremely easily), we had to use what HE wanted to use and he made the layout so complicated that to this day I have no idea how it is. He is also a big time waster like last week he spent such a long time discussing what he did on the weekend and what he is going to do next weekend (he went on holiday) and now I just lie to him that I didn't do anything on the weekend just so that we can finish the meeting faster. Whenever I hear his voice I get so annoyed but I don't show it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well-being: Tbh, now I just think of myself as an idiot who doesn't know anything. I also have felt that I don't deserve anything nice to buy even though I have the job. I have been getting angry easily like ripping on my hair angry level. I barely talk to my parents and I have not gone out with friends since the beginning of this year, I used to go out nearly every weekend with them but now I have no urge. I feel this because the supervisor talks SO MUCH that I don't want to physically talk to anyone else. I get a lack of sleep now like I wake up in the middle of the night just because I am stressed about the work. I have been eating more junk food more often and been going to gym less. And when I am there I spend less time than I normally did. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents won't let me quit as they say that it's a good experience of what I am doing. Then I told them of what I have been doing for the past 5 months and they said to keep it. The only way I can get out of it is that if I get another internship at a major corporation which has been unsuccessful so far.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice on how I can cope with this stress or deal with people who talk this much. I don't think I can take another year. If i continue at the well-being rate i currently am, then ill end up being an incel. ",16Feb2019,1
251,"Okay this is my first time on reddit so if im not posting correct heads up. I should give the story first okay so high school like 9 years ago or so, we dated and it was the classic first we did get into a lot of trouble, did a lot of crazy things and have a bunch of stories with each other. Now sadly her parents hated me a lot like a whole lot wont go into that part right now i was a wacky teen lets say. Now i was 1 grade above her so i graduated a year earlier then her and went off to college in north iowa while she stayed in souther iowa to finish school and meet me in college a year later, almost like a movie it didnt work not for cheating or anything that is was a pretty clean break up as break ups go. Now time passes she ends getting married to someone something around 10 years older then both of us they have a kid together and what not they seemed happy enough you obviously we didnt talk daily i did have a lot of people tell me that the guy reminded them of me but thats beside the point i guess idk. Now about a year ago she mesged for basically the first in 7 years or so telling me all kinds just wild shit this dude did does is doing to her things she loves stuff like that i at the time lived in North Carolina so i mean all i could do really is talk her off the ledge so to speak. But we talked off and on for the past year but about 2 months ago i moved back to iowa and our conversations took a jump to a very sexual level she keeps telling me how neglected she is and what not and we keep talking dirty and stuff we have hung out a few times had some sex all that good stuff now we get where i am at now and i gotta problem cause im starting to catch feelings and i dont think thats a smart move on my part but is it though you know lile maybe their is a chance but am i hanging my hat to much on that? You get me? Its one of those things that i almost without question its a bad idea but at the same time idk how to not plus i dont want to be a dickhead and just say ""hey we cant talk anymore, i know im the only person you talk to on a daily basis but thats on you fuck off dont talk to me"" that would be a real dickhead move i think and kinda selfish where because i cant handle the situation your on your own same time i dont want to get my hopes up for anything if nothings going anywhere. Should i just stop being a bitch? After typing all this out i can kinda see that one being a front runner. Ive never been married before or have any kids so i really dont get the staying with someone if your unhappy with that person i dont get how its not just a simple solution and leave the dude i mean i think thats my ignorance tho but idk dude what do you all think?

While my parents have to pay my insurance till I'm 26 I still have an outstanding amount of copays if I want to continue my treatments which I have to since I have an implanted medical device that has to be maintained. I rent a room. And have for the past 10 months but I have no way of paying my landlord the rest of my 30 day notice.

If I'm unable to pay that and my current credit card bill which is due in 6 days I will be $1200 in debt. I have a decent credit score but with no income I can't pay a loan back. I'm about to be out of home when I desperately need one for my health. I have no idea what to do I'm pretty desperate for help but I only worked a year part time so I don't have much to my name.

I have to maintain my port in a sterile environment that I just can't do in a car. I also don't believe I can have any of my medical supplies delivered to a homeless shelter as it has needles in the delivery.

267,"Around the age of 13, my friend began to be less fun to be around, and she had grown extremely lazy, and even argumentive. Since she had grown lazy, she gained at least 30 or so pounds, and was even fairly chubby. She wouldn't dance  or even do karaoke like we used to as kids, and it even got to the point where she wouldn't go out. She would stay home and sleep while her mom and sister and I would go out and do things like shop and eat out. Me being me, I was being stubborn and I thought she was being an ass. It was like that for a year or so, then she started to stutter and get frequent chills, and do weird things like carry around a blanket, even if it was the dead heat of summer. She would also try to go out in shorts and flip flops when it was snowing, and sweaters and scarfs when it was blaring hot, because she thought the whether was nice when it wasn't and vise versa. That was through the ages of 13-14 maybe. Then, when she was 15 she would talk and either go off topic or keep talking until she forgot what she was saying before, talk about something that doesn't even make sense, or stops her sentences midway, and forget what she was saying. She talked like that vine with the kid that said ""Do you ever have a dream a dream that you can dream you could do is that you could do anything?"". She had poor hygiene.  Hairy legs, greasy hair, chewed nails, a bit gross. She never really let the house, because she was homeschooled. The last few visits that I stayed at her house, she gave off a few red flags that I brushed off until I matured a bit. The first one being that the power had went out one time, and she said that her ears were ringing like bells and sirens louder ""than normal"". The next was the early years of her behavior, she'd hate it when I cursed, and told me Ibwas hurting god, and I just told her to fuck off cause I was an atheist. Lastly, literally the last visit, I remember her picking up my plain white phone case, and hysterically laughing at it claiming ""I didn't know your phone case changed colors!"" (Which it can't.). I stopped coming over, because I do have a bit of anxiety from time to time, and I'm introverted to a certain extent. I still go out and have a fun time, but I still  enjoy my own company. I guess the main reason I stopped coming over was that she annoyed the fuck out of me. She always wanted me to come over, but at the time I was only ever seeing the situation as her being a needy asshole. Now that I look back on it, I only now realized the gravity of what I might have caused. Sure, she could've been a bit more understand to my problems ,too, but I think her mind was too clouded up, and she could barley think herself. After a year of being away, and just now realizing that I was the only person in her life outside of her family to talk to, and be a friend to, I finally decided to come over. It's been a week since I came over, and I'm still alarmed on how bad my friend has gotten. Everything seemed relatively normal when I came over. I'm friends with her sister, too, and sister was the one that invited me over. Anyway, my friend was in the back garden, and she was watering her flowers. I didn't even recognize her at first. She dropped at least 50+ pounds, and was fairly thin and very pale. When her sister opened the back door to tell her I was here she was startled. Her stutter lessened, but when she did stutter, she did it quietly, and talked slowly when she had to get in a bunch of words. She still talk all random and all over the place as usual. She sounded monotone, and was very jumpy. I noticed she had scabs on her finger tips, and she looked like she hadn't slept well. I accidentally swore, and she just got quiet. She didnt seem to feel the need to argue. She kept rubbing her hands together, and frantacly hummed when she had something to say, but couldn't get it out. She hates loud loud noises, and she wouldn't then her record player up a certain level, and even went as far as to hand stitch, because she said she thought the sewing machine was to loud. She seemed spaced out, and had a blank expression, and she either gave me too much eye contact or didn't even look me in the eyes at all. She cleaned and tidied everything in sight. She never sat down once and was going from a to c before she got to b. She would laugh way too hard at a joke or she'd even laugh at absolutely nothing. At times she seemed way to preppy, flamboyant, and optimistic. She seemed to be in her head most of the time. She asked her grandma at least three times that day if she called her name, and all three times she said she hadn't. She was also telling me about head lines she saw online, and none of them sound real. Like one was something along the lines of ""Girl gets shot in the face at a (local) movie theater"" ,and no local news covered anytbing like that. She used to have social media, but she deleted her presence online, because she's afraid of being stalked, and she is very careful looking out windows. She makes sure the lights are off and everything. She said some new neighbors had moved in, and that she doesn't trust them very much. She was just out of it. She even went as far as to threaten to beat her sister with a ruler, because she had turned on the light while she checking out her window. I didn't sleep over, because the whole time I was fighting back tears, because I was coming to the conclusion I would never see the same friend again.

She has told me she wants to kill herself and I completely understand why. I didn't say that but with all of that and taking care of her mother with Alzheimers is making her extremely depressed. The only person in my family who has a job is my dad. He is a truck driver but is extremely stupid with his money. 

I have money saved up from a previous job, and receive financial aide from FAFSA. in all I have about 14K to my name. So personally, I'm not hurting financially 

I just have so fucking much in the future to deal with, im getting kinda depressed.

One thing that drives me crazy is my moms growing dependance on me. I plan on moving out for college but I feel stuck here. Everything revolves around ""here.""

I‚Äôm a chronic over thinker, and it‚Äôs hitting its peak right about now. She suggested asking him to grab coffee, since we both like it and it‚Äôs a low pressure environment to talk in.

273,"Around the age of 13, my friend began to be less fun to be around, and she had grown extremely lazy, and even argumentive. Since she had grown lazy, she gained at least 30 or so pounds, and was even fairly chubby. She wouldn't dance  or even do karaoke like we used to as kids, and it even got to the point where she wouldn't go out. She would stay home and sleep while her mom and sister and I would go out and do things like shop and eat out. Me being me, I was being stubborn and I thought she was being an ass. It was like that for a year or so, then she started to stutter and get frequent chills, and do weird things like carry around a blanket, even if it was the dead heat of summer. She would also try to go out in shorts and flip flops when it was snowing, and sweaters and scarfs when it was blaring hot, because she thought the whether was nice when it wasn't and vise versa. That was through the ages of 13-14 maybe. Then, when she was 15 she would talk and either go off topic or keep talking until she forgot what she was saying before, talk about something that doesn't even make sense, or stops her sentences midway, and forget what she was saying. She talked like that vine with the kid that said ""Do you ever have a dream a dream that you can dream you could do is that you could do anything?"". She had poor hygiene.  Hairy legs, greasy hair, chewed nails, a bit gross. She never really let the house, because she was homeschooled. The last few visits that I stayed at her house, she gave off a few red flags that I brushed off until I matured a bit. The first one being that the power had went out one time, and she said that her ears were ringing like bells and sirens louder ""than normal"". The next was the early years of her behavior, she'd hate it when I cursed, and told me Ibwas hurting god, and I just told her to fuck off cause I was an atheist. Lastly, literally the last visit, I remember her picking up my plain white phone case, and hysterically laughing at it claiming ""I didn't know your phone case changed colors!"" (Which it can't.). I stopped coming over, because I do have a bit of anxiety from time to time, and I'm introverted to a certain extent. I still go out and have a fun time, but I still  enjoy my own company. I guess the main reason I stopped coming over was that she annoyed the fuck out of me. She always wanted me to come over, but at the time I was only ever seeing the situation as her being a needy asshole. Now that I look back on it, I only now realized the gravity of what I might have caused. Sure, she could've been a bit more understand to my problems ,too, but I think her mind was too clouded up, and she could barley think herself. After a year of being away, and just now realizing that I was the only person in her life outside of her family to talk to, and be a friend to, I finally decided to come over. It's been a week since I came over, and I'm still alarmed on how bad my friend has gotten. Everything seemed relatively normal when I came over. I'm friends with her sister, too, and sister was the one that invited me over. Anyway, my friend was in the back garden, and she was watering her flowers. I didn't even recognize her at first. She dropped at least 50+ pounds, and was fairly thin and very pale. When her sister opened the back door to tell her I was here she was startled. Her stutter lessened, but when she did stutter, she did it quietly, and talked slowly when she had to get in a bunch of words. She still talk all random and all over the place as usual. She sounded monotone, and was very jumpy. I noticed she had scabs on her finger tips, and she looked like she hadn't slept well. I accidentally swore, and she just got quiet. She didnt seem to feel the need to argue. She kept rubbing her hands together, and frantacly hummed when she had something to say, but couldn't get it out. She hates loud loud noises, and she wouldn't then her record player up a certain level, and even went as far as to hand stitch, because she said she thought the sewing machine was to loud. She seemed spaced out, and had a blank expression, and she either gave me too much eye contact or didn't even look me in the eyes at all. She cleaned and tidied everything in sight. She never sat down once and was going from a to c before she got to b. She would laugh way too hard at a joke or she'd even laugh at absolutely nothing. At times she seemed way to preppy, flamboyant, and optimistic. She seemed to be in her head most of the time. She asked her grandma at least three times that day if she called her name, and all three times she said she hadn't. She was also telling me about head lines she saw online, and none of them sound real. Like one was something along the lines of ""Girl gets shot in the face at a (local) movie theater"" ,and no local news covered anytbing like that. She used to have social media, but she deleted her presence online, because she's afraid of being stalked, and she is very careful looking out windows. She makes sure the lights are off and everything. She said some new neighbors had moved in, and that she doesn't trust them very much. She was just out of it. She even went as far as to threaten to beat her sister with a ruler, because she had turned on the light while she checking out her window. I didn't sleep over, because the whole time I was fighting back tears, because I was coming to the conclusion I would never see the same friend again. I left right when she needed help, and when I came came back she was out of it. I'm not too sure if I can help anymore. I fell guilty that I ditchedbher when she need support the most, and since she didn't get the help she needed, she'll never be the same again.",16Feb2019,0

275,"Hi everyone,

Thank you in advance for reading - I will be detailed, yet brief.

I currently have a minimum wage job that I neither love nor hate and I‚Äôm slated to begin school this semester (Spring 2019). I have vague desires about becoming a writer, working in public office or becoming a licensed massage therapist. I am 25.

Here‚Äôs what: I don‚Äôt want to go to back to school. I‚Äôve dropped out twice in the past and feel absolutely no desire or motivation to sign up and proceed as I‚Äôve done during my last two attempts. 

I have no clue what I want to study or where I‚Äôd like transfer, so my community college courses aren‚Äôt tailored to a specific program or school. Some, ultimately, will qualify for the school/program I transfer to, others will not. 

Even worse, I am eating up my Pell Grant funds. I Have already received two of the allotted years I am eligible for.

It seems futile to do something that a) I feel no motivation for, b) I am not using to advance in a specific goal or purpose and c) offers limited federal funding I‚Äôm not using efficiently at the moment.

All that said, here are the pros of college: guaranteed learning/education. A low-risk place to try my hand at certain careers (journalism, for example, working for the newspaper). Mentors in the form of teachers. Built in social opportunities. Potential for growth. Completing general education units. 

Now, I‚Äôm not naive, and I‚Äôve found that many of the pros on my list aren‚Äôt exactly guaranteed. While I‚Äôll save my repudiation of the American education system for another day, i will say that it is flawed and laden with burdensome bureaucratic elements. The bottom line is, I dropped out of a private‚Äôs university once. The second time I dropped out of community college. I just don‚Äôt like it, and I‚Äôm wondering if I should try to make my way in the world without it.

Here‚Äôs the alternative.

Work: take more hours at my minimum wage job or find a waitressing or bar tending position. I‚Äôm not entirely worried about this. This would be the same whether I am in school or not.

Education: I‚Äôm a big time reader, online course taker, etc. khan academy, online course from major universities... all free. Classics and important literature can be found in the library. 

Technical education: trade school, internships, apprenticeships, on the job training (assuming lucky enough to get hired). 

Career Goals: for writing, I could very well try to launch a free lance business and generally cultivate the skill as I live my life. For public office, campaign volunteering, interning for non-profits, etc. potentially trade school for massage.

Just want a clear and clean 3rd party perspective on this... am I crazy and misguided? Am I doomed stay caught in the minimum wage vortex if I don‚Äôt graduate in something? Will I miss out on opportunities if I Don‚Äôt go to college?

I love this quote: ‚Äúyou can do anything but not everything.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm desperately trying to find out what my anything consists of.... thanks again, everyone.",16Feb2019,3

279,"Hi guys, I feel extremely conflicted about by part time ( and first ever job). I‚Äôve worked there for a little over a couple months, it‚Äôs part time but for the majority of my time there I‚Äôve been working full time hours. It‚Äôs a particularly brutal retail store and I get paid minimum wage for an 18 year old. I‚Äôm currently doing two days a week. My boss likes me but apparently I‚Äôm only just passing my probationary period, she has said she wants to keep me and not have to find a new person so she‚Äôd rather just try and iron out my mistakes. I‚Äôm only there until September when I got to University. 

The people I work with are nice enough and most of them extremely helpful and answer a lot of questions and help with with issues I can‚Äôt resolve myself at work.  The job is retail so it‚Äôs as you imagine, soul crushing and boring. 

I think a lot about either quitting or being fired and it kind of gives me a sense of relief. Something in me is just telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt work there. I‚Äôm a fairly confident person outside of work but I don‚Äôt know why my personality is completely different, I‚Äôve been there two months and haven‚Äôt really shifted out of feeling new. 

My and my parents worry is that because I‚Äôm only in my town for another 6 or so months that no one would want to employ me if I was fired or quit my current job. Also I need to do something, I‚Äôve found having no schedule or something to break up my week is very bad for my mental health. Like I want to like my job but I just constantly Day dream about getting fired or quitting. It‚Äôs a real pickle and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. 

Any advice on how I could change my feelings on this or what to do? My boss has been accommodation and nice in cutting my hours but even the shifts I am doing I‚Äôm not enjoying. Is this a normal part of working retail?

But then, I break down out of no where when something happens (a slight inconvenience that hits my insecurities- like not getting the attention from my friends around me cuz they are focusing on a person whom I know is very charming), and I end up having these paranoid thoughts regarding how my friends would leave me because they found someone better and more interesting... that causes me to have anxiety attacks before any future meet ups with any friend, and I would spend my time at home on my bed either staring at the ceiling in the dark or just scrolling through memes unable to get out of it. I even ended up not being able to shower or wash my face or brush my teeth before bed (it made me just feel even more disgusted by myself at those times), 
My problem here is that At that same period of time i get bulimic, and everytime I get bulimic episodes my sex drive shoots up high and I end up wasting hours and hours of my time satisfying those two.

284,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

im in serious need of help... my life has hit a brick wall and I feel completely helpless. I'm in my last year of high school, and my university/college depends on how well I do this year so i'm in need of serious help.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my dad lives overseas and I go and visit him every now and then (my dad isn't the problem)... but long story short, while I was overseas with my siblings my mum and stepdad decided to get seriously drunk. This isn't a problem *usually*, but my step dad has serious drinking problem and my mum does drink (and smoke cigs when stressed) but doesn't suffer the same chronic issue as my stepdad. When me and my siblings were returning from seeing our dad, the night prior they (mum+sdad) decided to go next door (a friend) and have a few drinks. I don't know what happened that night, but all I know was my stepdad pushed the neighbour and the neighbour, who's not as strong as my sdad, facing off with a stronger man and being partially undertheinfl called the police because he wouldn't leave the premises. Long story short from there, a court case granting bail, charged with assault and the implementation of an AVO. The neighbour never charged my stepdad, but instead public prosecutions.

&amp;#x200B;

So none of us knew this on the return home, but we got back and school resumed. It was all normal to me, until about a week in my sister was found to be self harming. It wasn't deep gashes in the wrist, but more scrapes on the surface from a really really (i can't emphasise how) dull razor, but it didn't matter, it left a mark that's still there. I don't know why she did it, but we are certain it's because of school, nothing sinister/home related there...I hope. I'm very close to my sister, she seems okay, but even still she's off to a councillor and getting professional help now. My mum, stressed as all hell (obviously if your child is self harming and you don't know why) drank quite a lot and smoked quite a lot during this period, and step dad joined along because idk why anymore. Long story short, they returned to neighbours place again. Stepdad drunk along with everyone else. Neighbour pushed. Cops called. This time we knew, because we were at home, and the police came and informed us of everything. Since there were 'kids' involved, child services were called. Not to take us away, but just in the future to check up. Court case followed the next morning, I took the day of school and sat through around three hours of court cases to get to my sdad's. My mum didn't show, I was the only person he knew in that court room. Charged with an additional count of assault, violating an AVO, bail 'refused' (idk what if this has any meaning, he isn't in custody, but he can no longer live at our property.)

&amp;#x200B;

should probably add here, i'm not interested in legal advice, my mum and stepdad have already got that from professionals. Jail doesn't seem likely apparently, but instead a court order mandating sobriety. 

&amp;#x200B;

My house has been in freefall ever since, but it gets worse. Since the court case doesn't state that my mum and stepdad can't not do stuff together, they've been renovating a second property we have. This is today. I come along to help them with the renovating. my stepdad needs to get some nails, I drive him up to  hardware, my mum calls him and asks him to get a 6 pack of beer. I go get it for him, but I ask that he doesn't drink. He agrees. Later my mum has had two drinks, and offers one to my stepdad. I intervene, and just say how about some water. He was extremely grateful for this, but anyway. I go home around like 5:30pm, and they decide to stay at the property for the night. I insisted not, but I can't command adults yet alone my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get a call 8:30pm. They're both drunk. I pick my mum up, because she called me to get picked up. She's far gone, but can talk okay. I'm telling her it's not a good idea to drink in front of a severe drinker facing court cases and you need to step up and lead by example, responses from her vary from ""you have no idea"", ""you're not old enough to know what it's like to sacrifice drinking"", ""you're just a child"" and something idk about ""he was already drinking when you dropped him up to the hardware"". I couldn't tell if this was true. He drove his car down to the property which has an interlock in it, so I assume not... but idk... I can never tell if he's drunk or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked my ass off two years ago to get into a prestigious school that would benefit my final year 12 result... and my school life is precarious, I personally have a real problem with persistent paranoia that sometimes keeps me awake at night until I take melatonin... I find it very hard to make friends at school, yet alone talk to people and I don't have much support from that world. That being said, i'm not antisocial but still talk to people but keep in very tight circles. I sometimes show up to school and just dont want to be there so much because I feel like shit, I go home and just nap for the day, or if I stay at school I don't feel like talking to anyone and everyone asks what's wrong. This is a serious problem of mine. I feel continually like shit like my life is out of control and that my parents are drinking themselves into a coma. My productivity rate has been at 0%, this is my final year of school, I'm falling behind on work, I have no motivation and am feeling like shit and my house keeps crumbling around me. I need some help, and I need to know what to do. I'm naturally lazy, I got into a routine that could withstand that a bit, but now i'm out of that, my life is a mess and additionally i feel like shit. I want to succeed, i've been working my way last year to do well at this school, and now as things get serious... it feels like my life is crumbling.

&amp;#x200B;

This may sound like im faking or something idk but im shaking right now and my mum is currently next door probably drinking and smoking. I can't call her back and ask her to sleep to be sober, but I need help or something to grasp control on this situation.

286,"About a week and a half ago, I met up with a friend who happens to recreationally use marijuana. We live in a 100% weed legal state, and I am in total support of anyone who uses it, I just don't partake myself because I work in health care and it doesn't do anything for me personally.

I have a few chronic medical conditions, including a rare sleeping disorder, which could likely stand to improve from CBD usage, however I have not tried anything or experimented with it.

When we got together, this good friend offered me what he said was an all-CBD edible that he had bought for me, to see if taking it would help me feel better at all. I was totally on board with this. I ate it, and later began to feel funny, which I recognized as only the second time I've ever been high. I told him this and he said he believed he'd given me the right one, but went and checked and found the actual CBD edible, and realized he'd given me one of his THC ones of the same brand. I know it absolutely wasn't intentional and otherwise forgive him.

I have a final interview in a couple days for a job that I will almost certainly be hired for either on the spot or very quickly. In my experience in this field and type of job, once you receive and accept an offer, they quickly send you info for a drug screen, and you have usually 48 hours to complete it or they'll rescind the offer (so that people can't intentionally wait out things they know they'll test positive for of course). It is possible they will take their time to decide or the details will be slow in being pushed through, and if that's the case then this is a non-issue. However, I believe it takes marijuana about a month to leave one's system, and I currently believe the drug screen would more than likely fall in that time frame.

I don't really have the option to delay the interview or the offer acceptance, should they make it. I very much need this job - it is perfect for my aforementioned sleep disorder, and that has been damn near impossible to find, so I don't want to chance anyone else swooping in and taking it while I'm delaying.

So my question is - assuming I am going to need to take the drug screen within the time that I will likely test positive, do I come clean to them before it, tell them exactly what happened and that I will likely test positive but that I do not use it, I will test clean a week from now, and offer to take random drug tests at any time during my employment to demonstrate my drug-free status? Or, do I take the test, wait to see if it does come back positive, and then explain myself if so?

The issue I see with the first option is that I'll be incriminating myself before the test even happens, admitting to the use, whether intentional or not, of marijuana, and they won't care about the circumstances it was under, and they'll immediately rescind the offer.

My concern with option two is that they'll just see the positive test and won't even reach out to me for an explanation, they'll just change their minds and take back the offer, having already decided that I must be a drug user.

But I'd love to hear the advice of you lovely people, anyone who might have experience in this area from either side. Thanks in advance for your help.",16Feb2019,1

So in the short 22 years, I noticed that everyone wants to be treated like a human (duh).

But I also noticed that if a person is more attractive, I (as well as I notice people in general), unconsciously treat them better. I managed to mostly purge that out, although at times I notice that occasionally, Im either more comfortable or less comfortable depending on the person's exterior.

Another discrepancy I noticed is that I tend to smile to elderly people and not so much people my age. And I typically tend to talk advisory towards people younger than me.

Is there a mental trick such that I dont act differently depending on the person's exterior? Is there a way such that I can uniformly smile, talk to, as well as listen to people no matter the age, attractiveness, etc?

I decide to get the flights insured just incase she cant afford the spending money when the time comes around as I didnt want to be putting her under any pressure to go.

Last week we found out the date of my cousins wedding coming up is the same weekend she goes away with her friends. She just kinda has the attitide oh well, thats unfortunate and dosnt even weigh up the options of coming with me. 

Do I have any right to be annoyed its not even an option for her? I feel like she could at least give it some thought. Now I dont really mind which she chooses of course I would love if she would come to the wedding as we dont have many family outings and would like her to meet all the family we dont normally get to see. 

Basically do I have any right to be pissed off?

Thanks",16Feb2019,1
294,"Last year, a few days after Valentine‚Äôs Day, my ex boyfriend broke up with me. He was my first gay relationship. Reasons were for breaking up were quite weird, so I think he was definitely keeping something from me.

Prior to Valentine‚Äôs Day, I had come down with the flu and was sick for roughly about a week and a half. So obviously I didn‚Äôt go over for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I also missed school and work because of it. He lived about 1.5 hours away and he didn‚Äôt have a car, so I would normally go to his house about 3 or 4 days a week, but we‚Äôd talk over the phone whenever i didn‚Äôt go over.
Anyways, after Valentine‚Äôs Day he told me it would be best if we saw other people because ‚Äúwe just grew apart.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt go over though.

Valentine‚Äôs Day just happened and it‚Äôs literally all I could think about. I don‚Äôt know if I did anything wrong, but I think it was my fault. I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship since that. I just think it‚Äôll end up happening again 

Looking back at who he was, I now know he wasn‚Äôt any good for me. I was his longest relationship (3 months) he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs been in about 10 relationships... I‚Äôd drive him and his friends around. He ditched me once to hang with his friends after I drove to see him (he told me to go over) 
But even after thinking it through, I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm over it

296,"I‚Äôve been single for 3+ years... I‚Äôve grown to love myself, be more aware, selective, etc. 
I usually choose shitty guys (im 27 btw). I took a good year to myself. To learn about myself and to basically‚Äî-love myself. I‚Äôm not bullshitting when I say that spiritual health is so important and from there on you become mentally and physically stronger. 

So long story short I started talking to this guy who lives two hours from me.. he‚Äôs awesome! I mean that genuinely not naively. 

We rotate and take turns visiting. One weekend he‚Äôll come to me, the next I‚Äôll go to him, etc..

He treats me so good. He‚Äôs considerate, tells me why it takes him so long to reply to a text ( personally I don‚Äôt mind bc I know people are busy and texting is very.. mmmm... boom... personal and out there, maybe even stressful).. he has reciprocated the liking.. but

Part of me wants to ask where he intends on this going.. it‚Äôs been 4 weeks since we started hanging out. ( we had been following each other on instagram for a few years before we made our moves) and now after roughly 3-5 years we‚Äôve finally met up and hit it off. He‚Äôs perfect..

However, I don‚Äôt want to come on too strong. I‚Äôm highly intuitive and hyper sensitive to moods.. but I just get all great energy and vibes with him..

My question is. Would I be rushing it to ask him what he intends on ( after only 4 weeks) or should I just play it cool????  

At the end of the day, what if I never ask and I end up wasting my time!? What if I stick with him and it‚Äôs awesome but nothing ever grows from it?

297,"Our dog just had puppies and my mom doesn't change their blankets and clean up after them nearly as much as i think she should be doing. I think they are 5-6 weeks and she cleans up the room once a day and i just woke up to there being poop and piss everyone in the room we are keeping them and they were gone on a trip i guess expecting me to clean it up after i told them i'm not taking care of dogs when i said they shouldn't have gotten them in the first place. 

   We live in a small house that's not big enough for two German shepherds and puppies. We developed a flee problem with the dogs my mom got before them, and i wanted them get rid of the flea problem and move before they got more dogs. My mom knowingly got more dogs with these issues and she says she gave the dogs flea medicine but forgive me if i'm wrong a magical pill can't get rid of fleas right you still have to clean up, wash clothes, vacuum, spray the yard? Every time i try to tell her the puppies room needs cleaning up or she needs to do something about the fleas it turns into her just calling me narcissistic and saying she's the adult.  

   My dad doesn't clean up or help at all with them and is just okay with them because he thinks he is getting a lot of money when they are sold knowing nothing about how they need shots and the effort it takes cleaning up and taking care of them. Plus isn't it illegal or bad to sell puppies to people knowing they have fleas bad? Also the mother is starting to lose hair on her backside too and i't doesn't look like they are ever getting rid of fleas, and i don't want her to end up like our previous dog with no hair on his backside. I've tried to fix the flea issue myself but my mom has a hoarding issue and doesn't like it when i move stuff or throw stuff away. I will link my parents to this post tell me what advice you would give to them since they don't listen to me and should we just send the dogs to the shelter because the fleas are so bad after we are done with the puppies.",16Feb2019,1
298,"How do you get over not having any close family? Personally I‚Äôve never felt close to any family member . My ‚Äúfather ‚Äú was never a father to me and was an alcoholic/drug addict .  So I have never been close to anyone from my dads side . They are all kinda like my father and have their own addiction and problem . I remember a time when my father mom (my grandma) came to visit when I was a kid and she was only interested in getting to know my brother for some reason and said to me things like ‚Äúyour bossy‚Äù and clearly played favorite to my brother . To be fair I was the oldest sibling and so I was probably bossy towards him . But I just felt like my fathers mom always had to make it a point to call me out on it . I was probably like 8-10 so it really stuck . So I never was really able to have a good bond with her after that because I only really hung out with her that one time she visited me . 

Then there‚Äôs my mom side , who I used to be very close with . My mom was one of 9 sibling so I used to be very connected with all of them on her side . Though I have lived over 5 hours always from all of them since I was 4 years old . My moms side of the family is VERY religious thus being very judgmental. I used to be pretty close to my grandma on my moms side but she got Alzheimer about 3 years ago and no longer remembers me , this has really hurt me and I was the closest to her out of my whole family . I still feel really connected to my grandpa but he is very old and I rarely talk to him.., I don‚Äôt even have his phone number ):  All my moms sibling and their kids are very religious and they judge all my life choices so we arnt close . I‚Äôm not close with any of my cousin or aunts / uncles because of this reason . I used to go to religious camps with all of them but since I stepped away from their faith they have judged me for it and don‚Äôt really talk to me 

Also there is my step dads family . My mom got married to my step dad when I was 10 and they had been dating since I was 7-8 . My mom growing up had always made it a point that  he wasn‚Äôt my real dad.  Whenever they had a augment she would says things like ‚Äúthey arnt your kids so don‚Äôt worry about it ‚Äú I think she was trying to stick up for us in a sense but hearing her say things like that really hurt me because I always wanted to be his kid . My step dads family (mom and dad ) has always been distant from me. They never reach out to talk to me and when they see me it doesn‚Äôt seem like they had missed me or where excited I was their . They always go over to my mom and step and they never tell me they are going. To be honest I don‚Äôt think they have my number , even though I‚Äôve had the same number since the 2nd grade.  They have never contacted me . On Christmas and my birthday they always give my parents money to give to me but never reach out to me personally . So I get that they care just from the  outside... I have never had a deep conversation or been close . 

I do love my step dad but we don‚Äôt have a deep relationship . He helps me out when I need it and I come to him in need . But we don‚Äôt talk about personal things . We never have conversations about relationships or life help I usually just talk to my mom and she relays it to him . I know he‚Äôd take a bullet for me and loves me like his own daughter but there has always been this distance that I‚Äôm not ‚Äúhis real kid ‚Äú because my mom made all of us feel that way.  I‚Äôve tried talking to him about personal thing but he‚Äôs so uncomfortable by it . I told him once I was fighting with my boyfriend and he had literally nothing to say . He just got hella uncomfortable that I was even talking to him and quickly changed the subject . 

My step dad has  a kid with my mom so I have a half brother . His name is Gabriel and he is 8. I love this kid and honestly he‚Äôs the closest family member I have 

Then there‚Äôs my mom . My mom is so judgmental and whenever I tell her anything that‚Äôs going on in my life she uses that as a way to bring me down . Like this the most recent example I had a fight with my boyfriend and I told her that I  was trying to break up with him because I thought he was emotionally immature ... then a few weeks later I invited my mom to come to a comedy show with me and afterwards we got drinks . During these drinks she randomly said ‚Äúoh maybe your the one that is emotionally stunted‚Äù .., she said this out of no where just to make a jab at me . I think she does this as a way to make me ‚Äúchange‚Äù or ‚Äúbe better ‚Äú but she ultimately just uses what I say to use against me later. I called her out on this and she apologized but this women literally does this all the time . She loves to bring me down as a way to ‚Äúteach me thing‚Äù 

Honestly the only one in my family that I actually feel a connection to is my half brother Gabriel , and My step grandparents play hella favoritisms towards him and it‚Äôs hard to not feel jelouse . Like I honestly think it stems from my mom . Take this last Christmas they gave my little brother 200 dollars and they gave me 100 and my mom says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lot considering they arnt your real granparents ‚Äú like I didn‚Äôt even comment on how much they gave us . It was my little brother that was bragging about getting more and that was my moms response . I wasn‚Äôt even mad at the situation whatso ever and was happy with whatever they gave me ,

Idk it‚Äôs just hard sometimes knowing you don‚Äôt really have any family members that care about you ACTUAL life outside of the physical . It just makes me sad because growing up family was very important and now I don‚Äôt relate to any of them . I just wish I had someone to talk to , 

All I can do is nurture the relationship with my little brother I guess and focus on our bond ",16Feb2019,1
299,"Hey, 
This is my first time writing here so it's going to be hard to summerize everything I am going through.

I've been feeling very shit lately because I feel like people sometimes misunderstand my personality and it has been bugging me for years now.

Two years ago, I have dated a girl that has recieved many and many warnings from people about the type of person I am, some people said that I was impuslive and self distructive, and that I well eventually cheat and use her, and that has led us to eventually break up because it was always me trying to prove my worth and eventually after all the hasle that happened and tryong to convince her to trust me I just couldnt handle the commitment that I had to a relationship that I lost interest in. 

Why did she recieve the warnings though? because where I come from and the enviroment that both me and her share the space in, everyone knows everyone. And shit spreads around very fast, espically when you do stupid mistakes that come bitting back at you.

And it feels like everytime I try to start again and reform myself from repeating that mistake, espically in dating and friends. People like to spread shit that is not relevant anymore.

Come back to today and I've met a girl couple of months ago, shes very sweet and kind and we only hit it off after four months of knowing each other... it was apparent that me and her liked each other back and we had a very good first date not long ago.

She apparently, right now, going on a school trip with bunch of friends that knew my ex a couple of years back and they've warned her to be careful about me since I broke up with my ex for ""no apparent reason"".

I overthink these situations a lot, and when I look back at it now, it seems as though it never stops. I've lost many many friends because of cases like these and it keeps haunting me even though this was years ago.

I won't deny the fact that yes, I tend to be Impulsive and say stuff that I don't mean  And yes I tend to appear cocky sometimes, but this does not mean that I don't want to become better.

Seems as though everytime I do try, I end up alone, and it really hurts to stay locked up like that.

I don't want to lose great opritunites to meet new friends, I don't want to lose the new relationship I established with this girl, I don't want to lose who I am aswell.

Any advice?

TL;DR: I know this is a long post, I couldn't summerize it any better since this revolves around many things in my life.

312,"TLDR @ bottom 

My boyfriend is 23m, I am 21f. I moved across the country for him and because I heard his state has some decent education for college students. Plus the way his mother and him made it sound; A Mexican, first generation college student, STEM, female would get basically a free education due to my minority status. (I don't think I even got FASFA but I think it's because it still paid for my instate college as I transferred but that's a different story. 

The arrangement we had was I would live with him and his family while I go to college. He said he was going to pay for my college as he was working and was not going to school to further my education. 

But he quit his job where he worked with a family friend, I understand as his boss was an ass and it wasn't very stable work. He is supposed to work with his dad for their company but even then they get into screaming matches and he ends up not going. He does not actively seem to be looking for jobs and when I mention it he says , ""really?? It's only been two weeks since I quit. "" 

I had a job at my college but it was temp and I lost it. Before then he would tell me I don't need to worry as he will support me and I don't need a job. 

I owe 3,000 in school for college lol. He has no job, I just lost mine. I'm applying and applying and waiting. While he is lax and smokes weed and plays video games all day. 

I smoke weed and love video games too, but staying up until 5am eating junk food, smoking weed, and playing video games gets kinda old don't you think. His online friends encourage this behavior they all do it. But they also are jobless and have nothing better to do too. 

When we play video games together he likes to complain about what I do wrong and how I screw him over with what I do and how he is tired of carrying the team. (We play smite) or when we play (fighterz) he can play that shit for hours. I get tired after 4 matches sometimes 7 and he gets so upset and says we barely played anything. It's not fun losing every match and I am not too interested in the game. 

He doesn't have the best hygiene either. He gets lazy and stays downstairs and pisses in empty water bottles. His friend (and he confirmed) told me there was a time they had to throw out his collection of piss bottles, some even collecting spores. I can't remember the last time he brushed his teeth, and he has awful breath and I have to look away and he kisses me on the cheek. I tell him he should but he usually waits until he showers to brush his teeth (which can take days at a time). For someone who sweats a LOT and in his sleep you would think you shower more? 

His IRL best friend seems him as a lazy loser too. Shit his entire family thanked me for making him get his GED, cutting his long gross hair, and getting a job. 

Then I moved in, with the idea he would work, maybe I would too, I would get a great education and things would be great. 

When I suggest things he just wants to stay in. Even to friends houses he would rather they come here. 

I don't know what I'm expecting but I feel really disappointed with what's going on. I'm hoping when school ends in may and we head to my state with my family maybe I will see things more clearly but idk 

Am I dating a loser? Am I missing something? Do I need to do something? I feel lost on how to handle this relationship because I'm not happy currently. 

TL;DR // 21Female worried she is dating a loser 23Male and does not know how to approach this issue. Worried I am missing something (is he depressed, lazy, or is this just him.) And how can I fix this.

Thank you, any advice is appreciated.

338,"Good morning,

Last night my girlfriend and I pulled the trigger on a breakup that we have both seen coming for a while now. She is moving out of our apartment today and taking our dog with her. I'm an emotional wreck right now and I don't know if I'm making the right decision with this breakup. For this story to make sense I have to give you a little backstory quickly. 

When my girlfriend and I met 1.5 years ago, I was going through a huge transition in my life. I went from being 256 lbs to 170 lbs in a matter of months. I went from being completely unemployed to now being employed at Delta Airlines and can travel the world for free. Right after having those significant changes, I met my girlfriend. I immediately dove into that relationship. She is the smartest person I think I have ever met, and she has the kind of the drive and desire for success that you would expect out of like Bill Gates of Elon Musk. It can be inspiring to be around. That is one reason why I love her, she makes me want to be better. However, that is also a downside. I feel as if I am constantly trying to live up to some sort of expectations, even if she never placed them onto me. It overwhelms me so much. 

So throughout this relationship the responsibilities and pressure kept piling up and I still feel as if I'm the obese, unemployed, stoner kid that I was before I met her. I've felt like throughout all of this I've just constantly been pretending to be someone I'm not. It's someone that I would like to be, but it's not someone that I am right now. I'm not ready to settle down and buy a house or have kids. When we initially met we discussed both wanting those things by 30 years old and I thought that was feasible. But now those numbers we essentially upped to like having them by 26-27 years old and I just don't have the money or desire for something like that. 

All of that is besides the point though, the main cause for our issues is that I don't want to hang out with her anymore. She just wants to feel loved and deserves that love but after months of feeling like I had to pretend to be someone I am not, I just cant do it anymore. I never want to hang out with her at home. I just want to smoke weed and play video games. I'm just so stressed out from school and work and dealing with adult responsibilities that I just dont have it in me to go out and play boyfriend. I didn't realize it until it was too late but I have just been toxic to be around. For like 3 months straight we just sat down every night and basically didn't hang out and just talked a little bit and repeated the same thing the next day. It's not that I don't want to do things, I just am anxious and stressed out and would rather do something else. But that is not what she wanted and I am not being fair to her. 

So now we live in this toxic atmosphere and I'm about to lose her and the dog and I'm just an emotional wreck right now. Am I being crazy for accepting this breakup because I feel like in order for it to work I have to change the fundamentals of who I am? Or should I be trying to change who I am and the mindsets I have? I'm so torn by this.

I missed a whole lot of stuff but if anyone has any advice or would like to talk more about it I would really appreciate it. It's just her and I in this apartment until she leaves today and I need to know if I'm making a giant mistake.",16Feb2019,2
339,"For context, I've had the same boss for several months, and knew her within the organization before she became my boss (although she understandably may not have known how to spell my name then).
Here's the confusing part for me: I have a difficult last name and typically encourage people not to worry about it and to just use my very easy first name, and I'm the only person in our organization with that name so it hasn't posed any problems. My boss has gone to the trouble of spelling the more complicated parts of my last name correctly, but consistently use the wrong vowel in one place. She does this in emails, where my name comes up in the contact info on any email and is at the bottom of what I've sent if she's replying to me, but it doesn't bother me terribly even though it's weird to see that one letter error and everything else right. She did it on my annual performance review, and that was what really got to me. That's one place where she actually had to use my full name, and one place where it mattered, and I think I feel insulted but I also don't want to be harsh with her because it seems like she's TRYING. But it would have been so easy to check the spelling. It's spelled correctly in so much easily addressable documentation, including previous reviews where my former supervisor got it right.
I also have noticed that she seems sensitive to criticism, as I've had to gently point out errors and concerns important to the job, and she seemed to get a little rattled.

345,"I broke up with my ex a while back, she has been very depresssed before we were dating and during the time that we were, she talks about suicide sometime. She hasn't done it because she's still alive nor hospitalized. After we broke up she thinks that I somehow hate her now (I don't hate her, we broke up because of reasons on my side) and that her best friends for years hate her as well. She recently was texting me and was implying heavily that she was involved with drugs and alcohol. She told me later that she doean't take drugs but I'm doubtful on that. She tells me that she has a psychiatrist but I don't believe that because I tried to get her to go to one before and.she got really pissed instead of just telling me that she has one. 

She thinks that she doesn't have a meaning in life and that her being dead would just help her parents financially so they don't waste money on her (she has other physical diseases which require medicines that she doesn't take because she thinks that shes gonna die anyways). When ever she talks about suicide and then later the suicide situation gets resolved she'd say some very not practical goals to stay alive with such as haven't watched the fourth avengers movie.

Her friends and I tried to talk to her and tell her that we don't actually hate her. We just don't want to see her doing the wrong thing and truly wants to help her. She doesn't get that. How can we help her even though she doesn't want help? And the 'psychiatrist' that she's got is probably more fictional than vaccines causing autism!

Sometimes this feeling goes away in 30 minutes or so but there were someday's that I felt mad throughout the whole day. 

Today I was just minding my own business walking down the street and there was a group of teenagers that started shouting racist slurs to me. This ruined my whole day actually.

351,"I‚Äôm 17 years old and I need some advice and exterior opinions. My mom has been liberal regarding me smoking weed before I sleep, which has been helping me a lot in terms of insomnia. If I don‚Äôt smoke, I‚Äôll say up till 3 to wake up four hours later, and If I smoke, I‚Äôm passed out by midnight or less, which has been a great help when it comes to having enough energy for school. It has been like this for some months, with the agreement that I won‚Äôt smoke while in school or if I have to study. I‚Äôve been doing my part of the deal, and I only smoke in my time, not bothering anyone. I keep my door locked cause of paranoia, but I‚Äôve always kept it that way since I am here. Apparently the fact that I keep my door locked bothers my stepfather and mom, but it‚Äôs something that gives me the comfort of true privacy. Because there‚Äôs also my stepsister living with us, she‚Äôs about the same age, and I wouldn‚Äôt want any awkward run-ins or anything. 

Now she decided out of nowhere it was time to stop. She says it is affecting her that I ‚Äú am always locked up in my room  (shit, I‚Äôm a bit of a cave hermit, but I think people should respect that) doing drugs ‚Äú
Fuck, I don‚Äôt want to stop smoking my little J every night. It‚Äôs done me great help. Is she right in doing this? I know that I am a teenager, my brain is still in development and it has a negative impact on that. But it‚Äôs the lesser of two evils. All my friends smoke in school and go to class all fried up, and I see how it affects them. I don‚Äôt want that for me. Why does it bother anyone that I do my thing in my own space at night, away from anyone‚Äôs sight or smell, or that I lock my door cause I‚Äôm a weird fuck with major paranoia? 
Is my mom wrong in doing this? If she didn‚Äôt want me to smoke weed, she could‚Äôve said it in the beggining and never let me create this habit. ",16Feb2019,2
352,"Hey guys, this is a post valentine‚Äôs day problem. I have been dating my girlfriend for the last 6 months and it‚Äôs been great. 

The only thing that I have a question about is our sex life. I‚Äôm 24, and she is 21 going on 22. She‚Äôs lives roughly an hour and change away so we normally see each other once a week since she‚Äôs at school and I‚Äôve got work. Initially, we would have sex every weekend using condoms, but eventually we ditched them. She was worried about the risk of kids, so she said she would look into and start taking birth control. I supported the decision, and we continued on our way. FF to when she actually got the birth control, I asked how it was going. She said that she has and will not be taking it because she doesn‚Äôt like what it does to the body from what she‚Äôs read, and she was taught that it is basically the devil. I was understanding to this, so we continued going about everything normally. 

We also haven‚Äôt been having sex often, and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where it‚Äôs 2-3 weeks each time we have sex. She complains when it‚Äôs been too long between sessions, but she denies my advances and when it does happen, it does not last long enough for me to actually finish. She refuses to let me even come close to her clit, and her reason is always ‚Äúit‚Äôs too intense.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong, and I‚Äôve asked if it‚Äôs something to do with me and she says no. I think it has to do with the risk. Now, I understand that condoms are the easier and convenient solution, and I will be going that route, just to put that out there. However, for me, condoms will result in me 100% not finishing that time. It‚Äôs resulted in days of blue balls and it‚Äôs painful, which I have also told her about. My question is I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm an asshole for thinking it‚Äôs unfair that she has not even tried birth control to avoid everything and wanted to know how I should approach this. ",16Feb2019,1

356,"I was hired by an amazing company mid last year and I started working on a very tight-knit team. 

There was one coworker, who was extremely checked out of the job. Our positions were pretty similar in daily tasks, but she handled them poorly and with a really bad attitude towards the rest of us. I was very communicative with my boss (calling him X) who without me knowing planned letting her go while I was only five months into the job because I took on more work willingly. He felt we could successfully consolidate her role. It was around this time he told me I‚Äôd be getting a promotion. 

Now the only other person on the team was our project manager (calling her Buttercup). Buttercup was always supportive, but she didn‚Äôt have as much of a workload as I did. Her and X were very close and started at the company together, and he always propped her up whenever we had to introduce ourselves to new direct reports. We *always* had new direct reports, so we were constantly introducing ourselves and explaining what our team does. Our newest direct report was the COO (Bubbles) was super cutthroat and wanted to work a lot more closely with us. After I had my first 1-on-1 with her I realized she really liked me, talked me up to the exec team and my boss and even told me what she felt was a more appropriate title. But she always asked me my opinion on Buttercup‚Äôs workload. 

So X didn‚Äôt necessarily like Bubbles, and was job hunting elsewhere because he felt sort of complacent after being there so long. He was honest to me and Buttercup about the job-hunt which I appreciated. Losing him would mean all of his workload being divvied up, but me getting most of it due to the fact that I already handled whatever overflow he had. Literally a week after him telling me about his hunt, he gets an offer and puts in notice. 2 days notice. I was pretty pissed to learn I had 2 days to figure out what the hell I was actually taking on. I got my promotion the day before X told Bubbles he was quitting. 

The days that followed were crazy. I took on as much as I can and we worked out a plan to push some of the excess workload to other departments with Bubbles‚Äô help. I say we, but Buttercup was officially checked out after X‚Äôs departure. She was open about job hunting which fueled my anxiety even more. It was just a team of two. We had a town hall this week and I received an award after being nominated by Bubbles for ‚Äúbest in business‚Äù. Basically for keeping my shit together. Buttercup was pissed and vocalized her disdain by snapping at me on multiple occasions. She basically called me bossy for asking for some important reporting I needed.

Cue yesterday, we‚Äôre pulled into our weekly meeting with Bubbles and going over the next month‚Äôs strategy. Bubbles asks me to leave the room and she‚Äôll grab me after. 10 minutes later she pulls me in her exec office to tell me Buttercup is being let go. The explanation I received is that her role didn‚Äôt feel like a full/actual role based on her slim workload. From 4 to 1 all in 9 months. I‚Äôm reassured constantly that our team is necessary (its partnerships and the board wants us to develop it). I have no direct report who actually understands my day-to-day, I‚Äôm finally building a career for myself, and now I have no team to back me up. 

I feel alone in a weird professional way and I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to handle any more work. I want to communicate this to Bubbles, who keeps asking me to tell her if I‚Äôm stressed, but she‚Äôs cutthroat and I don‚Äôt want to lose my job or be viewed as weak. They‚Äôre not planning to backfill my team until they hire a new director for my department after only *now* finding an exec recruiter. I‚Äôm also one of the youngest people at the company outside of our sales team, and I honestly feel like an amateur masquerading as a management lead.

I don't object about her friends who are completely immoral (drugs, cigs, alcohol daily and other messed up stuff that I'm not going to get in to) because I, including my friends, know that she isn't like her friends and is only associated with them due to personal reasons, family problems etc. She never did anything half as bad as her friends, but still keeps in touch with them, even though most of her time is spent with me. Despite this she recently smoked a nicotine cig, then went on to meet with me. I could tell what she had done by the smell.

362,"Brief Background:
I'm 23, just graduated college in May 2018, and am working in an entry level position at a physician's office in a very large company. I have one year experience in another company that I gained while being in college full time. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and an Associate degree in Business Administration. 

Upon being hired I expressed to my manager that I wanted to become a manager of a physician's practice in the near future, and she said that she understood when she hired me that I wouldn't be there forever. She also stated that she wouldn't hold me back and wants to see me succeed in our company. 

Details:
I work at an office as an over glorified secretary. When I got hired there were 9 of us, and now there are 6. We register for 8 physicians in the office. In regards to my ambition to grow in the company, I took a class through the company for lean six sigma the other month, and am in charge of a work que for insurance claims for the office. 

We currently don't have a senior position, due to the old one leaving a couple of months ago. My manager stated that we didn't need one, and maybe in the future she would appoint one. My coworker stated that all the medical assistants discussed that I would be a great senior and that they don't know why my manager is holding back appointing someone. I know all my manager talks about is the budget, and I think she is reluctant to promote someone to senior due to this constraint. But I might be wrong.

The Issue:
There was a position available for a level one manager a couple of weeks ago. I expressed how the position was 10 minutes from my house (I currently drive 35 minutes to my office now), a ""level one"" means that there are 2-3 physicians that practice in the office (I currently work in an office with 8 physicians and other specialties that we register for.) My husband and I just bought a home, I have a new car, and graduated college, so now I have to start paying back my student debt. I make a little over $12 an hour, and feel like I'm being underpaid for my education, and now have bills that my husband has to take over due to not making an adequate amount of money. 

I met all of the qualifications for the position, and even the preferred qualification of having process improvement knowledge. My manager would get a notification that I applied for the position, so I wanted to discuss it with her before I applied. She responded with, ""I want to be able to give you a stellar review. Right now I wouldn't have anything negative to say, but I think you have more to learn before you take on a management role. I was 26 when I got my first management job, and you definitely get looked down on for your age. If you don't apply I will mentor you for the next 9 months and then we will see where you are then."" Also, I told her that I don't feel like I'm prepared to be a manager because I don't know anything about budgeting, scheduling, quality, etc. She then responded, ""Watch what you say. Some people might take that unsatisfaction as millenial entitlement."" She continued to say that because I was only in my position for 9 months that the upper management might take my ambition as a negative, and that it shows that I'm willing to ""jump ship"" when the opportunity arises. 

Another incident happened recently where a patient's daughter happened to be an employee of our company and her father raved about his experience at our office to her. She ended up sending a ""kudos"" email to my manager. It happened to be a patient that I helped for 20 minutes in figuring his situation out that day. She sent out a mass email to the office acknowledging this incident and said that ""after investigating further, I determined it was (insert coworker's name here) who helped this patient."" She never asked any of the front office staff who assisted the patient, but just assumed who it was. Which it kind of annoyed me because my coworker took credit for my work and didn't correct my manager, so when I stated that it was actually me, my manager was reluctant to acknowledge this. Then later sent an email stating, ""as a follow up...(my name) also assisted this patient with the actual scheduling of the appointment."" It came off as less of a recognition and more of a ""she complained so here is her credit."" 

It's discouraging, and I feel like I'm not learning anything that is going to help me with my career goal. I'm worried that my manager is trying to keep me at our office so she doesn't have to justify hiring another employee to upper management. Did she tell me that she would mentor me just to buy herself 9 months to convince management to give her funding to hire another person? What are some tips that you all have to become a manager? Is there any advice for how to come across as ambitious and not an ""entitled millennial?""

TL;DR I expressed to my manager that I want to apply for a management position at a different office in our company. Now she is analyzing my behaviors, giving other coworkers credit for my work without verifying who the credit is intended for, and taking my ambition as ""millenial entitlement."" Am I being managed up? If so, how do I show my ambition without being given a negative label? Does anyone have tips for becoming a manager at a physician office, or a director in the healthcare field?",16Feb2019,1

Basically she treats my cat like she‚Äôs her own cat and gushes over her all the time, giving her her own little nick names and hogging her in her room. At first I thought it was nice that she liked my cat so much, but I feel it has gotten excessive. 

Unfortunately my cat has absolutely no interest in me and spends all her time with my housemate (sleeping in her room all the time and following her around the house). My housemate really encourages this and my other housemate commented that she thinks this is quite inappropriate, considering that she is my cat.

I spoke to my house mate about this in an assertive and non confrontational manner and she stated that she knows it is wrong and other friends and family have told her this, but she can‚Äôt help it because she loves my cat so much and that my cat scratches at her door all the time (this is not really true because I notice heropening the door when she hears her walk past).

I told her that I appreciate this, but I need her to hold back from now on but she has done nothing since our discussion and the behaviour is continuing.

369,"My ex-girlfriend broke up in a fucked up way. She cancelled a date with me to go out with another guy, broke up over whatsapp, and then she came by with another guy to pick up the stuff she had left at my place. Afterwards I had to try multiple times to reach out to her to get my stuff back, which was answered with things that were clearly meant to hurt me. For example 4 days after the break up I messaged her if I can finally pick up my stuff at her place and instead of just giving me a day on which I can pick it up she told me that isn't at home for a few days. Thanks for letting me know that you sleep over at another guys place already, and if that's not the case then at least show empathy and don't say something like this to a person you just broken up with 4 days ago because that's clearly what the person will think.

I always treated her good. I only insulted her once in the 2 years relationship, I never cheated or anything, so all of this was completely unjustified.

When I picked up my stuff at her place her mother cried and told me that I deserve someone better. After talking a little bit to her parents it became obvious that she lied to them about the break up. (Which left me wondering why her mother already said that I deserve someone better ? She probably brought another guy home while we were still in a relationship or something but I realised to late that she already said that before she even knew how she broke up with me)

She also lied to me I think, because she told me her last partner broke up over whatsapp and was the most pathetic human she ever met because of this. So either she lied to or she must hate herself right now and I'm pretty sure that she lied. By now I'm actually pretty sure that she was the one who broke up with her ex-partner over whatsapp, just like she did with me.

If I would have one wish I would just want her to know how fucking horrible she is. I want her to know that she is a shitty human, but I know that it would be more than just immature to reach out to her just to insult her and one side of me still loves her so I also don't want to hurt her.

373,"So here's the situation:

I'm pursuing a career in pharmacy and I've been accepted into a handful of amazing programs around the US. I've narrowed down my list to the two: UCSF and UT Austin. Both of these schools have amazing programs (in fact they are ranked equally at #3 in the country) and offer so many great opportunities and I know that if I go to either I'll receive a great education that will set me up for my future career. The issue at hand here is location.

My home is SF. I love my city, all my friends and family live here, and it's all around a wonderful place to live.  But, when I visited Austin, I did really like it. I'd never been to Texas before and I was pleasantly surprised by how cool it was.

My parents obviously want me to stay in the Bay Area. They make the case for staying nearer to home just to have the proximity to them and everything I've known. They also say I can save money by continuing to live at home (but to be honest I would like to move out and apply for school housing). In addition, I have an ailing grandfather, an aging dog, and close friends getting married in the Bay, and being closer to them would be valuable.

But I also liked Austin. I would really appreciate moving to a new city, as scary as it is. I've never lived on my own and I would like to strike out as a full-fledged adult. The cost of living is much cheaper in Austin, and once I establish residency in Texas, the tuition would be too. But, I'd also be alone since I have no family near the area. In the long run, I don't see myself living in Texas for my career, so everything would be temporary, but, where I would move after is a mystery for another day.

What do you think? Where would you go if you had a choice between the two cities? Anyone from Austin, and for that matter the Bay Area, that can make the case for your city? Has anyone made the move from CA to TX and have any advice? Also, any tips on how to move out in general?

Lastly, the people that I've talked to also bring up the big weather component. SF is pretty mild year round, but what is Austin like?

Thank you!",16Feb2019,2

This is kind of an ""off my chest"" sort of thing. I'm in year 13, and I'm beginning to regret some of the choices I've made. Maybe it's nerves getting to me as I wait for the rest of the unis I applied to to reject me, but I'm still feeling it nonetheless. 

I'm regretting not applying to places like Canada and Switzerland, and I'm seriously considering taking a gap year so maybe I can do so next year. The problem is, since I'm only considering it now, and don't know what to do. 

I don't have any plans like anyone else I know who's planning a gap year. I don't want it to be a waste - I want it to be meaningful so I can make better applications next year, but I don't know what to do.

I don't know whether I should take a gap, and if so, what even to do.

375,"Ok before i start no i do not have any problems with anyone who is gay or anything but I am not American and being gay is not widely accepted and being gay is potentially dangerous. My mother has this friend who lives relatively close to us and every time i visit this person home I am constantly bug about whether I have a girlfriend or not (I had girlfriends in the past but recent social anxiety has really took over my life when dealing with females) so not having one I try my best to be polite as possible and tell them i don't have one at this moment she will then go on to tell me ""i should get a girlfriend or else people will start saying i am gay"", I think this is what she thinks and she is known to spread rumors.

My friend has a fresh new interest in learning the oboe. She first wanted me to learn with her. I didn't want to be rude so I said I'd think about it, hoping she'd forget. She didn't forget and I said I didn't want to because I like playing the flute. She continued asking, and got the same answer each time. She then tried to kind of bully me into doing the oboe, saying I'm ""so boring"" and never want to do anything ""new"" and ""have no imagination"", most likely because she knows I'm a huge pushover. Now that she notices that won't work, she's moved to very subtle ways of trying to convince me. (DISCLAIMER, I don't know if she's still trying to convince me, but what I mean is she's always talking about it around me in a way like she admires it, which I think is just her trying to change my mindset into admiration of the oboe.) The first time I noticed was when we were working in a hall. Our school has an awards cabinet in that hall, and one of them was for a conductor. Their oboe was in the cabinet too. So she presses her hands against the glass and stares at this old, rusty, oboe, and says ""it's beautiful! V, come look at the oboe! It's so beautiful."" *sorry it's so vague it's just I don't remember exactly what she said.* I ignored it and continued my work. Then, just yesterday, when we were chilling, she had a computer out and turned on an oboe cover of fireflies and made me and our friends watch it.
So she doesn't listen when I tell her I don't want to, takes advantage of my doormattiness when I refuse, and then pesters me about it when I refuse to give her the response she wants. How do I get her to stop trying to get me to play the oboe.
(Also, I feel it's good to mention I can't quit my spot in band, because I like the flute and because there are only 3 flutes in the entire band, and on Thursdays I'm the only flute.)",16Feb2019,1

  For example, my brother in law and his wife got pregnant with their first baby when I was around 8 months pregnant with my second. Instead of being happy for them I got angry. I guess maybe it is because sub consciously I felt that they were taking away from my experience? I have no idea. Logically this seems dumb to me and I get annoyed at myself for feeling that way. When their baby was first born and mine was about 7 months old, my husband told me he wanted to give his brother our rocker that he says we never use, the co sleeper (because our daughter was getting too big for it) and a swing that he also said we never use. I got mad and bitter and did not want to let them use any of it. I felt that we had to buy these things on our own and they get to just benefit from our sacrifice and hard work.

My parents talked about getting a small house their whole life, it's literally their most important dream. They want one in the woods, and they saved up for it. My dad is going to be pensioned in the next few years so they finally started looking for a new home.

First of all, I really want them to be happy. There are just so many things that worry me about this:

- they dont have much money. 20.000‚Ç¨ for a house is nothing. Every hut they showed us was severely damaged and needed repairs done.
- they dont have any experience or have anyone who can give them advice on what to look out for when buying a house
- my dad is only able to do very basic repairs, if any at all. My mom can't do anything.
- they dont have any friends who can help them out with repairing stuff
- my dad is pretty old and sickly. If anything happens, my mother can't drive him to the hospital because she doesn't have a drivers license
- they will be extremely close to each other all day, without anything to do. They never had that experience except on holidays where they were always fighting
- my mother is very social and active, gets depressed when she doesnt have stress. They wont have much to do in the woods and not many people to meet up with
- in case the people already living there are mean they will literally have no where to turn to (people in small communes sometimes dont like outsiders)
- my mom cant go anywhere alone because she cant drive
- her kids (me and my brother) cant visit because its so far and we cant drive either

There are honestly even more reasons but i think thats enough. Basically im worried for my mothers mental and my fathers physical health and im worried they pick a horrible house (because their budget is so low) My brother is worried, too. Whenever we tried talking to them about it, they literally said that we (her kids) just begrudge them their dreams. They are being extremely unreasonable, if they listened to our arguments and thought about it, maybe come up with a few strategies but no, they just dont listen at all. 

Im afraid theyre making a huge mistake but i also feel like its not my place to talk them out ouf it, theyre adults and they dont want any advice... But i cant just let them run into their misery, or do i have to just accept it? Help!

I don't want to go into too much detail, but I don't enjoy any aspect of what I do at my job, and my boss is the definition of a micromanager.  So the obvious solution seemed to be to find another job, and I had an interview the other day that I think went very well for a job that I would actually enjoy.

However, there is one thing that I like about my current job situation, and that is my schedule. My husband works 1pm-10pm, and at my current job I work 1pm-9pm. So we get to spend mornings together, we mostly have the same days off together, we go to the gym a couple days a week, its great. 

If I did get this job that I applied for, I'd be working 8-430, and I'd have different days off than my husband. I'd be going to bed when he was getting home from work, and we would see each other almost never. The pay would be the same at either job, so that's not really a deciding factor. And my skills are best used in an office setting, so really any of the jobs that I'm applying for would probably have the same schedule. I guess right now the two options I can see are to take this job that I'll enjoy (even though the schedule might not be the best for my relationship), or to just stay at this job that I hate and enjoy all the time my husband and I have together.

They expect that when they tell me to do something or they give me advice, I just say yes without asking why or arguing and exposing my points.

And yes, most of the time they're right, they're experience people that've dealt with problems that I haven't. The problem? They dislike when I defend my point or ask for a reason to listen to their advice.

If they tell me ""do this, it's better if you do it in that way"" and I'm not convinced that their way is better than the one I'm using, I ask them why I should use theirs. And they don't like that, they get frustrated explaining why and they hate when I argue, even if I'm just patiently explaining my points. I try to be as polite as possible to not piss them off and they're frustrated anyway. 

They've even brought family friends to the house to tell me that I need to obey them just because they're my grandparents/parents and they're apparently above me in the family hierarchy because I'm the granddaughter. They even try to give me orders and impose me rules, instead of sitting on the table and discussing them as I've asked them to.

This is asfixiating, they have no reason to treat me like that anymore. I'm an adult, they don't pay a single dollar for me because I work and I don't even live in their house anymore because we all moved to my uncle's house, everyone is actually working to move out in their own after this. My uncle is pretty chill but doesn't want to get involved in this.

The worst one is my grandpa, who's extremely condescending, at this point he's called me brat, punk, uneducated, ungrateful, foolish... for politelly defending my point. He thinks I'm ""too rational"" and that ""sometimes you should do as we say without asking why"". 

The worst part is that I feel unsupported by the rest of my family, I feel they can't understand me and no matter how much I explain them that they need to be more flexible and listen and understand me a little more they won't. I feel I live in a dictatorship where my opinion doesn't matter because they never agree or side with me, the better I've done is to make them stop insisting in a point.

**Is this fair? Am I the asshole with the rest of the family for asking reasons and politelly arguing when I don't agree with them? How to act around or with them until I save up to move out?**

405,"Hi, 
   I‚Äôm currently a 19 year-old male in my freshman year of engineering school. My closest friend who I‚Äôve been friends with since pre-school non-stop has been very happy in a relationship. He met this girl about 9 months ago. To be blatantly honest, they met through work while she was in a relationship and my friend and her began hanging out while she was still in this relationship. They began hanging out a lot and began to be intimate, leading her to break up with her SO for my friend. 

  To begin, I‚Äôm not bitter despite the title. I‚Äôve been extremely supportive of their relationship, as I‚Äôm in a relationship of close to 2 years. I‚Äôm always talking the girl up because despite that I don‚Äôt often see her, from what I have seen she is very nice and kind. 
 Growing up, me and my friend have always been more like brothers than friends. I mean this sincerely and not through sentimentality. Everyday after grade school we‚Äôd hang out and talk about the intriguing philosophical questions of life and just do everything together. 

    Where the odd feelings set in was when I noticed that when we‚Äôd hang out, he‚Äôd always talk extremely lovingly about her, always be texting her, always be calling her and even on rare occasion of one-on-one hang outs, he‚Äôd drive over to her house and hang out with her while I‚Äôm waiting in the car. To clarify that this is not a misunderstanding of initial lust, I‚Äôve been in my relationship for much longer and I love my girlfriend a lot and can resonate with my friend about the love and seeing a future with a girl. But where I don‚Äôt agree is blowing me off with excuses that I know are just for more time with her. I hardly see him anymore, which I thought was just beginning stages of life and accepted and supported, but it doesn‚Äôt feel mutual anymore. I work two jobs, see my girlfriend often, and I‚Äôm in school doing a lot of homework and studying and I still find time for my friend. He has taken the work force path which I understand can be exhausting, but me and him don‚Äôt do anything exhausting enough to make him not want to hang out.  

    In this all, I‚Äôm partially worried because of the potential for heartbreak where it‚Äôs his first real relationship, and the balance of friends/work/love is almost non/existent to very rare. But also  I guess I do miss my friend. I have a good amount of acquaintances through school and work and such, but me and my friend are very compatible friends and I treasure that. 

    I‚Äôve brought this up to him before and it always seems like a deferment to what I‚Äôm asking about is brought up. Like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident me and her will be together forever‚Äù, ‚ÄúMe and you are still friends just sometimes life comes up‚Äù,etc.
All things I deal with and understand, but not real excuses to blow off a loyal friend of 16 years who has helped through very hard times, family losses and offered real utilizable advice through it all. He seems less interested even when we are hanging out like I‚Äôm a burden to his quality time with her.

I‚Äôm looking for opinions on this matter,

Is this the transition of a close friendship to an acquaintanceship?

If not, what else could it be? 

I‚Äôm starting to get less confused and more frustrated/angry about lying to me for her when no one has to be lied to. 

Thanks for any feedback and have a good day to all.

406,"Hey, so background: my girlfriend took a temporary position with a company a number of months ago. The wage was X. When that position expired, a permanent employee left and my girlfriend was brought into that position, but again, as a temp (I think that's because they wanted it filled, but it was outside their hiring season, I think that's what they said). When she signed onto this new ""temp"" position, the wage was again X and she also started to receive benefits, due to how long she had been working for the company.

Now, she's being fully brought on to her new position permanently. The employer said her wage now will be two dollars less than it was before.

I'm livid.

The reasoning is ""to maintain internal equity"". The other employees in the same role are making two dollars less than X as well. But I'm confused because she was already making X in the first place. Further reasoning is that she will have full benefits, but she already had benefits due to her long tenure as a temp.

She likes the role and the company. She hasn't accepted the decrease yet, she's still being ""interviewed"", but her supervisor knows and wants her to stay. What should she do to get her pay back to X?",16Feb2019,1
409,"okay this is long but i am torn and don‚Äôt know what to do (and pretty interesting story i promise). I am an 18 yo female and I identify as bisexual, I have only been with males but I know i have a sexual attraction towards girls. 

When I was 15 and a sophomore I went to an all girls school and my last period I had art class that was mixed with all the grades. The girl directly across the table from me was a senior and since the first day of class there was something that gravitated me towards her. she had this long wavy hair, porcelain doll skin, perfectly thick eyebrows, bubbly personality, petite, made honor roll, and so on. she was everything that i wasn‚Äôt and what i wanted to be. over the school year i wouldn‚Äôt say we became close but we did talk an awful lot to each other about our lives and interests and problems and whatever. 

the last 3 months of the school years she had gotten a boyfriend and would talk about him but i didn‚Äôt take much notice of him. he followed me on instagram and i followed back but that was that. it wasn‚Äôt until that summer she graduated that i had realized i had a crush on her, maybe even was in love with her in the most innocent way possible. i was only 15 and she was 18 and i had never had feelings like that about a girl until her. when she graduated that was the last time i saw her or even spoke to her but we still had each other on all social media.

fast forward 2 summers later and my boyfriend of a lengthy time had just broken up with me. i was going to start college and i wanted to meet people. i had gotten tinder and a couple days later while i was on it i saw him. the girl i had a crush on from sophomore year, it was her boyfriend. i haven‚Äôt told him this, yes i did think he was attractive, but i had swiped right on him because i thought they were still together and i wanted to possibly catch him cheating. we matched and he had messaged me the next night. we had messaged for a week before we met and even then it wasn‚Äôt much flirting, just two people getting to know each other. when we met we had gone on a ‚Äúdate‚Äù to get sushi and he didn‚Äôt bring her up so i just didn‚Äôt say anything to him or her. he said he liked talking to me and he wanted to hang out again so we did. on the second so called date he had told me about how a month prior he broke up with his ex and that he had cheated on her over message, snapchat, and in person with a dozen other girls and he had just wanted to ‚Äúbe real‚Äù with me from the beginning because he liked me. 

also the second time when we hung out (when he had told me about cheating) i had realized that i was falling for him. i truly thought he was charming, cute, intriguing, and funny. we ending up hanging out more and on the 6th date i kissed him. at this point she had found out somehow about us and blocked me on every social media, i was secretly heart broken because i knew she hated me and i just wanted to tell her everything. but soon after we had started a sexual relationship and then started dating a month and a half later. 

we have been together for half a year now and i love him with all the love that i have. we spend a generous amount of time together and we would do anything for each other and i consider him my best friend. but we do fight. sometimes being the insecure girl i am, i start arguments about how i think he will cheat on me because he‚Äôs done it before (i always thought if he would do it to her even though she‚Äôs so perfect why would he do it to me). 

but he always had negative things to say about her, never once have i heard him say something nice. he would give dumb excuses to how she was annoying because she wouldn‚Äôt have much sex with him, she was a vegan so she wouldn‚Äôt let him eat meat, he found her boring because they wouldn‚Äôt go out much, etc. but secretly i wanted to know more and more. i didn‚Äôt think she was annoying so those things i thought she was perfect the way she was. a few weeks ago when we were cleaning his room together i had found an envelope of homemade cards she would give him from vday, christmas, birthdays, and i got a lump in my throat and quickly put them back away where we wouldnt see them on purpose. i wasn‚Äôt jealous of her but i had realized i was jealous of him. he didn‚Äôt deserve any of those, i should have been the one to get those cards and letters. 

since then it‚Äôs been eating me alive that i‚Äôm still in love with her. lately i‚Äôve been thinking about how he took advantage of this girl that i wanted to give the world to.

if you have made it reading all this way, thank you. but my question for advice is this. the question is not should i tell him, but should i feel guilty for still liking her? even though my intention was different at the beginning i ending up falling in love with him, but i‚Äôll always have her in the back of my mind. 

[and if for some reason she ends up finding this: please know from the bottom of my heart, i am so sorry and i think about you everyday and i hope you are doing okay, w.]

                                                                  -l",16Feb2019,3

412,"ever since i was a little girl, I'd always be the 3rd wheel in friendships. at first, it would go well, then i would be replaced. i don't know what's wrong with me, that's just how it works for me. I'm always the one fighting for my friend. I've never been fought over. i don't think I'm that boring, or mean, ... it just always happens.

this year was good. i have a best friend from last year: lacey. and i made a new friend: Natalie. and they're great. for the first few months, we'd all hang out, but they'd be \*my\* best friends. I'd be the person in the middle. to each other, they were my ""other bestie"". and it was great, I'd never felt so valued.

I'd been called ""best friend"" from Natalie and it felt so good. to lacey and Natalie, they were just acquaintances/friends.

but recently, they started being more than friends. they make plans behind my back, and only invite me when i find out. lacey invited Natalie to try out for volleyball with her. but not me. and we've been best friends for longer than lacey and Natalie knew each other. i never knew about it until they spoke about it in front of me. i asked what they were talking about and they invited me. i suppose they couldn't just hide it from me at that point. they had to invite me, so they did. and i didn't go. i didn't want to feel like a poor puppy dog who's chasing after their owners. i didn't want them to look at me and think how pathetic i was, coming after their plans just so i would be included.

and now, they are both on the team. now all they talk about, in front of me, is ""volleyball, volleyball, volleyball."" and they know i feel excluded. i could see it in their eyes and hear it in their voices. they want to talk about their team in front of me so i know how they have a thing together that i don't. why do i assume the worst? because i know them. and yeah, they're my best friends, but they also happen to be bitches.

the two have never hung outside of school without me, (they've only known each other for 7 months since i introduced them) and I've hung out with each separately. soon i feel like that is going to change. and i don't want to feel like a jealous loser, but i can't help but feel this way. i feel excluded... like they favor each other more than me... and the worst part is i can't escape from them. i have 4 out of 6 classes with them. i can't just unfriend them, or I'd be riding solo while they will rub it into my face that I'm not friends with them anymore. and i can't bear that.

so, I'm trying to hold on for 3 more months until this school year's over and maybe next year I'll meet new people who won't exclude me purposely. but until then, what do I do to feel better? more independent? maybe win my best friends back?",16Feb2019,1

414,"Super long, so be warned:

Basically, I got really close with a super rich, super hot girl I never dreamed I'd have a chance with. Like she's seriously the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Anyways, we talked for a few months and one day she texted me basically begging me to date her. I was supposed to see her the next day, but something tragic happened and she never brought it up again. In like late November, she told me that we'd be dating if we didn't live so far apart. I figured that I guess she just wasn't into me like that anymore and it sucked, but she's way out of my league so I was sorta prepared for it. I had told her that I was going on a New Year's trip with some friends and she said (and I quote almost verbatim): ""Are you gonna hook up with any girls? Tell me if you do, I'd tell you if I do."" I assumed we were just really close friends at this point, so whatever. Two weeks after my trip, I get a drunk call and she's asking why I don't love her, why I cheated on her (?), why I'm embarrassed by her... I told her that she told me that we weren't gonna date 'cause of the distance, and then she starts crying and basically says that I ruined it. The next day, she ""doesn't remember"" what she said and I just left it at that. 

We stayed really close and we start talking about the future and how shit is gonna be. She talks about how she wants to meet the dude she's gonna marry and how she wants to have a family, and jokes that I'm obviously gonna be at the wedding. At this point it's pretty clear that I'm not the guy she wants, and I came to terms with that so it was alright even if I did love her. One day, she tells me that she hooked up with someone else so I guessed that she for sure didn't like me anymore, but then a few days ago I get another drunk call asking why I rejected her, whether I think she's ugly, telling me that she wants to fuck, telling me that she loves me for real, etc. What the fuck? 

Has anyone had an experience like this? What the fuck is going on here? I do love her (at least I did) but just never made any moves after November 'cause of what she told me and the way she was talking. I kept talking to her 'cause I did love her and figured that she'd eventually find someone else but that until then, we could at least stay close. When she told me she hooked up with the other dude my heart sank (almost literally felt like it) but at this point I don't even care anymore, which makes me question if I actually did love her. All my friends are telling me to drop her 'cause she isn't worth it but I just can't do it. She's like a part of my life at this point and I know that without her there will just be this depressive void. Despite that, I don't even know if I wanna date her anymore after this fucking roller coaster. 

Has something similar happened to any of you? How would you guys deal with this? ",16Feb2019,1
415,"All of my Highschool time my social anxiety has kept me from having fun, now im 15(almost 16)and im going to college in 2 years. I didnt have much social interactions at all exept for my close friends because i was too scared of judgement and rejection. I would‚Äôve loved to have more friends, go to parties, smoke, drink and overall experience and experiment, but i just ended up playing video games with my friends on discord and crying myself to sleep every evening. Dont get me wrong i did have great moments on there but nothing to create memories or to keep me happy for a long time. When people say ‚ÄûHighschool was the best time in my life‚Äú or i see people actually enjoying themselves and having no problem making new friends i die a little inside thinking of my wasted time. I dont want to be my college experience go down the same path. Just for the record, im not a selfdiagnosed attention seeking edge lord wanting to seem special, i was diagnosed by my therapist with social anxiety disorder. My family stopped paying for therapy sessions since they thought i was getting better, which isnt really true but i didnt want to bother them anymore because of financial issues etc, it didnt help anyway. I also dont want to take medication or drugs like xanax and weed that could potentially help because they all dont seem to work for me. So now i thought that i would go Hitchhiking for one whole year after Highschool to force myself interacting with strangers and to possibly improve my social skills, who knows maybe ill even meet new people. I hope that this helps me in college and later in life with handling social situations and making new connections. I dont want to stay lonely for ever and having anxiety attacks when ordering at a restaurant.
My question is: 
Is it possible that this would work or will it only be torture that leaves me even more scared of other people? Any personal experiences or advice?

418,"(TRIGGER WARNING!)

So to prefis this, this happened in december and January and it still effects me whenever I see that my best friend and boyfriend still hang out with this person. I've had a hard time trusting people because of alot that's happened 8n my past, so when someone breaks my trust, they dont get it back. (Sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes)

So, my bf tried to severly hurt himself a few times over that past month so much so that I asked one of our friends to call the cops if he tries something again. She told me it wasnt her job to do that and I just got really upset. She said she'd tell me if it happened again and made it seem that since I was dating him that I should call the cops. I pointed out that if she cares about him then she should call the cops as that what friends should do if some one they care about is in trouble. But she made more excuses. 

Later on 8 found out she told my bf, as they work together, what I asked of her and my btw ended up going on her side. So I called her out and told her she shouldnt have dont that as now I wont be told anything anymore. She then tried to make excuses and tried to back track what she said and I called her out for it. 

Everything came to a head at one point. The night before new years eve, my boyfriend asked why I cant I just have more faith in her, and I just broke down crying so bad my parents had to come over and calm me down. On mew 6ears eve I told him that he had no right and that I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but she told him everything that happened and o will not trust her again. 

New years day, after alot 9f drinking the night before, I tried to hurt myself and only told my best friend. That week, I had the biggest break down I've had in a while, 8 said some horrible shit to my friend, bf and called the girl out again. She laughed at me and asked why I still cared about this. I ended up in the hospital for a few hours and spoke to a crisis worker. 

My bf and best friend didnt talk to me for a while and my bf told me right before he went to work that he was thinking about breaking up with me. I cried alot that day and by that point my bestfriend started talking to me again after a long talk. She agreed that he shouldnt have done that and that it was disrespectful. I felt really bad about the whole situation.

We ended up staying together, but webuaf a long discussion with each other. Everything we spoke about we both agreed, we both knew that we need to help each other put when we arent doing well, and we need to be there for each other and work on thing inside ourselves. 

Cut to about 3 weeks ago. I was playing overwatch with my bestfriend and I made a joke about the one girl wishing that I didnt exist, it was a throw away joke that shouldnt have been taken seriously. It ended up going into a big argument between us and I just left the chat without saying anything. That night was one of the toughest, I also had someone I, used to call a friend egging me on to off myself, the emotions I felt were overwhelming and I just wanted everything to stop. 

I had a belt with me most of that night, but I was too weak physically to go through with any plan, but I did try. 

No one in my house, nor my bestfriend or bf know about what I did. And idk how to explain to them what happened and why it did. The entire situation makes me triggered and whenever I see that girl It always makes me want to cry. If I'm being unreasonable, please tell me, but I really need to know how to move past this.

General Gist of the Prank:
The girl that I like invites me over to a party and asks me to stay after the party too.

Pre Context:
I had also played a prank on her earlier leading her to believe that I went to the movies with the girl that I like

Post Prank:
She gets a bit suspicious and messages the girl that I like about said situation next thing I know I get a few messages here and there. I try to explain to her that it is just a simple and harmless prank and that the girl I like was fine with me doing said prank.

442,"My roommate is in an abusive relationship. 

She has been dating this guy for about seven months. They've broken up twice but she inevitably goes back to him. I know leaving abusive situations is hard and complicated; I've been on the receiving end myself. But it baffles me the level of outright abuse she will tolerate. 

At the beginning of their relationship he would comment on her clothes and ask her to wear more modest outfits. Not that it matters, but she doesn't dress in a revealing way to begin with. She asked for my opinion at the time and I told her from the start that it was a red flag.

It gradually escalated to the point where this guy won't let her see her friends. She's not allowed to eat at a certain restaurant without him because it's their spot. She has to send him selfies multiple times a day so he knows what she's wearing and can check the background to make sure she is where she says she is. He tells her she's grounded which means she's not allowed to go anywhere but school, work, or home. When she's grounded she's also not allowed to text anybody besides him or use social media. He checks her phone later to make sure.

If he finds out she broke any of his rules he'll beat the shit out of her. Sometimes he chokes her. Usually he'll beat her arms or legs so she can hide it and then tells her to wear long sleeves and pants. Once he gave her a black eye and everyone found out, which led to their first breakup. He also threatens to kill her especially if she says she wants to break up with him. Sometimes he threatens to kill himself too but his family says he doesn't mean it and it's a tactic he's always used to manipulate people. 

After I found out he hit her the first time I tried to get her to leave him and decided he would no longer be allowed in my house. Since then he has showed up to kidnap her a couple of times, which includes him calling/ texting her excessively and blaring his car horn in the street. On one occasion he showed up in the middle of the night and knocked on her window until she agreed to go outside for fear of him trying to break in. When it escalated to that point I told her that the next time he showed up and/or entered our property the police would be called. 

I've tried dozens of times to encourage her to make the right decision to leave this guy and told her that I'll be there supportively through the entire process if and when she wants to file a police report/ restraining order. Or just to have her back when shows up here again. I've encouraged her to speak to therapist just so she has someone qualified to help her work through it. She won't. 

It just blows my mind that she keeps going back. The last time she left him she felt free and told me about how huge of a relief it was. But within a week she felt guilty because he kept texting her about how sorry he was. She told me she wasn't even in love with him anymore but changed her mind again once he won her over. 

I wish there was something I could do. I am truly afraid for her safety every time she goes to his house but without her cooperation the police will do nothing. If he ever gives me the opportunity I'll call the police myself, but at this point he's learned to stay away from me.

Any advice is appreciated. 

I love her and she's one of my best friends, not just a roommate. But it's really hard on me to watch her stay like this.",16Feb2019,1
443,"So this has been bothering me for some time. I‚Äôve asked friends, and even a therapist and they‚Äôre all in agreement, but I would like a poll from the general populous. 

So about 5 months ago I went to ImagineFest in Atlanta with four other people, all male. It was decided ahead of time that we were gonna drop acid, pop molly, the whole nine. On the first day, we hippy flipped (took shrooms and acid) I had what I imagine to be 2 grams of shrooms and three tabs. I‚Äôm familiar with hallucinogens so I wasn‚Äôt too worried about how I was gonna feel because I‚Äôve done it before. About 25 mins later it hit me, and I‚Äôm having a great fucking time. We get into the festival and we‚Äôre all sitting in a semi circle eating cheesy potato chips, and then  one of the guys gets my attention to let me know that two more of our friends are one their way and about to show up, so he asks me to come with him. Seeing no problem, I get up and follow him. Up until we get to the campsite I‚Äôm vibing, having a great time, having a sensory overload and it‚Äôs great. Once we get to where we parked/camped, I notice that neither of our friends are there, but I chalk it up to us just being early so we can drop a pin and wait. Mind you, I‚Äôve maybe been tripping for two hours max, so I haven‚Äôt even peaked yet. Naturally, I ask this guy to call the one of the guys we‚Äôre allegedly supposed to meet up with. This is where the first red flag pops up. He puts the call on speaker phone, so I can hear it. Once our friend picks up he tells us that he has no idea what we‚Äôre talking about and that he‚Äôll be there in 2-3 hours. This is when the trip goes south, but I still haven‚Äôt picked up on this guy‚Äôs intentions. 

Thinking that it‚Äôs odd we‚Äôre there so early, I ask him, ‚ÄúHey, why are we here so early?‚Äù. To which he responds with, ‚ÄúIDK man, but we‚Äôve got a lot of time.‚Äù Then I notice that I‚Äôm getting nervous, my heart rate increases, and I start to feel uneasy. I ask him to call our friend again because it‚Äôs possible I could‚Äôve been hallucinating. He pulls out his phone and calls me. I tell him that he‚Äôs calling me and he hangs up to redial... and calls me again. At this point I‚Äôm still unaware of his intentions, so I press answer and point the screen at him to show him that he is calling me. He seems to not even notice and begins talking on it like he‚Äôs having a conversation. Then it gets weird.

I‚Äôm paraphrasing here, but something along the lines of ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre tripping, but _____ is looking really cute...‚Äù He‚Äôs referring to me. I think he‚Äôs joking because I‚Äôve never been hit on by a guy before, but for some reason my gut is telling me that something is not right. 

I decide to stay, and then it hits me. This wave of what I first perceived as my own sexual urges, but it feels like something is not right about it. And that‚Äôs when I realize it has a homoerotic aire to it. This is when I get extremely nervous because I‚Äôve never felt this way on a trip before. On previous trips, I‚Äôve noticed that I was able to read how people were feeling, and everyone I‚Äôve tripped with recognized that. Furthermore, I identified as a straight male my entire life, and at one point in time, had a girlfriend that I planned to marry. Anyways, my ‚ÄúSpidey senses‚Äù are tingling, and then I begin to analyze the situation. We‚Äôre there early, I‚Äôm uncomfortable for some unknown reason, my gut is telling me to GTFO of there, he put the phone on speaker, he‚Äôs been staring at me this entire time. Then I put the pieces together, this guy is trying to get me to have sex with him, and he thinks he‚Äôll be able to do it while I‚Äôm tripping. It explains the urgency of my anxiety, why I picked up a homosexual vibe, and why we‚Äôre there so early. At this point I freak the fuck out, I get angry, and I walk off. I feel violated almost, and I start to cry. About a quarter mile later, this kid finds me, and I confront him about it. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt appreciate what you just tried to do there.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù He responds.
‚Äú(His name), I‚Äôm not gay, what the fuck was that about?‚Äù

Now I found this weird as a response. He didn‚Äôt explode on me, he didn‚Äôt tell me I was trippin, he just seemed to brush it off. 

So still untrusting of him, I go to the med tent and report this shit because I‚Äôm shook. His facial expression when he found out, wasn‚Äôt anger, it wasn‚Äôt confusion, it was embarrassment. 

Now some background. I‚Äôve never seen this kid hook up, or even talk to a girl from previous times we‚Äôve gone out to the bars with other friends and he has a very questionable past in terms of his romantic relationships. 

So my question to y‚Äôall, is my paranoia justified? Do y‚Äôall think he tried to make his moves, or am I just being paranoid? This has been bothering me for sometime, and up until that point I never questioned my own sexuality. Any feedback is appreciated, and thank you to whoever reads this long story.",16Feb2019,2

I need some HELP. 
I am a loving boyfriend who is worried about his girlfriend (who is a writter).  My girlfriend graduated concordia university for english literature &amp; creative
Writing 4 years ago and is currently taking  some improv with Second City Toronto to help her open her mind. 

My girlfriend is a very creative and very social and just one of those people that everyone loves! It makes me sad when she talks to me and becomes very critical of herself when it comes to her writing and what she wants to leave on this earth in terms of art and literature. She is very ambitious and is hard on herself when she doesn‚Äôt think shes going anywhere. I always tell her keep writing and continue to educate yourself and an opportunity will rise for you.  It just hurts me to see her very harsh on herself and to see her struggle.  

I understand it probably is difficult for a writer to get their work published or looked at. What I am trying to ask my reddit writers is do you guys have any advice on how I can help her? 

Are there competitions or places she can show her work to so that maybe one day I can help her dreams come true? I just want her to be happy and not be miserable for the rest of her life thinking she has not left this world without her imprint on literature.  I just don‚Äôt know how I can help and this is why I am asking you guys!!!! 

I appreciate whatever advice I can get and look forward from hearing feedback from you guys :)

I know future employers like to contact prior employers to get a reference. However, I believe my boss played me in saying she would act as a good reference for me.

We have many stuff In common and I feel that we are compitable.  I'm extremely patient with her and help her with her tasks such as homework or working out. However the twist is that she's always cuddling with me,  allows me to kiss her on the cheek,  and she's always holding my hand.  I expressed how I like her in a romantic way and she just told me that she's emotionally detached and doesn't want a relationship,  and that she doesn't even like to kiss people ( which is fine)  however the other night I saw that she received a hickey on the neck and asked her about it to my amusement she said she got it from this other guy she has been seeing,  I asked if they kissed she said yes which confused me because she literally told me she doesn't do kisses a week ago.  she told shes not sure whether she likes him but for the most part she claims she doesn't and that she sees him as a ""good friend"".  Now I just don't know how to approach this so please help me because I'm really conflicted on what to do.  Thank you ",16Feb2019,2
462,"At the beginning of the school year she would take my phone away and post on my snap chat, she even was messing with my phone and put her number in my phone. She would use to take my phone away from me a lot. But she doesn‚Äôt do that anymore, but she asked me if I had her number, I told her no I forgot to save it.

463,"Hi, so context is we're both male (I'm 23, he's 22).

We both don't have luck when it comes to dating and social life in general. For a few years now he is often really negative and grumpy and sorry if this sounds too harsh but whines to me about how he does everything right and looks good and still does not get dates like his friends and does not have as many friends as he would like to have. He is legitimately baffled as to why most of his friends manage to get girlfriends and he doesn't.

I'm in a similar boat, hell even worse. Unlike him I have no friends to do stuff with except for him and have not even had sex unlike him, but I don't whine about how life is treating me unfairly (which he often proclaims). Life has no obligation to treat me fair and I know that there are things I could do better like go out more join clubs etc. but I have social anxiety and feel so awkward around people and holding a conversation for more than 2 minutes is damn near impossible to me. But I'm too depressed to get my shit together so after work I just go home and play video games.

This friend at least has a decent social circle (he manages to fill his apartment with like 20 people if he throws a party), but that's okay. It's my fault that I don't have that and my responsibility alone. I just get so much negativity from my friend. We have fun here and there too but over all it really ges me down to always have to listen to him go on about how bad he has it.

Look, I understand if it frustrates you that you don't have a girlfriend and don't know dow to improve your situatio but just stop being so angry and self pitying. I do believe his feelings are real, I know he's legitimately depressed about his situation. I always try to cheer him up and give him hope and am sympathetic but 2 weeks or sometimes 2 days later it just starts again. He says many of his acquaintances are shit, all the time (I remember that saying ""If you think everyone but you is an asshole chances are you are the asshole, I was really tempted to say that last time but I stayed friendly).

He even recognises that his negativity pushes people away but he doesn't change it. He also says that you have an easier time getting women and in life in general in you're a macho asshole and he says if things don't change for the better with him being nice and polite he would rather become an asshole in order to have sex. He's not yet a fully fleshed #niceguy, he doesn't insult women as of yet (ex. he was on a date where he drove 2 hours one way and paid 80‚Ç¨ alltogether and the girl wrote him that she is not interested in a second date. He told me that he doesn't hold her accountable for that. I'm just saying this because I want to be objective here and you have to get the full picture. A couple months ago tho he told me he kinda does hold women accountable that they don't want to go for him. So it seems like he changed here). Last time he said he doesn't hold women accountable because he knows there is something wrong with him, he just doesn't know what, and he is upset that no one tells him. I think he has a problem that I have too which is being a bit boring but he thinks it's more than that.

The thing is I don't want to be a bad friend. Friends should not run away as soon as the other friend faces a difficult time in their life and has a hard time and I'm not sure if it makes me a bad friend if I just let this friendship fade. But I tried to help him and give him hope and stuff time and time again but he keeps saying life owes him success because he looks good and is being nice. What also makes it difficult for me is that he is genuinely nice to me and interested in my life. This is the worst thing for me and it's making me feel guilty for wanting to cut him out. But it feels like there is this stream of negativity that outweighs the things I get back from his friendship and I just can't do this anymore.

Thanks for reading this wall of text. Cheers.

466,"Apologies for the dramatic title but I honestly don't know what other way to phrase it. I moved out initially at 19, lived my life etc and eventually ended up living abroad. My mom got cancer (she's got the all clear for the moment, thanks be to God) so I moved back to my home town and took up a three year contract which while very well paid, the rent in my city is so high I'm still miles off ever getting to move out. Moving away before the end of the contract is not an option, and honestly even after that, it's unlikely I'll be able to leave  immediately because of the way my career works

Living with my parents is driving me up the walls. My dad is the loudest person on the planet and from 8am to when he goes to bed - it's just shouting, talking loudly on the phone, endless vacuuming, everything he does is loud. Then if I try sit in the TV room with them, he asks me incessant stupid questions that I don't know how to answer, and then starts spouting racist stuff deliberately to wind me up (my entire family realise that it's just he thinks it's funny when I'm annoyed). I can't go into the kitchen without him commenting on every single thing I do when I'm cooking or cleaning. The constant questions and attempts to annoy me are honestly like water drip torture. It sounds ridiculous but I can't go anywhere outside my room without this non stop stream of noise and it makes me so angry I feel like putting my fist through a window. 

I feel stupid still being like 'omg my parents are so annoying' at age 25, but here we are. I have nowhere to escape to, and then whenever I get angry at him for what's going on - I'm the bad guy and then my mother starts giving out to me. My solution so far has just been to hide in my room 90% of the time but that just makes me even more depressed",16Feb2019,2

468,"Here's some background info on the situation.

I moved into this two bedroom apartment 2 years ago, but was never asked to join the lease. This person has had previous roommates who also were never on the lease. She's taken the smaller room, so I've always paid the larger portion of the rent. 

Recently she's said that she's looking into someone coming in to paint the walls back to their original color so that she can get her security deposit back-- meaning that she must be looking to leave the apartment in the somewhat near future. She hasn't made it clear that this is what she's actually planning, so I'm in the dark on the matter.

Ideally, I'd like to keep the apartment. I'm not sure what the process is, or what we'd have to talk about in order to make it happen. But there's no transparency in her decisions and I'm worried she's just going to forfeit the apartment to get her security deposit back. Is there anything I can do where we both win in this situation ideally? I really want to have some kind of preparation on this matter.

473,"So my friend Gil is 18, 19 next week. I met him back in middle school but he switched schools right after I started there and I didn‚Äôt see him for a few years. 

About two years ago I saw him again at a bonfire and we‚Äôve been friends since. Back then he was at my older friend/street mom (36) Rose‚Äôs house a lot. When his foster parents kicked him out he even moved in with her. I was there like everyday too and all we used to do was hangout and get fucked up. I really enjoyed hanging out with him. He was the first guy friend I ever had where there was never any tension that comes with opposite sex friendships. We were just bros.

After a couple months living there he started resenting Rose for pretty much no reason. We‚Äôd go to get some weed and when she went into the house he‚Äôd talk about how she was probably having sex with him instead of paying for it. He called her a slut, crazy, and so much other mean stuff. She definitely has a big personality but she cared about us and let Gil live with her rent free. I actually thought of her as my friend but I think Gil only thought of her as someone to live with. Once he felt entitled to live there Rose noticed he was being mean but she felt too bad to ask him to leave. 

Luckily there wasn‚Äôt any big fight because he decided to move to his biological mom‚Äôs house a couple hours away. He found out she was using him for his foster care checks and he left maybe 3 months later. Then he spent another couple months on the other side of the country doing construction and traveling before he finally came back here about 7 months ago. 

He spent a week bouncing around sleeping on friend‚Äôs couches until my best friend, CeCe, and her boyfriend broke up. Her ex boyfriend was used to having someone over 24/7 and still wanted that so he let Gil stay with him. In October it all came to a halt when a 2 week bender ended with them getting in a car crash. The ex moved to New York and Gil came up to stay with CeCe. 

She thought he‚Äôd be there for a couple days and then figure it out. It‚Äôs been 5 months now and he‚Äôs nowhere near ready to be on his own. He hasn‚Äôt finished high school yet, I think he has 120 credits left so technically he‚Äôs still a Sophmore. He enrolled at the same independent school as CeCe last week but she said he isn‚Äôt getting any work done. 

He didn‚Äôt even have a job until the week before Christmas. The only reason he got that was because CeCe asked her manager. He held that one for about two weeks but got fired because he was a no show twice. He spent two weeks in denial of the fact that he was fired because they told him they may call him in on short notice if they ever needed him. 

Then CeCe‚Äôs boyfriend got him a job at dominos. He‚Äôs been there for maybe a month now, but the only reason he‚Äôs still there is because CeCe‚Äôs boyfriend is a manager. He‚Äôs always late to shifts or causing some problem but some how he‚Äôs totally oblivious. I even took him with me to a temporary job for one day when we needed extra help and I had to go into CeCe‚Äôs house to wake him up. He whined all morning, to the point that my boss yelled at him twice. Any time I wasn‚Äôt looking he‚Äôd be eating from the snack table or be on his phone. When we got back that evening he was asking when we might need him again. When CeCe asked him how it went he said great and how he was such a hard worker. Which is the same thing I heard for months before taking him. I think he genuinely believes it.

CeCe is only 17 and her mom was okay with helping Gil at first but now she sees he‚Äôs not making any effort to move out. She hurt herself last year so she‚Äôs on reduced hours and pretty poor at the moment. Plus she has two other daughters to take care of. CeCe and her mom didn‚Äôt even consider him actually living there, just staying in the garage when he had no where else to go. They sort of realized they weren‚Äôt getting rid of him last week when they asked him to stay somewhere else for a few days  so they could have a girl weekend but he ended up there every night anyway. So CeCe‚Äôs mom asked him for some money for staying there. Gil gave her $150 and the next day he told me that he was paying rent now and he could live there until summer. When I went over CeCe‚Äôs mom told me she might as well be getting money if he won‚Äôt leave but she wants him to find another place ASAP.

I work at a place right next to dominos and he comes in most days before work to chat. All he ever talks about are his plans that he never follows through with and how great he‚Äôs doing at dominos. Any time CeCe‚Äôs boyfriend has a break he comes in and rants about how bad he‚Äôs doing or that he was an hour late when he came in to chat with me. He always talks about he‚Äôs going to get an apartment and a better job but he just ends up in the garage stoned and talking about himself for hours. 

We‚Äôve all tried to help him get on his feet. I forced him to sit down and figure out his health care. We spent 5 minutes on hold before he tried to hang up. It took a few hours but he got it and made an appointment for a checkup, that I had to skip school to take him to. CeCe‚Äôs boyfriend took him to human services and helped him get food stamps. I took him to the bank and helped him open a checking account. CeCe got him his first job, her boyfriend the second one, at the expense of their boss‚Äôs trust. But no matter how much we help him he messes it up and doesn‚Äôt see what he did wrong. How is he going to learn from that? 

One day Gil told them he could hear them having sex that night and made it clear the whole next day how disgusted he was. So he was kicked out later for one night so that CeCe and her boyfriend could have a night to themselves. That night CeCe‚Äôs boyfriend bought some alcohol for one of his friends. The friend came in for a couple minutes before going to the store and I guess Gil saw on snap maps. For a week after all I heard was how ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù it was that they kicked him out and had someone else over. 

He‚Äôs even had sex with two of our other friends and thrown fits when they didn‚Äôt want to date him. Then he would be in denial saying that they still had a thing going on. One morning one of those girls went into CeCe‚Äôs room with her and her boyfriend and he thought he heard them having a threesome so he threw a huge fit and went over to our other friends house until they all got up so he could fight the boyfriend. When CeCe didn‚Äôt want him over until he apologized he whined for days about how fucked up it was that his living situation depended on him taking a bunch of shit and keeping quiet. 

Even on a good day all he talks about is his previous traumas, things people have done to him, or how great some imagined ‚Äúthing‚Äù with one of our friends is going even though they only had sex once when they were hammered and they‚Äôve been trying ever since to make it very clear they weren‚Äôt interested.

Despite all that though I still really care about him and I want him to succeed. But I‚Äôm out of ideas. The couple times I‚Äôve tried to point out his mistakes, like maybe skipping work. He gets offended and says I don‚Äôt know all the shit he‚Äôs been through. I know that he really has had a hard life and I don‚Äôt want pretend that isn‚Äôt the case, he deserves to be mad about it. But at a certain point he has to choose wether he‚Äôs going to be at one long pity party for the rest of his life or he‚Äôs going to overcome it. 

CeCe‚Äôs tired of him draining them of all their resources and putting a strain on her relationship but she‚Äôs too passive to kick him out. I‚Äôm usually the more assertive friend so she wants my help pushing him out of the nest but I‚Äôm completely out of ideas. Please help.

P.S I‚Äôm sorry for how long this is. I didn‚Äôt even realize how bad I wanted to rant until now.",16Feb2019,2

478,"I'm a 19-year-old male and I have come to Reddit to seek advice for my current situation. I am sure there have been plenty of posts on this subreddit about how to talk to women or get a girl to like you but I have not come to ask such commonly asked questions. Instead let me start off by explaining my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a student that has a part time job in a supermarket. I really only work Saturdays and occasionally Sundays. On Saturdays I always work a long 10 hour shift, and I am physically exhausted and feeling unmotivated and sad after a day at work - I don't much like my job, but I am grateful for at least having the opportunity to work. At work there's a female colleague, let's call her Jane. Jane works at a different department than I do (I stock fresh produce, she does regular stocking work). For months I have been interested in Jane as a person, I am not necessarily sexually attracted to her, though I think she is beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

People that have worked jobs in a supermarket may know what I mean when I say that the work environment is far from ideal for holding extensive conversations. Supervisors expect you to work hard, no time for chitchat. As such I have found it difficult to talk to her, never have we had a conversation that has lasted longer than 30 seconds, let alone talked about anything other than work-related things. Add to this that she seems to be a very driven and energetic person, it is hard to catch her attention as she is constantly working hard (which I respect).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not a very sociable guy, I don't have many friends or go out, but I can talk with people and my confidence has been improving over the last few years. This and what I mentioned previously combined makes it hard for me to talk to her. All I want is to genuinely get to know her just to see if she's a person I would want to form a relationship with. However,  it's hard for me to justify asking her random personal questions while she is working or walking about because I respect her time and do not want to annoy her. I even find it hard to make eye contact with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I do find I am talking to her, these problems go away, and while I feel slightly nervous when talking with her, I am not struggling to find words or smile/make eye contact. She smiles back and also looks me in the eyes. When I look in her eyes, I feel happy and forget all about how I dislike my job for a while. Again, I just want to get to know Jane, since I have not ever felt these feelings before with any girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few side notes, I do not use social media like Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook and I do not have her phone number. We're not in the same school or anything, we probably don't even live in the same city (I live in a village a few miles away from my work). My point is, I only see her at work, once or twice a week on Saturdays and Sundays (she doesn't work every weekend though). Jane has been in some of my dreams, in a non-sexual way, rather, she was just there, being. Sometimes we had some short conversations similar to the ones I have had in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

What advice do I seek? I would like to get to know Jane, but I don't want to disrupt her work flow by calling for her attention simply to answer a few personal questions. I know I can ask those questions by steering a conversation towards that, but as I mentioned before, this is hard to do because of the supermarket job that is synonymous with a fast work pace. I will gladly take any suggestions or advice readers of this post have to offer and I am thankful for the existence of Reddit, being a place where I can share these feelings.",16Feb2019,1

482,"Warning: mention of mental illness

I know this sounds like a weird question, but I need advice.

I'm in my 5th year of my PhD who recently defended my master's thesis and passed my comprehensive exams on the first try (only 50% of the people who take it pass the first time). I haven't even told any friends/peers about my defense and comprehensives, and I have no desire to ever do it. The dilemma I'm facing is that I am an only child living with my parents and they are so extremely excited about these accomplishments that they want to tell everyone in our extended family. I have asked that they do not tell anyone yet, but we have a family get-together coming up and they really want to tell everyone there. They're not pushing for it, but only casually asked and told me how everyone would be happy to hear. I know it will make them so happy to share it. Do I owe it to them to let them share this?

The reason I do not want them sharing about this is because it has been a really miserable 4.5 years for me. I have been hospitalized several times, developed a number of new physical ailments, took two leaves, developed crippling anxiety and depression that no med could touch and stopped being able to sleep without a sleep aid. 

I have worked with an advisor who regularly sabotaged me when he felt I ""fell out of line."" He threatened to never let me defend my thesis every time I disagreed on an edit. He prolonged my thesis so he could get pubs out of it in the future. He's stolen from my lit for his own pubs. When he found out I had applied to a summer job, he called up the company and told them not to hire me. Then he reprimanded me, telling me my sole ""job"" is to produce research for the lab. Every day until he finally let me defend my thesis (1.5 months ago) was a nightmare. He is the only option for a dissertation and (obviously) there is little hope I could get through writing one with him to get the PhD so the most I will ever have is an M.A. 

My parents have witnessed all of this and have had to live with me being this mentally and physically ill for the past 4+ years. They have had to see all the near-daily crying, panic attacks, nervous breakdowns, hospitalizations, chronic physical illness and so on. I feel like the least they deserve is the chance to brag to their friends and family about their child's accomplishment. The problem is that the idea of telling others makes me feel sad. I don't want to think about my graduate program. I am never going to get that PhD. None of these accomplishments feel like accomplishments. It all feels like semi-relief about an end to some horrific years of my life. The thing is that is the right/thoughtful thing to do to put aside all my emotions about the experience and let my parents share this news and have their happiness?  ",16Feb2019,2

487,"Long story short, I met a guy last semester in college. Let‚Äôs call him M. M and I instantly hit it off and became friends. As friendships between guys and girls usually go, I fell for him. I ended up telling him at the end of the semester and got rejected. Something about obstacles in his life that prevent him from having romantic relationships. I respected his decision and we remained friends. However, 2 months have gone by and instead of becoming distant, we got closer. This includes late night texting and having deep conversations that you would never have with anyone you didn‚Äôt trust. We also found out we have a lot in common. I admit, after he rejected me I did continue to reach out to him via text as I was hoping to still have a relationship with him. After a while I just stopped trying because I realized I was the only one initiating and it bothered me. Fast forward a month and I was asked out by one of my other guy friends. When M found out, he began doing things that lead me to believe that he was jealous. He began initiating texts randomly, something he very rarely did. He also started asking me to hang out with him. When we do see each other in person he seems nervous and he‚Äôs never been like this before I was asked out. A part of me thinks that he‚Äôs just being friendly, but given the fact that he‚Äôs never done this, I‚Äôm confused. I started seeing him everyday again at school and I don‚Äôt know what my next step should be. I‚Äôm far from over him and I think this behavior is what‚Äôs preventing me from moving on. Should I wait and see if he continues this behavior? Are the things he‚Äôs doing considered ‚Äúmixed signals‚Äù or is it just in my head? Should I straight up just ask him what we are? Again, he did reject me already and I don‚Äôt want him to think that I‚Äôm desperate or don‚Äôt respect his decision. What would you do in my situation? Is it possible that he changed his mind about me?

He's a serious believer in fake medicine and science. He strongly believes in pseudoscience cancer cures, Keto diet as a cure all for all issues, the fact that mainstream medicine is corrupt and is actively trying to make people sicker, and that fluoride is the governments way to make people complaisant and to control society. . He believes fully in naturopathy and herbal medicine, he has HIV and although he takes medicine he has tried multiple times to rely solely on herbal supplements and a Keto diet to 'cure' him. He's driving me insane, usually its not an issue but when he starts on a tangent he goes for ages.

493,"Hi, so context is we're both male (I'm 23, he's 22).

We both don't have luck when it comes to dating and social life in general. For a few years now he is often really negative and grumpy and sorry if this sounds too harsh but whines to me about how he does everything right and looks good and still does not get dates like his friends and does not have as many friends as he would like to have. He is legitimately baffled as to why most of his friends manage to get girlfriends and he doesn't.

I'm in a similar boat, hell even worse. Unlike him I have no friends to do stuff with except for him and have not even had sex unlike him, but I don't whine about how life is treating me unfairly (which he often proclaims). Life has no obligation to treat me fair and I know that there are things I could do better like go out more join clubs etc. but I have social anxiety and feel so awkward around people and holding a conversation for more than 2 minutes is damn near impossible to me. But I'm too depressed to get my shit together so after work I just go home and play video games.

This friend at least has a decent social circle (he manages to fill his apartment with like 20 people if he throws a party), but that's okay. It's my fault that I don't have that and my responsibility alone. I just get so much negativity from my friend. We have fun here and there too but over all it really ges me down to always have to listen to him go on about how bad he has it.

Look, I understand if it frustrates you that you don't have a girlfriend and don't know dow to improve your situatio but just stop being so angry and self pitying. I do believe his feelings are real, I know he's legitimately depressed about his situation. I always try to cheer him up and give him hope and am sympathetic but 2 weeks or sometimes 2 days later it just starts again. He says many of his acquaintances are shit, all the time (I remember that saying ""If you think everyone but you is an asshole chances are you are the asshole, I was really tempted to say that last time but I stayed friendly).

He even recognises that his negativity pushes people away but he doesn't change it. He also says that you have an easier time getting women and in life in general in you're a macho asshole and he says if things don't change for the better with him being nice and polite he would rather become an asshole in order to have sex. He's not yet a fully fleshed #niceguy, he doesn't insult women as of yet (ex. he was on a date where he drove 2 hours one way and paid 80‚Ç¨ alltogether and the girl wrote him that she is not interested in a second date. He told me that he doesn't hold her accountable for that. I'm just saying this because I want to be objective here and you have to get the full picture. A couple months ago tho he told me he kinda does hold women accountable that they don't want to go for him. So it seems like he changed here). Last time he said he doesn't hold women accountable because he knows there is something wrong with him, he just doesn't know what, and he is upset that no one tells him. I think he has a problem that I have too which is being a bit boring but he thinks it's more than that.

The thing is I don't want to be a bad friend. Friends should not run away as soon as the other friend faces a difficult time in their life and has a hard time and I'm not sure if it makes me a bad friend if I just let this friendship fade. But I tried to help him and give him hope and stuff time and time again but he keeps saying life owes him success because he looks good and is being nice. What also makes it difficult for me is that he is genuinely nice to me and interested in my life. This is the worst thing for me and it's making me feel guilty for wanting to cut him out. But it feels like there is this stream of negativity that outweighs the things I get back from his friendship and I just can't do this anymore.

Thanks for reading this wall of text. Cheers.

EDIT: I posted this somewhere else (not many responses) and one person said:

&gt;Nah you wouldent be for not wanting toxcicity in your life. But if i were you i would keep him since self lothing can really get the better of you when you have no one.  
I had to deal with a friend like that when we were both 15 16 he wanted a girl friend so badly that he was turning in to a ""nice guy"" untill i explained to him to just relax out of the trillion some add people he wasent going to die with out a girl friend and that if he spends timw on trying to improve him self whether through sports or art or what ever hell seem more attractive then a guy thats bitchy that things dont go his way. So maybe you can try something of that nature.

I responded, but he didn't answer anymore, so I'm just posting my response here because it might be important info for you guys to know:

I tried to tell him every one of those things. I told him (which is completely true) that I have another friend (in another country) who is 25, has a great job, doesn't look bad at all and is such a nice person but he also has not had a girlfriend yet, but it has not changed a thing. I told him to join some clubs, to do sports, has not changed a thing. He even produces music and got a girl to sing in a song for him which is still ongoing. I also told him that it looks like he is showing signs of a niceguy which he acknowledged but he says he won't turn into a niceguy, but he is ready to sometime in the future ""become an asshole"" if things don't change because he thinks then it's easier. Multiple times. EVERY single time I told him to please not do that, but I couldn't change his mind. I feel like I'm talking against a wall.

And he *does* have other friends than me. He told me that he has multiple other friends he considers to be as good friends as me and that they could not give him helpful advice either.

Thanks again...

494,"It‚Äôs mostly petty stuff, he does a lot of drawing (we‚Äôre illustrators) and tends to demand my opinion on his work - even if he can see that I‚Äôm in the middle of a job. When he does this, he asks for criticism but gets annoyed if I actually give him any. Also if I‚Äôm not acting completely blown away by his work, he bothers me more over the day to ‚Äòask my opinion‚Äô on the same piece of work AKA get the praise he wants out of me. 

He has a tendency to talk at me even when he sees I have headphones in, which means I have to take them out and ask him to repeat himself. 

He‚Äôs very dismissive (and chiding) when I‚Äôm annoyed about work-related things, but is very vocal when complaining about his own. 

He makes the odd offensive joke which I think isn‚Äôt meant maliciously, but irritates me all the same. Particularly the jokes about women, as I am one of the few women in the office. 
(Also when I don‚Äôt laugh at these jokes he repeats them several times, which is to say every time because I never laugh at these jokes).

He also looks over my shoulder and comments on things on my screen which I haaaaaate (I think it‚Äôs so rude to do that like? I‚Äôm at work so I‚Äôm not looking at anything inappropriate but I check my social media and things and it bugs me). 

I know these things seem minute; but when grouped together over the period of months, it gets very, very irritating. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I‚Äôm relieved when he‚Äôs on vacation time.

He‚Äôs also not a terrible guy overall. Very tactless, and quite socially awkward, but I know these things aren‚Äôt deliberate. But yes, I still get angry, and I have to hold my tongue a lot because the last thing I want to do is get mad at him. 

I can‚Äôt ask to move seats as us illustrators are all sat together and the only other desk is on my co-worker‚Äôs other side. 
I also feel like complaining to a higher up is a bit over the top, they‚Äôre just annoyances.
But I don‚Äôt know how to approach this topic at all, it‚Äôs really starting to get me down and make me irritated throughout the workweek.

495,"I hope the title doesn‚Äôt come across as insensitive but I‚Äôve just never known anyone so young who goes through what this guy does.

 I met this guy about a month ago and he seems really great. He hasn‚Äôt told me yet what drug he‚Äôs in recovery from (he‚Äôs alluded to using several) but he‚Äôs a year sober and his life seems really together. He goes to school, works, is physically healthy, is committed to meditation and it seems like every other day he‚Äôs going to AA. He comes from a nice family (from what I‚Äôve seen) and overall just seems to be doing quite well and to have a healthy way of dealing with things. I know that this week in the span of Monday-Friday he went at least 3 times. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the standard for someone a year into recovery but I don‚Äôt pass judgement on him for it.

I‚Äôve been through a lot of shit myself, my mom is actually currently dying from alcoholism and an oxy addiction, plus I had a lot of struggles in the past with mental illness so I‚Äôm no stranger to the concept of trying to put back together a broken life that others wouldn‚Äôt understand. But I‚Äôve never had a partner I can‚Äôt smoke weed or do psychedelics with. I only use weed every couple weeks and I trip every couple months. I decided that it wouldn‚Äôt be a dealbreaker for me for this guy because even though I love having a partner I can smoke with, I like him so much and I‚Äôm willing to try that new dynamic in a relationship. I think it could be good for me to be sober with a partner.

But I‚Äôm young and I feel I don‚Äôt have a full grasp on what it means to be a person in recovery. I guess I‚Äôm looking for an older person‚Äôs insight into this because maybe I‚Äôm too inexperienced to see the full picture of what I‚Äôm getting myself into. Like I said, I don‚Äôt judge him for it; I like him so much and I really want to date him.

498,"Tldr: I've suffered with depression, probably for the last 10 years, I'm 22 now. I can't hold down work. I convince myself that I know nothing in the workforce and subsequently fail and/or leave. I only feel confident in a moment of giving others advice, although I cannot convince myself of my own. Is there any ways I can make a living from this?

Depression started when I was 13, for both health and situational reasons, growing up in my family was hard. I left school early without qualifications. I was told to work or leave home, although I wanted to study at college and make something of myself. My parents forced me out. I spent two years in a hostel, and with 3 months left before the second and final year of my course, I left, anxiety, depression or whatever it was, just wouldn't let me finish. 

I started working for an electrician as a handy man, my parents then let me back home. My dad had changed in this time, he was abusive, having an affair and tore the house apart. I lived in this mess for a full year before I convinced my mother to move away from the situation, and I followed her, away from the rest of my family and friends, to the other end of the country. Since I came here I haven't held a job for longer than a month, I cannot pin point why. The opportunities keep coming, I keep taking them initially with full confidence that things will be different, but they never are. I don't think I'm lazy, I've never felt like there's anything else I'd really want to do during the day than be successful.

I understand whenever my parents have to do something important, but most of the time they say they have to do one thing like go to the store and stay gone for about 2-3 hours.

I have a sister who is turning 13 but my mom never forces her to watch she just sits in her room and not help. If I do ask for help with my sister she'll give me a attitude and ignore me.

508,"I'm not sure where to start with this post but I'll try my best. Two years ago I divorced my husband for a abusive relationship, I was struggling at the time and so was my mother trying to raise my three sisters on her own so I returned home after 7 years of pretty much no contact. I helped out with bills, food, and raising my sister's since their dad wasn't in the picture and not paying any child support. She decided that she wanted to move across the country to be closer to her best friend and I agreed to come along too because I wanted to keep that relationship with my sister's that I had lost seven years on. I buy all their school supplies, pay for their equipment for sports and clubs, drive them wherever they need to go, take care of doctor's appointments, buy groceries and take care of the house. After starting my internship and not being paid for a month we ended up being evicted and moving in with her best friend. I ended up sleeping in the living room on the floor sharing an air mattress with one of my sister's while another got the couch and another got a bed. I took two jobs to get better pay. I've noticed that since moving in over here I started being treated like a child rather than an adult that had been helping support. The kids lost interest in spending time with me and my mother whom I had grown extremely close to after years of avoidance has pretty much completely kicked me out of all decision making. I was angry but accepted if she didn't need me and her best friend was taking my place as the parental role I was going to move out. So I found an apartment, had everything set to go and then told my mother I was moving out. When I told her this she asked me what she was supposed to do about buying a house and I told her the agreement was still the same I would sign on her loan but I just won't be living there. She said she can't afford a mortgage without my income and then it all clicked together that our original agreement of her taking loan responsibility and me eventually moving out was a lie that she never had any intentions of me leaving. The next day I get in a really bad car accident, my car is thrown over a fence and the only thing that saved me from the interstate was luck and a barbwire throwing me back over. When she came to the accident to get me I was upset about my apartment because I knew I couldn't afford it anymore and her comment was that ""everything happens for a reason and now I can invest in the house"" the longer it's been since the accident the more I realized it wasn't just whiplash. I got x-rays of my spine and it's fractured with possible nerve damage down my right side. When I ask her for help getting my things out of the totalled car she tells me she doesn't know when she'll have time. When I come home from work she barely speaks to me but the moment her best friend comes in doesn't shut up. When I call her about the prognosis that I'll need physical therapy with possible surgery and won't be able to work for three months and I'll be losing my health insurance she cuts me off to laugh at her friend's joke and I just sit here waiting for her to listen to me again about what's going on. Im angry at my mother and I hate her best friend for what feels like she's taken my place. I know the relationship I have with my mom is unhealthy and it reminds me of when I was a kid and I would disappear the moment her husband would come home. I'm not really sure what to do anymore. My grandfather said I can move back with him while I get through the fractures and get back on my feet again and I'm thinking that might be my only choice because I need Medicaid if I lose my health insurance. I guess what my actual question is.. what's wrong with me? Why do I have so much attachment and resentment to feeling replaced. Why do I have this weird marriage to my mother and I feel angry that her best friend is taking my ""kids"" away. I knew it was unhealthy so that's why I was moving out but it seems like everything got ruined. Is this relationship with her a codependency?

TL;DR
After years of helping support my mother with my three sisters we ended up moving in with her best friend and her friend has replaced me as being the step in parent of my sister's. My mother ignores me and when she found out I wasn't going to sign on her loan to buy her a house due to fractured vertebraes she's exiled me out even more. What is this relationship called? What do I do to fix it? How do I move out of this situation when I'm not allowed to work for three months? I don't want to be in this anymore.. I want to be my own person..",16Feb2019,1
509,"I live in an on-campus apartment for 4 people with 2 rooms. We moved in in the Fall semester as a friend group, but my roommate moved out after graduating last semester so I got placed with a random roommate. 

The random roommate is very quiet and keeps to herself. I noticed that our room started to smell pretty musty after a couple days so I asked my roommate if we could leave the room door open when either of us aren‚Äôt home so that the air can ventilate. 

After a week, I noticed that the smell was still persistent, and one day when I slept in while she was getting ready to head out for the day, her movements made me realize the smell was coming from her. I told my other roommates about this and they smelled her side of the room and bed and agreed that it was definitely coming from her, especially since we never had this problem with my last roommate. 

Now we‚Äôre onto week 5 with this roommate and the smell has spread throughout the apartment. Whenever we enter the front door, a huge whiff of must just hits your nose and it‚Äôs enough to have to open the window for the smell to leave. 

I just want some advice on how I should approach telling someone that their body odor is really bad since air fresheners don‚Äôt work and having the window open in the winter time isn‚Äôt the best. ",16Feb2019,20

shes 24 now and is probably doing this for a year according to texts.I confronted her and she shrugs and tells me so what so many girls in india are prostitutes at least i get payed well.

laying in bed...agitated, frustrated, pains of loneliness pulsating through me. I masturbated so I could feel something, feel good. As always it helped some...but as always, here I am again, back down to reality.

Last week or two -

I‚Äôve spent alot of time in the house, I only really get out to get food. I felt so...gross(?), socially anxious, guilty(?) going in the restaurant last night to pick up my food. Was going to go in there with ‚Äòthe raw essence of who I am‚Äô (aka hot breath) but decided to pop a mint in in case I can‚Äôt make a B line to get my food and back. Murphy‚Äôs law always seems happen and someone wants to small talk. But on the other hand, I thought ‚Äòmaybe you‚Äôll meet someone special‚Äô, so I popped the mint. Murphy‚Äôs law didn‚Äôt happen.

I met about 6 or 8 people (thru reddit). Half have already ghosted. I think ghosting has more of an affect than realized. It doesn‚Äôt affect me on the surface and I just move on but I think the more it happens the more it chips away at you because the brain records everything. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but thats what it seems like. I hope these budding convos and relationships go somewhere but the hope dwindles the more they end. Also I‚Äôve noticed some things that could be serious problems down the line with each person (and maybe they have too with me) so yeah the thrill(?) or hope is fading. I‚Äôm trying to connect but its like there‚Äôs always this magnetic field that starts to orb around each other (i.e. our baggage, beliefs, misunderstandings, personality traits etc) which makes it really hard. Especially the older we get its just really hard to try to meet new people.

I would really like to find something like the Japanese Moai groups or a co-op or intentional community. Or maybe start one. Are there any sub reddits out there for that? Also any other subs where a post like this could be posted? I‚Äôm kinda new here so don‚Äôt know my way around much.

Past 10 yrs or so -

My world has completely flipped. NOTHING is the same. Divorce, family, friends, relocation. Relationships have soured, been limited, cease to exist. I feel geographically cut off and the loneliness is this slow dark cloud that keeps catching up to me.

540,"Sometimes poster on Reddit first time asking for advice.
Sorry in advanced for the long somewhat rambling read.

I'm 25 M, I have pretty bad anxiety in general and I'm bi-polar- not super manic but a milder version to a degree i guess. 
The thing I have trouble coming to grips with death is that it too closely resembles falling asleep for me, which in turn makes it nearly impossible to sleep at the same time. It like a sharp pain in my gut twisting and like I'm about to have anxiety attack. I've always understood that you live, you die from a young age roughly 4years old (might sound stange being able to remember that young but I do). The whole concept of death scares the living shit out of me, while also making myself take stupid and often dangerous risks and doing everything to an excess (sex, food, drugs, alcohol, smoking) in a self destructive manner. Not so much drugs anymore but thats pretty much because I cut my own access off for the better I think as weed makes me super paranoid, speed just makes me think I can rip someone in half for no good reason which just isnt me, decent mdma is non existent here and shrooms have been a bit of a hit and miss.
I honestly dont know what to do with this fear- in one aspect I feel like I live life to the fullest and have led a hedonistic lifestyle but at the same time I feel like I'm running straight at death and I'm getting there quicker than I really want to. 
I dont know what I'm really asking for help with around my fear of death and I dont exactly have any people in my life I can talk to about it either. I've been to psychologists and all that jazz but they haven't exactly been helpful and the cost of $300per hour doesnt really help me see them.
I dont exactly have purpose in my life either. I work part time due to my varied MH, I do things I enjoy, i travel when I can. But it all seems quite meaningless when in the end, nothing really fucking matters. We will be forgotten. We will die alone. We know nothing of what comes after if anything at all and we'll probably just blink out of existence just as quickly as we came into it. Whats the point? Like you could probably go on a murder spree killing 100-300 people because a bird shat on you and in the end 100 years later no one would really give a shit because in the grand scheme of things wars have been waged over stupider things, killing hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. (Just noting... I'm NOT suggesting people nor I should or will go on a murder spree just because a bird shat on you/I or you/I were inconvenienced in some small way). I'm just saying that why shouldnt I just pack up and leave? How the fuck am I supposed to bring meaning into my life until my eventual death? Why shoudlnt I just kill myself and just be done with it? Why should I abide the laws of humanity for the simple etiquette of ""civil"" society? And dont even get me started on religion in the mix - These are the things that stem from my fear of death, I've always seen the many shades of grey knowing the world isnt black and white but I dont recognise the person I'm becoming when the fear of death is so persistently looming and reminding me over/during every breath, every pain and everytime I close my eyes. Has anyone been cured of their fear of death?
Is there something I can do that can help eliminate it? Has anyone tried hypnosis? I'm just exhausted all the time.

TLDR; Living a hedonistic lifestyle I also have a fear of death and in fearing death life seems pointless. While feeling like I'm going towards death faster because of my lifestyle choices. Minor ramblings here and there ""drugs yada yada, bird shit, yada yada murder spree""... 
I dont recognise who or what i've become because of this fear. What advice/tips can you give me?

Anyways, been trying to track everything over the last couple months, but now im seeing that a lot of the data just isnt in a convenient format to even be able to see the potential patterns that are helping or hurting me. Like my moods, energy, libido, feel random as fuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Issue #1: My data is spotty so even if I could format it right I dont think its accurate enough to be worth something, So how to fix that when what im measuring feels so much like a subjective spectrum? Like everything I want to track has like ten different subconscious flavors in it.

Issue #2: How to go about formatting that data in a way that helps a simpleton like me see the patterns? Does that mean fancy graphs that make it more visual and so more easy to comprehend?

My friends and I were trying to park on the street today. It was half hour until we can park at a certain spot, so I decided to look for the spot on foot around while my friends stayed in the car. After I walked one minute ahead (there is just a stop sign and one car between our car and I), I saw a black car‚Äôs owner was heading to his car and leaving. Following him (around 20 seconds), I called my friends as soon as possible, then after him getting into his car, I continued asking my friends to hurry up and stood at that spot while that black car was pulling back. Then a white car driver saw this black car‚Äôs leaving and waited behind him, so I told the white car‚Äôs driver that my friends was almost here (my friends were almost at the stop sign). The driver insisted a while and left, but another grey car right behind him started to horn at me (my friends had passed the stop sign and was behind it by one car). I pointed at my friends‚Äô car, but the grey car continued honking for at least two minutes and tried to make me move by losing the brake. The grey car blocked five to eight cars (including a bus and my friends‚Äô car) so I believed that everyone looked at me while I was talking on the phone to my friends and asking them whether I should move. Then the grey car left when the bus honked. Almost at the same time, there is another spot available right next to ours when my friends finally got in. The driver and his girlfriend parked next to us staring at my friends and I in weird faces, and they even sneakily took photos of my friends and I. When my friends asked ‚ÄúExcuse me. May I ask what happened?‚Äù They turned back and went into the restaurant. We didn‚Äôt follow in or asked them to delete the photos.

I know that street parking is on the first come first serve basis, but this is my first time looking for a spot on foot, so I want to ask that whether I am the person who is rude and act wrongly. If I am, please tell me directly and I apologize here, and please share what would you do in this kind of cases. Thank you!

Hello  20 year old guy here, well I have never had issues having good grades,  If I study and prepare myself I find exams overall being easy but I know  that in Med School things are a little more hardcore , how do I know  that I  have the skills to go through Med School and survive there? I¬¥d  say I am good at Biology, Chemistry, Maths and Physics not the best, but  good.

I know I am a persistent person  and that when I want something I will work for it with all my will , but  I do not know if that is enough for applying for Med School . I also am  very curious about the human body and find pleasure in helping people.

Current  background : Since child always choosed the route of sciences and  technologies and currently taking a degree on Bioengineering( one more  year to finish it , then I think I will apply to Med School).

557,"* First time posting on here, so I‚Äôm sorry if the formatting or whatever is god awful * 

   I‚Äôll start off by saying I am 20 years old and I have practically been raising myself my whole life and thrive off independence. On the other hand, my older brother, who is turning 23 in a few weeks, has had everything handed to him by my extremely enabling parents. They believe that doing all this stuff for him and even giving him a weekly allowance of $150 will make everything right but I can no longer be a bystander to this anymore. He has absolutely zero life skills, social skills, independence etc etc. Most of his friends I see on facebook are getting married, starting a family, having kids, starting their career etc etc. while he cant even figure out to boil a pot of water on the stove. Now, I know it‚Äôs wrong to compare yourself to how others are living but how does he not realize the path he‚Äôs continually going down, as worrisome? 

I genuinely do care and love my brother to death but the fact he denies and rarely ever acknowledges his problems is extremely worrying for me. I do believe that he suffers from severe depression as he exhibits clear textbook signs of mental illness. I‚Äôve done all I can with trying to encourage him to work on himself because of all the years I‚Äôve lived with him, he has not done so. Most days of the week, he will lay flat on the couch with his laptop on his stomach watching Anime or playing video games. He rarely does anything to help out around the house; I am constantly picking up after his mess, throwing out his trash, washing his dirty dishes. It‚Äôs honestly like living with the shittiest bum of a roommate because he knows I will or my parents will do everything for him. 

I need help on what else I can do to encourage him, other than trying to convince to see a professional about his mental health. He will literally deny ANYTHING remotely negative about himself.

558,"This is an issue I have been experiencing for nearly my whole life. I'm currently 21, and have flunked out of college last year due to bureaucratic complications coupled with anxiety disorder. I've been having trouble finding any sort of motivation to continue pursuing my goals beyond doing the bare minimum to keep my relatives from berating me for lack of action and worsening the anxiety. 

I am on medication for ADHD and anxiety disorder, but I'm worried that the anxiety is where all my motivation was previously coming from, that fear of failure was the only reason I wanted to continue to succeed. I have trouble finding determination and focus due to ADHD, I worry my only motivation is through my anxiety, and on top of it all I worry that I am passing blame to those mental illness labels when in reality I am just lazy. 

This lack of drive is impeding my ability to find a job, apply to school, visit friends, and all of the other typical things that more responsible people manage to accomplish. I've tried seeing a psychologist but monthly checkups feel too slow and infrequent for me to truly move forward. 

I believe it boils down to not experiencing joy in doing something, but instead alleviating the pressure of needing that thing done. Through high-school I always waited until something was overdue, presumably so the guilt could kick in so I could finish it. I can recall precious few occasions where I was proud of having done something. Waiting for guilt to settle before I can act has become a way of life, and I do not know how to break this cycle and enjoy achieving things again. 

How do guys give rewards to yourself for a job well done? Any ideas on how to make, ""feeling bad until it's done"" to, ""getting it done then feeling good""? How do you self-motivate, or, how do you give yourself the determination to push through something difficult? ",16Feb2019,1

565,"A little background

I live in a house with 5 other guys. Rent is split between us at a fairly good rate at only $325 per month. In our house each person is in charge of a specific bill. For example I'm in charge of wifi, someone else is in charge of garbage and recycling. Whenever the bill is due we just venmo each other our portions of that bill. We are also all in charge sending our land lord our portion of the rent.

This roommate, let's call him Charles, was in charge of the utilities bill. Throughout the fall at the end of every month Charles would collect about $20 from everyone for the bill. But then...at around mid January our utility company sent a piece of mail to us addressed to all the residents of our house, not just Charles which I found odd. I opened the mail and found out he hadn't paid the utilities bill since September! 

I was furious and confronted him about it. He said he had some banking problems that prevented him from paying. When I asked for more information all he said was that his bank account was hacked and nothing more. He said he was working on resolving it and it shouldn't be an issue going forward. Charles had most of the money we sent him in his bank account which was hacked, but still some in his venmo. He sent me the money and I used a guest pay feature my utilities company has to pay what he had access too. He made it very clear he is working on resolving the issue and that it's only a temporary problem. This all seemed a little suspicious to me and my other housemates but none of us have had any banking issues so what do we know?

Then today happens. At around 11am all our land lord, John, sent an email out to all of us living in the house. He said that Charles hasn't paid rent for December January or February and that he needed to pay $1125 (the rent he owes plus lates fees) as soon as possible. This made me pretty furious especially because he led us all to believe he had fixed the issue. I sent a message in our house group chat simply saying ""you need to email John and explain your bank issue.

This is where my questions come in. How should people confront a housemate that isn't paying bills or rent.

Tl;dr House mate has said he has been having banking problems since October preventing him from paying bills. He said he was going to fix the issue. We then find out he hasn't and is three months behind in rent now too. How should he be confronted?",16Feb2019,1

To start, I'm 20 and my brother is 12 (he'll be 13 in April). Legally I still live with my mom, but I moved out in August to live with my dad so there would be more space for everyone else at my mother's house.  It's a really small house and really cramped when I was there.  

It gets really complicated.  My mother has had strokes and really can't do much for herself anymore.  She can't drive and can barely cook, but in around June, a family friend of ours needed a place to live so she moved into our house, and she helps out around the house a great deal.  This is kind of what triggered me moving out (The lack of space, I mean).  I still go back home and help them when they need it, of course.

My stepdad travels a lot for work, and him and my mother aren't really in a relationship, but he still lives at the house and pays for things because of my brother, as he's my brother's dad.  He's also cheated on my mom many times, but she doesn't really care because she doesn't like him.  One of the women he cheated on her with HATES my mom (I really don't know why.  My mom did nothing to her except exist) and she called CPS on my mom recently, I just found out about this.

My brother was questioned at school about this.  I don't know many details really except that a CPS inspector is going to go over to my house sometime this week.  I'm really worried because unfortunately, my mom smokes a lot in the house (I know it's horrible.  I don't support that in any way, and it makes me furious and I've been trying to get her to quit) and obviously the house reeks of smoke.  I don't know if this is grounds to take children away or not because it isn't illegal and I know it happens in many households.  My brother is not and has never been abused in any way and I know that the best place he could be is in my mother's house.

Is there any chance they could actually take him away just because of the smoking and the fact that my mother had strokes?  My mother's friend is there all the time to help out.  I go home to help out multiple times a week.  My brother never goes hungry and again, is not abused.  ",16Feb2019,1

Since Januari I'm trying to learn Japanese. I can already read Hiragana and katakana like a 4y/o I guess (first guessing which sound each symbol is and then saying the complete word). But I only know a few words of japanese. Because of this I thought I would buy an easy readible manga, translate the kana to romanji and then translating the japanese romanji to my language, and so learning the words.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I didn't learn Kanji yet because... well simply because it's a lot more difficult then the kana and I thought it would be best to learn speaking it after learning the basics of reading it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, is this a good idea, and if so, does anyone know where to get easy, but fun to read, japanese manga?

582,"First world problem, for real.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25 years old. Over the years (since I was 12) I've accumulated a ton of photos. On my Mac alone I have about 40,000 (that includes phone camera roll), but I know that on my old computer I have another 20,000 to look through. It stresses me out so much because I hate letting go of moments. Photos really serve as memories for me, because I find that I will sometimes forget an experience entirely. The idea of forgetting experiences is extremely depressing to me. I also paint landscapes a lot and so I'll find myself wanting to capture every ounce of light and all the beauty around me so I can study it later on.

&amp;#x200B;

I really, really want to delete a ton of photos though. There's just way too many and it stresses me out. I'd like to keep what's valuable, and if I can, get that number down to 15,000 photos. Or 20,000 even.

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue is I have a ton of photos of me and my ex boyfriend, and I can't seem to part with them. We dated for almost 3 years and we broke up 3 years ago.

583,"I found videos from one ""funny picture/gif/video"" site, which includes hidden camera footage from gym. In these videos you can identify people and see them half or full naked. All footages are filmed in the same gym, first video is from Aug 2018. Videos are taken with phone.

I have Imgur album (""NSFW""), which includes censored screenshots about the gym. With censored material I mean screenshots, where I censored private parts and faces so no one can't identify people from these pictures.

On another album (""SFW"") I have only pictures for identifying the gym. Tried to take screenshots where you only can see a dress room and shower without any persons. 

I find this stuff disgusting! I guess these videos are filmed in different country than my homeland, maybe Italy. That's why I need Reddit's help to identify this gym so we can stop this guy!

For background, I'm currently enrolled in a public university and I am in the honors program at my school, which means I have access to priority registration, personal advisors and tuition-free schooling.

On paper, it sounds like an opportunity that I couldn't pass up, especially given the fact that I come from a low-income family (my parents were not willing to co-sign a loan nor did they/ I have the funds to pay for school) and I intend to go to graduate school someday.

After completing my first semester and a few weeks into my second semester, I feel like I'm not happy with where I am currently. The social life, which includes school clubs, is non-existent; the environment is not for me, as the school is mostly a commuter school, there is a negative atmosphere, and I feel stagnant in terms of personal and academic growth and it's greatly taking a toll on my mental health; most importantly, I have been growing an interest in a field that my school does not offer. I would like to try my hand at engineering (possibly), but right now my major is in the sciences.

I want to transfer but I'm concerned about the finances and the drastic change in major (science to engineering).

On my list right now is Cornell and Columbia and possibly, a state university. I know these schools are a long shot but I really don't like the spot I'm in and I was wondering if you guys had any general advice. I already have professors agreeing to write me recommendation letters.

Is it worth it transfer? Do you know of any transfer friendly schools (in terms of financial aid and adjustment)? Is it possible to be involved in the technology sector without having a formal education on it? Anything I can do to improve my college experience?

605,"Hey everyone. I need some advice about my situation. I don't want to give too many details, just to protect the anonymity of everyone involved, but I'm having something of a personal crisis. 

I'm one of three siblings. I have two brothers. One of them is severely disabled, and the other is completely typical. My brother with disabilities will never be able to live independently. We have some assistance from the state to pay for caregivers to stay with him 24/7 in a place that we were lucky enough to get for him. But the care company doesn't do things like buy food, pay utility bills, etc. So there will always have to be someone overseeing things. I understand that, and when my mother passes on, figuring out those responsibilities will obviously fall on my brother and me.

However, my trouble comes from some decisions that I will have to make soon. I have a career that I can do pretty much wherever, and I would like to live in a different part of the country. The problem is that my disabled brother will have to stay in our hometown, because that's where he is currently set up, and we get all of his disability benefits currently from this state. It took us over a decade to get him all the help he has now, so moving him is non-negotiable. 

My mother assures me that she will be able to oversee things for a while, and after she is no longer able to, we may be able to hire someone to act as a sort of overseer, as a feet on the ground sort of position, with my other brother and I taking care of bills and other stuff from afar. She wants me to be able to live where I want and have a life that is somewhat independent of my brother. 

I just don't know how feasible it all is. And I have this terrible feeling of guilt for wanting some degree of separation from him. I love him dearly. I just never saw myself living in the same town for my entire life. It feels stifling. And if I were to stay, would I grow to resent my other brother, who seems to want to live elsewhere as well? It just seems rather hopeless, and I'm not sure there's a clear cut answer to any of this, other than one or both of us saying very close to him. I also don't want to make the decision to move away and then feel like I have a limited amount of time before I have to move back and take care of him. 

I'm very grateful for all the help we have been able to get for him, and I understand that there are others in far worse situations. 

I don't know. Is it selfish to want some separation, and to manage things from afar if possible? Should I just suck it up and stay in my hometown? Does anyone have any experience with these sorts of things? I just feel so overwhelmed. I'd really appreciate any advice at all. Thank you.",16Feb2019,1
606,"So... Sometimes I get addicted to shemale porn for a few days. Usually it only lasts 3-5 days and then I go back to cis girls. Everytime this happens I question my sexuality and I've even seen gay porn (with cis men) to see if I'm actually bi or something, but nope, I don't like it at all. 

Lately though, I've been watching shemale porn everyday for at least 15-20 days straight. It all started when I jerked off to Sissification porn. For something like 3 or 4 days I saw sissy captions or hypno every night, and jerked off to it. Then I stopped with help from my therapist because honestly I hate it, and I fear it might bring me into a life I would absolutely hate. But after I stopped watching hypno and confusion and whatever, I could only fap to shemale porn. The night after, and the following, and the next one, and the next one. I was just waiting it for it to ""fade away"" as it usually does, but it didn't. 

To make things worse, I have tried watching porn with cis girls, but it just didn't make me as horny as shemale porn (which it used to). That could mean I'm gay, if it wasn't for the fact that I have, as mentioned, tried and didn't like watching gay porn. Also I see myself fantasizing only about girls when I'm not fapping, and I feel attraction to girls when I see them IRL, so that means I'm straight, right? But then, if I were straight, a vagina would turn me on, not a penis. But only does if it is a woman who has that penis? I'm so... lost.

610,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I'm 19F.

&amp;#x200B;

To make a long story short, I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness (JW) by a single mom who had me when she was 19 when she was out of the religion. she came back in when I was born. If you don't know much about JW, it's very controlling and has caused me a lot of mental health issues, from depression to anxiety.

Until a few years ago, I had no contact with my dad. He lived far away and had his own life, wife, and kids. He eventually reached out to my mom on facebook and my mom gave him short answers. Part of being a JW is limiting contact with anyone outside of the religion. My mom always kept me updated on things he sent.

Fast forward to a year and a half ago, when we moved from the place I was born and raised to a tiny town in the rural south. I left my entire network of friends behind, and I was depressed for a while as they didn't text me that often. I start questioning whether I want to be JW, and eventually I decide that I don't. I also decide that I want a relationship with my dad. Since my mom was the mediator between me and him using facebook, I let her know to tell him I might be interested in getting to know him. 

Well, my mom has decided she wants out too, which is awesome. I tell her she can send more things about me to him. Long story short, I eventually find out that my dad is having an affair with my mom while he's still married and has kids with another woman. It hurts me a lot, and I'm still angry. 

My mom has been defensive about it, saying that she doesn't need my permission and that he was sooooooo unhappy with his wife. And that's right, she doesn't need my permission or anything, but it makes me sick, and it influences my opinion of him and of her. My mom was married to another dude while we were JWs and he was terrible. They separated when I was 10 because he was abusive and an alcoholic, and it's just been me, my little brother, and my mom since then. I know what it's like to live in a single parent household, and it sucks (even worse as a JW). And I know that parents shouldn't stay together for their kid's sake, but the fact that they're not even divorced and he's dating my mom makes me so angry. I don't understand why they can't just wait until they're divorced. I'm not sure where he's at with that, as they were supposed to tell their kids that they were divorcing and he was supposed to get his own place, but idk if that happened.

Anyway, my mom and my dad have been trying to push me towards having contact with him. I've still never met him, but I do message him through Facebook. He seems like a pretty nice person, I guess. He thinks the world of me and it terrifies me. 

I wouldn't call my mom abusive, but she's convinced I had a wonderful childhood and she did an awesome job at raising me, which I would contest. Yes, I never went hungry and I had everything I needed. But my great work ethic and always keeping everything clean? stems from my anxiety of her yelling at me when I didn't finish a chore. I remember one time when I was 14-15 and I had to clean the house while she was at work, and I knew she was having a bad day, so I made her gluten free chocolate cupcakes. The majority of the housework was done, but I think there was still some little things that didn't get finished. She comes home and starts yelling at me because something wasn't done and I just start bawling because I tried to do something nice for her. When she sees the cakes she stops yelling and I think she might have apologized, but I still remember it. This was a constant event in our house. to this day I still can hear her voice in my head and think about how upset she would be when I think about not doing something related to the house chores. I'll come home from a long day of school in the morning and a closing shift at night and there'll be dishes in the sink and I'll apologize profusely for not putting them away even when she says it's okay, that I could just do them in the morning. The first words out of her mouth when I told her I was getting a full ride this semester at school was ""good, now you can start paying rent.""

Anyway, I'm getting off track. My relationship with my mom is strenuous. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I take my car into the dealer to get a recall fixed and also to get my coolant leak examined. Dealer tells me it's going to be around $2500 to get everything in my car that needs to be fixed, fixed. My dad's a mechanic and he calls and he manages to get the coolant repair down to $1300. I am upset over this, but thankfully I have the savings that will be able to cover it. However, it's still stressful as it does take a major part of my savings (I had around 3k saved.)

Mom and I go to dinner and she tells me that she thinks that I should write or talk to my dad to get the tensions out and I should say it if I feel it. She also says that I could do the same with her and that not worry about her getting upset, which is such a load of BS. 

And just now, she got home from work and I've been brewing over this in my head (there's a lot of other little things, this is just the main picture) and I'm upset. I don't want to talk about it with her. She tells me that if I don't tell her what's wrong, I need to stop acting upset. She assumes it's about my car and she tells me that ""You have a good life. Most kids your age would be screwed if that happened with their car. Be thankful you have the money saved"" and I just shake my head because telling someone they have a good life is such a loaded statement. I do have a good life. But I'm also stressed af- I have two different dudes who are into me and idk how to let them down without being mean and I have work (customer service at a grocery store) and school (first midterm due sunday) and I just feel like I'm going to collapse.

612,"So next weekend I'm spending the entire weekend with my best friend for her birthday. On the Saturday we were planning on going shopping and going to this mini golf place that my friend has been on about for ages. We are both super excited for it, and have been talking about it every chance we've had for the past month. 

However, one of her other friends has messaged me asking if I wanted to be part of a trip to 
surprise my best friend at the golfing place the week after her birthday. She has specifically asked me not to tell my best friend as she doesn't want me to ruin the surprise. I tried to explain that we already had plans to go to this place, but her friend wants me to convince her out of it by telling her that I don't want to go and I must stop her from going at all costs. She says that my best friend ""might be mad at me, but she will see that it was worth it in the end"". She doesn't seem to understand that my best friend would be mad at me the entire weekend and I would probably ruin her birthday as she was super excited for it.  

I feel I have been put in an impossible situation and no matter what I do I will upset somebody. Should I tell my best friend about their surprise and ruin it (I know she would cover for me and act surprised anyway, but I don't want to ruin it), go golfing anyway and upset her group of friends (who I recently started to get to know and actually quite like), or tell my friend I don't want to go golfing and have her be mad at me the entire birthday weekend? I'd hate for them to cancel their surprise plans as it is a really nice thing they are doing for her, plus, they already have everything planned out and some of them cancelled other things to attend.",16Feb2019,1

614,"Was offered a side job by a friend working a pull-tab booth in town for some easy cash. They were super short staffed, and he'd been talking me up to the manager for years, telling her to hire me if I could ever do it. He brought it up to me again, and I said I'd look into it.

I meet the mgr, tell her I want limited hours, she's okay with it and will shuffle around people's schedules to get me in. I ask the wife if there's any reasons why I can't take the job. She says no. Two days later she remembers that we just barely qualified for health insurance for the two of us based on income, and that this would put us damn close to the line. She also says she wants to sub to get out of the house and earn a little of her own, but doesn't tell me how much it would account for when I try to do the math. But with the numbers i do have, if they agree to pay me less than normal, I can do it. She doesn't put up much of a fuss at this.

I meet with the mgr again and accept the job on reduced pay, and the wife blows up. She won't have time to sub, she says, so I'm leaving her at home with the kids 6 days a week, even though she quit her teaching job to stay home with the kids, leaving me to earn all the money. And if she does sub, we're back off insurance.

So I'm here at my first shift, and wife wants me to quit. The job doesn't mean that much to me, but it feels like I jerked these people around and it's a bridge I wouldn't want to burn.

She's done this sort of thing before, mentioning vague concerns before a decision and then getting mad because *she was so clear* that it was never a possibility in the first place after I've made it.

Do I quit, or do I put my foot down on this one and save my good name?",16Feb2019,4
616,"My (23/F) friend (33/F) is tanking a trip to Mexico and has been wanting me to go for a while. I can‚Äôt exactly afford it, don‚Äôt really have the time to go or want to go right now. She told me she would pay for me to go with her, and I‚Äôd pay her back over time. I decided to go on a whim, because I actually can‚Äôt afford it and her helping was a nice gesture. We booked the flight and realized I had probably made the wrong decision because of some things that have happened in the past. 

We have had a strange relationship, I have known her for a few years, but when we met, she was a 30 year old woman still in that partying and drinking stage. I was just out of college and still living that lifestyle and being careless. I didn‚Äôt actually realize it was quite a toxic friendship, as there were times (only can realize this is retrospect) that she was using me and we were overall bad influences on each other for some time. There were countless times she‚Äôd pick a fight with me or run off with some random guy while she was drunk. 

In the past year I have put that life behind me and she has gotten better too, but our friendship has definitely changed. I don‚Äôt know if I am just being overly cautious or paranoid. I want to go on this trip, just not with her. And I don‚Äôt know how to tell her that. There are just too many crazy things that have happened here and I couldn‚Äôt trust that it wouldn‚Äôt happen in another country I am unfamiliar with. I also have very little travel experience, and she wants to hop from different cities each night where I would like to just stay in one or two areas and have a set hotel for the duration. 

I feel like I am a bad friend for not going with her. I do trust her, just not when she drinks and I have cut out drinking. I don‚Äôt know what to tell her about cancelling. 

TLDR: friend wants me to accompany her on trip to Mexico. I can‚Äôt afford it at this time so she offered to pay for a flight and I‚Äôd pay her back. I accepted but realized  I don‚Äôt want to go that badly to have debt over it. Also have trouble trusting this person based on past experiences.

617,"First, a little backstory... I thought I was straight my whole life and have always been with men.  But I met this girl while I was married and long story short, I came out to my husband, got a divorce and was with her for 3 years.  We broke up a few months ago and I though I had become asexual.  I was focusing on my daughter, school and learning to be happy alone.  It was actually pretty easy.

A week ago... I met a guy at a bonfire and we didn‚Äôt really talk much there, but we exchanged numbers (I got a few numbers from people I thought were cool), and he texted me the next day to see if I wanted to get coffee.  I agreed, we met and had a great time.  There was a little flirting from him but I told him I was focusing on my kid and not looking for anything.  He was such a gentleman though and he insisted that anytime we went out, he would pay.  I found myself thinking about him a lot afterwards.  I thought about him sexually.  He texted me afterwards to tell me that he wanted to see me again.  I found myself falling for him even though I had been sure I was a lesbian, then asexual.  We met up again and he turned up the pressure and kissed me.  It was so awkward and uncomfortable but he was not letting up.  He kissed me 2 more times during that date and not in a sweet gentle way.  I am aware that this sounds like a horrible date.  After that situation, I decided that I just wasn‚Äôt ready to date or anything and he was very understanding.  But then, last night he asked me if I wanted to grab dinner strictly as friends.  I had already eaten, but I asked him if he wanted to grab drinks strictly as friends.  We met up and it was amazing just talking to him as a friend, but the more we drank, the more we talked about being more than that.  We ended up having the most amazing sex.  The way he looked at me and held me, and talked to me was like nothing I had ever experienced before.

Here‚Äôs my dilemma- I really like this guy, but he wants to settle down and have kids.  Like now.  We are both 36, but I already have a kid and I don‚Äôt want to start over again.  Also, my ex husband probably wouldn‚Äôt react very well to seeing me with a guy after leaving him after coming out as a lesbian.  

This guy asked me what I wanted last night and I told him that I don‚Äôt know.  There‚Äôs another girl he‚Äôs been talking to that he really likes and wants to see where it goes.  He told me he would cut it off with her if I was open to moving forward with him.  It all seems so fast and so wrong to me right now, but I don‚Äôt want to lose him.  I don‚Äôt know what to do.",16Feb2019,1
618,"Hi, I'm 32 and work in a preschool kitchen, a couple years ago I became a supervisor and I absolutely hate it. I do not have the social skills or situational awareness needed to see when someone needs to be told what to do or to deal with a difficult employee and it's crushing me. I've tried so hard to push through and learn it but it's not working and I really need to get out. Trouble is have no other marketable skills besides cooking and I'm not that good at that and have no passion for it. 

I was trying to learn watchmaking but have been trying to reassemble a movement and idk if this is gunna work. I think I broke something and I'm so lost on if I even broke it or if I'm just doing something wrong and really don't think I have steady enough hands for it. 

I don't know what to do, I'm so lost. I feel so underdeveloped and useless. I think I probably have aspurgers or autism or something because my social skills are really trash, I can get along with co workers well because we have a job to distract us half the time and we can keep it light, but any type of job where I have to sell something to people is a nightmare for me. I've tried at yard sales and stuff, I'm really bad. This is another reason I'm starting to really second guess the watchmaker thing, though I think maybe I could handle it if it's something like that where I have a passion for it and would really know what I'm talking about.

I'm not very strong either, though I'm trying to get into shape lately but it's really bad, after a month I can still only get though like a 15 minute workout tops. 

What i am good at is puzzles. Which is why I though watchmaking would be great for me. Maybe some other type of machine that doesn't require surgeon level steady hands. I want a job where I'm given a broken thing and have to diagnose and repair the problem. Idk much about machines, so I'd have to knuckle down and learn everything pretty much from scratch, but I'm willing to do that. 

I don't care that much about money as long as I can afford a moderate life. I'm more concerned with finding a job I don't hate and am capable of handling. My current job is not meeting any of those marks and I desperately need to get out asap. I don't even feel like I can afford a therapist which I quite clearly need. 

Please, any ideas on what career I might be able to move into? And please don't say I need to have more confidence, I've tried and I feel that the only way to do that is to find that job that's right for me.",16Feb2019,1

A physical job helping people outside, with new challenges daily. My issue is the physical part. I realize that being an officer is a physical job. For the college I want I need to pass a physical test just to get in to the police course. That leaves me with one more year until I‚Äôm going to the gym 3 times a week to prepare.

I‚Äôve worked 2nd shift for a small mom &amp; pop hotel  for over a year with 3 other coworkers, one of them being my boss. We all use the same email inbox as it‚Äôs the company mailbox. We have to check all emails from the shift prior to ensure there are no errors with any new reservations. 

I was checking emails from 1st shift today &amp; I saw an email regarding a written warning for a coworker of mine, and it was addressed to me, as my boss has asked me to handle all disciplinary action as she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with it (this is a whole other issue I‚Äôve attempted to address to the hotel owners to no avail. Don‚Äôt get me started). This email stated that my coworker received a hefty raise as an incentive to get her tardiness under control but her tardiness has only gotten worse.

Time went on and it became clear, that there is one thing not so easy to handle for me.
He doesn't feel (or is aware of) emotions like neurotypical people do. He knows anger or stress, but can't comprehend love or affection, despite in a rational manner (he says he likes me and likes being with me, but doesn't think he is capable of loving someone or even understanding what it means).

Now I am super uncertain if I can be and stay happy in a relationship like that. Everyday life with him is great but i miss getting emotions back to my emotions. Everyone wants to bei loved by their significant other, right?
Could it bei enough to just rationally ubderstand that he choose me and that is the closest thing to love I can geht from him?

Maybe there are people here living with someone with similar emotional differences or are of the spectrum as well and can give meine advice.

632,"I am really uncomfortable with the idea of seeing a therapist/doctor about eating issues and would like to know what I should expect. I‚Äôm not really even sure that I have a real problem, but I have externally been told that I might.

I semi-frequently [non-compulsively] don‚Äôt eat for a few days at a time. My main reasoning for doing this is because I have strongly positive feelings about not eating. Aside from a general ‚Äúgood feeling,‚Äù I specifically feel great for having the self control to decline food when offered and throw it away.

Less prominently, I have desires to be thin and I guess ‚Äúpretty?‚Äù I have spent  hours looking at thinspo. This is uncomfortable to admit, but thin guys/girls are SO beautiful. It‚Äôs probably not completely healthy to idolize people to this extent. Sometimes it makes me feel motivated but other times I just feel really sad and insecure.

I have no desires to be a girl (I am male), but I have cried on multiple occasions over the fact that it will be really difficult if not impossible to have cute/pretty legs as a guy.

Compulsively, I can‚Äôt eat when I am anxious. Additionally, I absolutely cannot eat around close family and friends. Even if I both could and wanted to eat, I can‚Äôt if one of my family members is in the kitchen. I strongly prefer eating in complete privacy.

I love acting but it's a lottery, eay too many actors and way too little jobs for them and my oarents don't support it whatsoever. I also like doing camera work and editing videos but in reality it's really hard getting a good job with camera work and editing.

My nephew got way too many gifts for a toddler, so much so that my brother and his wife need to make two trips for all the toys. Luckily my grandmas birthday is next week, so they are planning to pick up the rest of the kid toys then. 

Initially my brother said they would leave the toys at the sister in law‚Äôs sister‚Äôs place, where the party was at. Then, before we left, my brother asked my gma and I to bring home some of the kids toys so they can just come to our house next weekend for my Gma‚Äôs birthday. I initially said ‚Äúno, because that wasn‚Äôt part of the plan.‚Äù I told them we don‚Äôt have enough room for the toys (seriously it was like an entire room of toys). Then my brother started guilt tripping me saying ‚Äúoh so if that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre going to be then forget it‚Äù and essentially what equates to a little kid who gets all upset when he doesn‚Äôt get what he wants, etc. 

Why did I say ‚Äúno‚Äù? Because for the past year it‚Äôs felt like my brother and his wife just use my grandmas house for events. For example, Xmas, they just come and get a ridiculous amount of presents, my grandma is so sweet and over accommodates them by sleeping in another room, and then they leave. Before that they stored a few items in the basement.

I understand raising a kid is not easy and perhaps they mean well, but I felt like I needed to draw the line somewhere so they get the point, even politely to a small favor. Adults shouldn‚Äôt put others in predicaments, especially over a change of plans. If my brothers going to be upset over saying no to a small favor, so be it, but I do not want to see my grandma being taken advantage of. My brother just seems to overlook all that we do for him and just was looking for a reason to be mad at us. 

Thoughts? Was I being too harsh? ",16Feb2019,1

640,"Hi!! So, I earned about 900$ and was wondering  what decision could I come up with my money. (16 yo)

I would like to invest in knowledgde by buying books worth 900$ (that's around 25 books).
Topics would be devsops, cyber security, programming, investment, machine learning, hacking and more cyber security.

On the other hand, I was wondering if the best option should be to buy a Laptop worth 1000$, not a crappy Laptop of course but rather one that does have very good specs and a good price (e.g Asus Zenbook).
Now, I already have a medium-cost PC with 2 monitors and a gtx960 (going technical here) but I'm pretty interested on going portable.

I was thinking on buying the laptop and geting then all the books through a not very legal way :D (I have the enough resources to do that) but I would really prefer having all the books at my hand; having my own library makes me very excited!!!

What do you think?",16Feb2019,1
641,"&amp;#x200B;

I met a girl on an online dating site and we've known each other for about 2 years now and have grown very close although we do not consider ourselves to be in a romantic relationship.

Lately she has been threatening to kill herself because she is in constant physical and emotional pain and feels like her relationship life is hopeless because she has been abandoned by a boy she met online who did not return her feelings and possibly because I told her I cannot marry her or live with her forever.

I offered to pay for a doctor because I care about her, but instead she said that because she is in too much emotional pain and that doctors would only bring more pain, she prefer that I pay for other things to help distract her such as clothing and enjoyable food.

At this moment, I cannot offer her the relationship that she wants. But I also do not want to abandon her because of my concern for her welfare. So I've been continuing to talk to her almost every day. Almost every day, she says she wants to kill herself, and every day I say that we will find a way to make her happy which I truly believe.

However, whenever I try to bring up things like seeing a doctor or starting a career she gets angry at me. I'm not sure if this is due to my bad timing or the fact that I simply don't know how to approach these topics with her.

One of the things that I promised her was that I would always do my best to be there when she needs me. However, today I fell asleep and could not answer her call while she was having a hard time emotionally. As a result, she harmed herself because I was not there.

Whenever she threatens to hurt or kill herself I take it very seriously and start acting and sounding very worried, which upsets her and makes the situation worse. Since according to her, its enough that she is freaking out, she doesn't need me freaking out too.

I tried to apologize for not being there when she needed me, but I think that because this is not the first time I didn't answer her call immediately when she needed me, she was quite upset and  she promised to kill herself tomorrow. I panicked/reacted nervous and after a small argument which was unrelated to these events she blocked me from contacting her, I assume because she felt betrayed by my broken promises of being 100% available and not over-reacting to her threats.

So right now I am freaking out and I don't know what to do. I can't contact her anymore and she lives in another country and I dont know any of her friends. And I feel like the fact that she blocked me means she doesn't want me to contact her anymore. But I can't sleep and I have a very important day tomorrow. Any advice for me?",16Feb2019,1
642,"I go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I‚Äôm a 21 year old quiet guy who‚Äôs quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‚Äòok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I‚Äôm very quiet) ‚Äòyes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?‚Äô (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she‚Äôs never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she‚Äôd in her early 30s.

643,"Since I was about 9 or 10, I have spent countless hours in extreme stomach pain. I'm 16 now and nothing has changed. Foods I eat one day will have no effect, and the next will send me in my bed, stomach distended and cramping for hours. The only thing that doesn't cause this is pretty much chicken breasts and limited amounts of vegetables, but I can't live my life only eating chicken and green beans. Every day is a tossup to see what food, if any, is going to make me spend the day in pain. When I am at peak pain I can barely walk, sitting hurts and makes it feel like my stomach is going to explode, and the only thing that will help is laying down. I have been in so much pain that I have laid down on countless public bathroom floors, the floors in my house, and so many hours in bed. Sometimes it's caused by a full stomach, sometimes just by eating one thing. And I have been trying to track these things but there seems to be no consistency. I've recently had a couple instances where I've thrown up, most likely due to the pain from eating. What the hell is going on? I've mentioned it to my parents but they think it's nothing and it's not really like I can prove it to a doctor, so I'm not really sure what to do. ",16Feb2019,1

647,"tl:dr my roommate spends most of his spare time smoking pot and drinking in his room alone (well, skyping his gf) and I'm not sure how to tell him I'm worried about his behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate (m/28) spends most of his free time in his room with the door closed and only comes out to get food from the kitchen or go to his lab (he's a phd candidate in biology). He does have a ldr with a girl from Peru and they seem to facetime all the time, but he doesn't have many other friends that he hangs out with irl. He smokes a lot of pot (I can smell it and hear him coughing all the time) and tends to drink most nights (while skyping with his gf), and I just feel like this isn't the healthiest thing to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

His gf just left after a long visit and I haven't seen him as much and he hasn't been bringing our communal kitchen dishes back. I emailed him and our other roommate (who tends to hoard tupperware) to bring back any dishes they have in their rooms or labs, and he still hasn't done this, even though it's been a week. When I asked him about it one of the few times I've seen him this week, he said he was busy prepping for a 4th year symposium, but my other roommate (also a 4th year), says this isn't until May... He said he'd bring them back, but that was a few days ago and he still hasn't done it. It can't be that hard to carry dishes to the kitchen, can it? If it is, then something must be going on, but idk how to ask...

650,"So, I recently began the long process to adopt a kid because I‚Äôve always wanted to. Almost everyone has been excited- my family has lined up already begging to babysit or teach the kid the games they play. Friends have been supportive of the idea. Excited even. 

Except for one friend. She basically told me that since I‚Äôd be a single mom I‚Äôd be unable to care for the kid. Despite how many amazing single moms are out there. And since then- despite time carefully and calmly explaining my ideas and options (going part time, going to day shift, family babysitting) she has given me the cold shoulder. 

I feel like our relationship has taken a dive and I just don‚Äôt get why she is so mad that I want to adopt a child (especially since I‚Äôm gearing towards ones with medical or developmental needs).  I guess I‚Äôm just asking if there‚Äôs any ideas as to how to approach this. Or should I just leave it alone and see what happens. ",16Feb2019,1
651,"Been married for 1.5 years to my wife (I'm a woman  too). We moved to USA recently and we have been fighting a lot recently. She has work stress and we have to move out of our friends house soon. 

Problem 1: I can't speak when we fight. I become quiet and just listen. I can talk about it later but the fear.of confrontation makes me not do it. Therefore wife is annoyed cos there is no resolution  to our problems and fights.

Problem 2: I think I've lost self confidence (nothing to do with her). So I end up always asking for permission or waiting for her to make the decisions in our life.  Even if I make a decision  it ends up that she's not happy with it. Seems like I can never do something that is ok with her. 

Problem 3: I don't have a job yet and I've become lazy. I know the ways to get out of this funk but I've become lazy to do or try. I sometimes feel what's the point
