0,"I need advice, i’m 18 i have my drivers license and a car yet i’m not allowed to drive. I’m not allowed to have anyone in the car no friends and no girlfriend. I don’t feel like i’m able to do anything and i feel strapped by her. She told me to write down what’s been making me u happy lately and this is the only thing. How do i tell her? I understand parents get nervous but it’s been so long that i learned to drive and i’m not allowed to do anything with it. I can’t go out and have fun or even go on dates with my girlfriend. She makes me feel trapped. I know i just turned into a legal adult and i’m a “new” driver but i’m not dumb. I’ve proven multiple times to her that she can trust me but she just won’t let go. I’m stuck at home all day and i feel like i’m still 15 years old with a permit. How do i tell her how i feel? How do i tell her to just let me be free?",18Sep2019,0
1,"My mom is very strict. I’m a teenager and I’m always cooped up inside the house. I’m not allowed to walk many places and I can’t have a curfew. (Come home right after school.)  I am most definitely not allowed to date I’m not even allowed to go to parties! I basically can’t do things a normal teenager can do.. I’m just tired of coming home everyday and doing nothing and I want to experience stuff other people my age are doing but it’s impossible. 

It’s not like i’m a  bad kid either. I  follow the house rules most of the time, I don’t think i’m much of a nuisance and I get good grades. Whenever I bring this up she just brushes me off. What should I do?",18Sep2019,1
2,"I’ve struggled with Major Depressive Disorder for about 6 years now, as well as Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Complex PTSD. I’ve been on and off of medication always, and am currently not taking anything for it.

I’ve expressed concern to my teachers and counselors, anyone I can that may be able to help me, that I’d like to start seeing a therapist and I need their help finding one in my moms budget.

I’ve brought it up to my mom a few times that I want to start seeing a therapist, and she did nothing but bitch and moan pretty much saying, “Fine, I’ll just work MORE (overtime) for YOU so you can be even more ungrateful.” She hasn’t yet, or mentioned it again to me.

I found out that pretty much wherever I go the copay will be $35/session for therapy. Which isn’t bad in my opinion. I know money is tight, but I know we aren’t poor and I’d even be willing to skip lunch and walk home instead of ubering once or twice a week to save up that money for therapy.

One of my counselors has found a place that therapists will see teenagers for free, but my mom isn’t even willing to take me to therapy.

I had a doctors visit a couple weeks ago where they asked me why I stopped taking Lexapro and BusPar and I told them, with my mother right there, that it increased my suicidal tendencies.

I’ve mentioned to my mom several times in the last couple months, stating blatantly, “Mom, I’m suicidal” and she just changes the subject or moves on with whatever she wanted to say instead. 

I don’t know where to go from here. I feel undeserving of therapy at this point since I can’t seem to find access to it anywhere I turn, even to my own parents.

I’m turning 18 soon, so I’ll apply for state insurance or something and get a car of my own once I can. I’ll be able to start therapy then, but that’s like 6 months out and I’m struggling beyond reason right now. If mental health has a “pain” scale of 1-10, then I’d say I’m in critical condition at around a 9 at least half of the time.

What do I do? How can I find help when I have such limited resources?",18Sep2019,2
3,"i’m going to cut to the chase. i live in a very large house and my parents have had bad blood within the past year and i overheard my sister mention my mom has a sugar daddy (or several??) and she’s hardly home, comes home at 2 am sometimes but isn’t here everyday. my dad’s paying the rent.

but my mom owns the dogs who my sibling cares for deeply, but she hardly takes care of the dogs anyways. what would happen to the dogs, or more-so my family overall? i want to tell my dad so badly but there’s so much that could go wrong, but it’s the morally correct thing to do.

7,"Right off the bat, I (male, 21) will admit something: I am an overthinker. In most situations where I have to deal socially with people or have responsibilities to take care of, I tend to get extremely anxious and think of the worst/best possible outcomes. 

I started working at my current internship a couple months ago and will be working until December. In the first month or so, we got the chance to meet all the other interns there (majority from my university) and there was this particular girl that stood out. She and I work in separate divisions but we share a lab space and frequently come across each other's paths. What really got me interested in her was her willingness to approach me and get to know me. In most, if not all situations, I am the person who initiates conversations and asks questions. Even my close friend has said that if it wasn't for me trying to get to know him he wouldn't have bothered getting to know me in the first place. I really appreciated it when she would come up to ask me what I was doing or how my day was going. Soon enough, I developed a crush. Her sense of humor, her smile, and how kind she was were all things I found extremely attractive (she's also just super cute).

One day at lunch she came up to me and started to talk about skateboarding. She talked about how she really wanted to learn and I told her that we should hang out and skateboard one day. A couple of weeks after that (had some things to take care of) I asked her out to skate and we had an amazing time. We sat down and talked for a while and she invited me over to her place to meet this cutout board of a celebrity and we just talked and talked, and next thing I knew 3 hours had passed. Our conversation was all over the place but mainly it was both of us asking questions to get to know each other. And then it was time to leave and next thing I knew she had walked me all the way out of her apartment and we talked even more before I left. I was really nervous in that moment but I told her that we should really hang out again and do something fun like this and she excitedly agreed.

Fast forward two weeks and here I am, anxious as ever haha. Considering that this is a six month internship the best option would be to wait until December/January and ask her out then since I would be seeing her at my college in the spring. Now, here is where I seek advice: Do I continue to ask her out to events like skateboarding and things she might like and drop a few hints that I'm interested / flirt? It's sometimes pretty difficult to ask at work because at lunch we are with the other interns and work should be a time to work, so I will try my best and otherwise just set things up through text.

However, of course I have begun to overthink this situation quite a bit by asking questions like: is she even interested? am I enough? am I ready for a relationship? I've never really dated someone before and have never confessed in person that I was interested in someone. I've also had a lot of problems with confidence and taking responsibility of my life, which has affected my physical (overweight) and mental (emotionally unstable at times) state. I have definitely been working on these and I hope to continue to improve but the last question I will ask is: is it better to solve my own issues and then start considering dating other people, or is it ok to pursue a relationship and work things through along the way? I think the second option **is what I want to do.** We all have problems of our own and sometimes it really is just about solving them and having people around to support you.",18Sep2019,1

Anyway, today I've done most of nothing except doing a few errands and play videogames. I'm really sick and tired of just doing that....sitting around having not much to do, and maybe do an errand here and there. I also love to draw, but I believe that my depression tends to bring my motivation down with doing anything at all with art/drawing. The program I'm going to in January is for Illustration anyway, but I feel like I can't force myself to do much of anything, and I just waste my day away.

11,"My best friend is a victim of sexual abuse. We discuss the effects it’s had on her and she’s very open to me about it. I love her so much and it hurts me to see how this event shaped her whole life. I’ve known this for years, and when it happened I didn’t know her. We only became friends in college.

This past weekend, one of my cousins confided to me that she was sexually abused by our uncle. It broke me heart bc I was there when it happened (granted we were both very young) and I see this uncle a lot. I feel sick to my stomach that this had been going on for years and I had no idea...I don’t know how to be around him anymore.

After knowing this, I’m just wondering how I should deal with it. I take on other people’s emotions easily, and I can’t stop crying. I can’t believe she has been going through this for so long and I had been dumbly sitting there for years. People had been classifying my cousin as “crazy” just bc she was drinking, doing drugs, etc as a way of dealing with her abuse. 2 people very close to me have been dealing with this, and I’m just fucking angry.


I’m scared to tell anyone about my stress bc I don’t want my cousin and friend to think it’s about me. It’s not about me, but knowing this info has really affected me. I don’t know what to do.

Her father is an aggressive alcoholic and her mother isn’t around anymore. She has no one to turn to and only has me at this point because I reached out. Usually we meet up at a park whenever she’s struggling, but today it was especially bad. I had the horrible idea of inviting her over since only my uncle was home (blood related). I talk to her and try to calm her nerves. After a little while, she’s finally calm. At this point she’s acting weird. I try asking what’s wrong but all she does is look away. I tap her shoulder and the turns and kisses me. I, in no way, have every shown her ANY interest within this realm. My uncle sees this and likely didn’t want to get her involved.

15,"So today as I was walking into my computer science class, this girl that I haven't really talked to before said hi to me as I passed by her in class. I didn't really hear her well as I was just taking off my earbuds as she said hi to me, and not even a second later she repeated herself and said ""MJB360, hi."" So I responded by saying ""Hey."". Now this girl in my class does have friends (albeit only guys though as she is the only one in my computer science class that's a girl) and she was sitting next to one of them when she said hi to me. I don't know exactly what her motive was of saying hi to me, all I know is that it seemed a little out of the way as a friendly gesture as she wasn't exactly close to me when she said hi to me. Also she didn't say hi to anybody else during class today (at least not like that) and I don't recall her saying hi to anybody else in the class like that before. A few weeks ago on the second day of school my teacher wanted me to show the few seniors in my class (me, her and two others) my CompTIA A+ certification wallet card to them as they are going to be taking the test later this year (I took and barely passed mine over the summer) and the girl who said hi got somewhat happy and excited for me when she saw it.

16,"I noticed how my friend Sarah is spending so much time with this new girl now. They met each other at work two months ago and I can avoid to feel jealous how close they are now. 

Sarah even invited this girl to her home country when she never asked me if I wanted to go and we’ve been friends for three years. 

She spends so much time with this girl. When we meet up she doesn’t stop talking about her.  For example, she tells me this girl bought a new phone or that they will meet up this Saturday for a sleepover. 
Obviously, I don’t show any sign of jealousy I just smile and tell her is nice. 

I’m completely aware I am wrong but I just can’t help it. Sarah is one if not the best friend I’ve ever had. She’s so nice I’m afraid to lose her or that she “leaves” me.

My stepdad owns the car I drive and it's fairly older and has some issues. My girlfriend goes to college about an hour away and we plan on moving in together.

My mom is very controlling. She tracks my location, gives me a curfew, and is always wondering what I am doing and who I'm with. She won't let me sleep over at my girlfriend's house over the weekend or during the week (based on our work and school schedules). She also wants me home by a certain time every night I hang out with someone. I really want to move out and have some money saved. However, I was going to buy a car with that money because I doubt my stepdad will let me have the car if I move out. Me and my girlfriend are planning on moving in together next year, but I really want to get out before my mom ruins our relationship. It's already taking a toll on my mental health and I really don't like being at home anymore. I also don't really know how leases work but I don't want to sign a year one because that would push off me and my girlfriend moving in even longer. Any advice helps, thanks.",18Sep2019,1

Since I am home from college I only took out $10,000 this year. (Plus I think $6000 from the school).

31,"He’s fought a 3 year battle with a neuroendocrine tumor in his pancreas which gradually spread to the liver. It seemed like he was rallying for a while and after 2 doses of concentrated Y90 treatment to the liver we actually saw some shrinkage and he gained his energy and appetite back. Then he had a fall and broke his hip, became hypoglycemic, and fell into depression for a few months. After getting him healed up again, he went back to driving himself around and we got him prescribed THC oil which further helped his appetite and nausea. 

But recently, doctors determined chemo wasn’t working, and having expired every type of chemo available, he opted for a clinical trial at Emory. This is when things got terrible. Within 2 weeks, he was overwhelmed with nausea and pain, he dropped about 40 pounds, started becoming confused easily and stopped eating entirely. He fell out of a recliner and went to the ER and from there his liver has stopped functioning and since Friday he’s been declining rapidly. 

So, we’ve been denied by two hospice centers because they claimed “he’s not in bad enough shape”. Social worker said something about they are looking for a 2-3 day stay max, which baffles me because hospice is literally for end of life care and I can’t imagine him being any worse without being dead. So people at Emory are now kind of rushing us to figure out where he’s going and they’ve already cut back his fluids and he hasn’t really eaten much since Friday. They keep insisting on in home hospice care, but that would almost be impossible for us to make work because of our busy schedules and lack of knowledge about the round the clock care he needs. 

Help?? Anyone who has been in a similar situation and can guide me to possible options?

I’m on the top bunk so I can’t even charge my phone up there because it’s so far away from the outlet. 

My dorm is also so far away from campus I pretty much can’t come back in the middle of the day. 

Like fam, I’m not trying to do nofap. Going for up to a week without anything? Absolute torture, my brain is mush and I just feel like shit. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!!",18Sep2019,1

35,"Hey guys, I am new to reddit.

I am meant to be at school but I’m having a mental break down. I feel like such a bitch right now but whatever. My family is all out at work while I’m laying on my bed. My mum is texting me to grow up but I really can’t go to school.

So let’s get this straight.

I’m 5’9 (174cm)

Male
75kg

I have a bit of acne on my face and it kills me when I look in the mirror. I hate my height because heaps of people are taller then me. My hair is shit after I got it cut and it basically just goes into my eyes. 

I have a bit of muscle but I want to lose weight in my face, arms and stomach. 

Going to go listen to the ink spots and not cry but just think what I am doing with my life ( haven’t cried in 3 years ;) ) - thank you.",18Sep2019,1
36,"This is the second time my neighbor's cat had showed up to my house and stayed outside for over 24 hours. She's A very friendly and affectionate cat. She had a chip with the number last time- that's how I found her owner.

Last time the owner told me his new roommate is allergic to cats and started to leave her outside for that reason. He said he was looking into giving her away or something.

Last night, she showed up again and stayed over night. This time- NO CHIP. My hunch is that this guy is hoping the cat would just run off and it wont be his problem anymore. Sadly im not in a place to take her on. 

He said he's gonna come pick her up in a few hours. What can I do? The shelters I found near here are closed now. I also dont want to be over stepping on my boundaries nor there is enough to report him for negligence. Im in south bay - los angeles county.",18Sep2019,2

39,"going to the shithole part of town and antagonising the pikeys by spraying them with piss, getting a cup of piss heating it up in microwave and squirting piss with a water pistol i did it to the spoiled snotty rich kids who thought that they could talk to ppl older and taller than them with no respect

it was literally them trying to annoy me by nonstop talking i wasnt bothered but then me and the lads were having a waterfight and we had a decent idea they ran off, but they didnt know where they live so when they got their parents i'd be long gone i was pretty casual i'd just dispose of the gun and then just walk home i was 15, some 13 yr old kids trying to be smart try to annoy me tbh

i laugh and then i saw the opportunity for a drenching i mean i think kids just need to learn some respect, and that they're not above the age thing when i was a lad i was respectful to older lads its better than fucking taping them up and hitting them

42,"I know he doesn’t like to text much. He doesn’t like to talk on the phone either. He doesn’t pick up on my flirting, so how do I show him that I like him and would like to go on a 3rd date? How can I spark a quick convo? Do I have to ask directly? 

So, I met this guy online, he’s very direct and forward. Which I thought meant he was very confident at first. We exchanged numbers right away and set up a date almost immediately. Our first date went great, we sat at Starbucks for 7hours just talking and only ended our date because we got kicked out, it was a Saturday night. We ended the date with a nice hug and he text me saying he was pleasantly surprised with me and was very happy to have met me. He asked me for a second date immediately. 

On our second date we walked around the pier for about an hour and found a quiet place to sit and talk afterwards. This date lasted 4hours since it was on a Monday afternoon. However, this time I was putting my typical “I like you” queues to work. Like, when I’m on a date I subtly touch guys hands to emphasize certain aspects of my story or as we are crossing the street I’ll get really close and guys will usually grab my arm. When I did these things this guy didn’t catch on and as our conversation progressed this time I noticed he wasn’t catching my jokes or when I was being sarcastic. The way he was expressing himself gave me the feeling he might be on the spectrum since I’ve engaged with Aspies before. I didn’t catch it the first time we met. This time was a lot more obvious. When we said good bye we gave each other a nice hug. He said I would hear from him. I texted him saying I had a fun time, and he replied saying, “Likewise. You looked amazing again :).” Yet, he didn’t ask me for a third date. 

So, what do I do now? Our texts are solely based on when and where we are meeting up and nothing more. It’s not a continuous conversation. He told me he feels talking on the phone is a waste of time and I’m guessing he must feel the same about texting. I think he likes me. I feel like he does. But, what should my next step be? Do I have to ask him out now? I’ve never dated anyone on the spectrum and he hasn’t come out and told me about it either.

FYI - I already posted in the Aspie communities and have yet to get a response. That’s why I’m posting here.",18Sep2019,2

but my mom owns the dogs who my sibling cares for deeply, however my mom hardly takes care of the dogs anyways. what would happen to the dogs, or more-so my family overall? i want to tell my dad so badly but there’s so much that could go wrong, but it’s the morally correct thing to do.

45,"
The past couple of weeks I haven’t been sleeping as much, but it doesn’t seem to effect me much as I’m still running around at all hours of the day. I’ve also struggled with dissociating for my entire life, but in the recent weeks it’s gotten the wost it’s ever been. (Like there of been times on the bus route I’ve been taking for years where slowly then suddenly I forget where exactly I am or what’s going on, and have trouble figuring out where I need to go) 

My emotions have also been all over the place (definitly due in part to having to visit my parents a couple of days ago, because seeing them always ends up stressing me out) I feel like I’m usually a pretty logical person, but recetly it feels like my emotions and brain are in sync, but not in a good way. It feels like the irrational emotional part of my brain is taking the lead, and instead of guiding it, my brain just rationalizes it all meaning my impulse control when it comes to making terrible decisons is low. 

When I get like this, I tend to care about people less overall, and get manipulative. For example I’ve noticed tension between my friend and her bf and a part of me wants to dig at it and see what happens because I’m a terrible person who wants to see what’s under the surface.

I guess what I need advice on (besides seeing a therapist because I am soon) is just how to ground myself, curb my impulses, and just not be terrible.

TLDR: I’m dissociating a lot and extra mental ill lately, and am trying not to be a shitty manipulative person for the sake of not blowing up my life. Help plz",18Sep2019,1

48,"Background: I(18f) have a 'friendship group' with my boyfriend, 'sara' and 'Ben'. I can drive, ben can drive and Sara can't drive but is learning. We almost always are at Sara's house, her family don't have a whole lot of money. But they're not exactly poor either.

So Sara's step dad 'Dave' has recently gotten quite unwell, his leg has been swelling up and causing him quite a lot of pain. Dave isn't legally allowed to drive because he's epileptic, Sara's mum doesn't drive either so no one in their immediate family can drive. 
When Dave first got sick I offered to take him to the hospital etc since my days are relatively free because my job start date isnt for a few weeks. Then I ended up taking his wife and picking Dave up from the hospital.
Since then I've taken him to hospital and picked him up and then another day I took him again. 

I'm taking him in and picking him up again tomorrow aswell, he's mentioned that he may need to go in daily for 2 weeks and kind of implied he wanted me to take him. My question is, should I have to take him? I dont want to be a taxi and ferry him around. He lives about a 5 minute drive from me and then the hospital is about 20 -25 minutes away. I feel like I should take him since he is unwell and me and my friends are at his house a lot. But I also feel like it shouldn't be my responsibility? There are bus routes in our area, he could very easily get the bus, it would just take longer. It's not like he can't walk either, his work involves a lot of manual labour and he's still doing that. 
Also, I dont understand why he hasen't asked Ben to take him at all? Hes been friends with Sara a lot longer than me, I've only known them a year. 

I just feel guilty about saying no because he is unwell and worried that I am a bad person for wanting to say no.


TL;DR Should I have to drive my friends unwell step dad, who cant drive for medical reasons, to the hospital for appointments? And how can I say no?",18Sep2019,1

- I can go 6 hours without talking to or seeing my boyfriend until I start feeling deflated, lethargic and sluggish.

- We have a healthy relationship and communicate well; like all couples, we do have time apart, which is intended to be healthy.

- I don’t usually double-text my boyfriend until the 6 hour mark has passed, and by then I’ll be extremely paranoid and sad (as well as the aforementioned deflation).

- He isn’t perturbed by my clinginess but worries that it could eventually hinder me.

I don’t know what to do. I love my boyfriend, and we get along great. This is the best relationship I’ve had in ages, and I don’t want to mess it up by being sad whenever he’s away.

I am now 20 and he is 22. It kinda made me believe in the saying “right person, wrong time”. He would drive to my apartment a state away every Friday just to spend the weekend with me, so I kinda got a little feel as to what it would be like living with him. He was good though; if one of us were feeling down and wanted to cancel plans, we would do it in a heartbeat and just have a comfy movie night with no complaints. I would cook dinner and he wouldn’t even let me touch the kitchen or dishes afterwards (his way of appreciating me cooking). He would do things without me even asking, like taking out the garbage or whatever. He picked up after himself and never cared if I needed just some alone time in my room.

I'm fine about 50% of the time, which is when I'm very motivated to do school work and reach out to friends. Other times, it doesn't matter if I'm alone or with a group of people because all I can do is imagine the what the setting would be like if I wasn't there.

- exercise 
- cut down on video games
- deleting social networking apps (these absolutely slaughter my happiness)
- cleaned my condo obsessively

I lost the last bit of the rotted shriveled up corpse of respect I had for him (I had some respect for him because it isn’t like he isn’t trying to be a good Dad.). In June I finally told my Dad that I hated him after he asked me (He asked me multiple times that year). He said to me that if I hated him then I would be disowned. Was this close before my brother told him that I misspoke and I had to go along with it because he also said that he should of punched me for that and that the only reason he didn’t was because I would of died if he did that. In July I ran away with the Cat I legally owned and walked a long way to the vet so I could get him mandatory shots because my plan required me to bring him to a Pet Boarding Place that offered anti flea bathing. At some point the police were notified (not by my parents since they thought that they can file a missing person report after 24 hours of them being missing) and my Mom came. After being brought home and basically being told that I got most of my info wrong and that it was hard to read even though I could read it fine and told that I was a ‘Spoiled Brat’ and ‘If you’re going to kill your self you better just do it’ by my own Dad. In September after my Dad started the conversation about my behavior (I never start these) and telling him that I didn’t care if I was apart of the family he caused a fit telling me that I was going to be spanked, went up to my room, pushed me to the back of the wall while I was in bed, then slapped my face multiple times still referring to it as “spanking” and then verbally berated me and asked me the same question (You have to be careful on how you answer my Dad’s questions whenever he is around). After some point he said that if I reported him than he will send Me and My Brother’s Cats to the Pound. The only thing that stops me from reporting this is that fact since they might call my parents first before showing up. I have an audio recording of the entire incident including me finding out that there was a hole in the wall because of the fact that my Dad pushed me to the back of the wall. What should I do? Also is there any way for me to still attend my school if I go into foster care and can I keep the Cat that I own while in foster care. I have a temp home plan if necessary. I just need to set it up with the person.",18Sep2019,2
80,"So me and this girl were talking for a bit via text. I don’t usually like to hook up with random people off tinder or anything but this girl I somewhat knew from college. 

I was just feeling it. She came over wanting to hook up but found out I wasn’t really attracted to her personality at all which made me not attracted to her really. 

Basically I didn’t penetrate yet as I was just toying around with my fingers. I felt something and pulled my fingers out only to see blood all over my fingers and all over my sheets. 

I was pissed because she never let me know. I went to the bathroom to contemplate what I was about to do. I got back and she told me to keep going and just forget it but I wasn’t even feeling it in the first place so I told her to leave. 

Well she left very confused and unhappy and I never heard from her again, blocked me on everything etc...Not that I care anymore about it but I just want to know was I being too harsh/mean? How would any of you handle this type of situation?",18Sep2019,1
81,"So, I have been friends with this guy for about 4 years, but we sometimes have arguments that don't even make sense.

He is generally a good friend and I love to play video games with him. He doesn't understand jokes or sarcasm though, and I still have no idea how to deal with that.

We also have serious arguments when he is trying to tell me something, but I don't understand what. His sentences just don't make sense. I think he's trying to sound smart and use fancy words, but when I tell him, he just gets mad and says that I'm an idiot, whose is just too dumb to understand ""a genius"". After that, I start to get mad too and can't hold myself anymore. Then he starts to whine about how my friends and I are heartless monsters who just laugh at everything and it ""hurts his soul"".

83,"Let me tell you the story about how our lives got turned upside down and we are in a critical spot M(27), F(23), M(1).

We had made a life decision to move in together and get a place to grow our happy little family. We live on a pretty tight budget and so we decided to ask a close friend to move in with us to help soften the blow of our $1050/mo rent. We struggled the last 5 months because of poor financial choices and live tightly paycheck to paycheck and that's our own fault. 

Fast forward 5 months, our roommate went on a stoned walk and decided to bring a flea ridden and diseased kitten near the brink of death into our home. She claimed to give it several flea bathes and nursed it back to health. Mind you she already has 3 cats and we had just recently adopted a rescue kitty who is restricted to our room due to cats being dicks. Anyways we had told her it couldn't stay and she needed to take it to a vet. She's a F(19) server who is sickeningly dramatic who also knows everything so she ignored our advice and polite request to remove the kitten from our house. Nearly a month later we are fighting off 3 story and dense flea infestation. We have bombed our entire house with foggers and are slowly washing all of our clothing. We have had to throw out most of our child's toys and animals because his room is insanely populated by them, a lot of our rugs and other things. 

Understandably we are frustrated and she has left us to fight off this infestation and take care of her cats because she is 'allergic' to foggers. We had to take out a pay-day loan to put a dent in the population and have been bathing the animals and using all methods to eliminate this horde. Our basement is a damn warzone, (I just bought Gears 5 and just want to play my damn game without being alive). Anyways she has decided she is moving out and found a place to live in the next 3 days. Her only contribution to the cause has been to buy the cats flea collars and she hasn't been home in 2 days.

We are currently trying to do a transfer within the complex so we can afford rent and sleep without being devoured. The complex is billing us for damages to the carpet and blinds from her cats, and for a cleaning. We have to pay $400 for the move, then $850 for rent on the 1st of next month, today is the 16th. We asked her to cover the cleaning cost and she  tried to hit us with well I offer you guys netflix and hulu, and wifi, etc. Anyways we have a child we are just trying to give a better life too and we are on the brink of being homeless and I'm about to sell my car just to make sure he has a roof over his head. (Also not my kid, his dad wanted him aborted) I'm so overload with stress that it's hard to even focus on what's right in front of me. 

The petty/vindictive person in me wants to sell her shit and let her cats out but my gf wants to just let karma take its course. Literally just want some advice on what to do so this child doesn't have to live out of a car.

They are currently biting/jumping off me as I type this.",18Sep2019,1
84,"whenever I get angry or frustrated over school work or life in general I normally feel best if I go to negative coping habits first (ex: eating a lot even though I’m not hungry, dwelling on the bad stuff) basically just until I get over it and then turn towards going for a run or gratitude journaling ,, is this okay?

85,"*This is very long so thank you in advance for reading. Forgive me for any typos or misjudgment on time periods. I’m very frustrated writing this.*

My husband and I moved into our first rental home in May with our now 18 month old. A close friend of mine (we were inseparable in high school and even lived together back then) was looking for a place to rent and we thought it would be the perfect arrangement to move her into our second bedroom as we still share a room with our daughter. We weren’t hurting for cash but it has been helpful. My husband decided to charge her $300 a month and said she could stay for as long as a year, we just wanted to help each other out. We thought she’d be a great roommate as I have always trusted her with money, she’s great with kids (5 nieces and nephews) and there’s no tension as far as another woman living with my husband. (I completely trust my husband but I wouldn’t move in any of my other female friends. She and I are very comfortable with each other and I’ve never worried about her around him, vice versa). 

The first month or so she was awesome. She helped me clean around the house even if it wasn’t her mess, she was very quiet when she came in late from work, even though it isn’t her responsibility she offered to watch my daughter so I could shower or make dinner, etc. She kept her space clean and orderly, she paid rent on time, and all around was just very considerate of my family and our space. Perfect roommate, you get the picture. 

So about a month and a half in she’s in a huge slump over hating her job, and decides to quit out of the blue. No two weeks notice, nothing, just decided not to show up for her next shift. She quit because it was a toxic work environment, I get it, but it’s an irresponsible thing to do when you’re living off of tips and renting. So that following month, she couldn’t pay all of her rent money, but my husband was very gracious with her. He asked her to pay $150 for the next two months but to do her best and be back to the $300 after that (if I’m not mistaken would have been this month). I will admit she worked her ass off trying to find a new job and she eventually did within about 3 weeks at another restaurant, but we really started to notice her behavior once she quit her old job. We admitted to each other this wasn’t working out with her.

My roommate quite enjoys drinking but I didn’t know how much until this point. She would drink every night after work with her coworkers, so that means her shift would end around 11 and she would come home drunk at 2am, stumbling into the door and fumbling with her keys, hence waking up our daughter. We also have a chain on our door above the locks for safety (we don’t live in the safest area) that we have to keep off in order for her to get in, so this was really irritating for us never knowing when she’d show up. We didn’t feel safe with the lock off all night long. So then she starts taking showers or doing laundry at the most inconvenient times, like late at night when we’re all trying to sleep or at nap time (we have two entrances to our bathroom which is right beside our bedroom so you can hear everything). I really got upset when I woke up to her talking to someone on speaker phone around midnight while she was in the bathroom. She started lacking on her part of cleaning the kitchen or bathroom (we rotated weekly) and now her room is constantly filthy with beer cans, fast food trash, even dirty feminine products thrown into a Walmart bag in the corner of the room. We recently had Terminix come to our home and I think the bugs that started to show up had a lot to do with her room. 

She comes from a family of junkies and is now trying to bring her fresh out a rehab sister into my home to “hangout”. She knows we don’t want anyone invited into our home unless we know them and the other day she called to ask if my husband was home because if not she wanted her sister to come over, as if I don’t agree with his rules and as if I would side step my own husband like that. I straight up told her no. 

I could list a few more reasons why we’re done having her as a roommate at this point but I think you guys get the picture. I have tried talking to her but the only thing she’s cut down on is drinking. She’s not even aware of how inconsiderate she can be. I don’t know if I’m over reacting but what I do know is that she has become this very negative, draining energy to be around. She’s constantly complaining about money, how shitty she feels mentally and physically, how much she hates her new job, etc. Even though it may not be fair of us to ask her to move as we told her she could stay for a year, I know that we just can’t deal with this anymore and we’re ready for a change.

I know she has other places to stay as not all her family are addicts, and she has other friends so we wouldn’t be putting her on the street. We’re thinking about giving her until December as we want our home to ourselves for the holidays. Is this too short of notice? Otherwise, I could offer her to stay longer as long as she is moved out by the time my daughter is two. Although then I would have to just deal with my frustration with her. What do you guys think? How should I approach her?",18Sep2019,2

90,"I’m a Freshman boy that’s in advanced Math, English, and Spanish classes. I’m also on the soccer team. I’m really good at it and I’m going to try to get into Varsity Soccer next year (Since Freshman can’t be in Varsity, only Junior Varsity). I have a lot of good friends that are also in sports like Football and Basketball. Most of them already have dates for Homecoming which is coming up in October (for those who don’t know, Homecoming is basically a prom that’s a bit more informal and all grades can attend).

The only problem is... I’m not attracted to girls. Which shouldn’t really be an issue but unfortunately a lot of people in this world see homosexuality as dirty and gross. One of those people is my soccer coach.

Don’t get me wrong, my soccer coach is a brilliant and well mannered man. He’s funny, nice, and usually inclusive. But anything LGBT is where he immediately draws the line. He never really says “I hate gays” or anything like that, but he *does* make little comments about it, like “don’t be a gay boy” when one of my teammates does a bad job. Along with the fact that a student on Varsity last year came out and immediately after that season he was never on Varsity again. 

My coach seems to believe that “gay boys” are prissies, which is not true. In fact, I’m very masculine. I’m nothing like the gay guys you see on TV. When people look at me for the first time, the thought of me being gay most likely never crosses their minds. Actually, I’d like to think that most people place me in the “Straight Jock” category with all of my other friends.

I would come out but I’m... afraid to admit that I’m scared. I truly am. I don’t want my soccer career to be ruined by some homophobic coach. The only reason I even get to participate in soccer is because I go to a public school that has scholarships if you can’t afford it. (My family isn’t that wealthy). There’s no way in hell I’d be able to continue playing soccer at a good college if I don’t have good reputation in high school.

Here’s my call for advice: Should I stay in the closet until I get into college? Should I come out and risk my dreams of being a professional soccer player? I really don’t know what I should do at this point...",18Sep2019,1

He's never once raised a hand to me. Apparently, someone gave him a drugged cigarette because they thought he was a snitch.

95,"I guess I was raised in a way that you're never supposed to complain and you're just supposed to take any and all criticism and not get offended by it, and maybe that's why I'm struggling now because I hate telling people my problems.

I live with my parents, and we were inviting a family friend over who we all really like. It's been a while since I've seen him so I was excited.

My father, who hasn't initiated a real conversation with me in years and hasn't even participated in small talk with me in the last 2 months, finally initiates a conversation with me.

He says : ""Hey, don't take this the wrong way, but you need to change your shirt.""

I'm taken aback by this, as I'm legitimately wearing a new, clean shirt. I smell myself and I don't smell anything. I know when I stink, and I showered earlier in the day in anticipation for the friend coming over. I tell him this, defensively.

He says: ""Just because you don't smell yourself, others can. You've been wearing the same shirt for three days.""

This is legitimately inaccurate. I have two pairs of dark blue shirts and two pairs of black shirts that look similar, so i think maybe that's what has caused the confusion.

I tell him this, then get defensive and tell him that he need to get a haircut as he's got patches on the side of his head from cutting it himself. He get;s mad but says he'll think about.

Feeling self-conscious I go and change shirts anyway, and spray myself down with deodorant, but I end up just leaving dinner early as I feel uncomfortable now.

I just feel like, even if you did smell something you should either a) keep it to yourself or b) not tell me loudly right before a dinner .

I also feel like, fuck you, your breath smells horrendous 90% of the time from chewing tobacco and your teeth are stained yellow, you're balding and handling it terribly, and you don't know how to cut hair, and I don't say shit to you because I care about your feelings.

97,"Me and my younger sister have a rocky relationship (we don't talk to each other at all). Whenever she does something and my mom sides with her (even when my sister was in the wrong), I go off to my room which I share with her and feel the need to wreck something of hers to relieve myself of the overwhelming anger.

Sadly, apparently I have less than spectacular judgement and while the teacher is away we have a substitute.

I grabbed one while we walked out of class and the substitute didn’t notice. 

Sadly I can’t say the same for half my class, of which I decided to raise it in the air and yell “The ultimate Heist” while shaking it. Normally that would not be a problem. Except my class is a bunch of dumb yuppies with a high chance of snitching.

Afterwards, I have debate club on mondays and tuesdays and I avoided questions by saying that I found them outside. (Retard mode activated) and for some reason that seemed like a probable possibility to me. So I gave them to everyone in hopes to destroy the evidence but they weren’t all eaten. And since my mother is a really worrisome person I couldn’t take them home. They weren’t all eaten so my teacher put them in the cabinet for the next meeting.

111,"So I recently moved into a house with a few other girls that are the same religion as me. The house is apart of our church and we have a few requirements living there such as attending church as often as we can and praying together. 

Now, I haven't been as involved in my religion and therefore don't know too many people at my church.  We are encouraged to reach out to others but lately its been very hard for me. 

I've introverted and don't always want to engage with everyone and half the time I choose to be engaging with my church's community, it just isn't worth it. I'm thrown aside, not included. 

I'm worried that I'm going to get talking to one of these days about how I'm not doing my job but when I've tried, it's resulted in moments that just tear me apart. 

It doesn't help that my sleep schedule is completely off so that I'm sleeping in till 2 pm every day. I figured that my roommates know that I'm terrible at going to bed but sometimes I just love staying up super late. But it's not a good habit and I've been cursed with it for years.

115,"Hello, I am an adult male who is an incel, and just to say, therapy is not an option for reasons I will now disclose. Anyways, I have been having a toxic mindset against women for maybe four months now. I try not to browse /r/braincels but I do almost daily because it feeds into my mindset of women being worthless creatures who don't appreciate anything, and are handed everything on a silver platter and don't have to work. I dislike myself mainly because of my height, I am very short and I think my self pity stems from that. I don't want to have these toxic mindsets but everywhere I look I see women who whine about the smallest things, and belittle others for something they can't control. How do I change my mindset?

121,"Alt account.

I go to a private Muslim school. I live in the US. This school is extremely strict. Extremely. For you to understand, here is part of their rule book: Disrespect to Staff, first time in home counseling, detention, and a parent teacher conference. Second time suspension, and Third time expulsion. Even if you do something as small as talking in class, 3 times, over the span of the full school year, they can expell you and you can't do anything about it. I'm in 9th grade now. Ive been going to this school most of my life with some exceptions. In 3rd grade I went to a public school near my house. I stayed for half the year, then my parents took me back to the private school. Then in 5th grade I went back to the public school. This private school costed alot of money and it was a 1 hour drive to go and to come back. So it was hard on them so they would prefer a public school except they're extremely hardcore Muslims. So  I went to this public school until 7th grade. I absolutely loved it, I made lots of friends who I always hung out with and I had never been happier in my life. After 1 month of 7th grade passed my parents put an end to all of it. They took me back to the private school. This school is not only 1 hour away, but everyone in it is hardcore Muslims (I'm an atheist). This school has 40 minutes of mandatory prayer every day, Islamic studies class 4 periods a week, and 4 periods a week of Quran Class. Having to waste all your time on this while pretending to also be Muslim (my parents don't know I'm not Muslim) was mentally exhausting. I couldn't take it so I was on my worst behavior so I could get expelled and my parents would take me to my old school. Well it worked, but not really.  I did get expelled, but my parents instead of taking me to my old school, took me to Muslim 3rd world country where my family is originally from. (I'm not gonna say which because of privacy). I was absolutely devastated. Not only did I have to learn in a completely different language, but I had also came in the middle of the year, and I absolutely hated the country and it's people. I made it through the school year but I was suicidal the whole time and cried every day and wish I was never born. Summer started and I had braces in the US and we had to go back for the summer so the orthodontist can check on them. We did and when summer ended they bought a plane ticket back to 3rd world country. But the day of our flight I locked myself in my room and no matter what they yelled or tried I would not budge. They couldn't do anything. So we stayed in America but they didn't put me in school. 5 months passed, all day I was at home doing nothing, and I didnt have a phone or a computer or any form of entertainment. One night I was so fed up and realized that not only has my whole life been shit to this point but my future is also gonna get fucked up so I called the cops and told them my parents weren't putting me in school. They came and forced my parents to put me in school. I went back to the same Muslim school and even though they expelled me my parents begged so much they agreed. Keeping up with school was the fucking hardest thing you can imagine. Last year I switched school 3 times and finished the year with a totally different curriculum in a different language. And this year (8th grade) I missed the first half of the year. I tried my hardest and believe it or not I finished the year with all A's and 2 B's. I was so proud of my self because not only was the studies hard but this school is super strict and I would constantly get in trouble but I pulled through. I thought this was the end I pushed myself to my limit and thought finally I could go to a normal school like any kid deserved. But no, this year started and I'm back in the private school, with stricter than ever rules, and worse than ever teachers. I really don't think I have the mental and physical ability to get myself through this year. And even if I do, what then. I can't go on like this  for another 3 years like my parents want. This is a hopeless situation and I'm sitting here crying after getting 3 hours of after school detention today for talking in class once and I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm just tired. I want it to end. I would really appreciate any advice.",18Sep2019,1
122,"     My boyfriend and I have been “officially” together for almost a year now, (we were romantically hanging out for months beforehand). We were together back in high school around 4 years ago and things didn’t work out. However, the universe had some mysterious way to bring us back together after all those years even though we now lived in different states. We both are so different and grown up now. I am now 20 and he is 22. It kinda made me believe in the saying “right person, wrong time”. 
     Every Friday he would drive to my apartment a state away just to spend the weekend with me, so I kinda got a little feel as to what it would be like living with him. He was good though; if one of us were feeling down and wanted to cancel plans, we would do it in a heartbeat and just have a comfy movie night with no complaints. I would cook dinner and he wouldn’t even let me touch the kitchen or dishes afterwards (his way of appreciating me cooking). He would do things without me even asking, like taking out the garbage or whatever. He picked up after himself and never cared if I needed just some alone time in my room. 
     Recently, we decided to start renting an apartment together and planning to move in on October 1st. I am not too worried but I also feel like I’m naive about this stuff because I’ve never lived with a s/o before. What are some things I should expect or ideas on how to live together functionally? We both have full time jobs and aren’t home really during the day too besides weekends we have off. Is this a bad idea or too soon?

124,"I started high school at the beginning of this month.
I left junior high with a 98 average. I absolutely loved all of my teachers and they seemed to like me. I could go through an entire day without having to talk. The hallways weren’t constantly crowded and I was comfortable (to an extent) around most people. 
Now it seems like everything has been flipped over. I hate talking, an social situation because I really suck as it. I don’t know what to say so I go on auto pilot and be an idiot. I have a group of friends but to be honest I don’t think they like me very much. I only joined them last year because everyone thought I was depressed so my sister dragged me into it (it’s her friend group). 

I also have to talk because I don’t know 99% of the people at my school as they came from the other school which had a lot more students. My teachers force everyone to try to socialize and I don’t want to seem mean or hurt anyone’s feelings by simply not talking as I would normally do. It’s horrible. I’m horrible. 

In science we have a group project of course, and I was put with literally the worst group. All the people I didn’t want to be put with, I was put with. We have to do a skit tomorrow in front of the class. We know what we’re doing (at least me and the girl who did the other half of the work do) but the others barely participate. We won’t get a 4 on the project because we had to get the teacher to tell us what to do (he was literally no help). That means that already my science mark had gone down. My science mark cannot go down. I *cannot* get below a 90, and already I’m probably gonna get a big fat 3 because of my worst nightmare - a group project. 

It’s not just science that’s probably dropping. I’m normally the top of my class in band. Band is my all time favourite subject. Now I’m in a big class (for me) with a bunch of kids that I don’t know. The teacher is really reluctant on the fact she thinks everyone knows exactly what she’s talking about and is perfectly ready to start playing what ever. Of course I keep messing up horribly and obnoxiously every time we do something simple. I know everyone in that class thinks I’m an idiot. I *know* it. The teacher does too. If my previous band teacher heard me playing, he’d be so disappointed in me. I’m
not supposed to be making such idiotic mistakes. No one else is, why do I have to be such an idiot? What do the kids in my band class that new me from last year think - there expectation for me is for me to be really good. What the hell am I doing? Why can’t I just think properly?

Sometimes people talk to me during class while the teacher is talking and I don’t want to make my teacher think I don’t pay attention but I don’t want to hurt others feelings by hushing them. My teachers probably think I’m one of those who talk to their friends and go on their phones during class all the time. 

I’m terrified (and I mean *terrified*) of raising my hand for anything. I tried once and I was shaking like crazy. I don’t want my marks to go down but I really really really can’t do anything that involves speaking or sharing my ideas and it’ll be that way for a little while.

 I have to get up to check my answers in math and sometimes put them on the board or share them with the kid next to me. The teacher keeps singling me out when checking our homework, asking if I need anything clarified (she doesn’t ask anyone else). I know the math perfectly but Texts are my only actual way of proving it, so my mark is probably gonna go down there as well.

Gym is just crazy, there’s 80 students in my class (3 classes combined) and you have to be social and physical in gym anyway (obviously). My friend group and I are together so I guess that makes it a little easier in terms of picking teams and stuff but still.

There’s so much kids in this school. Everyone probably hates me. They probably think I’m gross and ugly. I’m usually really good with teachers but I feel super distant with the ones I currently have. I hate that. My grades are likely dropping and I’m socially an absolute idiot. My reputation is going deeper and deeper into the grave. What am I supposed to do?

128,"For context, I live in a large, rented Victorian house share with three others, and for over a year, we've had a problem with mice. We hear them scuttling around in the walls and ceilings and see them now and again darting under fridges or doors. 

My friend and I like to sit in the kitchen/diner in the evenings, and for the last week, we've seen a cute, baby mouse crawling around under out fridges and around the skirting boards.

Months ago, my landlord decided to buy cardboard glue traps and place them around the kitchen floors to try and catch any mice. However, they've been ineffective up until yesterday.

I entered the kitchen for breakfast and immediately, my stomach dropped when I saw a tail hanging out of one of the traps. Upon closer inspection, I realised that it was the baby mouse we'd been watching. Its whole underside was pinned to the thick glue and I thought it was dead. It wasn't moving at all, except I could see its tiny body breathing by using a torch. 

I love animals and didn't know what to do. I hate to see anything suffer. I no longer wanted breakfast, and went back to my room to browse Reddit/Google for advice. I ended up reading for over an hour about what to do, with the overwhelming result coming back as ""put it out of its misery"" with some saying you can free them with oil and release them outside if you take them miles away from their habitat to stop them returning. 

That didn't seem very plausible as I don't drive, and the mouse didn't look to be in a very good way and probably wouldn't survive being put in a strange environment with loads of natural predators/lack of food, so I decided I would reluctantly kill it as I'd left it to suffer for long enough already.

I wrapped the trap up in several carrier bags and took it out onto the balcony. We have a paving slab we use to prop the door open so I hit the bag hard with that several times and disposed of it alongside all of the other glue traps in the house. I will not allow my landlord to use them again after this experience. I have messaged him asking for more humane traps as I now see how awful glue traps are.

I have felt sick and guilty ever since, and didn't eat at all yesterday. My housemate got home that evening and said she would've tried to release it and wouldn't have ""instantly thought to kill it"" like I apparently had... She then suggested that the point of those types of traps is to release the mouse when it's caught, but that's not what I've read at all.

Do you think I did the right thing? I hated doing it but felt it was the right thing to do at the time to end the animal's suffering, but I am now questioning myself. Should I have tried to release it with oil and maybe get a bus somewhere to set it free? 

TLDR: Landlord placed inhumane glue traps around our house to catch mice. I found a live mouse in one and regretfully killed it with a slab. I don't know if I did the right thing...",18Sep2019,2

Since then it seems like I've had a pre-existing body image problem get worse. I will have different feelings about the way I look which will change at the flip of a coin and it typically goes from ""wow I'm super cute in this snap what a hot bitch"" or something along those lines to ""what a pig guess who's not eating for the next 2 days"" I occasionally do follow through on that in an unintentional way because I feel like occasionally when I feel like that food just is really not appealing to me at all when I try and eat. But I don't know the thoughts can be so pervasive it just kind of weighs on me until it flips back to something more affirmative. 

As well as this, I feel like constant anxiety if I'm around anyone at all thinking about what negative things they're thinking about me.

133,"Okay, so I'll start off. My brother is a 22-year old, 5'10"", 250 pound male with autism. He's also a bully, and he will physically hurt any one of us in order to get his way. He's put my mom in the hospital multiple times, I've had to empty half a can of pepper spray in his eyeballs, and my dad has had to beat him senseless, multiple times, in order to stop my brother from killing my entire family. I always have a weapon on my person in order to feel safe, and I struggle with suicidal ideations/severe anxiety and depression/PTSD (hypervigilance, hearing voices, boosted senses, etc.)/insomnia/psychosomatic bladder and bowel issues/severe anger issues. Today, I headbutted a solid, wooden door and it cracked. I wore down all of the knuckles on my right hand and I can't make a fist or grab stuff because I beat up brick walls for years. Currently, I'm on 20 mg Lexapro, and that helps me, but feeling like a robot also sucks (even though it enables me to view my situation from an objective, rather than a subjective, standpoint). 

My mother is abusive, severely depressed, bipolar, narcissistic, and has multiple personalities. She refuses to seek help for her conditions and denies their existence, and as a result I am her punching bag. She broke me down until I was nothing, and then spit on the ashes. She switches moods every 5 minutes, acting like a normal human being and loving parent/then acting like a witch. She used to be able to draw me in, make me vulnerable, and then destroy me. I liken her relentless treatment to a fisherman giving the line some slack, and then reeling in his prey once the fish thinks it is safe to swim around and loosen his guard. I could get into details, but I'll leave it at threats, control, and name-calling, along with cutting insults and severe beration on an hourly basis. 24/7. 

I would like to detail a particularly horrible instance in which she showed me her true colors - I was 13. My mother had argued with me about something entirely insignificant, and sent me up to my room. About 5 minutes after I was in my bed, I heard a long scream coming from my mom. It reeked of pure terror, and was simply ""Nooooooooooooo!"" I could hear her desperation and helplessness, so I went downstairs, not knowing what to expect. I locate her on our back porch, looking like a chemotherapy patient. Half of her hair was ripped out of her head, she was crying, and my brother was on top of her, choking her, ripping her hair out, and beating her ass. I could do nothing but watch. I called 911, and by that time it was too late anyway - the dog had intervened and saved her life. Ever since that day, she has blamed me for the attack and she likes the dog more than she likes me because he saved her life, and I could do nothing. If it had happened today, I would have gotten my bat and beaten him to death, which is what I should have done back then. 

My father...this is where it gets complicated. To make a long story short, he has a long history of physical abuse with me. He's also plagued with severe anger issues. He's kicked me in the groin, beaten me, slapped me, threw me at the wall, and pushed me into a glass window. He's also cornered me in the shower and broke the tiled wall next to my head. I was also 13 when this happened, and I was completely naked and helpless. My mom spurred him to do these things by telling him lies when he was already exhausted and angry, and he flipped out on me. So, for a while, she broke our relationship. There were periods where we wouldn't talk for months on end. However, this all happened when I was younger. Now, my dad is suddenly my biggest ally, and I haven't got the heart to tell him to acknowledge what he did, because I don't want to ruin what little good I have in my family. He's been nothing but kind to me since he realized how insane my mother was, and I don't know whether or not I can ever trust him. I fake trust, but it's torturous to do so. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Anyway, how the fuck do I make heads or tails of this? I'm moving out on Sunday, against my mom's wishes and with the full support of my dad (he helped me find a room, and he's paying for it). I have a beautiful (both inside and out) girlfriend who I love dearly, and without her I would be reduced to nothing. I have two very close friends who I also love dearly, and I'm looking to find my own inner peace about my family just to have some closure. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Are you good at your job? She will fabricate something to other managers about a few things you are terrible at, and the next thing you know you're being dressed down by another manager who has no evidence to back up their claims.

Complain about a rude colleague? She will claim that colleague has complained about you when in fact they haven't. It is about this last pattern I have a question about.

She loves to take people into her office and claim ""many people are complaining about you"". Store policy is apparently not to name who complained and about what. So you will believe her, racking your brain about who you may have offended.

Except I long suspected it was complete horseshit. Earlier this year I got pulled aside for doing something I never did. I've taken everything these bozos say with a grain of salt ever since.

Today when I was pulled in I hit the record button on my phone so I could record my manager telling me once again everyone is complaining about me. I pressed for names. She gave three from the past few weeks.

I asked one of the three. She said it was a lie, and that this same manager has made the same accusation towards her in the past, and that she never believed it to be true.

I asked the second person of the three. He also said he never complained about me. I have a recording of this person saying he never complained about me too.

I have several options. I can go to corporate HR, which tends to side with management. 

Apparently the store manager wants to have a meeting with me about something else. (Who knows.) I can wait till we have that meeting.

Or I can email the store manager now to let him know what happened today. I doubt I'm getting fired, but if I am, it may be good to email the store manager first especially if it's because of this manager.

I will only disclose I have the recordings if the manager denies she ever said it. I want her to deny and deny and put her in a corner first.

137,"Obligatory throwaway. TLDR at bottom.

First some context:

I'm a 21 year old university student. My current dorm room I shared last year with a chill roommate but he moved out and I'm back this term. I share a bathroom with the RA who is a new person. My first day in the room I had a roommate who had already been there a few days as he is an athlete with early check in privileges. I never actually met that dude because after dropping my stuff off in the room on check in day I left for awhile and he moved out to somewhere else.

Later that day, a new guy, we will call him Tom, moved in. Tom is a big dude and kinda scary. Tom asked me after I had setup my things if I wanted to move to another room with someone else. He even offered to pay me $200 for this request. I said no because I didn't want to move my stuff and it was too much to deal with it. I didn't learn until later that, Tom wanted me to move out so he could be with a friend who has a health condition that somehow requires his constant attention. 

For the next few days, Tom came in and out of the room at odd times. Leaving dirty laundry and other clutter everywhere to sit and stink.  He only actually stayed over night once and the next day he asked me again to change rooms. I say no again because I've grown comfortable where I'm at and it was the middle of the school week. That night, he says he is moving out to live in someone's basement and takes his things.

Fast forward about 2 weeks. Tom comes back. Turns out he never even checked out of the room. He says he lost his key and that he's actually leaving for good but that I'm getting a new new roommate. Some other dudes filter into my dorm and drop stuff off until I finally meet Adam, 19, who apparently was the roommate Tom's friend had. Adam accepted Tom's offer for $200 cash after Tom kept asking. However, because Tom ""lost"" his key, Adam wouldn't get one until a replacement was made. The housing department also was gonna take a while processing the whole thing.

So because Adam couldn't get in the room on his own, he asked me all sorts of questions about his schedule vs mine so that I could be in the room to let him inside when he needed it. That said the schedules have a lot of conflicts to make this possible. But since it was a weekend there weren't many problems. At this point though I am pretty annoyed at the whole thing.

And finally last night... Adam comes back to the room late and I'm ready to go to sleep. However, he asks to turn the big overhead light on for an hour to work on a paper. I had set up christmas lights around the entire room because the light was too bright even in the daytime and I never liked having it turned on. So, I groan about it but he does it anyway. I told him there were spaces in the dorm he could work without bothering anyone and that the RA could let him back in the room until midnight. He ignores this and starts working at about 10:30 - 11pm and doesnt stop until after 1am. I pretty much just tried to keep the light off my eyes and sleep despite the noise he was making.  

Finally, I ask him when he is gonna stop and he makes it a big deal out of it. He said he isn't bothering me at all and he needed to finish his essay tonight because he had to turn it in in the morning. He also couldn't use the book he needed until he got it off his friend. I got pretty mad and yelled at him. He then got mad that I was using swear words (before this I hadn't said many around him but I don't think f bombs should make someone that mad and they just slip when I'm upset). I said swear words were common in the real world but then I also let slip how he needs to stop asking me for things like babysitting the dorm door for him. Then he got madder and said it isn't his fault he can't get a key. I told him he shouldn't have accepted Tom's offer if he knew about it and that I wasn't responsible for him. Then he got mad but quiet and eventually went to sleep.

After that it took me awhile to get tired enough to rest and he started heavily snoring pretty quickly. Needless to say, I didn't get much sleep. Then he woke up around 6-6:30 and spent an hour doing his usual routine of pacing the room, slamming doors/drawers/his other boxes of crap, and showering. Finally, I ask him to keep it down because I can't stand the noise. He says it shouldn't be bothering me and I start arguing with him again. Again, he's upset about the swearing and says things like ""You're 21, you're older than me, you shouldn't talk to me like that. Where I come from we don't speak like that."" I reply by calling him a B***** A** P**** and he flips out. He grabs my shirt and pulls me, while I'm still in bed, towards his face. Then he starts to yell never to call him that. I go No. NO. NO. NO. And jump out of bed. Then I run through the bathroom and knock on the RA's door. He comes out and sees my scared face and helps me unpack the situation to him before calling Adam to speak. After some mediation we calm down and the RA says this might just be a warning for Adam but there's a strict no violence policy. We sort of apologize to each other and then Adam wants to speak alone to me before he has to leave for class. I say okay and we eventually shake hands. Then he asks me not to escalate it any further with anyone else so that neither of us gets punished. Then he says I should be thankful that it wasn't any worse. To that I lose it and practically shout ""ARE YOU THREATENING ME?"" and he says no he didn't mean it. Because of that, I told him that I was going to file an incident report and talk with the housing department. And I also said that I wasn't concerned about any trouble but he should be. 

After that he left and I filed an incident report to security online. Then I went and spoke to the housing office directly. They took my story and said they'd help me find a new assignment. I got an email from them a bit later about an opening in a nearby room with a different roommate. I sent a reply explaining that I felt dissatisfied with the idea that I had to move out and that he should be the one to move. They replied that my options are to mediate the situation or move out. I replied and said that I wish to mediate the situation and now we are having that meeting tomorrow night.

So reddit what should I do? I know I messed up with what I said, but I've been sleep-deprived and stressed out. Now I don't feel safe on top of that. I really don't want to stay in the same room with Adam anymore but I also feel that he is not really receiving any punishment for getting physical if I have to move out. 

Apologies for the formatting, I am staying with family for the night and am on mobile.

TLDR; Roommate took cash to swap dorm rooms into mine, keeps me up all night and then assaults me after I call him B**** A** P*****. After apologizing, threatened me again. Uni wants me to move or else concede my well being to stay with him.",18Sep2019,0
138,"Hello Reddit,

I could need some advice as I can't really decide.

Having money was always **the problem** for me and finding work that I can do just with a laptop was not very successful so far. I don't have any apartment and live just by traveling in hostels etc in Asia ( sick of my country and all that consumerism, whatever)

Now I could work as a chat moderator but hesitate because of various reasons.

As I see it most of the chats are from dating websites and therefore mostly sexting.
I am male and have to jump in a ""fake profile"" to answer messages.

The payment is good and as I travel all the time it would be a great income.

But I am in a relationship currently ( although she would not really mind if I do it).
SO also pointed out its some form of prostitution.
People pay money to talk to woman on these websites, not with some dudes that pretend to be  female, which doesn't feel right from a moral point of view.

D constantly makes sex jokes about my mom around me and my sister. Which is also uncomfortable and strange. 

But tonight at he did it again, saying, “you have nice curves” to my sister. This kinda stopped the energy in the room for a second and me and my sister exchanged a couple glances of like “what the fuck”

153,"Alt account.

I go to a private Muslim school. I live in the US. This school is extremely strict. Extremely. For you to understand, here is part of their rule book: Disrespect to Staff, first time in home counseling, detention, and a parent teacher conference. Second time suspension, and Third time expulsion. Even if you do something as small as talking in class, 3 times, over the span of the full school year, they can expell you and you can't do anything about it. I'm in 9th grade now. Ive been going to this school most of my life with some exceptions. In 3rd grade I went to a public school near my house. I stayed for half the year, then my parents took me back to the private school. Then in 5th grade I went back to the public school. This private school costed alot of money and it was a 1 hour drive to go and to come back. So it was hard on them so they would prefer a public school except they're extremely hardcore Muslims. So  I went to this public school until 7th grade. I absolutely loved it, I made lots of friends who I always hung out with and I had never been happier in my life. After 1 month of 7th grade passed my parents put an end to all of it. They took me back to the private school. This school is not only 1 hour away, but everyone in it is hardcore Muslims (I'm an atheist). This school has 40 minutes of mandatory prayer every day, Islamic studies class 4 periods a week, and 4 periods a week of Quran Class. Having to waste all your time on this while pretending to also be Muslim (my parents don't know I'm not Muslim) was mentally exhausting. I couldn't take it so I was on my worst behavior so I could get expelled and my parents would take me to my old school. Well it worked, but not really.  I did get expelled, but my parents instead of taking me to my old school, took me to Muslim 3rd world country where my family is originally from. (I'm not gonna say which because of privacy). I was absolutely devastated. Not only did I have to learn in a completely different language, but I had also came in the middle of the year, and I absolutely hated the country and it's people. I made it through the school year but I was suicidal the whole time and cried every day and wish I was never born. Summer started and I had braces in the US and we had to go back for the summer so the orthodontist can check on them. We did and when summer ended they bought a plane ticket back to 3rd world country. But the day of our flight I locked myself in my room and no matter what they yelled or tried I would not budge. They couldn't do anything. So we stayed in America but they didn't put me in school. 5 months passed, all day I was at home doing nothing, and I didnt have a phone or a computer or any form of entertainment. One night I was so fed up and realized that not only has my whole life been shit to this point but my future is also gonna get fucked up so I called the cops and told them my parents weren't putting me in school. They came and forced my parents to put me in school. I went back to the same Muslim school and even though they expelled me my parents begged so much they agreed. Keeping up with school was the fucking hardest thing you can imagine. Last year I switched school 3 times and finished the year with a totally different curriculum in a different language. And this year (8th grade) I missed the first half of the year. I tried my hardest and believe it or not I finished the year with all A's and 2 B's. I was so proud of my self because not only was the studies hard but this school is super strict and I would constantly get in trouble but I pulled through. I thought this was the end I pushed myself to my limit and thought finally I could go to a normal school like any kid deserved. But no, this year started and I'm back in the private school, with stricter than ever rules, and worse than ever teachers. I really don't think I have the mental and physical ability to get myself through this year. And even if I do, what then. I can't go on like this  for another 3 years like my parents want. This is a hopeless situation and I'm sitting here crying after getting 3 hours of after school detention today for talking in class once and I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm just tired. I want it to end. I would really appreciate any advice.",18Sep2019,2

160,"Sorry if this gets long, I'm just fed up with how this has all panned out. My sister developed epilepsy almost 8 years ago. She started on medicine that gave her extreme anxiety and because of that and a few other factors(shitty teachers, school coming at my family for truency) my sister started an online homeschooling program. Shes 19 now and ever since she left school she has never had a social life, never got past the 8th grade education level, no friends at all, and never had a job. She has no clue how the outside world is or how it works. 

She is completely blind to social ques. I guess the title is just one example of that and it sums everything up about my sister. We will be watching a very serious movie, maybe something about the holocaust(think schindlers list gravity of seriousness) and she will obnoxiously laugh out loud because of a face one of the actors made, even though we are in the middle of a sad scene. 

We are middle lower class. My dad works his ass off so we can live comfortably but my mom has always worked part time jobs to help my sister when she would be sick or have a bad seizure. But that just ended up as my mom bowing down to every one of my sisters needs. My mom doesn't know the word no. She washes my sister's hair for her, will sit in the bathroom with her while she shaves her legs bc my sis wants someone to talk to. My sister constantly gets treats like McDonald's anytime she asks or when someone has to run to town for an errand they have to bring her something back while I'm scrounging by on pop tarts and tuna sandwiches in between my classes and work. It's not only that my mom coddles her but my sister takes advantage of the situation and milks it all she can. 

Now before I finish this I just want to say my sister is a very sweet girl. My mom is the most loving person(as you can see sometimes to an obsessive degree) and my dad has been the best father we could ask for. But anytime I bring up a problem it's my sister yelling at me ""I dont need to hear it from you"" or my mom says she doesn't want to see us fighting and cries.

161,"For the last 9-10 years I’ve been playing recreational soccer. Last year I joined a select soccer team for the first time. This team pushed me to my limit physically and mentally. I have scars on my side from that season. The coach was strict at times but ended up being a guy that I looked up to in the end. Winter training was rough and I was always comparing myself to the other members of the team. The ones who weren’t rookies, who had been on select teams for multiple years. I felt out of place and unwelcome on more than one occasion. The only place I felt welcome and full of pride was with a different coach I was with for goalkeeper sessions. He kept me motivated and determined. He knew who I was and my limits and my problems with confidence on and off the field.

When the season ended I was ultimately relieved. However a month later I learned that the team was being disbanded and we’d be moved to a new team if we made tryouts.

Come tryouts, I ended up doing well and was asked to play on an even more prestigious select team. One with so much opportunity available to me. I could make my name known to people higher up if I did well. The coach is a younger guy who seems very nice and a lot less strict and demanding than my last one. I know no one on the team except for one guy from my last year. I’ll also never see that great goalkeeper coach again, although I do have a means of contacting him. 

This all sounds amazing and all, like a dream almost. But I’m starting to think I’m burnt out. There’s been so many years of the same sport, the same thing, loss, win, tie, disappointment, stress, and anger. I don’t know if I can do it again. I joined marching band this summer. It was something new and it was amazing. The people are great and I don’t feel like I need to compare myself to people as much as I do in soccer. This activity made me start to think and consider my choice.

To finally get to the point, I want advice on whether or not I should join the team. I still have time to change my mind, although saying no after already accepting around three months earlier would screw up the team badly possibly. Joining the team would be more work on top of school work and other activities I may do. It will be more work than it was last year, as it’s higher level. I don’t know if I can keep up with everyone though. I’ve never been great at the sport and I personally believe I’ve gotten lucky making it this far. If I join I feel like I’d crack under pressure fast. Joining would screw me up bad emotionally. Any mistake would be taken so critically.

I think I’ve gotten far enough in my time of soccer and that it’s time to hang up my gloves (I’m a goalkeeper).  My dad however thinks I should give this season a chance and not pass up the opportunity. Thinking about the season though immediately fills me with dread, but quitting also makes me think that I’d be letting so many people down and passing up a valuable chance. I understand that this post is nowhere near as meaningful as others. It’s a small problem compared to what other people have. I’d post it in a more suiting community if I knew of one. If anyone reads all of this then please offer some advice, whether it be a related experience, thoughts, or anything. This issue is weighing on me hard and is getting in my head. Thank you everyone in advance.",18Sep2019,1
162,"Ok, from the top. My girlfriend of over a year has started a new job this past month, she's spoken about a few people she works with, but at first spoke about this one guy quite a lot, I was a bit suspect but thought nothing of it.

I've had a look, taken pictures of these texts and it's this guy she spoke so fondly of. They're hardcore flirting, making suggestive comments and all that. I've taken photos of everything so far. She was moving out so we could have a bit more personal space so this is where I need advice.

My main plan at the moment is to take most of her stuff to her house, drop her off and act like everything is ok, then just before I leave, let her know I've seen these messages and end the relationship there and then. Is there any more effective ways I can make her realize ""sh*t, games up""?

Thanks!",18Sep2019,2
163,"okay, so i don’t have like a perfect movie family but I never really thought of my family as toxic until now.

we were eating dinner (first time in 2 years together)
and I keep trying to talk but everybody talks over me like always. the one time i talked over any of them I got screamed at for being disrespectful.

they say just because they do things to me doesn’t mean I can do it to them because they’re adults.

im 15f, sister is 26f. so after half an hour of this I’m feeling really sucky because nobody cares and my mom’s talking about how she dislikes my grades (all Bs with a C) w/ a weighted gpa of 3.5

i say yeah I’m gonna talk to my guidance counselor about switching me out of math since my math teacher and I aren’t doing so well.

i say I’m gonna tell the guidance counselor everything and my mother freaks out and says don’t tell her about you know what. I know she’s talking about my dad beating me up but I play dumb (this is the only time he has, he did to my sister too but stopped when she was 11ish so when I was born. mom says to forgive him)
and so I ask what do you mean? the time dad beat my ass because Lucy (my sister) got mad that I sucked helium out of her balloon and told on me and screamed about me so much my dad kicked her out and said we’re both on his nerves and then came upstairs and went worldstar on my ass?

and they’re all FUMING that I’m speaking about this. I love my mother but fuck me she’s a prick about stuff like this. a lot of yelling ensues and I stand up and call my mother brainwashed, my dad a cunt, and my sister a prissy bitch (she told me I deserve everything he does to me, he’s emotionally and verbally abusive and has been since I was 8ish).

i tell my dad that he’s a freak who should’ve gotten divorced when they were talking about it for so long (he didn’t know I knew), who hid my mother’s medical textbooks so she would fail an interview (again didn’t know I saw him, he didn’t let her work when we moved here so now there’s a big gap in her resumé), and I told him the only way I’ll believe in god like he wants me to is if he croaks on the floor (in reference to the times he’s told me to keep laughing until I die whenever I would laugh at his threats to hit me).

i told my mom I love her but i don’t even know who she is anymore and either does she. I told her she thinks she’s in love because this is the only relationship she’s ever had. I told my sister she inherited the anger issues from my father and is so in need of somebody to bully like he did to her and that I’m the perfect target (she’s hit me before too when I was 12 and her 23 because I gave her the wrong flavor lemonade and she said I did it on purpose bc she doesn’t like pink lemonade). i said she’s a hypocrite, that she’s a spoiled rotten bitch for telling me I’m selfish when I attempted to... u know what I attempted.

168,"I'm a 30 year old straight woman who has already given up on romantic relationships.


Some may say it is too early to throw in the towel, but I think I have more than enough evidence and feedback to support the belief that most guys are not interested in me. I knew back when I was 17 yrs old and still my experience is the same.


I live in a major city and was last approached 5 yrs ago. I can count on both hands how many guys have liked me over the past 10 yrs. More often than not, most guys will point out some flaw(s) I have that supports why they aren't interested - Whether it is a physical attribute (ie too thin) or personality trait (ie too quiet). Being rejected (I have several times) is what I have come to expect and being ignored is the norm. 


I understand everyone has preferences, so I am not complaining. But I am not interested in changing how I look or behave in order to have someone love me. Especially since a) I already love who I am and b) these defects others see are not so in my eyes.


Sure, I received compliments from others who state these great things about me (smart, sweet, etc) but..there is always some but that makes me so not worthy of a partner.


However I can't help to feel, once in a while, pretty down knowing the reality of my situation. Especially if I'm socializing with others and they are sharing their wonderful moments with their partners and spouses. It's not envy or jealousy, but a reminder of being unwanted.


And if I dare share my lack of dating experience with anyone who knows me personally, they'd a) invalidate it all and not believe me or b) look at me even more as a ""weirdo"". Because ""it doesn't make sense for a nice looking intelligent woman like myself to not garner any male attention"" (their paraphrased words not mine).


I just don't want all of this to have a negative impact on my self confidence and self esteem. Tips and advice are welcome!",18Sep2019,3

We hit it off pretty fast, and about a month into talking I hung out with her at her lake house for 3 days and we ended up having sex. I asked her out there. She started doing kind of weird things, like posting lots of pictures of me on her vsco, and telling me how funny it would be if she made sex jokes about me to some of my friends but I just brushed it off. A couple days later, I noticed that she posted a picture of me sleeping on her vsco, and a screenshot of some text of me saying that the day before ""was awesome"" with a heart. That kind of freaked me out but again I just kept going. In a couple more days some of my friends started telling me how she was texting them after we had sex and would say weird shit like ""guess who just got dicked down"" or she sent one of my friends who she had never met a picture of her birth control and said "" my mom thinks I'm a whore."" At this point I pretty much just freaked out and broke up with her over text, and I talked to her the next day and just explained that I had lost feelings.

I am college student living In a dorm. I have my windows open at night because the dorm rooms heat up. All of this is context.

I’m preparing to sleep when I hear my dorm neighbor arguing with his gf. It didn’t seem serious or anything. After awhile his girlfriend starts saying “no, don’t touch me” and “NO”. This goes of for a few minutes. (I thought they where playing video games or something) 

Then she starts yelling “help” out the window. This is when I started to worry. I wasn’t sure what to do. When she was yelling “help” it didn’t sound like she was screaming help, just saying it loudly out the window. 

I was about to let an RA know about the situation or call security but then my neighbors door opened up. I couldn’t tell what was happening but it seemed like the gf was deciding to leave. I went back into my room because I thought everything was good.

Then I heard the gf go into his room and (I assume) started knocking his stuff over while my neighbor is laughing saying,”what are you doing?” Them the door opens and the gf leaves.

My question: is this something serious or just a fight/argument and should I report this to someone. I don’t be the whole story, just what I heard.

182,"Guys here is my Bio -

85 to 90% in High school. Had science, maths and economics as majors, no extracurriculars.

Applied for marine engineering and cleared but family didn't like the idea of me spending months on the sea so told me not to go with it. I was gullible at the point so agreed and entered some mediocre college in the area with CS major cuz liked computer games.

Naturally didn't do very well in CS due to unrealistic 
expectations and barely scraped through with 2.7 GPA. 

Didn't apply for a job after graduation for the fear of rejection and became a NEET for an entire year. 

After a year somehow forced myself to do something with life and started learning programming for real. Also managed to secure an average job on first attempt (low paying but a decent job nonetheless) 

Now I have been in here for 3 months and find myself having way too much free time. I decided to improve my programming skills further and am now looking to go from python to flask/django (make a few web based projects), then onto machine learning if possible. 

I recently saw one of my classmates from high school had entered University of California Los Angeles and I thought maybe I can apply there too after a 2-3 years. But then realization came and I see my profile, it's not even average. Should I even bother thinking about applying for masters in a prestigious college?

183,"I'm a F in Senior year of HS. Ignore my spelling mistakes I'm on mobile. 

So my Dean of Students is my old English teacher who HATES me. I had him in Freshmen year and I constantly avoided trouble because there were either loopholes or I talked my way out with the principal. I managed to become friends with the Dean at the time as well so I always never got in trouble. Anyway, in my Junior year, he became the new Dean. He started targeting me for anything. After getting a few detentions for things I didn't do or weren't actual rules, my dad told me to get a bunch of teachera to sign forms saying I didn't do one thing or another. This year is completely different though.... At the end of the year there's this trip where you fly out to Cali for 2 weeks. In this time we go to an island that's nicknamed C.I.M.I. We go to C.I.M.I for 1 week, have a break day where the students and teachers wait at the rented house or do whatever they want and stuff. After that they go to Disney for 3 days and then head back. This trip is the best and the HS isn't big. Maybe 1000 kids for the wholw thing (mostly Freshmen). A suspension or getting a grade below a C for semester can get you kicked off the trip. My Dean is trying to give me a suspension for the worst reason.

So in class today we were taking a test and I was tapping my pencil. My teacher said I was distracting everyone and to stop. I stopped and said sorry. My friend said racist in the back. The teacher thought I said it and called the Dean to tell him about what I 'said'. When I got called to his office I was explaining ghat it wasn't me. He said that normally it would just be a Saturday detention, but since I already had one this year (I had ripped jeans) that I need something more severe. When I started crying (I heard the trip was the funnest thing the whole year and I already made my $500 deposit.) So I walked out after he said he'll discuss it further. I went to my friend and told her what was happening and she's never gotten in trouble and told me that she'll go up. She did and I had ro leave for the day so I left and she told me that they MIGHT still have me be suspended. She said that they'll talk to me tmr. What should I do?

Obviously I said I would do the right thing and be a dad, and we did love each other. So anyways, fast forward a year ago and we got to the point where I didnt even wanna be home anymore because we would fight and couldn't get along and we didnt know how to communicate. But the brand problem was I didnt know how to open up and actually talk I just bottled everything up and pushed it all away. We talked about breaking up often but wanted to make it work for our son. She went for counseling and begged me to go talk to someone too and I thought it was stupid. So we end up calling a quits before it got too ugly and hated each other, about 6 months ago I finally started realizing my ""shitty days"" were everyday and I was always mad and couldn't get past. So I finally went and talked to someone and she helped me realize quite a bit of stuff about myself so I have went every other week to learn how to talk and communicate and talk about my feelings. And since my ex and I ended things we have became the best co-parents and we have became closer than ever before. We do family stuff, have the best times, we can sit down and talk for hours. So I worked up the courage to ask her on a date and see if something could still be there. She shot it down really hard saying how she doesnt trust me anymore and to top if off she is dating someone now. And I tried to take it in but that was the nail in the coffin for me and i fully admitted i needed help and that there was more to my problems than I thought. I completely broke down and went to the doctor and he diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety, immediately put me on antidepressants and put me on short term disability because of my mental health so I can try get back together. I've started seeing a therapist and I'm happy I'm starting on the right path and can talk and communicate, but now I'm looking back and realizing I was a fucking piece of shit to her and didnt treat her good at all and I pushed her away when all she did was love me and actually want to help me. So that's killing me that I couldn't realize all that way back then. But now its completely too late, I've had and lost my chances and now some other guy is living the life I want. And I mean at the end of the day she says shes insanely happy with him and she thinks this could actually be the real deal with him, that should be good enough for me because I do want her to be happy. But I just cant move on past this, or her, and since I've started opening up to her more and talking to her shes been really cold towards me and its pushing her away a LOT. I'm trying to give her space and leave her alone because shes just trying to be happy with her new life, and I know I cant keep expecting her to be there for me like she always still has been but it's so hard. I drive myself crazy every single night knowing hes in her bed and I'm not.

190,"Let me start off by saying that I over think and worry about everything. It’s something I’m working on but this all definitely stems from that.

This year I transferred to the college I’ve always wanted to go to. It’s a huge party school which is a massive change from the High school I went to which was incredibly small. There was really never any parties at my High School and no girls I really had an Interest in and because of this, I never really have been in a relationship. Playing off of this, the most I’ve ever done with a girl is kiss, and even that was short. But, I have always wanted to be in a relationship. 

Skip forward to now, I have zero experience talking to girls that I actually like. Part of it is that I could never see a girl liking me or wanting to be in a relationship with me. I think this even though I have been told that I am attractive, but in my head, I have a list of reasons why I’m not, and the fact that I’ve never been in a relationship enforces that thought even more.

Now to the main point. I’m at a huge University, which means I’m basically always around sex. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s killing me. Everyone I know has had sex but me, and because I’ve never done anything with a girl, I feel like a never will. I also have the fear that I won’t be up to their standards or that I’ll be the worst they have ever had. I couldn’t even imagine having someone else see me naked, let alone do anything intimate. But this doesn’t even matter if I can’t talk to women. Going out to bars and parties, I have no idea how to take it to the next step with a girl I find attractive or even initiate any physical connection with them.

I thought that all of this would change once I got to a big school, but I’ve now realized that it won’t happen unless I do something about it. 

I feel like a loser typing all this out, but I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s taking over my life, this is all I think about. Does anyone have any advice that could help?",18Sep2019,1

195,"So, I need some advice. I need to move out of my family home. My mother is narcissistic and is experiencing a break up with her partner. If I was to move in with her in the new place I would be paying rent, but I wouldn’t be getting any more freedom as she’s crazy strict and also goes through my room a lot. I have the option to move into my fathers, but I lived there when I was younger and had many terrible things happen to me which has led to severe ptsd so I’m worried I will spiral living there. I am a first year apprentice so there’s no way I could afford to live on my own, and I don’t think I could live with randoms. The opportunity has come up for me to move in with my very close friend and 1 year old (my god daughter) but with her comes another single mother with a four year old who can be a bit of a temper tantrum (the both of them) but they would get the room furthest away so I can actually sleep as neither of them have jobs and I work 7.30-4. 
What on earth should I do? My mother is making me feel guilty, I feel like I need to get out but I don’t know if it’s the right decision. I’m so torn between everything my brain keeps jumping everywhere. Should I just move and get my rental history up and save until I get enough to move out on my own? Or do I stay with my mother?

198,"For a while, I thought my (22F) and my dad's (65M) relationship was going well, but, well, now I'm in my room crying so hard I think I might vomit.

Lately, it feels like my dad loses total respect for me whenever I do something even remotely wrong and uses me as a way to vent his frustrations about the world. As of tonight (when he blew up at me when I said I needed to pee, right as I was starting to help him put away dishes), I've come to realize the belligerent man of my youth hasn't actually gone away.

As much as I loathe to use this term, I do have to acknowledge that my dad was verbally and emotionally abusive when I was growing up. He's never been great at emotional control and whenever he was frustrated, he'd let it build until something finally set him off (usually something small and tangentially related).

For the last several years, he's been better--but he's also been less stressed. Now his wrist is going and he's starting to face his mortality, which is at least why I think he's been so on edge.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm sick of being an abuser's victim, but I just don't know how to escape. I live at home because I can't afford to live by myself; I've only recently gotten over the most limiting factors of a learning disorder, so balancing a job and college isn't feasible with my current stamina. I also love the community college I'm at, so in an ideal world, I'd want to stay here.

I don't have any friends I know well enough to live with while I get this sorted, and my only ""nearby"" family is my brother, who's a 10 hour drive away and is in no situation to take me in, and my aunt, who's six hours away and also can't take me in.

I'm just feeling so lost and hopeless and trapped right now. I can't even stand to be in the same room as my dad right now. Does anyone have any advice on what to do?",18Sep2019,3
199,"Throwaway bc i dont want my main associated with what I will start working in.

So. I've been looking for jobs around me and lucky me I found a job that's 1. Close to me and 2. Pays well. I don't really pay rent as I live with my mom but I do want to help her with the bills, and this job would let me do that AND have some money to put away, so that's great.

The thing is that it's a sex shop, that's not bad in itself, I guess that's why they pay more than any other retail job, the manager told me that not everybody would want this job, but I personally don't mind. (If anybody has any advice for working in this kind of thing I would really appreciate it) 

The only issue is my dad. He and my mom were never together and he doesn't live with us, but they do work together, he is involved in my life and I see him every Sunday so, he would *know* if I had my first job. I'm 19 btw, and here's where things get....odd I guess. My dad is 83 years old. He's very active, very healthy, he cooks and likes to take walks when his knees feel like it, he does a lot of puzzles, what I'm saying is that the man is not unable in any way. But he is of an older generation and I honestly don't know how he would take to me working in a sex shop, we have *never* talked about sex or anything related to, my mom gave me a ""sex talk"" but I'm a lesbian (my dad doesn't know that either) so the bird and the bees talk was a bit useless for me.

202,"We have both been struggling with mental health issues, her from unrelated situations that happened before she met me, and me due to losing a best friend. We're both in college and university, and she called me over one day and basically told me that she needed to figure out who she was and felt as she counted on me and previous boyfriend's too much for her happiness and needed time to figure herself out. I have always tried to be helpful with her mental health, always trying to relate to her problems and hear her out, and she has appreciated that. In this situation I forced myself to understand because I believe that this is the true reason she needs space from me. It has been a week and she asked me to hang out after class so I picked her up and tried to be as positive as I could because I knew I have to move on but don't know how I could not see her, but I came to realize that I couldn't stop acting how I used to, always touching her whether it be a hand or hair or shoulder, while she seemed happier than ever to still be able to see me while not acting how she always had before. I left lots of details out because I need to get this out, but place reply with anything I'd appreciate it. My friend told me it wouldn't be healthy to keep seeing her but I seriously only think about her all day because I was so happy with her and we had serious plans for a future. I know we're young but it's beyond marriage, she is my best friend and I don't know how I'm supposed to move on and watch her lose her love for me and still be there to help her with mental problems. Is she just letting me off easy by saying it's mental issues? I know it might be hard to tell because every little detail could change someone's opinion.

203,"A bit of backstory: A while back me and this girl kind of had a falling out and we didn’t talk much. Over summer, I had been fighting depression, and was talking to a different girl about this. Recently, the new girl has stopped hanging out with me, so I decided to talk to the other girl.

We were discussing things towards bedtime, and she kind of helped with the social issues I was struggling with. Then, while I am in class, I get a text from her, which is unusual. I look, and in a pro-revenge turn of events, she had shown our PRIVATE CONVERSATION to her friends, and her friends texted me thru her phone. I was stunned and didn’t know what to do. That night I blocked her number to prevent a further escalation of the issue. But, her friends know, and some of them know me.

Our friend group at school has almost been rearranged into a social hierarchy. This one kid who is the leader is the one that has been hanging out a lot with the girl I had talked to over summer. He gets all the attention and is constantly debasing me and trying to prove everything I say wrong. There is the middle class which consists of most of our friend group, and me and a few others are at the bottom.

In short, I don’t know how to react if that conversation gets brought up. I can’t really defend myself well (verbally to say the least). If the “leader” finds out he can use that against me and ruin my “hanging by a thread” relationship and ruin my social life. I just don’t know what to do from here, and this has taken a toll on me.",18Sep2019,1
204,"I'm currently still in high school. During my freshman year, I made a new friend (girl 1, who's my age) and met with some older friends that I hadn't seen for a while. One of those friends was and is one of my closest friends, in-band (guy 1, one year older than me). My new friend fell for this guy that was my friend for 4 years. After leading her on for a few months, Guy 1 rejected her. Around a year later, she fell for Guy 1's best friend (Guy 2, also 1 year older than me). Guy 2 didn't like her back, but I helped out Girl 1 with and getting over him. Around the same time as that (aka Sophomore year), I got depression for about 6 months due to rejection because of age. My crush liked me back but didn't wanna date because she was older by 2 years. Girl 1 helped me get over my depression and with my crush.

Now the actual problem. Me and Girl 1 are currently Juniors, and the other two guys are Seniors. Two years after Guy 1 initially rejected Girl 1. Guy 1 told me he still had feelings for her, but Girl 1 doesn't anymore. I believe that Girl 1 should not give him a chance as he threw his shot. Also, not be mean to Guy 1, but he kinda treated her badly by leading her on. Guy 1 is one of my closest friends, but I don't think he is right for Girl 1. 

To make matters worse, I think I'm starting to like Girl 1. Mainly because of how she cared for me during my depression, and she's genuinely a great person. I hope that my feelings aren't getting in the way of judgment for helping my friends out. It's kind of a love triangle, but I don't want to do anything yet, because I think she'll reject me and I don't want my friend to get mad at me. Also, I don't know how to tell her. She suspects I like someone

In short, Girl 1 used to like Guy 1, but he rejected her. 2 years later, he likes her back again. I don't know what side to take, but don't want to be biased by my feelings. I also don't know how to confess.",18Sep2019,3

207,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend and left my friends and family to move to a bigger city. Let me give you a little backstory: my best friend moved away to college two years ago and I missed her a lot so I decided to leave my dad's house and go move in with her 3 hours away from everyone else in my life. Before I decided to go I was in a relationship with a guy who couldn't really provide me with the emotional support I needed. Basically he wasn't ready for a the type of relationship I wanted/needed and he knew that, but he kept me around for a long time regardless. In my head this just gave me more of reason to go and start fresh. I lived in the same small town since third grade and I got tired of seeing the same people doing the same shit everywhere I went. I got tired of dating the same assholes over and over again. So I moved over here 2-3 weeks ago and I've been trying to find a job with very little luck.

I really want to thrive and meet a new supportive, fun group of friends out here but it feels so hard to get to that point. I've always struggled with my mental health and I can kind of feel myself spiraling a little bit. I'm so deprived from social interaction that I'm thinking about actually texting my ex back just so I have someone to talk to. Yikes.

A little background story, I am self-conscious about my appearance and I hate every single bit about it. I am camera shy and I can not look at a photo of mine without breaking down. 

My friends are well aware that I have very low self-esteem and sensitive, but decide to pick on me anyway. 

My other friend saved the photo (We'll call him Y), and uploads the photo of me again.
At this point, I'm freaking out because looking at the photo, even trying to remember it in my head, makes me want to breakdown. 

Wihout thinking, I said that I would harm myself if they didn't take the photo down and completely deleted it from the gallery. K eventually did, but it took some time for Y to. He kept teasing me, saying that he would show it to my crush. 

I went to get a shaver and tried to take the blade from it. I am weak as a leaf, so I wasn't able to. However, I did take the top off from the shaver and was able to cut a few small ones on the top of my arm. 

I left the call a few seconds later. My best friend had experience with cutting, and knowing that, Y reached out to her. Nonetheless, she was ANGRY. 

...

It's almost 12 AM, and I regret everything. I overreacted to the maximum and I destroyed a friendship of me and Y that had been developed ever since kindergarten. I forgot to mention, but I left the Discord server but was invited back. I scrolled up to see a few messages of (We'll call him S), mocking me. :/

I wish I took this a different way but I couldn't think clearly. I did ask for them to take the photos down, but they didn't budge. They kept relentlessly teasing me. So I brought self-harm in it which was a terrible idea.

Her mother was mentally retarded and didn't date my father, who was in love with her. He married her sister instead aka my adopted Mom.

A couple years ago, Melissa found out Sam was cheating on her. Differences couldn't be reconciled, and they got divorced; Sam is totally out of the picture now.

Melissa first stated that she wanted to take some time for herself after the divorce and just be single. Within a few days, she was dating one of Sam's former coworkers. That relationship didn't work out. Then she dated a guy she went to high school with, and that didn't work out. 

Here's where it gets problematic.

She started dating a guy that lives 2 hours away from her. He has no job, no car, no license, lives with his parents, and has a kid.

Another week goes by and she's asking him to move in with her and her kids.

217,"For context, I am a college student (M19) who is studying a difficult curriculum and is busy as a bee with work and school.  


I've dealt with quite a few recurring issues since early childhood that I've never really dealt with or solved, but I've succeeded in many ways in my life. Yet, I'm wanting in quite a few, and I need advice on how to deal with my problems.  


Currently, my glaring issue is struggling with social isolation. I deal with bad anxiety and insecurities about my appearance, weight, clothing, but mostly my own social behavior. Since middle school, I answered this by isolating and being isolated socially. I learned that video games and personal time were when I felt most comfortable, and I continued this habit up to my recent combat against this behavior. Whilst I had many acquaintance-friends, I didn't invite anyone to anything, nor did I get invited to anything, often, besides for a small friend group that I had. While it always has hurt doing this, I don't feel that anyone wants to spend time with me anyways. I've noticed that most people that I meet simply avoid me or, for instance, switch spots in a class to the other side of the classroom, and later ignore me completely in public. Groups that I once considered friends spend time without me, always had group chats specifically without me, and go out to parties without me. I've done my best to not loathe on those thoughts and past, to focus on my career and work, but it just has grown into my thoughts more and more over time. I've always had ""acquaintance-friends"", but never friends that treated me as if I mattered to them. I've felt like the majority of my peers are making bonds and friendships that I just can't make, and I'm sick of spending nights toiling over it. I feel like a middle school child asking this, but I can't seem to understand it. How do I make friends? How do I find genuine people that value me for me? How do I get over social anxiety and isolation? Am I just a weird guy that creeps people out? Am I socially inapt?  


Another issue that I have is relating to my past. Similar to friendships, I never really had a relationship beyond friends in my early school years. I lacked experience and knowledge of it going into college, and got into a nasty, abusive and painful relationship that left me with what my therapist described as trauma. In short, the woman that I fell madly in love with built a relationship with me by lying constantly. I'd pick up hints of it, then bring it up, and she'd go emotionally ballistic on me. This escalated into mental, emotional, and eventually physical abuse, where she would leverage my mad love over her to keep me from my friends, school, and own life, for whatever the reason. Slowly, she got sick of my crying, and we ""broke up"", even after seeing each other for weeks after. My mental state continued to worsen to a point where I'd stay up all night in a mind throbbing blur, I would binge drink daily, and even got to the point where I self harmed. Later, when she began to distance herself again, I learned that she was with another man with a promise ring (which she initially claimed was a promise ring, for example of her bullshit), which she hid by lying for months. When that came to light, I went bat shit crazy on her over a text storm simply to be blocked the following night. I spent the next few weeks trying to get letters to her as a final word, trying to get previous gifts back, and trying to communicate to her boyfriend about what happened. It all ended with me having suicidal tendencies and even police being called to my dorm to investigate a suicide threat that I made the last night we talked in person. I spent the next few months getting therapy, moving to have new room mates, going through weekly hookups, failing my classes, and struggling with alcoholism.   


I have been struggling with thoughts about the whole situation and other details as I return this year back to school, and no amount of time or active thought control has stopped them. Impulsively, I remember about her and the whole ordeal when I see vague reminders, everything from a notable chicken sandwich to someone who looks similar to them. I lack any closure, not knowing if I'm the bad person in the situation, not knowing if I have the courage to apologize for my crazed behavior, and even knowing I'm better off without her, not knowing why I still have feelings for her. I've failed to shake off thoughts, and I can only stay focused in school when I take my meds, but by late the evening when those pills wear off, I often spend nights rolling in frustration and pain. The lack of sleep and impact upon my mental health is starting to take away from school and my social life.  


Those bad memories, combined with my pains of loneliness, have rolled in my brain for the past few weeks since school began this fall semester. Is there a way I can shake these off? I really don't know what to do, and I refuse to put these issues off whilst they impact my career.",18Sep2019,1

We have been talking about me asking a girl to be in a relationship. I have told them that I don't want to, and I'm afraid of being hurt, but they don't really understand. They aren't pressuring me or anything, but they want me to talk to her. 

I have no idea what to do. I don't know whether or not I should tell them about how I actually feel or just do nothing. Again, they aren't pressuring me. They are pretty understanding people. I think I am scared of those relationships changing and I don't want to embarrass myself or make myself a burden to them.

228,"My brother is my best friend. He was adopted my freshmen year and he’s just a few months younger than me, so we are very close. He’s always heard voices but when he started doing drugs, it went away. It wasn’t until recently, when he quit, that the voices came back louder and more violent. He can’t hold down a job, he can’t keep friends, and he’s isolated himself in his room for the past year. 

I recommended the mental hospital so they can diagnose him and give him free shelter and food for a week, so he can stop starving (he can’t afford food, I’ve given him mine, but now I have no food). He said he can’t because the voices told him that the hospital is full of cops who are going to shoot him when he goes in. I explained that this hospital is nice and that when I was there I was treated with respect and everyone was nice. He doesn’t believe me. 

The only person his voices trust is me at this point, but I know I would break that trust if I were to take him to the hospital against his will. Should I take him and have him get better but never trust me again, or do I let him kill himself like he’s doing now just so he can continue trusting me? And if I were to take him, there’s a chance he could try to kill me. He’s very violent because of the voices. I just want him safe, but I don’t know how to do it.",18Sep2019,1
230,"I graduated HS nearly 4 years ago so I follow some of the people I liked and talked to on Instagram. Today one of the girls I used to be friends with posted this  [photo of a gun with this caption](https://imgur.com/gallery/gCHLYG3). 

Essentially she is threatening an unnamed woman. 

The gun looks like it carbine (is that how you spell it, I’m not totally sure that’s what my boyfriend called it). I am not sure if she is still living in my home city or if she moved to the bigger city in the state, or if she moved out completely. I don’t know if the gun is real or if she’s just acting hard. I don’t know. All I know if that I’m kinda freaked out

Do I have a moral obligation to report her to the police (which would be hard Bc like I said idk if she lives in our home state still? Or like fbi? Or what? 

Something feels wrong just letting it go. She’s been acting really “hood” the past few years and I know she’s gotten mixed up in the wrong crowd before. I’m worried that if I do report her, she could find me and hurt me despite the fact I live out of state now. 

I don’t know what I should do. Do I have a moral obligation to report something suspicious, or do I let it go?",18Sep2019,1

233,"I (19 F) have been dating my boyfriend (21 M) for a little over 2 years now. When we first started dating, everything was perfect. We fell in love instantly and were inseparable ever since. I lied to him about something very important in the very beginning of our relationship. Once he found out, it crushed him. I had never seen someone so hurt by me before. I promised myself I would never hurt him again and continued to shower him with love and affection every day since. This was within the first month of our relationship, he seemed to heal almost fully a few months later. Within the first year, we had many issues with him lying to me. He never physically cheated on me, but he still cheated via text, social media, etc. He just seemed to flirt with a lot of girls and it always hurt me a lot. I understand I should have left then because most will say that’s my problem, but I didn’t. I am deeply in love with him. One time, he broke down crying because of how ashamed he was of himself for something he did with a girl on Snapchat and my first instinct was to hold and comfort him. My initial reaction to anything is always to make sure he’s okay. 

Fast forward to now, he’s going back to school and lives 3 1/2 hours away. Before he left, we saw each other probably everyday. We genuinely have been each other’s best friend since we met. Also today, we still seem to struggle with a few lies here and there. We were doing really good until he texted a girl he went to high school with. (He used to frequently text her and flirt in the beginning) In my opinion, the texts were somewhat flirty. Not texts that should be sent to a girl he used to try to talk to like that. He deleted them and tried to hide them from me. (This all happening since he moved back to school.) After that, I fell right back in the routine of feeling like I can’t trust him again. We were doing so amazing the week he texted her too. We had a long talk that week and really started to love and appreciate every chance we had to talk to one another. That’s why it was so frustrating to me that he would do such little things to mess it up again. Normally I wouldn’t care if my S/O has friends of the opposite sex, but he hasn’t proven to me that he can have a normal friendship with a girl. I wanted to end things for good after that because he had messed up so much over the past 2 years and he knew it was his last chance to be honest for once, but as usual, I couldn’t leave him.  After all, I’m in love with the guy. 

Since then, I’ve noticed more of a tenseness with him. He always seems so miserable. I do not expect him to jump off the walls and constantly smile and laugh on the phone/FaceTime, but, it would be nice if he just tried to look a little happy here and there. He doesn’t see it at all. When I point it out, he gets very frustrated and it starts an argument. It almost comes across as if he has no patience for me anymore. Everything I say seems to set him off. He constantly sighs on the phone and just stares at his computer screen in silence or at me occasionally without smiling once then goes back to the computer. He genuinely just looks bored. I feel like a burden to him. He will text me all day as if he is so happy and he is very reassuring through text, but on the phone, it’s either he’s the same or nothing at all. I know it’s not just his personality to be quiet and down like that all the time because I have seen him genuinely enjoy talking to me before. But things just seem so different. He acts like he’s forced to talk to me. Sometimes I feel like there’s been too many bad things done to one another for us to be kind and loving in the ways we should be. I know I don’t forgive him for things he’s done.  I don’t think he’s ever fully forgiven me for the lie I told him 2 years ago, but I don’t know when enough should be enough. Every little thing that made us special seems so nonexistent now. I know a part of him really loves me, but I’m scared he only sees me as the hurt girl who’s always telling him how he should treat someone. I feel like he sees me as a bother or a job, not something he actually wants to have. 

So in conclusion, I think my boyfriend subconsciously is tired of me. How do you know when the relationship is really over or just going through a rough spot?",18Sep2019,2
235,"I a lot of times feel so numb I just can’t handle it. I break down and cry at random things. Things like having to order and other people behind me, my mom rushing me, and I end up ordering something I don’t want or even like out of panic make me break down in tears. I get so overwhelmed with panic I can’t calm down. I break down crying and my mind races, my dad or mom yells at me so I basically shove it back inside and pent up the leftover bullshit from freakin out over a milkshake. I think of suicide a lot and have some plans, I don’t see myself living past 19. Nihilism fills my head at night and I can’t sleep. I self harm, cut my wrists to relive some of it. When I after overwhelming panic I restrict my meals and don’t eat for the rest of the day. I obsessively exercise and I can’t stop. My dad yells at me and curses me out when I get that weird overwhelming panic. I have everything i could want, what am I doing sitting here cutting myself when kids add starving, people are mourning, veterans are on the streets, and I’m here crying my eyes out about a milkshake.

I used to have a friend and I would lash out and talk about the most random things, have that overwhelming panic and go home obsessively exercise. I know I freaked him out but I was and am so unstable. Mood swings going everywhere.
Nothing helps and everything hurts. Throughout the day I feel nothing and once I’m sitting alone at night I freak out and break down in tears. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I have no right to feel anything wrong. I have to be glad about the life I have constantly, I have absolutely no right to ever be upset about anything ever.

237,"For background. 
My mother (49)  is depressed, bipolar, and my eldest brother (would be 30 this month) passed away 3 years ago. I have 2 (26,19) other brothers from her side. I only live with one (19y/o) of them. She’s had a very rough upbringing.

Now, moving on. She’s been extremely hard to handle these past few years after my brothers death. She’s been on various substances, lying to me about which. She yells at me for eating the food in the house because “we never leave her anything to eat and she goes hungry” so I’ve resorted to buying my own food and keeping it in my room, same thing with juices and waters and such. But two days ago, I bought juices that I didn’t want to go bad (bf told me it’d be better if I put them in the fridge) so I put them in the fridge. I labeled them “do not touch” with my name, and she got mad, and told me that everything else in the house is hers, including the fridge. And that I am not allowed to touch it. 

She never sees what she does wrong. She is a textbook narcissist. She thinks she’s perfect, but then expects me to lend her a shoulder when she’s upset. 

I’m not looking for any “you need to get out of there” (I’m 17, 18 In March 2020) because I know. I have 6 more months until I move in with my boyfriend. Im looking for tips on how to deal with this and not lose my shit.",18Sep2019,1
238,"So I want to learn how to be rude to people. I've noticed more and more throughout my life that I am treated like shit and because I am too nice/kind I usually do nothing about it and just let it build up or ultimately forget about it. But tonight I just hit my limit. In the middle of a conversation, the other person took their phone out and started surfing the internet. Once I finished my sentence she immediately looked up and said ""huh...what? I stopped listening"". And if I'm being honest with myself, this actually happens a lot to me. 

But the older I've gotten I've come to realise a lot of ppl I know or work with are jerks to me, even strangers occasionally. Ppl always come to me because they know I always have a listening ear for anybody but the minute I want to talk I get left on read or told off. A lot of the stuff I say is not taken seriously because I'm usually very nice/happy and by that default ppl assume I'm stupid. There's a lot of other examples but this post is already getting too long. At first I thought it was because I was annoying or ugly that I get treated this way, but the few good friends I do have have told me that this is not normal for everybody and that being rude could just be a byproduct of today's generation (whatever that means). 

I've tried to make myself less annoying and friendly by no longer initiating conversations, or joining in on them even if I'm in the group/room. Trying not to smile everytime I make eye contact at people, failing though because I used to be a very happy person and smiled all the time and now it's like a reflex that I can't help (I'm smiling even if I'm crying, tbh it's creepy). Looking more serious so that I'm taken seriously. But I'm not sure what else I can do. Does anyone have an advice on what I can do to make myself more tolerable to other ppl so that they aren't rude to me or at least some advice on how to not care about these situations that happen to me.

239,"My friends and I often hang out in the common room of my dorm, and when we do we often listen to music - more often than not, it’s rap.

I know that she’s from a very small town and probably doesn’t know how offensive it actually is for her to say it (Grace being a 18yo white girl). I’m from the city, and since i’m way more accustomed to diversity I feel as though I understand why she shouldn’t say that word, even though I myself am white. Also, out of the 12 students in our dorm hall, there’s only one black guy. Since we hang out in the common room, there’s a likelihood that he could hear (his room is close to the common room). Overall, it just makes me uncomfortable to hear her say it but I don’t know how to bring it up.

245,"A bit of backstory: A while back me and this girl kind of had a falling out and we didn’t talk much. Over summer, I had been fighting depression, and was talking to a different girl about this. Recently, the new girl has stopped hanging out with me, so I decided to talk to the other girl.

We were discussing things towards bedtime, and she kind of helped with the social issues I was struggling with. Then, while I am in class, I get a text from her, which is unusual. I look, and in a pro-revenge turn of events, she had shown our PRIVATE CONVERSATION to her friends, and her friends texted me thru her phone. I was stunned and didn’t know what to do. That night I blocked her number to prevent a further escalation of the issue. But, her friends know, and some of them know me.

Our friend group at school has almost been rearranged into a social hierarchy. This one kid who is the leader is the one that has been hanging out a lot with the girl I had talked to over summer. He gets all the attention and is constantly debasing me and trying to prove everything I say wrong. There is the middle class which consists of most of our friend group, and me and a few others are at the bottom.

In short, I don’t know how to react if that conversation gets brought up. I can’t really defend myself well (verbally to say the least). If the “leader” finds out he can use that against me and ruin my “hanging by a thread” relationship and ruin my social life.

This coworker then claimed that her another coworker and I are highly impressionable mood wise. I again explained to her how the only way I may be impressionable is by a rude customer and by then it’s only a change of tone but I never let it effect my coworkers or my overall day. She later sent out an email with a new protocol for the office exclaiming it’s new since she has been back and I started. I can’t help but feel that she is throwing me under the bus for things I don’t partake in and is using me as an excuse to keep everyone else in line.

247,"Am I out of my mind on this?

I feel like I know I can be incredibly highly functioning if nobody tries to convince me to be. 

I’m a child (15 years old) and I’m super into self improvement. Working out, training, learning to cook, comedy, playing instruments. I’m just working to become an elevated human. Joe Rogan style. Someone’s who’s 4 times as athletic as a normal person, 4 times as funny and 4 times as smart. 

However, I feel there’s a strange roadblock. That’s my mom. I want to work hard, I want to train, I want to make jokes, I want to grind through these years of my life to become better for the next ones. I just can’t. She’s sort of controlling and intrusive - it’s almost completely shut down my drive to do what I want.

If I go downstairs to work out, she’ll stop me. “Hey honey? You should go downstairs and workout.” 

“Yeah, I was going to.” 

“Oh good, because you know it’s very good for you...”

This dialogue will go on for 5 or 6 minutes at least. Even this short amount of time is enough to sap all of my desire to work out. I’m very ADD so I’ll quickly move on from the desire in this scenario, whereas if I just do it, I’m constantly engaged and I don’t get bored.

I’m not sure if I’m overreacting with this one.

That may not be so bad but it gets intolerable when it’s dealing with every minuscule facet of my life.

Even something like showering, eating or something as little as getting water to drink! She’s recently divorced so maybe it’s that she wants to feel in control of something - I don’t know. It’s painful to listen to her talk at me every moment of my waking life.

It’s preventing me from doing anything I desire. I know the counter argument of “maybe it’s just the straw that broke the camels back on reasons you won’t do what you claim you want to.” 

Objectively, this isn’t the case. My mom will occasionally leave me home alone for a few days while she does whatever it is she does. In this time that she’s gone, I’m constantly up and doing what I want to. I’m cooking, training, practicing guitar - just learning in general.

This is when she gets back home and in the first few minutes of talking to her, I hear something like “you should go outside more, it’s very good for you!” And immediately I’m back in my room silently seething knowing that if she just stopped talking I could actually work to be the person I want to be. 

I just want to convince her to stop talking to me entirely. This phenomenon my have something to do with me being introverted and non-confrontational or probably something to do with my moderate to severe OCD. Obviously the complete gift of independence is far-fetched but it’s impossible for me to humour her and maintain the drive to do anything. I know what she does comes from a place of love but it couldn’t be having a more opposite effect.

I was wondering, do I stop focusing on her feelings so I can actually do what I want to? Is there another alternative? If I need to elaborate further in the comments, I will.",18Sep2019,0

Then suddenly she starts hanging out with other people, other friends, some I know and some unknown. I get worried whenever she's just, away for so long. Am I being too clingy? Am I just a toxic boyfriend?  
Now I can barely talk to her because she's always responding to my texts in one word responses. It's like she doesn't want to be with me anymore. Maybe I did something and made her mad but I just don't know what to do. I want to be with her, but I feel as if that's unrequited.

I do understand that kissing doesn’t really determine weather someone loves you or not.

258,"TL:DR; need advice on how to let the guy in my apartment know I like him without coming off as a stalker

Ok so I just left a sexless relationship a month ago. Moved 1326 miles to come live with my mom to an incredibly small apartment. Anyway, I have developed a bit of a crush on the guy that lives directly above me. I noticed he likes playstation from the hat he wears and I can hear him laughing at night when he is gaming. And I kind of want to say hi but I'm incredibly shy and self conscious since I'm a bigger girl and I'm terrified of rejection. I thought maybe leaving my phone number on his door or something but that feels rather stalkerish to me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",18Sep2019,3
259,"For context, my girlfriend (18) and I (19) have been dating for around 4 months. Her parents are extremely strict and do not approve of our relationship. 

I was dropping her off at her house and her dad was waiting and saw us. He immediately started yelling at her and me. He took her back to his car and drove them home.

The next day my girlfriend was sad (as I guessed, something like this had happened before), but she would never tell me what was really bothering her. She finally admitted that her arms were hurting, because her dad had beat her after they went home.

There had been other times I would see bruises on her arms, but she would always downplay it or make up an excuse.

264,"Okay. I don’t know how to exactly put everything into words. I guess I’ll give as much detail as I’m comfortable sharing. I work in a hospital setting. So nurse and doctor setting. We have a doctor who rarely comes in because he has a busy schedule. Everyone loves him. He’s good looking and smart. I haven’t had many interactions with him because of his schedule. I can probably count the number of times I’ve talked to him. He’s always seemed like a nice, keeps-to-himself kind of guy. Occasional light hearted jokes with people. Is clearly there to work and not make friends, but he is friendly. People know him and always try to schedule appointments with him because of how handsome and smart he is. I’ve always had mixed feelings about him. He’s a nice guy. Sometimes comes off as a complete introvert, other times complete extrovert. It’s hard to talk to him sometimes, other times it’s easy. Regardless, all of the ladies love him. He’s a charmer. He has a reputation of coming in late and missing appointments, leaving us to deal with clients. Anyways, I don’t have any kind of relationship with him. He’s a doctor and I’m a nurse, pretty much. 

Today, however, was a strange day. I worked with him all day. I didn’t think he should show up so I took his name off of a few whiteboards because of this (not sure if that’s even relevant). I found out he was in and asked a coworker to put his name back on them. It was a crazy day so a couple of appointments were roomed later than intended. I don’t know if this is relevant either. I just want to be as descriptive as possible. 

Today around late noon, he came out of an appointment and slammed his folder right next to me. I was kind of stared and confused because he’s never done anything like that around me or anyone from what I’ve noticed. He kind of stammered and muttered something along the lines of “I don’t know why I did that.”
(The whole situation was...strange so I’m not sure if this part of my story is in chronological order. However, all of these things did happen). He left the chart and I worked on it while he walked back to his desk to wait for his next appointment which had already been checked in and waiting to be roomed. It was busy so it took me a while to finish up the chart. There was a mix up in pharmacy and we didn’t have a medication he wanted to prescribe. I roomed his next appointment, cleared up the medication issue, and waiting for him to come down the hall (since he had an appointment) to make sure I put in a few instructions correctly. 
This is where it gets blurry for me because I was just...I guess in shock?

He walked down the hall, I asked him about the instructions as he was walking and cleared all that up. When he was walking down the hall, he walked directly towards me. He grabs me by my right arm while I’m sitting down facing the computer and squeezes my upper arm (above the elbow) which both his hands. It was a tight grip. Tight enough to keep me from snatching it away, but not so tight that it would cause any bruising. He’s into bodybuilding so he’s strong. And I mean works out 24/7 gym rat life, super cut strong. I feel like it was intentional. Like he wanted me to know how strong he was. I feel like he went for it because he saw that no one was near or around. There is a camera that faces me down the hall, but he’s massive so I’m sure that from that angle is just looks like he’s standing in front of me as if he were talking to me. Like I said he had me in a tight grip with both hands almost in that Indian-burn type grip.  I didn’t make eye contact. I just couldn’t grasp what was going on. I faced the computer nervously laughing until he let go, which felt like eternity. He shook me a little. I didn’t know how to react because like I said we work together here and there, I rarely see him, and he’s such an introvert around me. Almost awkwardly. I pretty much waited for him to let go because he had an appointment waiting. He finally let go and walked into the exam room. 

I just sat there staring at nothing for a while. I wanted to cry and I held back as tears started to form. I don’t know what happened and every time I think about it, it just feels hazy if that makes sense. I’m so confused. Was I harassed? Did I do something? Was he angry at me for some reason? But if he were angry at me why not just tell me and let me know? I don’t understand why he grabbed me like that out of nowhere and why he didn’t say a word that entire time. 
I feel like crying just thinking about it and I honestly just don’t know if I’m over reacting or not. What do I do? Should I say something? Am I over reacting?? 
All I know is that I feel scared. Maybe I was afraid at his strength and the fact that he could snap my arm if he wanted to? Why didn’t I say anything? I couldn’t make out any words at all.

I avoided him after that. Luckily that was his last appointment of the day and he went straight home after that. 

What do I do? Are my feelings justified?  I work with him tomorrow and the next day. Just my luck.

268,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over two years now. We took a break in the beginning of the year but reconciled after that awkward phase of we’re not officially back together but we’re sleeping with each other phase. That lasted for a month or so until we finally decided to really make it work. Rewind to the end Of May and I’m all in. It honestly felt like a new begging..Up until yesterday (sept 16) when I found out he requested an STD panel July 24. I’m really confused as to why he would need one if he isn’t cheating on me. If this test were to take place closer to the time we were broken up it would make more sense to me, but it wasn’t. I didn’t know how to react, I couldn’t really tell him how I know he got tested with out throwing myself under the bus so I brought it up as best as I could. 

You see, I have been experiencing an off again on again yeast infection since the beginning of August. I just recently moved so it has been a struggle getting an appointment with a new GYNO but it’s finally this Thursday. After finding out he got tested, I’m now thinking I could have an STI that it’s going away because I have been self medicating with home remedies. 

I expressed to my bf that I’m concerned, and shared my relief in finally getting an appointment. Side note, we haven’t been having much sex because of the discomfort. I jokingly brought up STI’s and he quickly turned it on me. (Part of our break up was his trust issues) I slipped in there that I’ve only been with him and asked him when the last time he got tested. HE LIED TO ME and said he got tested back in 2017. 

Like I said, brining up how I know isn’t an option, so I’m stuck. I’m trying to rationalize why someone would need an STI test if they are in a monogamous relationship unless A) He’s cheating or B) he thinks I’m cheating. Which I am not, I never have. Even looking back at our text messages from July 24, we didn’t argue, nothing to trigger insecurity or question my loyalty.

I’m now having to pretend that everything is okay because I don’t want to open up Pandora’s box until I get tested myself and know what’s up.    I figure, if I test positive for anything I’ll know my answer and end it without bringing up how I know. But if I test negative, then I’ll always wonder why he got tested. Overall I feel distraught. I thought we were doing so well..and now I’m questioning every time he hasn’t answered a call, or when I’m with him and he tilts his phone away or leaves it in another room.

Ive been telling people that I'm planning on leaving because they are getting pretty old, my mom is in a wheelchair, and my dad has early onset alzheimers, and got fired from his well paying job, and is now scrubbing floors.  They need all the help they can get.  But if I'm being completely honest I'm doing it for selfish reasons.  My parents are the only people in my life that give a shit about me, and I desperately need help that I'm not getting here.

I got out of a 3 year relationship a couple months ago, where we talked about, and pseudo planned on getting married, and having kids.  I was miserable, but so deeply in love I couldn't see how mentally and emotionally abusive she was, and it only really clicked after she dumped me for some guy she just met, and I stopped looking at her through rose colored glasses.

After 3 years of declining mental health I'm to the point where can barely function.  I smoke weed or get drunk almost non stop outside of work, and am currently having suicidal thoughts.  I'm not to the point of attempting it yet, but I'm terrified of getting there.

The only thing really good about my life right now is my job.  I'm a manager in the medical field, and got this job for no reason other than crazy good luck, and a great interview. But I've only been there for about 10 months, and I dont want to leave before I stay atleast a year, because i dont think i could ever land a position like that again if i left so early, but I hurt so much, and I want to leave now.

I've tried to make friends, I cant afford professional help, I've reached out to old friends with no avail.  There is nothing for me here but a statistic on a resume.

My parents are 100% on board with this idea btw, they would love nothing more than me being there to help them and I feel the same at this point honestly.

278,"I'm 22, currently living with my parents while I get my Bachelor's in Nursing. I'll be graduating soon, but my mom has recently brought up the topic of wanting to live in a different state in the future. We're currently in Illinois near the Chicago-land area, which she doesn't like because of the harsh winter. 

While I'm also not a fan of the extreme cold, I like living here because I've been planning many job opportunities or dream hospitals I want to aim for in the city once I graduate. What's put a stop to that recently is when we found out that my mom has a brain tumor. The doctor has told her that it's not malignant and very small right now, and that all they'll do is monitor it. As long as she isn't under a lot of stress, they said it shouldn't get bigger. She keeps saying it's fine now, but it's been keeping me on edge ever since I found out. I just want to her to be able to relax and go on vacations once my sister and I graduate next year (she'll be going to college and I planned to move out soon once I have some money saved up).

The thing is, my mom has said that she doesn't want to move if I don't go with them. Her reasoning is that if her or my dad ever get sick in the future, then I'd have to fly back and forth trying to take care of the sick one, and she says that's too complicated. If I decided to stay in Illinois and pursue a career here, they'll for sure be staying with me. 

My issue is that I just feel terrible making her stay here when she's mentioned many times how much she dislikes the weather and wants to move somewhere warmer. She in no way pressures me to move, but knowing that she's not as happy as she could be here makes me feel so guilty. Moving states feels like a big change for me because I've lived here my entire life and I've grown to love it. I want her to be happy and focus on herself now because she's gone through so much raising my sister and I. And I know she'd be happy moving to one of the other states she was thinking of (like Georgia or the Carolinas), even though that's something I never even considered.

Homework and my job have definitely gone by faster recently and feely decreasingly stressful, I have a 4.0 and I am confident I can at-least keep a 3.6+ this semester (shitty english teacher who teaches gender studies, as all english mega liberals are lol) I am libertarian btw not that it matters but before someone thinks im some trumptard

I had dated a girl for 2 years who dealt with my really well through a transition in my life, I broke up with her a few days ago due to me not feeling much for her anymore and thought being straight up is the right decision.

I downloaded tinder and other apps and have gotten a decent match success as I am fit and 6""3, I crave that feeling of love, being cared for and willing to do anything for a girl, I realize This comes off as clingy so I try to balance myself with new people I meet

Have had success with this one liner ""wanna steal my comfiest hoodies after you let me bring you out for fish tacos?"" Always end up getting numbers etc. I push to talk on the phone before meeting girls in person but as my personality sits I can be awkward and quiet, I dont drink or smoke which doesn't help my case for entertainment and my two best friends are 3 years older than me and the other is a really hard working guy who's dad runs a body shop on the side we can play around with to modify his civic si (his dad is a manager at the mercedes benz service center where I live and dude is cool af)

Sorry for rambling, my issue is that I am lonely, I feel lost in what should be going good, girls just want flings, or they are overly religious, act not interested when may be, just dont know what they want...

I crave that interaction with someone else and dont get confused with me saying i want my ex back because far from it! I met a girl on tinder who is surprisingly, in my math class. She initially had started glancing over at me in class a lot never smiling and today we talked in class while we sat with her friend, im getting more of a ""friend"" vibe from her although into her. 

The thing with me as my friends put it, ""you dont want to win, but you dont want to lose"" I am impatient as all kids are and I guess my question to everyone is how have you dealt with loneliness? How have you filled that hole? What keeps you going from rejection or girls sending mixed signals (for the fellas), how can I up my chances with creating something serious with someone? 

Sorry for rambling, thanks everyone I just am really sad and wanted to vent somewhere so I guess here we are lol...",18Sep2019,1
292,"Sorry in advance for the formatting and long post but I am new to reddit and will try my best. This is a throwaway account because some friend and family use reddit and I don’t want them in my affairs.

My sister (F,24) has some serious issues in her life and I’m trying to help her overcome them.  We currently live in Illinois. She is homeless, jobless, single, and has 4 children under the age of 6 with 3 separate fathers (2 Female, 2 male). One of the fathers is in jail for drug possession , one lives hours away trying to rebuild his life together, and the last one is her most recent father and has helped her the most. I’ll give brief explanations of each father using their first name initial to identify them.

J is the worst of them all. He is in jail for possession of methamphetamine and several other charges. He currently has 40 days until he is released from prison. He is mentally and physically abusive to my sister. He supplied her with drugs and pushed her into harder drugs and she got addicted to Meth. She has been sober for over 6 months with no rehab or any outside help.  When he calls from jail he calls her a whore, a slut, a shitty mother, and everything in between.

D is the middle guy. He has issues holding his employment and moves around frequently. He is not financially stable and always stays with friends, family, or even sleeps in a car. He’s a good dude IMO, but needs direction and to pursue a career. He jumps from one factory production job to the next.

K is the best of them all, but still not great. He has given my sister a place to live and partially helped care for the kids. He occasionally buys them clothes or shoes and helps feed all the kids and my sister. He has his own company and does well for himself financially. He and my sister aren’t together and have been separated for some time while still living together. He has kicked her out and she is now staying with friends. He has done so much for her, but doesn’t help watch the kids or play with them (besides his own biological son) and expects her to clean his house.

Now for my sister. She dropped out of high school and never pursued a GED. She has had several jobs but kept losing them due to pregnancies and other financial issues. She has an old and shitty car that needs new brakes and rotors badly. Her brakes constantly grind and actually drag her car because they have essentially welded together.  She has lived in low income housing, but could not afford to pay and got evicted. She was then sued and now owes just shy of 1k to the housing department. Our family assistance is limited because both of our parents are deceased (2007 in case anybody was wondering).  Her kids have just started school except for the youngest one. She has terrible dental hygiene because of the drugs and she needs several cavities filled and root canals. She has no legal trouble such as felonies or misdemeanors.  I have tried to help her as much as I can, but I am working and going to school full time in addition to being married. We stay in a duplex. She currently also receives WIC but I’m not sure how much. 

I love my sister and she means a lot to me and so do her children. Her youngest child’s middle name is named after me so I know she thinks highly of me. What can I do for her? She wants to turn her life around. None of the fathers will pay child support and she doesn’t have the financial means to pursue child support. Even if she does pursue it 2 of the fathers are usually unemployed. She has told me she considered suicide often but she doesn’t want to do that to her children. I think that she can only take so little more before she gets past that point. She also has not turned to stripping, prostitution, drug dealing, or any illegal means of making ends meet and I hope she stays that way. 

If you can think of any options or anything to improve her life even a minimal amount, it would be a godsend. I spend a lot of my free time researching options and assistance, and this is one of those sources. Help me give my sister a chance.",18Sep2019,1

298,"Tl; dr: I need advice on how to start a small online store in Colombia. I need to know which is the most secure and easiest way for selling the goods. Considering that we don't have Amazon or eBay. We will use Instagram for publicity but I want to create a website for payment and shipping and I need advice on where to start.


I am starting my first business.

It will be a small online store of carefully curated items. And it will be seasonal with limited stock.

Because we will be buying the items from China, the service that our store will provide is that we can deliver the goods immediately to our costumers.

So, we have to plan way ahead and wait for the parcels to arrive (almost two months on average). 

We save time for our costumers, and we can offer a lot of great items for the less tech savvy. Also, we will curate the items so we can guarantee that the quality will be the best.

We will use Instagram for publicity. 

My girlfriend and I will be the owners. She is a photographer, graphics designer and has a degree on business administration. (I know, she is amazing)

But she works full time.

I am currently getting my degree in Biology. It has taken some time because I am type II Bipolar and I am currently very unstable.

I had to stop DBT (the only therapy that has worked on me) because it's very expensive and I just couldn't afford it anymore. Since then, my mental health has been going south.

I am 28 years old and my dad gives me everything. But he is not getting any younger and money has been very scarce lately.

The thing is, Instagram is perfect for publicity but we don't want and don't have enough time to manage the multiple methods of payments and shipping that every client would require.

(There is an important detail that I forgot to mention: We are colombians, so we don't have Amazon or eBay)

That's why I want to create a website. I know it not an easy task but I am resilient and persistent.

What can you advice me about this whole idea?

Also, can you advice me on where to start learning about creating a website?

I have seen a lot of courses on Coursera that are free, but I don't know it that is the best option. They seem way to advanced for me.

Also, I have no idea what is best language to learn.

Obligatory: I am not a native English speaker, so please excuse me if I made some mistakes. I am also open to correction or suggestions about my English. I like learning from my mistakes.

Thank you!",18Sep2019,1
299,"I posted this in another subreddit, but honestly just want a bigger outreach. I apologize to anyone who will see this twice.

My significant other (24/M) and I (25/F) have been together for one year. Aside from the occasional bad argument, and childish behavior (which we're both guilty of), our relationship has been a dream.

Tonight that dream turned into a nightmare.

We were getting ready for bed when my phone rang with a notification from his Facebook. [We share my phone, and I'm hardly ever online, so he stays logged in.]

Apparently, Facebook has it's own dating app. *And apparently*, he joined said app weeks (?), months (?), *he doesn't remember* ago. The notification was an alert that a girl ""liked"" him.

He was completely honest with me; in regards to what the app is, and what it's for. He also explained, he has no idea why he didn't tell me about it himself, - and yes, he *does* have some issues with our relationship, but they aren't worth breaking up over. He claims he genuinely wants to fix our problems together, and get help for himself.

He deleted the app (in front of me) immediately after fessing up, without me asking him to do so.

I understand he may have just made a mistake, and part of me wants to forgive him. Regardless though, I still feel so betrayed.

I'm sad and embarrassed, more than I am angry. I have had no idea this whole time, and feel like a total fool.

But the worst of it is: I really believed we were doing great, and was entirely blind- sided by this notification, and his confession. 

I'm currently on the couch, and he is in our room. He half begged me to sleep with him, but I told him to leave me alone.

I have no idea how to begin to mend our relationship... or if I even should. Maybe someone on here could offer me some insight?

311,"Hey all.

This may seem like a pedestrian situation to a lot of people, but I've never left a job for any reason other than ""i'm moving."" And this by all accounts was a solid situation for awhile.

So, I'm a writer and a performer who moved across the country from my dinky town on the east coast to Los Angeles, California to chase the entertainment dream. I've wavered in my drive for my dream before but it's always been what I've been the best at and I truly feel it's what I should be doing. I don't work a desk job, or for a production company or agency. A lot of my peers do this, but most of them hate it because they have no 1) free time where they're not exhausted or 2) actual desire to be creative. I chose the starving artist route, and I've been waiting tables since my move about a year and a half ago.

This job came along at a really good time, I almost got lucky with it, and for awhile the money was great. Recently though we were given to new management and with that comes a change of rules and hiring of a lot of new people, so I get less money and generally less work. I've been sending out job applications to higher clientele restaurants but haven't had a whole lot of luck thus far. However I have a very good amount saved up so i'm not that concerned with this current job situation necessarily.

Where I'm concerned is my creative side. I generally do something creative for about two hours once a week. The rest of my time is spent committed to work, but also navigating an adult life (running errands, I have a gym membership, I've been dating a lot, etc). Thinking about that more and more though, it seems like my life is more defined by waiting tables than it is the creative work I'd like to do. I recently looked up a bunch of the work I did in college, and I became nostalgic not for the people or places but for the *time* I had to do the work. I'd come home from class, eat dinner and write. Or plan the production of something I'd already written. Or perform in something. Or help a friend write something. Or plan the next thing I was going to write.

So I think I want to quit. If I do it in December I can spend the holidays with my friends and family back east and then return to LA in 2020. I have tracked my monthly expenses for years and I have enough money to be unemployed for 5 months, and by December it will be between 6 and 7 most likely. I wouldn't be unemployed for that long, because I'd be actively searching for more work...

... in theory. This is what I'm afraid of. It's such a leap into the deep end of the pool, to have no steady income. I'm genuinely frightened of still being jobless in half a year and having to move back in with my parents. I'm so conflicted because talking to people about this pulls me in two directions; creative people tend to think it's a great idea while those with finance and business degrees look at me like I'm crazy when I suggest quitting my job.

So this is why I need advice. I'm sorry for the long winded wall of text but I felt I needed the story framed so those of you who aren't creative types (which is okay!) can understand a little better. Ideally i'd love to hear from someone who was in a similar situation, but I'm happy to take advice from everyone. 

Should I quit my day job to focus on my creative career, even if it means getting rid of my income safety net?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I'm thinking of quitting my day job waiting tables to chase the entertainment dream I moved across the country for, but I'm conflicted because it would mean a solidly long period of time without any income and no guaranteed light at the end of the tunnel. Should I take the leap?",18Sep2019,1

Before I've ever masturbated I could pee just fine. I didn't have to go to the toilets often and I could pee at a distance. 

I started masturbating a few years back and how I masturbate isn't like how many people masturbated. I do it in a weird way where all my pressure is on my penis.

314,"I need help. I want to understand myself better and determine if it’s “not all that bad” 

So for the past two years I have been living a lifestyle which involves taking drugs, sex and gambling. It’s not exactly a rockstar / high roller lifestyle per se but let me fill you in. 

Background:  Since moving back to my home city after living in a regional town for work (was there for 14 months) I have fallen into this particular reoccurring pattern every 3 months. 

That pattern is: taking prescribed medications to increase my focus and mood throughout my working day and then at night I either exercise, play poker or have sex with a girl. 


Drugs: I take dexamfetamine as prescribed for my idiopathic hypersomnolance (unexplained excessive daytime sleepiness) as I was not able to function at work. I went through a series of sleep studies to get this. I suspect this actually originates from starting work (I work in health)  at 7am-4pm Mon-Fri, then on the weekends I will stay up all night until 4/5am playing poker or going out meeting girls. Falling out of a normal sleeping routine I really struggled to function at work at (1-3pm) because I am a morning person. So I take a Dex to “get me through”.  Coffee doesn’t work and is a very mild stimulant for me (I’m 188cm/98kg), so Dex works best. I’m not dependant on them as it varies, but when I take them it’s like the movie limitless. Let’s fkn go.  Occasionally I’ll smoke weed (1-2x/week) which I am sure doesn’t help my mood in the long run. 

Girls: In the past months I have had girls come and go, and they’ve all gone because of me and my inability to commit. My first girlfriend of 7 years(16-24) dumped me because she “lost feelings” because all I did was play PC games. But honestly, I don’t want a relationship, commitment or any bullshit associated with it. I just wanna hang out, have sex and go back to my hobbies such as exercising and playing poker. It seems as though I have to spend time and effort to make the girl like me (because girls like feeling wanted and love, I get it that’s a normal human thing). When she finally does like me I instantly don’t like her or don’t want her. It’s like climbing a mountain. All this effort to getting to the top and then once it’s accomplished it’s like oh cool, whatever. Then I have to make up some bs about I don’t want to see the girl anymore. I feel like I’m kicking a rugby conversion with a girls heart as the ball. Some of them hit but most of them miss. Of course, this makes me feel like shit and I’ve just used someone. But when things finally  smooth over and we cease talking to each other im straight back to the clubs looking for another victim. 

Poker: I study poker as much as I play and it’s got to a point where it is supporting my main income. I don’t ever let anyone manipulate when and how much I should play and that is also a reason I’m unable to commit to a relationship. I don’t have the spare time to go to the fucking markets on a Saturday morning and do couple things. I’d rather spend that time studying and working towards improving my play at poker which might provide more opportunity at life. I also don’t have any intention of getting married until I’m 35+( I’m 26), because I don’t want to live with regret of not doing something I wanted to when I was young so I don’t want to limit my potential or opportunities. I am moving to Vegas in 8 months to have a crack at playing full time.  Every time I’m with a girl I’m thinking I could be spending this time playing or studying. The bonus is I get to bed at a normal hour so I can recharge my batteries, ready to stay awake till 4am playing poker. 

Conclusion: I’m not addicted to the Dex or weed and I only drink alcohol when I go out. I don’t crave sex everyday but I certainly enjoy the process of tuning someone, I see it as an art or skill. I feel bad when I crush a girls heart because I’ve worked her up where I then run away. Outside of work, poker is my life and no ones gonna stop me from pursuing my hobbies. Explaining to a girl that I play poker semi- professionally is challenging as girls like stability and security.  

TLDR: I take focus enhancers to help me function during the day to combat my poor sleep schedule which is derived from playing poker till early morning every weekend. Somewhere amongst this, getting my dick wet is a temporary priority. 

Anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do? Or is it simply a matter of: “it’s my life, live life on my terms and fuck anyone else’s opinion?”",18Sep2019,1

319,"Hey guys, 18M here in college in Australia.

Let me start by saying that this teacher, we'll call him J (23), is usually pretty friendly. He gets along with students, has inside jokes and alike. He's not afraid to swear in front of/at students, but it's always in a joking manner. Never to be hostile. I'm in one of his classes and I would have, until today, considered us good friends. I trusted him. He's also big, like 6'4.

Well today I noticed I didn't have my wallet, and I started retracing my steps around the school to find it. When I got to one of the computer labs, J was in there with another student. The door was locked so I knocked and asked if I could come in. J told me to fuck off, and I assumed he was joking around. This wasn't the first time I'd been in pretty much this exact situation, and he's joked around before.

So I pressed it, saying I'd only be 5 minutes, and as a joke I said ""I'd promise to pay 100% attention in his next class if he opened the door"". He got up to open the door and that kind of solidified that it was a joke for me, like he was playing along. Anyway after this he opened the door and prodded me backwards with a metal rod and told me to go away. I again told him I'md be a few minutes and he jabbed me again a little harder this time. I thought that this joke was going pretty far even by his standards but still played along. I jammed my foot in the door and basically wouldn't leave. This was when he grabbed me by the back of my neck, strangulation style, and started forcing me down the corridor. I told him that ""J this jokes gone far enough it's not funny anymore"" and he hissed in my ear ""how the fuck can you not tell that I'm not joking"" and then tried to push me down the stairs at the end of the corridor. If I hadn't grabbed on to the railing I would have gone down.

This was when the other student stepped in and took me aside and told me ""I'm kind of in deep shot right now and J's actually pretty pissed. Probably just leave for a while"". So I grabbed my bag out of another room and left.

When I got to the bottom of the stairs J was behind me and asked to talk for a minute. He pulled me aside and said he was ""sorry it got physical, but how the fuck could you not tell it wasn't a joke?"" and I replied that that was the kind of dumb shit he always does as a joke. I told him I was just looking for my wallet and he let me search the room, and I went on my way.

I was shaken up for the rest of the day. Now that I can reflect on what happened knowing that he wasn't joking, I've never seen him that angry before. I haven't seen many people that angry before. In my opinion, no matter how angry someone gets they should never lay hands on someone else. I'm pretty sure what he did would be a fireable offence, as well as probably assault by law. I have a few friends who could back up my story, and possibly the other student, but he and J get along very well. It's also J's second year of teaching since graduating, and he's normally friendly, so is it worth ruining his career over this?",18Sep2019,3

323,"I've been talking with her for a while and not too long ago became official. We're in our 20's and in college. She has a very messy past, but I've always overlooked it because I have strong feelings for her and the past is the past, shes done a lot of drugs to experiment, had lots of sexual encounters (shes bi), compared to her I've done nothing like that. I'm not a boring person but I refrain from drugs as I'm in a nursing program (they test for clincial sites) and I don't really drink, also I have a good sexdrive, but hers is way higher. 
She recently opened up about something that made me feel very upset. We never spoke in high school so we didn't know about our group of friends, but she told me about a certain time she went to a party that had lots of drugs and alcohol, she was a sophomore and someone took advantage of her, she told me she didnt know how to say no, and that she was under the influence. She also told me she cried right after and that the guy sorta implied not to let anyone find out. She then tells me that guy still hung around her group of friends and pretended nothing happened. 
When she told me his name I got a lump in my throat and a deep feeling of anger and resentment. He was the shit head that would tell me things for no reason. He keyed my truck in high school, pulled one of my gfs in middle school towards him and hugged her, and threw gum in my hair in high school. I always retaliated but he continued. And now that he ""used"" the girl I like so much I seriously wish the worst for him. Why is it that even years after not seeing him he seems to ruin something for me. I know it's not my gfs fault, i know it's the past, but damn this infuriates me and it makes me feel a little different about her. I know I shouldn't blame her for anything, and I dont, but feel down I ask myself why she couldn't just push him away and leave, or not be under the influence to  see the situation she was in. Idk I probably sound like a jackass, but I feel it somehow  could've been prevented. Is what I'm feeling normal? I HATE him, like with a passion. I wish he never touched my girlfriend, I wish he wasnt a douchebag, I wish he didnt exist.


TL;DR
A guy that always bothered me through out middle school and high school took advantage of my current gf back in the day, just found out about it and it makes me feel upset and mad at everything, including my gf even though it wasnt her fault.",18Sep2019,1
324,"THIS IS LONG

To start, I'm a field technician in IT and Security services. I used to work at a few different wholesale and refurbishing warehouses dealing with technology. So that explains why I have connections to the following scenarios.

I've got a couple things I want your take on. I'm going to explain three scenarios. Your opinion and belief on the following actions and ideals portrayed would give me deeper insight and possibly benefit others.


Scenario #1 -

As stated before about my type of work, I bring in customers sometimes. Or attempted to rather. Though most haven't followed through just yet.

I'll shoot a few numbers and certain deals.

A $5.2k one time setup of a whole group of computers was offered at one point. What would you say a fair rate of commission as the employee who brought this customer in would be?

We have a monthly service pack that we offer to our customers at about $500 a month. If I bring in this customer and they apply for this monthly contract.. how do you go about commission for that? Would you do 3-6 months of a lower % rate? Lifetime? 


Please share your honest and guided thoughts.



Scenario #2 -

An old contact of mine as well as a former employer in the wholesale technology industry has a warehouse full of tech. All kinds, servers, computers, even down to the most obscure things such as gas masks and police gear. 

He's a nice man, but when it comes to business he's very different. He has a secret greed to him, though not heavy. Props to him as he tries at times to be generous, or so I think. 

Me, a field tech working for another company at this time have some contacts that want products. I tell him about what they need and how much they need, etc. Then I finish it off with I want commission out of it. This is where things stir up a bit. 

I tell him that I want %10. He says normally people ask for lower numbers, I tell him this is a one time commission as I know he will be buying more. 

Moving on he starts telling me the prices for the items and tells me I need to add my commission on top of the prices. This is where I'm a bit baffled.

Normally wouldn't you have a set price for something and give commission of that set price? Especially when they couldn't find the customer without you, you're essentially responsible for giving them that business?

It makes me not want to do business with him considering if I add my commission, people won't buy for those prices.

Please share your thoughts.


Scenario #3 -

My employer often does pricing and invoices for his customers for products. Sometimes I do it. 

For example we have a whole 6-7 pallets of small computers worth about $180 for each computer.

My employer always tells me that you need to offer customers retail prices. Those same computers he offers customers at $330-350. Whereas I see it as an overpriced attempt to make profit on the customers ignorance.

 I even sent some of those numbers to one of my known clients. He's tech savvy and know when to strike a deal and what's fair. He asked me, why so expensive? I can get this same system with a monitor and warranty for much cheaper. And followed duly by sending me a link to the original pricing someone was selling it for.

Please note those aren't new computers, they're USED. Which makes it all the more overpriced.

I'm not sure whether this is a reasonable business practice or if it's just an attempt at profit on ignorance. 

Please share your thoughts. Anything is appreciated!",18Sep2019,1

328,"Hey guys, again sorry for poor formatting I'm on mobile.

So this summer I completed my BMQ course (boot camp for Canadian forces) and just need two more courses before I'm completely qualified. The only issue is I'd like to make the military a full time career and the province I live in only has a reserve unit.

What all my superiors and work friends keep telling me to do is to stick with reserve until I become a Corporal and then switch over to an infantry reg force unit after so I dont have to do my training all over again. 

While this seems like a smart thing to do, reserve only pays me once a week and one weekend a month for training so I'll still be bouncing part time work while not making much progress since training for reserve is only available at certain points during the year for 2 of the courses I need.

I'm super torn guys any advice is welcome.",18Sep2019,1
329,"I’m a 25 year old male. Just 2 weeks ago I started to have symptoms of feeling spaced out. I’m Struggling to focus and have the feeling like I’m in a dream almost. I feel out of it and struggle focusing on things. I feel as if Im in tunnel vision but not able to focus on things. It feels like nothing is real to me. I feel mentally slower and it’s hard for me to focus. Its even hard to focus when I drive. The feeling has not gone away.

I’m not having any other symptoms like night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, fever, unexplained weight loss, headaches, or memory loss. I saw my doctor a week ago and he thought it could be ear related since I’ve had many ear surgeries and told me to take some mucinex pills and nasal spray. Neither has worked so far after a week of trying. I’m not sick, stuffy nosed, or have allergies...

I’m worried that I’m getting the starts of CJD. A neurological disease that could be passed on from chronic wasting from infected deer. I hunted in Wisconsin in a Chronic wasting disease infected county with low rates for the past 5 years. Last deer we got was 2 years ago and we never got it tested. 

I’m seriously worried this is the start of dementia and that I’m slowly starting to lose my mind. This feeling just came out of no where 2 weeks ago. Should I go back to my doctor? I’m absolutely freaking out and feel like I’m losing my mind. I can’t focus and feel dazed. I’m very emotional as well which has never happened. 

Should I be concerned? What do I do?",18Sep2019,1
330,"I’ve had this uneasy feeling for a few years now about whether I should try out therapy or counseling. I go back and forth between thinking I would have nothing to talk about and then imagining conversations of all the things I could say. 

I’m a 23yo female, I haven’t really experienced a Big traumatic event that would clearly warrant therapy and so I feel like I almost don’t deserve to go? 

Something that I’ve considered going to talk about is my sexuality, as I am out to some of my friends and my sister as Not Straight but am unsure about what label I fall into and have a lot of insecurities about my lack of experience and general confusion about my own identity. I have a really hard time saying things out loud, for many of my friends I came out to them over text. I know I shouldn’t want to have to put myself in a box but I hate being so unsure of who I am as a person. 

I’m also very anxious about the future, I have a college degree that I am not using and have spent over a year having “fun” seasonal jobs that I’m able to do because I’m fortunate enough to have my parents financial help. I know that I can’t do this forever and the thought of having to apply to “real” jobs after my seasonal job ends next spring makes me incredibly anxious. Right after I graduated college was one of the worst times, I couldn’t bring myself to follow through with many job applications but when I wasn’t doing them I felt worthless and like I was wasting my life. The thought of getting the jobs was even worse, I’m worried that there aren’t any jobs using my degree that I will be good at/enjoy in the least. 

There are probably other things... I don’t know. My parents are very loving but not very good communicators and therapy is not normalized in my family. My sister has her Masters in social work and is supportive of the concept but as far as I know has never participated. I love my parents but I grew up being almost scared of emotions and very uncomfortable seeing them in other people... if I ever have kids or even in relationships I don’t want the same to happen. 

 Also if I were to miraculously follow through with finding a therapist I’m worried that it would be super tough for me to open up to a stranger since I’ve never done anything like that. Except right now. Haha. I’m a lot better at typing hard things out to people than saying them out loud. 

Should I try going to a counselor or therapist? I feel like since I’ve had a very privileged life and am doing okay for the most part I’m not warranted to be there, I know logically that’s not true but has anyone else felt that way? What has been your experience with therapy? This is crazy long. Sorry y’all. 

tldr; I’m in a weird, confusing spot in life and don’t know if therapy would be helpful. And I’m scared of it!",18Sep2019,5

332,"Ever since I started working at this restaurant, first job ever btw, I have been getting disrespected over and over. If it’s the customers I wouldn’t mind because that’s what u expect from them, but no, it’s my managers and supervisor. Examples of that you ask? Sure!

1.) first day on the job, I was learning on the cash machine out front when a manager -not the one training me- pushes me aside and yells at me for not knowing what to do,, even though I started 30 mins ago. Same manager has been yelling at me for stupid reasons ever shift, ie. too many coins in my till, not knowing something that hasn’t been shown to me yet, etc.

2.) three weeks in, my supervisor tells another manager to pull me aside and tell me I smell, because she’s too impressed to tell me herself. I would like to point out that I, infact shower twice a day (morning after the gym, night before bed) and I always get compliments on how I smell good when sometimes I’m not wearing perfume. So to say the least I was shocked, but what they failed to tell me was that the register I have been standing above the whole day actually has a sewer hole under it, so they’ve been just smelling shit the whole time. But me being the stupid bitch I am I still went to work every shift with a smile on my face and fuckton of mans and women deodorant and perfume on me.

3.) last straw was today actually. I told my boss 2 weeks in advance that I need today off because I’m picking up my aunt from the airport a few cities away because she’s literally immigrating here, and she said she understood. But yesterday I found out through a coworker that I was actually scheduled today (I didn’t check because I haven’t been working all week and she doesn’t post it on the board till like,, three days before the shifts you’re supposed to get). So I called in and told her this morning and she told me “it’s not a good enough reason, find someone to take it because you can’t just tell me u can’t come in.” This was over a 3 hour shift on our slowed day. She seemed to forget that her daughter calls in 10 mins before every shift telling her she can’t make it because she doesn’t want to, making me take all those shifts.

I want to quit due to the fact that this is just causing me to stress and cry after every shift. 

TLDR; I have been disrespected and embarrassed by my supervisor and managers, should I write a letter or resignation that says how I feel or should I just call and tell them I’m not coming in to any more shift?",18Sep2019,1
334," Okay so long story short I have had the most toxic job / internship on the planet. It is in healthcare. My previous boss was this really racist / stupid person who thought she was incredibly intelligent. She would send me wrong dates, addresses and instructions and then make up things that I had done wrong - picking on me.I told her about this nurse who was acting unprofessional and next thing I know she invents a reason to give me a warning. I told her she was retaliating. She stopped doing it. Two months later she left the job as she had somewhere else to move to (internship was over for her).  


She got replaced by this guy who from the start took her side. There was a time where both of them completely changed character and tried to say racist / odd things and I didn't build upon them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways this guy has since been asking me personal questions since then. What time I clocked in, what time I clocked out. When I graduated high school. Which month I was born in. Even asked me to hang out with him. All the while never admitting to anything the previous lady said. She said things like ""men are bad at finding good deals"" and ""I hate koreans because bla bla"". Now the last few weeks the other two nurses (the nurse I complained about long ago) had been acting like bitches so I sort of sent him a text message to have it on file. But since then he has been interrogating me even harder. Is it possible that he is recording me and if I misspeak he will put an edited recording on internet? or perhaps get me fired using an editing recording? he got me into a political debate and I just said many american troops died in korean war and that also indians kill alot of people every year over eating beef. We were talking about how people may murder for something trivial. But I feel like he is up to something. He even told me things like how he didn't like violent video games. Is it possible that he is going to get me in trouble via recordings? or perhaps ruining my social reputation?  
I do have bad anxiety but I have also heard him saying terrible things about me behind my back. Anxiety is killing me man.  


Btw what those nurses did was put a bag with a rotting piece of meat right next to me.",18Sep2019,1
335,"Not only does it feel like burning, but it physically burns my skin leaving it red and painful.

336,"One of my friends is *really* into theater. Like, he goes to see shows whenever he can, sometimes more than once during a run (I think he mentioned he once saw a show eight times during its run), his Instagram is basically a Playbill account, bottom line is that he lives and breathes theater.

And then there's me. I got really into Hamilton a couple years ago, and just recently I tried listening to In The Heights and Be More Chill. But when I told Theater Friend that I was trying a few new shows, he immediately started recommending that I listen to Spring Awakening, Rent, Aida, Dear Evan Hansen, all these different things, a few of which I was planning to listen to anyway but most of which I've never even heard of. And today, after I told him I might not listen to any more for a while cause I'm starting college, he offered to make a list of all the ones I should check out.

I know he's got good intentions, he loves theater and he's just trying to share his interests, but it seems like he's projecting a little too much, as if he's trying to shape me into someone as passionate as himself.

I'm fine with listening to shows casually, but I don't want to be who he wants me to be, I just want to be myself and appreciate theater but not obsess over it.

I was about to be blunt and say ""Remember that I'm not you, you're kind of projecting, I can't handle all these recommendations, I don't want even more recommendations, I told you I was going to be really busy with college, and frankly I'm not even interested in some of what you're suggesting."" But I felt like that would be too rude.

So, how do I tell Theater Friend what I said above? Am I gonna have to be blunt and brutally honest, or is there a better way? I feel like I'm overthinking this, maybe I should just be straightforward before he takes this much further, but I'm just not sure how to proceed.",18Sep2019,1
337,I just stumbled upon this website called parts-people.com. Wanted to check it's authenticity. Is there a subreddit for checking authenticity of websites or is this the best place to ask ?,18Sep2019,1
338,"A bit of background:

I'm gay and came out right before my 18th birthday (accidentally and not in a good way) and I expected shit to go down but everything went fine and It was never really an issue (seriously it was so anticlimactic I waited for the other shoe to drop for ages before I realised nothing bad was going to happen) with anyone even though our parents (and community) are very conservative (I didnt actually realise until my second year of college that my brother had been secretly defending me and fighting my battles for me both at home and just in general pretty much keeping everyone off my back and essentially making them be nice to me)

So needless to say... me and my older brother are super close. He is 3 years older than me, and has been my hero for pretty much my whole life. Whenever I've had a problem he has always been there for me and has even cut people out of his life because they said negative things about me. I've done the same for him and even though we live further apart now that we're older (I moved to a big city and he's settled in our home town whenever he's back from deployment). 

It should now be mentioned that he has been dating a girl from our hometown for like 12 years on and off (since they were 16) - she was always super nice to me and I liked her quite a lot. I always believed she was a good match for my brother so I was super ecstatic when they got engaged. 

I should also mention that about 9 months ago I ended up working with a boy from our home town in the city (the same boy who I used to hook up with and who ended up being part of how I messily came out to literally everyone), our companies were working on a collaboration, so we ended up working together and then we ended up reconnecting.

Ok so here is the situation:

My brother is getting married in a little less than 4 months. He has just finished his final tour and I had some long service leave piled up so I decided to go home for a few weeks. I was talking to my bf about the wedding and everything (I didn't even realise until then that we had never talked about it before but we honestly dont really talk about our home town because bf didn't leave on good terms). As we were talking I pulled out my phone to show him a picture of me, my bro and his finacee ... everything seemed fine at that point but then started acting weird when I saw him the next day. 

After some miscommunication in which I thought he was trying to break up with me (which was legit a low point in our relationship) he explained that he and my brother's fiancee had history. She had heavily come onto him and he kept shooting her down. Eventually he told her he was gay and she said some horrible things to him and essentially told him that he just needed a good woman to show him how to be straight. When he told her to back tf off she tried to blackmail him and when he refused to pay her, she eventually told his family and their buisness partners that he was gay which essentially lead to him being disowned and kicked out of the family buisness (leading him to the city and his job and eventually right back to me). 

I was shocked and didn't want to believe him because like I said she had always been super nice to me and we've never had an issue. I told him I needed time to process and he offered to show me the chat since it all happened over fb two years ago. The messages were honestly horrible and l am still shocked that someone would say and do half the things she had done. 

So here is my dilemma because I dont know if I should tell my brother all of this. On one hand ... It was two years ago and she could have changed and it technically doesn't have anything to do with him. On the other hand I dont want my brother who is quite literally an angel in human form to be stuck with someone horrible because I didnt tell him. There is also the fact that because it was two years ago I dont know if they were on an off period when she started trying to chat up my bf (if she then she was technically trying to cheat) ... also the blackmail part has me super worried but again maybe it was all the circumstances and she didnt actually mean to go through with it...

This has been tearing me up inside for the last few days and I'm heading home day after tomorrow to see my brother. I dont want to ruin his life and I honestly have no idea what to do...

TLDR: I found out that my brother's finacee sent messages to my bf two years ago and idk if i should tell my brother.",18Sep2019,2

342,"I’ve been out as a gay man for the better part of a decade. I’ve always been into the same sex. I’ve never really found an interest in females past a semi-platonic relationship. However, I was out of town with some friends from college who live in another state. They brought a girl with them who I have never met. From the moment I saw her there was this gravity I felt toward her unlike anything else I’ve felt. I was enthralled by everything she said. I wanted to hear more stories, laughter, see her smile, everything. We have so much in common and even the things we don’t share the same experiences with, I’d love to explore with her. I’ve not felt like this toward another person before and it’s kind of scary. We both seem to hit it off but I’m unsure if her side was just filled with the “gay, best friend” vibes. 

I’ve been out for a very long time and I truthfully don’t know how to approach the situation. I’m slightly worried about how friends, family, etc. would take the “news” of me finding a woman attractive. I’m even more unsure of how to go about talking to her about it.

344,"To be clear, I would NEVER fuck with somebody’s relationship. That is not my right and completely unfair. 

Currently, we work right next door to each other. We spend a lot of time doing work related things together and I find her such a joy to be around. Here’s where is kinda gets tricky.

In any normal situation, I would say unequivocally that I should keep my damn mouth shut. Thing is, my work is arranging staff positions for next year. I’ve requested to work next to her again and she has more or less done the same. From her perspective it’s likely because we work well together and she enjoys my company. 

But now I’ve started thinking, is it wrong of me to request staying around her when really the request is motivated by romantic feelings? And if she doesn’t know, she’s requesting the same without all the facts.

I am very conscious of speaking positively about her boyfriend and if she explains a fight they’ve had, I’ll defend him if it sounds like he was in the right. I am not in the business of breaking up relationships for my own selfish motivations. In my eyes I have three options:
- ask to be transferred away from her (which unfortunately would cause me to distance the friendship, which on its own I value very much)
- tell her that I have feelings for her but still want to work with her as friends and colleagues and let her decide (which I can’t help but feel is an unfair thing to dump on her) 
- just keep my mouth shut and continuing enjoying working with her, admiring her from afar haha.

361,"Hey guys so basically, every time I go on a night out with my best friend, it seems like everyone in the room gravitates towards him and wants to be his friend. But when I try talking to people and making friends it’s almost like they see past me and just aren’t interested. It makes me wonder what’s wrong with me ? And this is no hate towards my best friend because he’s genuinely the best person ever and I’m not surprised people love him, but why not me ? For example last night we were in a group talking to girls we didn’t know, and he walked away and as soon as he did the girl just started giving me short answers and then left to try and find him. It just makes me feel really sad because I genuinely don’t know why I’m not good enough for people and it’s hard always being around him when he’s in such “high demand” and I’m always just there. It also happens with another friend of mine everyone loves her and wants to get to know her (I literally heard people last night pointing the two of them out and saying they want to be friends with them) and I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I try to be just as nice and outgoing but it never seems to work.",18Sep2019,2

I was never that social in high school (save for one or two other losers that hung out with me), so socialization scares the fuck out of me. I have no clue where to start with meeting anyone, and I overthink literally everything to the point of missing sleep, which sucks because I actually like talking to people whenever the situation arises.

Just a little background.. My uncle is 70 and a very heavy smoker and has since he was a teenager, he is slim to average weight and has a history of high blood pressure. Also has a horrible sweettooth for jams and sweet preserves, will eat 2-3 jars a week. Anyways... I found out a few days ago he was struggling to breath very early in the morning. He was not allowing his wife to call an ambulance and after almost an hour she finally convinced him to go to the hospital. Just as they arrived he said he felt better and didn't want to go inside to get checked out so he made her drive him home. She told me she had begged him to go in but he kept refusing, apparently there was a big argument in the car while in the hospital carpark. She said his reason was the building was too big and the walls are too thick, and they deliberately make it that why so they can trap you inside and take your organs. She was saying no one wants your organs... I know.. Sounds nuts. Anyways, i just want some advise on what can be done?  And what kind of danger he is putting himself in? He is super stubborn and maybe a little paranoid. We are from Australia.",18Sep2019,1
366,"I used to be friends with my best friend's (let's call him D) ex gf (let's call her A). We're not anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

I love them both and I will NOT, I repeat, I WILL NOT, choose sides. Please do not try to make me. I just want peace. Basically they were together on and off for 3 years. He abused her mentally and physically. A's father died when they were together, which saddened not only her, but D, too. It became a unhealthy relationship. A also had anxiety which put more strain on their relationship. D also lost his job for a whole year that time. D was going through so much stress with life and being with A and he let it control his anger. He lost control and ended up accidentally abusing her...

&amp;#x200B;

They broke up officially 2 years ago and went no contact. I loved them both, and I believed D could change. It bothered A that I remained friends with D. I get it but I am MY OWN PERSON who can be friends with who ever I want. She cut me off a year ago... she ignores me now. I feel like shit... she got a new boyfriend 2 years ago, and they are still together today. I hope she's happy. Her boyfriend is my colleague and I can tell he hates me. It fucking hurts... so bad... I sort of hate him... but as long as she's happy. D will find someone too... someone better for him too.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been supporting D through his journey of healing and change. He has changed tremendously. He is a much calmer and nicer person now. There were times he lashed out with friends, due to missing A, but with time he always gets better. Everything is peaceful. Change is a process.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the drama played out. So my ex boyfriend (who is friend's with A) has been receiving harrassment through fake accounts on social media. He confronted me thinking it's D. I am aware this is something D would do in the past, but it is THE PAST. A friendly bird told me A said that it's probably D doing it. So I confronted her at school. I admit I was really mad. I know D better, especially since he has changed. HE WOULD NOT DO THIS. I know him well, more than A at this point. I expressed that I did not appreciate her accusing D like this. That I have the right to defend my friend, and how I thought she can be so much better than this. All I want is peace but she keeps a grudge. She reacts super mad and defensive, it was the first time I ever seen her so mad and mean. She brought up the past and things that didn't even matter. Then she just walks away when i try to say my part...

&amp;#x200B;

I get it she's defensive. D wouldn't leave her alone for some time after the break up but he has left her alone now, and he has MOVED ON and CHANGED.

&amp;#x200B;

God I hate this drama. I hate A's attitude and her fucking ugly boyfriend... I hate my ex... all I want is peace... but that will never happen right?

&amp;#x200B;

I, in no way, support D's abuse in the past. I support his will to change and be a better man. Please try to see my point of view...",18Sep2019,0

I'm curious and assume other people are like this and wont to know if there is a name to it. Anyways, I think I have a phobia of watching people get hurt or get needles put in. Not hurt as in punches but I mean flesh wounds, like cutting or stabbing. I also don't really like looking at what insides look like. I am completely fine if it is a zombie, I have no reaction, but when it comes to humans I can't handle it I will quickly have to look away and it feels as if it happens to me, I'm not grossed out by anything but its more that I feel it happening to me, not physically hurting me obviously but I feel extreme discomfort and it takes it a minute to go away. A perfect example of this is that I was watching the movie called *The Dirt* with a couple of friends. The first scene I couldn't watch was \*spoilers I guess\* when someone cut their arm, with a knife really deep oh my gosh, just thinking about it now made me cringe for lack of better words. My friends could watch it just fine. Second scene I was grossed out in was when someone was putting a needle in their arm and it was a pretty long scene, about a minute maybe a little less. I couldn't watch any of it and had to ask my friends to tell me when it was over, and yes, the continued to watch, unfazed. I'm just curious if this has a name or at least if anyone else is like this. I feel like its not uncommon to be like this, but I don't know, I have a subjective opinion because I can't understand how people how can withstand that.

373,"I’ve been dating my partner for almost three months now. He’s the first person I’ve ever felt as if I could possibly see a future with. There is just one minor issue. I feel we are the complete opposites. We are both introverts. He’s a video gamer and I enjoy browsing the web and reading. He likes to long board and I like walking. I’m not a talkative person and neither is he. I often think that a lack of conversations can imply that we maybe we don’t vibe well together.

We truly do not have any common interests besides being intimate and physical together. We talk a lot about sex and how we both can improve or what we can try next. We both really enjoy cuddling and obviously touching one another. This fills the lack of conversations. To be truly honest, whenever we hang out, that is all we do. Whenever we message each other, all we talk about is sex, not sexting, but more so of what can we try next or what do one another likes. 

I don’t want that to be the only reason why we’re together. I have spoken to him before that maybe we might not have much in common and that it can lead to one of us possibly getting bored. His response was that we needed to spend more time outside of the bedroom together so that we can explore things together to find common interests. We’ve both been really busy so we do not see each other often. Maybe once a week if even and not for very long either. So by the time we see each other, all we want to do is just touch one another. I truly don’t mind that at all. I just don’t want that to be the only thing about our relationship. 

I guess I’m just looking to see if anyone has gone through this and if it’s okay that maybe that is what ties us together. I just feel that if we can’t talk about anything else due to no common interests, what do we talk about then when we run out of things to say about sex? When we are tired of talking about the weather? I really like him. I just don’t know if this could be a potential red flag.",18Sep2019,1

Need some guidance. Don't have any family to rely on and I think my bff would be against it. And so would my therapist - although she is super supportive.

\- I am a Jr FrontEnd Dev and I'd love to work remotely - do you guys have any suggestions on how to do that?

\- I also have a SCRUM Agile training. 

\- I have no college education - I started 2, but finished none.

My parents married young. They have no education and seem to have always been financially unstable for as long as I can remember. Thus, there's always constant bickering and fights. My whole life has been an unstable mess.

These past few years have been the hardest however as they feel I am now old enough to be pulled into their world of hurting.

A few days ago, I was on my dad's laptop and accidentally opened his email tab. I discovered emails from Tinder message notifications, various other dating apps and many Uber email updates asking for  him to rate his ride from our house to several destinations around our local area. I can't assume without evidence, I understand that, so I proceeded to go through his phone. There are images of him with several different women and some very explicitly sexual videos. He has been connected to his iCloud on his laptop since 2012 and more thorough scrolling has lead me to believe this has been going on for more than a good 5-6 years.

Normally, I wouldn't hesitate to tell my mother (or anyone for that matter) of a situation like this, especially when it affects me and my family. But there are things at stake:

1. My grandma just died 2 months ago so my mother is very fragile
2. I have 3 little brothers who may be impacted by a divorce and the breaking of a family
3. I don't want to have to be the bearer of bad news
4. It's not like my father loves her any less. He's a good guy and tries hard to please her but he just may not be attracted to her anymore.

389,"Tl;dr: still have a pompous glowing cramped pc gaming desk. Annoyed reaction of my gf made me consider getting a more discrete but powerful business laptop instead. Bit afraid that this will lessen my enjoyment though. 

Hello,

this is a difficult topic for me so please hear me out. 


I (m25) was always a gamer and it will always be a big part of me but I'm getting a lot more mature lately. I'm a lawyer since early 2019, have a fulltime job, got a new car replacing my 20 y/o trash college car, soon moving together with my GF, wearing a suit all day and going to college soon again for my masters degree.

The one thing screaming ""immature"" is desk completely stuffed with my 35"" Ultrawide monitor, huge orange and black glowing window glassed desktop tower filled with 2500€ worth of components and blue glowing mechanical keyboard.

My GF saw my setup for the first time a few days ago and had that annoyed ""are you serious?"" look.

So I'm not sure if I should sell my rig, and get a more business looking notebook which fits my current lifestyle better. A lot less power but enough power under the hood to play my games (a lot less time for it anyway) . If I'm getting tired of 15"" I can hook it up to my TV.

394,"I started high school at the beginning of this month.
I left junior high with a 98 average. I absolutely loved all of my teachers and they seemed to like me. I could go through an entire day without having to talk. The hallways weren’t constantly crowded and I was comfortable (to an extent) around most people. 
Now it seems like everything has been flipped over. I hate talking, an social situation because I really suck as it. I don’t know what to say so I go on auto pilot and be an idiot. I have a group of friends but to be honest I don’t think they like me very much. I only joined them last year because everyone thought I was depressed so my sister dragged me into it (it’s her friend group). 

I also have to talk because I don’t know 99% of the people at my school as they came from the other school which had a lot more students. My teachers force everyone to try to socialize and I don’t want to seem mean or hurt anyone’s feelings by simply not talking as I would normally do. It’s horrible. 

In science we have a group project of course, and I was put with literally the worst group. All the people I didn’t want to be put with, I was put with. We have to do a skit tomorrow in front of the class. We know what we’re doing (at least me and the girl who did the other half of the work do) but the others barely participate. We won’t get a 4 on the project because we had to get the teacher to tell us what to do (he was literally no help). That means that already my science mark had gone down. My science mark cannot go down. I *cannot* get below a 90, and already I’m probably gonna get a big fat 3 because of my worst nightmare - a group project. 

It’s not just science that’s probably dropping. I’m normally the top of my class in band. Band is my all time favourite subject. Now I’m in a big class (for me) with a bunch of kids that I don’t know. The teacher is really reluctant on the fact she thinks everyone knows exactly what she’s talking about and is perfectly ready to start playing what ever. Of course I keep messing up horribly and obnoxiously every time we do something simple. I know everyone in that class thinks I’m an idiot. I *know* it. The teacher does too. If my previous band teacher heard me playing, he’d be so disappointed in me. I’m
not supposed to be making such idiotic mistakes. No one else is, why do I have to be such an idiot? What do the kids in my band class that new me from last year think - there expectation for me is for me to be really good. What the hell am I doing? Why can’t I just think properly?

Sometimes people talk to me during class while the teacher is talking and I don’t want to make my teacher think I don’t pay attention but I don’t want to hurt others feelings by hushing them. My teachers probably think I’m one of those who talk to their friends and go on their phones during class all the time. 

I’m terrified (and I mean *terrified*) of raising my hand for anything. I tried once and I was shaking like crazy. I don’t want my marks to go down but I’m scared of anything that involves speaking or sharing my ideas, and it’ll likely stay that way for a little while.

 I have to get up to check my answers in math and sometimes put them on the board or share them with the kid next to me. The teacher keeps singling me out when checking our homework, asking if I need anything clarified (she doesn’t ask anyone else). I know the math perfectly but Texts are my only actual way of proving it, so my mark is probably gonna go down there as well.

There’s so much kids in this school. Everyone probably hates me. They probably think I’m gross and ugly. I’m usually really good with teachers but I feel super distant with the ones I currently have. I hate that. My grades are likely dropping and I’m socially an absolute idiot. My reputation is going deeper and deeper into the grave. What am I supposed to do?

397,"hi! so first off, it is nothing serious but i’m constantly thinking about it to the point that it stresses me out, heck, it even scares me a little for some reason but i’ll get to that part later. you see, one month from now on an event i’ve been anticipating since last year will occur from the 18 til the 21th and i genuinely don’t want to miss it! especially on its first day, but from the 14th til the 25th i’ll have an internship (30h hours each week) and my school  is very strict when it comes to absences. for starters i have to make 2 phone calls and let both, my school and the place where my internship will be held to inform them that i won’t be coming and then provide a solid reason why. i was gonna ask my teacher if i can readjust my schedule because i’d be more than willing to “work” more hours to make up for friday but i don’t know if she nor the ppl I’ll be working for are open for compromises. of course i could leave it for the weekend but i’ve been attending said event since 2012 and i’be made the experience that the most fun day to go has always been friday. do i ask? or should i call in sick after all? if i were to do the letter, i’d say that i was suffering from food poisoning to the point that i couldn’t even get out of bed hence why i didn’t see a doctor (1. so i can be present at the event starting from the very beginning 2.) his opening times are at 9am til 2pm). i’m very sorry if i sound pathetic but i really want to go! this event means so much to me but at the same time i don’t want to screw my chances of becoming a kindergarden teacher..",18Sep2019,1
398,"I need some direction. I had a massive heart attack last September. If it wasn’t for the circumstances, I would now be a former human. I was a firefighter for the last 24 years and I threw myself into the job. I worked my way up the ranks through promotional exams and night/online school to get my Bachelors. 

My wife still works full time (and she is 5 1/2 years younger than me), I have a 5 year old daughter and a 14 year old son, so I’m not exactly sitting around looking at the clock. I’m not lost, but I’m feeling some emptyness. I wish that therapy would work, I’ve tried 4 times over the last 15 years but the Irish catholic takes over and I walk away after an almost panic attack from sharing. 

I need a passion. My wife’s salary combined with my disability retirement pay (I was fighting a fire when I went down) is enough for us to pay our bills and continue our lifestyle, so I don’t need something that pays well or pays at all. I think that I need to care about something to give me a spark. 

The one and only criteria (criterium?) is that I will not make this activity more important than my family. This still leaves me with plenty of time during the day.

400,"When I was a kid, no older than 8 years old, I remember my dad used to love watching action and horror films. If anyone here is Latino or Hispanic, they know that late night movies on Hispanic TV channels were very gory, violent and explicit. 

My dad enjoyed watching movies involving people dying in a very elaborate manner, and I would be there sitting next to him and he would do nothing to stop me from watching. I might also mention that my dad was very physically abusive (I have lifetime scars from belt marks where he made me bleed).

I have vivid memories of serial killer movies, people getting their body parts severed, people suffocating with their hands tied behind their back and a plastic bag over their heads, people being strangled to death, people being suffocated with a pillow, drowned, stabbed, beaten, and other forms of death and torture. 

When I was in 5th grade I remember that the night before I went over my friend’s house, my dad had watched one of those films. I remember that when I was younger, my mind would constantly race with ways a person could die or be killed, in great detail. At my friend’s house, I surprised her with a question: “what would happen if you were taking care of an elder person and you put a napkin on their mouth and closed their nostrils so they couldn’t breathe so they can die?” My friend in her then innocence wasn’t startled, she kinda just brushed it off and said that no one would ever do that and we continued to play. 


Later on in life I developed a blood phobia that has had me pass out multiple times in doctor’s offices when my blood is being drawn (to which my doctor called me “dramatic”) and a fear of suffocating.

I never slept on my stomach, I never slept on my back in case someone came with a pillow over my face. Being restrained in any way, shape or form for too long makes me extremely uneasy. This includes hugging, even with my boyfriend.


I’m very sensitive to rough housing even if it isn’t done in a way to hurt me. When my boyfriend hugs me and puts his whole body over me, i quickly begin to panic and have shortness of breath and have to push him off. I can’t drive with my windows up all the way, or I feel claustrophobic. 

I’ve been watching Breaking Bad with my boyfriend and I can’t handle the events in the show. They’re too distressing for me and I’ve had nightmares every night and woken up 4 times during the night since watching the show.


What is wrong with me? My therapist said it’s just a phobia and something I’d grow out of if I eased myself into shows that were slightly violent. My doctor called me dramatic and did nothing about it. Do I have a problem? How do I fix it?


TLDR: I used to regularly watch gory and explicit death scenes on TV with my dad when I was a kid and now I seem to be traumatized by it but medical professionals say it’s not a big deal. Why am I so affected? Am I making it a big deal?",18Sep2019,1
401,"Hello everybody, I am now in the brink of losing my chance to be in the honor roll of our school all because of the subject mathematics. I barely survived last year's mathematics and now I really find it difficult and I'm losing hope. I was a top student when I was in elementary school and a consistent honor in my junior (high school) days. 
I asked my mom about it and she said she won't be disappointed as long as I perservere and to not neglect my studies. But it still makes me sad knowing and expecting that this will be the time I taste defeat as a student. Any advices on how to cope up with this situation?

403,"It's a question I suppose many ask but each have their own particular issues that make the problem and solution be unique to each one, so that's why I ask anyways. 

So, I'm 21 right now. Since teenagehood I'm depressed though things really hit the bottom in the last months. Before, I was depressed due to lack of friends, proper education and good family life, while I must say these three factors still exist, they don't affect me as much anymore, something else does, a neurological disorder I developed also around my teenagehood but that only now is making life particularly hard. 

 I don't actually know what I have, exams haven't been conclusive, but I know it's a pretty evil illness. It's been worsening ever since I acquired it, causing me tremors, twitches and perhaps also poor memory. Doctor thinks is a genetic, without-cure kind of thing and while I'm still trying to prove him wrong by requesting more exams, the situation is pretty loomy and the likelihood is that I'll just keep getting worse until I die and that is something I just can't get my head around. I've been trying for months, actually, over 2 years, but I just can't do it. 

I've always been someone particularly sensitive to illnesses, to this day I can even cry in just seeing blood on the TV for you to have an idea, so it's really tough to me, especially the thing I have kind of ruins the life I wanted to build. I wanted to be a fearless and successful guy, someone those I cared about could rely on, but my disease really makes that super difficult. First comes the embarassment. It happens whenever I'm talking to people, be it at an airport, college, work or whatever. Then is the sense of being weak, because that's really what I am. I talk to people and am shaking but when I feel I'm in a challenge, like the person doesn't agree with me or that I do is inherently difficult to be done, my shakes become even worse and after so long I think I just printed in my head that I shouldn't be in challenging situations (which comprise most of life situations) because it's going to worsen every base insecurity, weakness and shake that I have. So, to be clear, I shake regardless of what happens, even while being calm, but stressful situations make it worse. 

I quit university this June because I wasn't liking the course and because I was feeling too bad. Since then I should be studying for the entrance exam of my new course but all I've been doing up to now was feeling bad in my bad. This caused my GF to leave me because I wasn't being nice with her. I feel I have to change, I'm in this for far too long and I do have responsabilities, but again I just can't find a way out because no matter how much I want, I'll never be the guy I wanted to be, neither will I accomplish all the things I wanted to accomplish. 

I've already tried so much, so unless you give some thought to your responses, I think they're not going to be of much use. I'm sorry for being so blunt, but I don't want to waste anyone's time.",18Sep2019,1

405,"So I'm in high school and just sat my exams. My best friend told me today that someone told her that I cheated in the exam, wrote stuff on my hand and would hide them and stuff when teachers walked past. Now, this is not true. I did not cheat on the exam and even if I did, wouldn't write it on my hand which couldn't be any more obvious. I asked her who said that to her and she said that she promised her that she wouldn't tell me. We are best friends and if it were the other way around, I would've told her instantly who it was, no hesitation. I'm a person who keeps promises but if someone accused my best friend I would, of course, tell them that and who it was. I would trust and get the side of the story from my best friend not another girl in my class.  Just kind of doesn't feel that great thinking that she doesn't trust me. I mean we're best friends so it kind of just sucks and hurts a bit that she wouldn't tell me.

406,"I was raped/sexually assaulted when I was about 6-7 and I knew that it still affected me but the symptoms were always minor for example nightmares.

I've recently started ye old job search and ended up getting in touch with my younger brothers boss.

So my issue is that I've never had another job and Im not sure if im weighing the pros/cons correctly.

Current Job: 

Decent pay but I'm a dollar short of paycap(I'd share what I make but not sure if thats frowned upon) 

Weekly pay

Due to my knowledge/experience here I'm almost completely layoff immune (survived two +60man layoffs)

Nightshift 6pm - 4.30am
48hrs/wk (four 10s and an 8 of OT)
60mile trip to/from work/home (1hr drive)

I can float positions so i never get super bored
××××××××××××××××

New Job:

Starts $2hr less with room to grow to past my current paycap

20miles round trip

Dayshift 7am-3pm
40hrs/wk guaranteed any OT is hit or miss

No layoff protection

BiWeekly pay
××××××××××××××××

They both have similar benefits packages as well.


There's also a lot things to keep in mind that Im sure I'm missing because my work/jobhunting experience starts and ends with my current employer.  

Im mainly looking at this dayshift job because of the shorter trip and dayshift hours. My forklift Cert also transfers over to the new job.

Over the course of time we both began to feel a romantic undercurrent in our friendship, we were becoming more than just friends. We started sharing I love yous’ and all that kinda stuff getting more and more romantic by the day. One day she straight up asked me if I had feelings for her and I answered honestly and told her how I felt and that I hoped it wouldn’t change anything between us, she then told me she also had feelings for me since the time we first met! I was very happy when she told me that, but you see all my life I have been overweight and it wasn’t until the time we met that I had gotten into shape but I still have lots of self esteem issues and anxiety because of how harsh people were to me when I was fat. All my anxiety made me believe that if I tried to make me and her a thing she would change her mind and our relation would be ruined, so I never made my move :( She really is one of a kind and makes me happier than anyone. She’s beautiful, funny, smart, and she really takes the time to hear me out on whatever it is I’m telling her. So completely losing her would be terrible! She’s  posted online about this guy in her class she has a huge crush on and she really seems to be trying to pursue a relationship with him, I can’t blame her for getting tired of waiting for me to act. I really don’t know what to do or how to go about it. Things have gone from romantic to just friendly and I’m just agonizing over it because she used to post about me and how happy I made her and how much she enjoyed being with me, I’ve never shared something like this before but I hope I can get some advice on how to go back to the way things were :(

Matt and jenny arrived together, and they sat with me on the couch. Matt was joking with jenny about her favorite team and she fake hit him. She was like stroking him and it was funny. Later, jenny and alfred went somewhere I don't know, and I was alone with Matt. He was talking to me all the time, and when she left he came closer to me. He didn't hit on me or anything but it felt good idk. She (jenny) came back with my friend Alfred and she said something like: move. And sat between us. Later jenny suggested we go to her house watch movies. We were choosing what to watch and everyone was together on Jenny's bed. Then matt used the fake hit thing without any context for it on me. I don't know if he did it on purpose, or it was natural. Then people were hungry and we went to the supermarket. Matt just stuck with me chatting, while jenny and alfred were together far from us. When we got back in the car, jenny seemed very pissed. We watched some random stuff and it was  late, around 9:30pm so Alfred took me home. Im a lonely person so it was a very fun day for me. Matt is so cool, we get along so well, too well. Matt and jenny didn't show any kind of affection, it looked like they weren't dating at all, and Matt was much more interested in interacting with me. I talked about this with Alfred the next day and he confirmed my thoughts. I played some game with Matt, and we were chatting a lot online, then he stopped all of a sudden. I think they had a conversation, she wasn't feeling good about me maybe. And i can't get this out of my head, it isn't like I think about kissing him or anything. I just miss talking to him. Matt is that kind of person who you'll talk about literally anything. We just clicked. I may be in love with him? Anyways i know nothing will come out of it, i just want to forget about it.

421,"Hi just for background I’m (20 F) currently at uni and live with 3 friends. My living situation is actually pretty solid, we all pay rent on time, bills, etc. My issue is that I’m kind of the “glue” between all of us, which is fine but it does mean that when there’s issues between anyone I’m inadvertently involved because I’m everyone’s confidante. The reason I’m posting on this sub is because recently one of my flatmates has come to tell me that she’s fine being friendly with our last flat mate but they have nothing in common. Obviously it is what it is and I’m not mad at her for that but her reasoning is that apart from them just not being similar she feels like the other girl still sees her as “20 F’s friend”. This is patently untrue and I can’t help but feel like she’s pushing forward this narrative to distance herself from hurting the other girl who is super invested in deepening their friendship. At the end of the day I can’t control other people but I can’t help but wish that she never told me bc now I’m uncomfortable around them.

425,"Hi guys. I've had a rough few weeks. I've been trying to get into grad school and I was accepted by two universities. To make a long story short there have been some difficulties getting the correct documentation and visas so I may not be able to go this year. This isn't too much of an issue though because I am ready to start looking again, but the issue is with my parents. They are very christian people, some might say they're fundamentalist and I am an agnostic atheist. As we were experiencing difficulties during the application process my mom wondered if it was because I didn't have enough faith. I've tried to discuss my lack of faith with them, but I was always told I am a devil worshiper for not believing in God and for some of my hobbies. They've also made me cut contact with friends from university because they are convinced that they're all a bad influence for me. I did have a rough time last year at university, but most of my issues were because of grappling with how to navigate my lack of faith with them. I have been talking to the people who have been helping me out the most though. In the end I was able to finish and get my degree. So I've been pretending to be a christian until I am independent from them. Now a few weeks back, I was looking for accommodation for university on my phone. My mother was with me and she wanted to see what it looked like. I had to help my dad with something so I had to leave the room. When I came back, my mom and phone were gone and when I asked where she was, she said she was in her bedroom using the bathroom. I knew that she was looking through me WhatsApp messages so I just waited for the inevitable confrontation. A lot of words were exchanged but they essentially threatened to pull support for me going to university because I was a devil worshiper for being an atheist and for the conversations I had with my friends. So I just had to swallow my pride and say I was christian again. They have said they would help me go to university again, but they've also doubled down on their Christianity, always giving long speeches on how great God is and how god has helped them and me. So now I'm in a situation where I could spend 6 months to a year with them, pretending to be christian. They took away my phone, and threw out my controllers so I can't play video games. I do make music as another hobby, but it's either a waste of time for them, or they want me to make christian music. I also want to start writing something, but I fear that they'll want it to be christian oriented as well. So I'm just looking for advice on how to cope with this situation, because I cannot for the life of me figure out what to do.",18Sep2019,2
426,"Hi guys. 

(Suicide mention below btw) 

So the basic gist of this is i have a girlfriend that's not completely the healthiest when it comes to her mental health. That's okay, we've been together 2 years and while it's been an uphill battle she's made a lot of progress.

With that said, she recently moved from her native country to the United States (where I live) for school so we moved in together.

And the stress of moving away along with other stressors probably were the reason why she had a really bad freakout yesterday.

And so basically, I'll try to summarize it but we had gone into a bit of a disagreement that left her really sour. So at some point, she really lost her shit with me and basically started threatening to kill herself and also threatened to kill me if I went near her. 

I should also add I had no idea where she was or what she was planning on doing at this point 

So, since she's never made threats like that towards me before, I was kinda extremely freaked out at the fact she actually threatened to harm me. I ended up calling my mom who then told me to contact my girlfriend's mom

So I sent her mom an email with some screenshots of stuff my girlfriend was saying as well as told her I didn't know where her daughter was. Her mom basically had me call 911 to tell them that my girlfriend might hurt herself. 

And so at this point, my girlfriend found out I had told her mom about what was happening and was really upset with me. And at that point she kept saying that her life was over and she was going to leave her class and go find somewhere to end it. 

After that, this is around 3ish, I was really shaken up and basically decided I wasn't going to go to class since I didn't know where my girlfriend was and needed to find a way to to get to her. 

But I wanted to tell my teacher so I walked over to try to find him but ran into the department head. And I basically broke down in front of her because like I legit didn't know what the fuck to do man
 
So the department head suggested that I leave things to authorities and try to find somewhere safe. I should add she texted my teacher I had an emergency and couldn't make it. And then told me I should go to the counseling center and set up with them. 

And so at this point, It's 3:30 and I basically go and do that. cry to the counselor because idk where my girlfriend is, my parents are basically coming over to pick me up (they live an hour away), and I don't feel safe going to my apartment because of the aforementioned threats made. 

Anyways, in the end, my girlfriend came over to my school because she wanted to talk. I was really scared to go over to her, but ended up going anyways. We basically argued and talked until her mom called. 

And then talked and argued and I was able to get her to calm down. I ended up calling the police again to tell them i found her safe and okay. 

And um after that we agreed we'd get her some counseling and kinda made up. My parents didn't pick me up because I was really worried about leaving her alone.

And so I basically had to take care of her and bought her some dinner and then put her to bed when we got back. 

And um in the end, I basically missed class and didn't turn 3 assignments in. I don't really know what to tell my teacher now and I could use some help on what to tell him.  

(And for the record, my girlfriend is going to be getting counseling because this isn't okay and I told her that the only way I'd support her is if she got help. Which she agreed to do).",18Sep2019,1

I keep two handguns and two rifles in the flat. I enjoy target shooting and will do it most days. They are usually put away safely but occasionally I leave them out in my room if I’ve shot them that day.

This is where the problem starts! A few days ago My flatmate took one of the guns while I was out and pointed it at me as a joke when I walked past his room. I was obviously a bit alarmed but I knew he was joking so I didn’t think much of it.

The thing is, he’s started to make a habit of pointing the guns at me, even when they are loaded and cocked. I don’t want to overreact or anything but it’s really unnerving talking to someone who is pointing a gun at you. It’s just not funny anymore and I don’t know what to do.

What do you guys think I should say on this matter? I don’t want him to move out or lose him as a friend - it is difficult to find decent people to share with and I enjoy the time we spend together.

431,"So my birthday is coming up and my best friend and I had plans to go out of town if I wasn’t scheduled for work, but she recently made plans with her “man” to go to a concert on my birthday..... the work schedule isn’t out yet so we don’t know for sure but even if I work I’d work at night, so the morning is when we would do something fun but the concert is 12-3 so like literally she’s blacked out my birthday. When she told me about the concert I specifically asked her not to go and told her my birthdays important to me, but she’s going anyways because he got the tickets already.

Would you be mad? Am I overreacting? I literally HATE her man he’s the worst guy but is that clouding my judgment like is this not a big deal? 

Her response when I’ve brought this up recently was also “well he can get you a ticket” like as if I wanna spend my birthday with you and that loser at a concert third wheeling? It seemed like an obvious move to make it seem like she was trying, she knows I would never want to do that",18Sep2019,1

438,"Hello everyone, I need to vent/looking for advice, sorry about the long post! 

Recently my nephew got married (sisters son) his new wife is extremely selfish but I love my nephew so much I would help him anyway I can. My best friend is a photographer (she is really good) and I dabble in photography. I know my nephew and his wife couldn’t afford to hire a photographer so my best friend and I decided we would shoot their wedding for free (big mistake)! Two days before the wedding the bride messaged me and said “my cousin is a photographer, she is coming to the wedding and would like to take some photos” I said “After we are all done getting our shots she is more than welcome to take some photos, but I need her to wait.” She kinda got all pissy with me and said “fine I will just tell her she can’t take pictures, she was doing it as a wedding gift for us.” I told her if you want your cousin doing photos I will let my BF know and she won’t make the 5 hour trip down. The bride said nope I still want you and your friend to do them. Fast forward to the wedding...My friend and I were up very early following the bride and groom during their process of getting ready all while the brides mom and some of her friends were very rude to us but we kept a smile on our faces and kept going. We were with the bridal party and about 20 mins before the wedding was to start my BF said to the bride “the wedding is supposed to start in 20 mins and you’re not even dressed (the venue was a 20 min drive) the bride said “meh everyone will be there when I get there) leaving elderly and young kids in the very hot sun. The wedding was very unorganized so instead of me taking photos at the beginning I am running around trying to sort out music they forgot and hand out confetti they forgot (at the grooms request) but my BF was still taking photos. So immediately after the ceremony the bride and groom came up to me and said we were told you didn’t get a photo of the first kiss (here we go, the cousin was starting bullshit) we got many many photos of the first kiss! We were annoyed at this point but let it go and moved on...Picture time and all the grandparents left and went straight to the hall, no big deal we will get photos with them when we get there. So we start photos and this other photographer is standing behind my BF’s back taking photos (not good etiquette at all) so My BF start taking photos of the groomsmen and out of the corner of my eye I see the cousin taking all the bridesmaids. Then the bride comes up to me and says my cousin wants to take A Photo do you need me for a minute? What am I going to say no? She knew our terms and we asked that we get all our shots then after we were done her cousin can take as many as she wanted. Well the bride is gone for over 30 mins so my sister, brides cousin and bride had a few words (it didn’t go well) and now bam drama at the wedding. Now we are really late for the reception because everything is so far behind. We have families that are upset because very little family photos were taken (nothing we could do the bride was always missing) so then we make our was to the hall and there’s the cousin trying to take the bride again. At this point both my friend and I are feeling a lot of tension and drama and both of us want no part of it! I walked up to the bride and said we are feeling a lot of tension and drama and we don’t want that for your wedding day, if you would like we will graciously put away our cameras and your cousin can have a turn? Her reply “are you sure?” “Okay”. We were very hurt and upset but let it go and said nothing more. One of my family members said until they apologize I wouldn’t give them the pictures, the way you guys were treated was horrible. My sister and I talked about it and I said as much as I feel like doing that I would never keep them from her son. My sister and her son were fighting horribly the next day as she paid for everything and the bride nor the groom said thank you to anyone that made the day possible. So my sister in her true fashion was calling his wife horrible names and it got real bad, I was trying to support my sister and telling her there is a certain way to say things without being unkind. My sister clearly is bi-polar but will not seek help for it and denies having it! Last week my sister sends me a message asking where the f^*k the photos are? I told her wedding photos take anywhere from 3-6 weeks to finish we had over 1600 photos. Well she lost it telling me she is going to ruin my wedding, don’t fuck with her and she has been sending horrible messages to me calling me every name in the book. She said she will ruin my wedding like I ruined her sons. She then messaged my BF and said the same thing to her. My wedding is a destination wedding and my guests are paying a lot to be there, my sister has already paid for her trip and did not buy cancelation insurance. I don’t want her at the wedding and I don’t want her to ruin it for al my guests either. My fiancé nor his family deserve this. We will be in Mexico and my fiancé has said if she starts anything I will call the police and she will be removed but then I think that’s my sister. I am so torn what do I do?

443,"Hiya.

So  Some back story. My fiance and I have been together for about 5 and a 1/2 years a. We got engaged in April. The last few months have been trying, to put it lightly, mainly due to some changes that have occurred in our daily routine. On fortunately these changes have resulted in more fights than normal a, and her big thing is that I seem to always rag on her for things.


The issue is, she has no idea how many things she does That actually get under my skin.


Any one of these things would be potentially manageable if not compounded by all the other things that happen that frustrate me.

For instance. She has a nasty habit of leaving her laundry on the bathroom/bedroom floor, when we have a perfectly functional hamper to put said dirty laundry in.  I have mentioned this one in the past, it gets better for a couple of weeks and then she goes right back to doing it.

 In addition to the laundry she leaves in the bathroom, she leaves piles and baskets of clean laundry at the end of our bed. I try to make it a point for myself to put my laundry away at least once a week, but the pile that is now mounting here that I'm sitting next to  has not been put away in months.

Another example is her inability to put the shoes that she wears on a daily basis in the shoe rack I specifically purchased for her to house said shoes.  She is an atypical female in that she doesn't have a closet FULL of shoes, usually wears sneakers to work, flip flops when we go out.  But when we get home from wherever we were, or she gets home from work, the foot apparel she was using gets left wherever she kicks it.  One issue I have with this is that it's a tripping hazard, and because we live in very tight quarters we already have enough to trip on without having to worry about her sneakers. Another concern I have is when my 9 year old son leaves his sneakers in the middle of the floor she is 1 of the 1st people to say something to him about it, but then does the exact same goddamn thing.

 The biggest issue I have is the pile of garbage she leaves on her side of the bed. Again because we are living basically in a single Room, we have very little Room for anything, and because our roommates are slobs we don't venture into other parts of the house. This often means I eat dinner at my desk which is in our Room, and she eats in bed which ultimately creates a pile of garbage next to her on her side of the bed. One issue I have with this is the fact that I bought a kitchen sized garbage can so that there would be a place to throw said garbage, and more often than not I find myself once again picking up after her and when she comes home and realizes I have done so, does not thank me and then within a few days has a new pile of garbage piling up.  This is a major issue for me also because I have come home to mice in our bedroom more than once rummaging through the  pile of garbage she leaves...

Add to this list that when she eats in bed she drops crumbs and then there are crumbs in are goddam bed, something that I complain about frequently and she laughs off, I'm not a happy camper.

I recently posted on another sub reddit about other issues that she and I are having, this happens to just be a piece of the puzzle, and I'm really starting to 2nd guess whether we should continue saving for a wedding and saving for a house, because when everything is said and done I'm not going to live like this in my own place.

I have tried bringing just about everything in this list, and I'm sure some things that I'm forgetting, up to her at 1 point or another, usually she apologizes says she'll do better, does so for a few days or weeks, and then shit reverts back to how it is right now. 

 Given  Nature of our relationship as of late, I haven't mentioned anything recently, but when everything is said and done anytime I do mention it it immediately turns into how she's a crapy girlfriend or fiance. Self depreciation does not fix the issue it just frustrates me and makes it turn into a fight.

Any advice that anyone could give would be greatly appreciated because I am at my wits end.",18Sep2019,1

446,"I’ll keep it brief but I was bullied the entire way through school from age 5-16 by pretty much everyone else. I tried to make friends but the more I tried, the more they made fun of me for trying “as if anyone would even want to talk to you” etc.

So when I got to college I already had it in my mind that everyone else here has friends from school and I’ve never had a friend so it psyched me out. Somehow I still managed to make a few friends, 3 or 4, but only in the classroom capacity. They never invited to me to hang out after class and I don’t like inviting myself along. They were more like classmates or colleagues than friends. 

Eventually after moving one of them into my spare room (private rent, previous roommate moved out) she became a bit hostile and told me I was a boring roommate. She wanted house parties and drinking but I always just stayed in and watched movies. I said she could have easily invited me or asked me, not just assumed I would say no. I can like nights in AND nights out, but as I don’t have friends already that’s why she never sees me out. She laughed at me and then by the next day my classmates all avoided me as some sort of saddo with no friends, which I was yet again. 

Anyway it happened 4 more times with various jobs and I’m back at college again doing a different course but it’s day 2 and it’s already happening again. Being ignored in conversation, not being included to anything, but I’m chatting and friendly, just not forcing my company onto anyone.

If anyone has advise to break through and prove I’m still fun and nice even though I’m not as outgoing as everyone else i would be so so grateful.",18Sep2019,1
447,"Long story short an old coworker with a higher title than me left the company about 4 months ago. I implicitly inquired about the vacancy and suggested I apply for it and they can hire someone with less experience more easily. 

I was given the ""I'll look into that"".
I inquired yet again, this time more explicitly saying, ""I want to apply"", a few weeks ago, and was given another blank answer.

It's obvious they don't want to give me this position.

Now, before you guys suggest I don't do the work required for a promotion, I do. I've done the same amount of work or more as my ex coworker. I've led projects, led people and received high marks on mid year and annual performance reviews (mind you I only have two years with the company). 


Is there some business aspect I'm not understanding on hiring someone new? Wouldn't the company spend more money on training and getting the person up to speed versus giving me the title and salary increase?

Only other thing I can think of is years of experience really does matter, or I'm just simply not performing as good as I think I am...

450,"*This is very long so thank you in advance for reading and feedback. Forgive me for any typos or misjudgment on time periods. I’m very frustrated writing this.*

My husband and I moved into our first rental home in May with our now 18 month old. A close friend of mine (we were inseparable in high school and even lived together back then) was looking for a place to rent and we thought it would be the perfect arrangement to move her into our second bedroom as we still share a room with our daughter. We weren’t hurting for cash but it has been helpful. My husband decided to charge her $300 a month and said she could stay for as long as a year, we just wanted to help each other out. We thought she’d be a great roommate as I have always trusted her with money, she’s great with kids (5 nieces and nephews) and there’s no tension as far as another woman living with my husband. (I completely trust my husband but I wouldn’t move in any of my other female friends. She and I are very comfortable with each other and I’ve never worried about her around him, vice versa). 

The first month or so she was awesome. She helped me clean around the house even if it wasn’t her mess, she was very quiet when she came in late from work, even though it isn’t her responsibility she offered to watch my daughter so I could shower or make dinner, etc. She kept her space clean and orderly, she paid rent on time, and all around was just very considerate of my family and our space. Perfect roommate, you get the picture. 

So about a month and a half in she’s in a huge slump over hating her job, and decides to quit out of the blue. No two weeks notice, nothing, just decided not to show up for her next shift. She quit because it was a toxic work environment, I get it, but it’s an irresponsible thing to do when you’re living off of tips and renting. So that following month, she couldn’t pay all of her rent money, but my husband was very gracious with her. He asked her to pay $150 for the next two months but to do her best and be back to the $300 after that (if I’m not mistaken would have been this month). I will admit she worked her ass off trying to find a new job and she eventually did within about 3 weeks at another restaurant, but we really started to notice her behavior once she quit her old job. We admitted to each other this wasn’t working out with her.

My roommate quite enjoys drinking but I didn’t know how much until this point. She would drink every night after work with her coworkers, so that means her shift would end around 11 and she would come home drunk at 2am, stumbling into the door and fumbling with her keys, hence waking up our daughter. We also have a chain on our door above the locks for safety (we don’t live in the safest area) that we have to keep off in order for her to get in, so this was really irritating for us never knowing when she’d show up. We didn’t feel safe with the lock off all night long. So then she starts taking showers or doing laundry at the most inconvenient times, like late at night when we’re all trying to sleep or at nap time (we have two entrances to our bathroom which is right beside our bedroom so you can hear everything). I really got upset when I woke up to her talking to someone on speaker phone around midnight while she was in the bathroom. She started lacking on her part of cleaning the kitchen or bathroom (we rotated weekly) and now her room is constantly filthy with beer cans, fast food trash, even dirty feminine products thrown into a Walmart bag in the corner of the room. We recently had Terminix come to our home and I think the bugs that started to show up had a lot to do with her room. 

She comes from a family of junkies and is now trying to bring her fresh out of rehab sister into my home to “hangout”. She knows we don’t want anyone invited into our home unless we know them and the other day she called to ask if my husband was home because if not she wanted her sister to come over, as if I don’t agree with his rules and as if I would side step my own husband like that. I straight up told her no. 

I could list a few more reasons why we’re done having her as a roommate at this point but I think you guys get the picture. I have tried talking to her but the only thing she’s cut down on is drinking. She’s not even aware of how inconsiderate she can be. I don’t know if I’m over reacting but what I do know is that she has become this very negative, draining energy to be around. She’s constantly complaining about money, how shitty she feels mentally and physically, how much she hates her new job, etc. Even though it may not be fair of us to ask her to move as we told her she could stay for a year, I know that we just can’t deal with this anymore. I think all in all our lifestyles are just clashing and we are just ready for a change.

I know she has other places to stay as not all her family are addicts, and she has other friends so we wouldn’t be putting her on the street. We’re thinking about giving her until December as we want our home to ourselves for the holidays. Is this too short of notice? Otherwise, I could offer her to stay longer as long as she is moved out by the time my daughter is two. Although then I would have to just deal with my frustration with her. What do you guys think? How should I approach her?",18Sep2019,1

I’ve been with a company for 4 years as a project coordinator, in June was promoted to Sr. But nothing really changed other than a pay bump (still not anything close to even 40k a year). 
 
I could file a whole list of why I don’t want to do this anymore. It’s overwhelming, I have over 400 clients I work with and it’s not what I want to be doing the rest of my life. 

I spoke with my boss in March about switching to another role in the company using more of my MFA degree (creative writing) as in marketing, editing, etc.. Was told they’d keep an eye out. 

Last week, I got  an email that other coordinator on my team (1 yr w/ the company) will be moved to full-time remote editing. 

This was never brought to me as an option. The other coordinator asked about working remote to help with their 2nd job and was told no. When they said they’d  find a new job, my company offered her this. 

I’m frustrated. And don’t know how to tell my boss I’m frustrated and, ideally, I’d like to be also doing editing. 

Other factors: I have kidney disease which I’m in a study for. No guarantee I’ll be into remission from this study and the site is 1.5 hrs away.

This included her ,without my instruction, proceeding to kiss my genital area and telling me how to kiss hers. She even sort of instructed me how to do it by demonstrating on my finger. She would say ""mommy wants u to kiss here"" when she would point to an area of her body. I remember feeling uncomfortable having my genital kissed.

She refuses to listen to any of my explanations regarding my lack of time, or troubly stomach (I spent three days throwing up most of what I ate, my theory is I have to switch to super low fat meals and I've stuck to it even if it's probably not accurate), and bothers me day and night with things I didn't do or should do, etc. And I don't know how to deal with all of this.

Hi. I need some advice on how to respond to the questions ""Have you been placed on probation for disciplinary reasons."" I am going to answer yes, but the explanation part is scaring me.

Super introverted/quiet irl. Grew up with bad depression/social anxiety most of my life and no treatments have really helped. never been in a relationship or have any friends for the most part. Not too bothered by because it I'm just not compatible for anyone really because all of the mental illnesses.

My problem is I'm not really motivated by money and all that. I've been unemployed for a month now. I dont have any dreams, life is just so meaningless to me. People take life/work so seriously but in 100 years most of us will be dead. I just dont see the point I know I probably sound lazy and all that.

I’ve noticed in the last year or so that my moods have slowly taken over my life again. While for a long time I was able to get upset/ angry/ sad / any negative emotion then handle it and move on, now I find if I wake up in a bad mood or if this mood occurs at really any point that it’s almost impossible for me to get over. I will let something small affect me and my overall mood for the day and can’t shake it no matter how dumb it may be. If I wake up annoyed or sad for no reason I’ll dwell on it all day, as you can imagine if it’s due to something it will take over for days.

471,"I recently graduated college and landed a job at a place in a field I eventually want to grow in. Initially, I was hired as just a secretary. My job duties include answering phones, ordering supplies, taking care of the kitchen as needed, and taking things to the bank. A man that is in a position higher than me, but not my boss, began having me do little things for him. I was happy to help the job of a secretary becomes mundane. However, he starts having me do a lot more each day. My boss recently reached out to me asking me to do a project with him so now my work has doubled as I am doing actual work on top of my secretary work, I am now considered more of an assistant. Even though this man knows the boss is giving me this extra work he continues to pile his work on me. Sometimes he tells me to do something that would've been easier for him to do himself than it was to tell me how to do it. He has expressed he's in over his head in his position and is actually looking to leave soon. I understand he needs help but at this point he just commands me to do things totally outside of my job description. Sometimes he just gives me work to do that I know he just doesn't want to do. It feels disrespectful  No other employee that has the same position as him acts like this toward me. It is starting to become frustrating. When I make side comments about it he just goes on and on about how busy and overloaded he is. I am really unsure how to go about this. And could use any advice. Thank you!",18Sep2019,2

475,"Ever since I was a child I remember disliking my country(I'm not going to name it, but I will say it's in South America). I was lucky as a child in the fact that my mother traveled a lot for vacations so I knew different countries from an early age. I've always felt alienated from the culture(or lack thereof), and the overall meaningless of the everyday life here. Despite all that, I made a good career and own my own business, so I'm successful enough to have a good life, but I just can't seem to enjoy it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't like the people here, and most of all the lack of adventure and routinary life that everyone seems to accept. To be honest the food also kinda sucks compared to other places I've been, the women are overly dramatic and jealous and kinda boring, politics are a mess(that seems to be a problem everywhere in Latin America though), there is no culture of service, people are rude and sometimes I can't even stand my  friends. It just seems like a very plain, robotic place, the rat race is so embroiled in people's mind that everyone seems to have the same goals.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got back from a long trip to Southeast Asia and I felt so much better, I have an AD that seemed to go away(ulcerative colitis), I also had trouble sleeping/anxiety and everything went away when I was traveling. 

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short now I'm back in my country and I can't help but feel depressed about being here. Because of my business, I can't leave (It's my main source of income and I worked about 6 years to achieve reasonable success). I was thinking about just selling everything and live trough passive income but that seems like a recipe for disaster regarding my mental health.

481,"So about a year and a half ago I (F) became quite good friends with this guy (I had always known him but we did not really become friends until then) we can call him P. Everyday after school P, My sister and I would go to a park to hang out. through doing that I found out he had a massive crush on a girl she can be called K. So I encouraged him to ask K out because I thought she obviously had a crush on him but when he asked her out she said no. I was really surprised though because it was kind of obvious but then she started coming to the park and hanging out with us as well then her friend (M) started coming also. She started to hang out with him more so I encouraged him to ask her out again and then at first she said no but then she said yes and she also said she originally only said no because she was not ready to date. So they start dating and she is really nice but now it is like he has started to progressively treat me worse and worse, he will ditch me and just be quite rude. It is like he is doing everything he can for her to please K at my expense. For example he will ditch me and leave me for K and also today we were messing around and some sand got kicked on K’s bike and then P grabbed a massive handful of sand and threw it on me to make her feel better. He will always do things that he knows I hate and I feel like sometimes I bend over backwards for him but he just treats me terribly. He will do anything for K and is so polite to her but he sometimes treats me like trash. I don’t know what to do though because although he can be really bad he can be a really good friend who does nice things for me like gets me a nice birthday present and make me laugh and other times he will do things like tell people who my crush is and rank all his friends and give me a low rank to make me feel bad. Although maybe he might just be a little clueless and not know how badly he is hurting my feelings. But what happens a lot is that P will do something to hurt me then the next day he will apologise and I will forgive him because I feel like I don’t have another choice, so I would think by now he would know what hurts me. I just worry that if I do try confront him that he will hate me and never talk to me again and I don’t want that I just want to be treated better. What should I do?",18Sep2019,1
482,"So lately I’ve been looking to get into some hobbies some of which I am passionate about, but I’ve been feeling more and more stressed about money. Currently I have a hefty student loan and I’m renting an apartment with my partner, both of us have jobs with mediocre pay. Currently our financial situation is stable, but for some reason my debts have been pressing hard on me. We make just enough to squirrel away a bit of cash for both of us to use for personal purchases, and leave our main account fairly filled to keep up with our bills and day to day needs. Now I am getting interested in some hobbies but most of them are going to run me 1000$+ to get fairly started. My main issue is while I can continue my payments on loans, my subconscious keeps guilt tripping me into thinking I shouldn’t get anything for myself until I have made progress on my loans. As of right now with my fixed payments it’ll take roughly 15 years at this rate to pay them off. If I scrape together every nickel and dime to pay it off outside my scheduled payments (while also making the scheduled payments) it’ll possibly be around half that time. I’m not sure how to tackle this situation and how this anxiety/stress is getting to me",18Sep2019,2

485,"Hi, 18f here! I’m currently in my last semester of college (dual-enrollment during 11th-12th grade) and I’ve come to the realization that I have no friends.

My mom has isolated me since I was young and would often cut her relationships with the parents of my friends (she loves the drama), leaving me isolated. Even during high school, she wouldn’t allow me to experiment with friendships and socialization. When I turned to online friends, she didn’t like it either, threatened to take away my phone, laptop, and any means of communication and would scream at me if I said that I needed to talk to someone besides her. The only person she was willing to accept was my boyfriend of 3 years (he was surprisingly accepting of my social awkwardness) only because I stood my ground.

After this and a long string of emotional abuse (that’s for another post), I’ve finally decided that enough is enough. I really want to connect with people, have long conversations with and laugh with. But now that I’ve come to that realization, how do I do it? How do I, with the lack of social skills, make friends? It’s so difficult for me because I feel like I’m incredibly behind on this, and sometimes (as silly as it sounds) I feel like it’s a test I didn’t study for. I’m willing to push my limits as a person, which means feeling uncomfortable, to make this happen. This weekend, my boyfriend is inviting his friends and other girls who are my age to a hang out. He told me that he wants to help me improve socially and that this is my chance.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you! &lt;3

I work for a large agency and I’m about to take an out of state work trip for training. These trainings mix people from all over and we stay in hotels. Normally people unwind at hotel bars after work and this is normal behavior and I pay no mind. 

HOWEVER, I noticed a man included in the training used to be very high up in our organization and is now at our mid level (a demotion) I don’t know this man well at all, but there was a sexual harassment case against him and now he is at this demoted level so I’m assuming things did not go well for him.

To my question, is it appropriate to divulge what I know about this man to someone I might see getting drinks around him? Or if I see him being creepy (which is an opinion)drinking and hanging out like I mentioned is not uncommon in these situations and sometimes that leads to being vulnerable.

497,"I (M21) booked a surprise 3 night break to Iceland for my SO (M23). This was a bit of a financial overstretch, but as times have been particularly tough for various reasons and I came into some money I was willing to take this on to arrange something special together. Perhaps this was my first mistake but budget wise there was very little wriggle room for something to go wrong. In typical fashion, unfortunately his grandfather has recently died and after a funeral planning complication it has now fallen on the date we were due to fly out. SO has decided to attend the funeral and I am fully supportive of this, but as I booked with a certain notoriously difficult budget Hungarian airline (wink) we are faced with a few predicaments.

1. We reschedule flights for the next day and lose a day out of our already short trip. This will incur an additional expense of £35 cancellation fee + flight fare difference per passenger, which is more than I am able to afford. SO has offered to cover the cost but I am reluctant as this now puts him in a situation of forking an expense for a trip he didn't choose to go on in the first place, and defeats the intention of the gift.
2. I fly out to Iceland on the original date and he either a. books a new flight and cancels the original to receive a partial refund under their death of a family member policy or b. pay the £35 + flight fare difference to cover himself (whichever is cheapest). This would mean I would not be there to support him at the funeral and he would travel alone straight after it.
3. I take the hit and cancel the entire trip.

I have asked my partner what support he feels he needs for the funeral as this is the priority and, whilst he says he doesn't mind if I go ahead of him, I am aware he hasn't experienced a funeral before and cannot predict how he will feel in the moment. Also the slight possibility that if I did go without him, it'd never live it down...

The first time he didn’t pay me back I got a little annoyed, it was £30 afterall and I didn’t have a job at the time. Both him and my other mate got pissed off at me, getting really defensive saying the amount of weed he’s given me (not actual weed, just sharing spliffs with me) equates to that. That’s not how I work, and equally I was never told that said weed needed to be paid back (nor did he even consider that at the time).

With this in mind, I’m worried to bring it up again, £45 (the amount he currently owes me) is a lot of money to me, I live quite the distance from my friends and travel is expensive; not to mention our habits.

I just don’t know how to deal with this, I wouldn’t want to keep sending messages to ask if she’s ok etc all the time (and I don’t) but I also have no idea how I’ll know she’s come out of this ‘episode’ or if she’s actually getting better.

She *almost* acts like nothings wrong over messages (when she does reply).

Has anyone else had an experience like this where they’re not able to help them in person? And over messages it’s very tough to get through?

Anyone have any ideas on dealing with this? Or actually just helping me process/deal with it?",18Sep2019,1

509,"Hi Reddit,

I’m in a tough situation. I got involved with a coworker who has a boyfriend a while back, but things never progressed further than hooking up with her once, flirting at work and lots of flirty late night snapchatting. There was a lot of this flirting and playful touching at work, definitely mutual. I tried hanging out with her outside of work again, but she was totally ambivalent to the idea. I told her I was not going to just be her friend while she has a boyfriend, so I didn’t talk to her for two and a half months (aside for running into her at work a couple times). No texting/snapping/calling etc.

I randomly worked with her a couple weeks ago and it felt like no time passed, she was flirty and playful and great banter. I snapped her that Friday an inside joke and we went back and forth for a bit, and on Sunday we were texting a bit and I told her a little part of me missed talking to her and she responded with “just a little part of you?” I asked if I could talk to her on the phone later and she seemed surprised but said yes.

I told her everything I was feeling - that I had a lot on my mind and was just thinking about some stuff and thought about when we worked together and how it felt like no time had passed and that every time we interact there was this chemistry between us that I couldn’t ignore. I told her that I felt like she feels it too. She was completely shocked that I told her this and kept telling me she didn’t know I felt that strongly, and that she was stunned that I actually called her and poured my heart out like that but didn’t know what to say because she was so surprised.

Her phone died mid conversation and she texted me later

Her: I can’t explain how much fucking props I give to you for reaching out. Like a lot. I’m here for you through the rough time you’re going through as a friend. But I can’t do anything more than than I’m so sorry
Me: Do you feel what I feel or am I crazy?
Her: I’m not saying you’re crazy, but I’m in a relationship and I’m here as a friend for you.
Me: No problem. If things don’t work out feel free to hit me up. If I’m available we can do something

My question is NOT how do I get her..I believe I have that answer. MY QUESTION IS how do I act around her when we work together today? I am completely unsure what to do..act like nothing happened and treat her like a normal coworker? Treat her cold? Flirty/playful? I don’t know what to do. I have a tendency to act differently around girls I like, so this is hard for me.

TL;DR: Got involved with coworker who has boyfriend but is mutually attracted and I’m working with her for the first time in a while and I don’t know how to act around her or maintain my composure without revealing my feelings or acting out of character.",18Sep2019,1

513,"Some background: I initially applied for this job on 15th August. It’s a small but growing company and my role would be an editor. I didn’t hear back for two weeks, so I chased my contact there and immediately heard back from the editor-in-chief. 

She said she needed more proof of my writing work, and set me two tasks (including reviewing a local pub). I did this and submitted my work a day before the set deadline. She came back and said they were, quote, ‘great’, and asked me to come in for an interview the following week. 

This was last week. I interviewed on Thursday (after taking the afternoon off work and driving a two hour round trip). I think I did pretty well - I told her upfront that I could do 100% of what the job description was asking. I might have rambled a little, but generally I think the interview went okay. She told me she’d like to see more of my editing work, so she would send me another piece to edit. She did so later that day, and said in the email that she’d be back in touch next week (so this week).  I sent it back within two hours. 

Now she’s gone quiet. She never acknowledged my edited piece. I realise it’s been less than a week since the interview but I was genuinely expecting a quicker response - especially as she said she was keen to get someone in ASAP. Does it look too needy to chase again? I’m never usually this anxious but I really, really want this job, and for every day that passes I’m feeling worse about it. 

Tl;dr - I attended a job interview on Thursday and haven’t heard back despite the boss saying she’d be in touch this week. Is it too needy to chase already?",18Sep2019,1

515,"You know something.  It doesn't really matter what it is, only that you know it *really really well*.

You have degrees in it and years of history and you are paid to know this thing really really well.

You go to take some action based on what you know.  If you're a pilot you're just flying your plane.  If you're a doctor then you're treating a patient.  If you're a mountain climber then you're climbing a mountain.  The point is you're just doing your thing.

Along comes some group of people who don't understand anything about what you're doing.  They start interfering in your work.  They're egging each other on, they're getting in your way, they're obstructing you either directly or by confusing other bystanders.

This is 100% on them.  You didn't ask them to understand your job or agree with your opinion.  You didn't ask them to help you do anything related to what you know.  You just happen to be in the same general space as them and they have taken it upon themselves to revel in their own ignorance while obstructing you.

Various communities have ways they deal with this.  Private security, subreddit rules and moderators, bouncers... it doesn't really matter; the point is that most places where people of a particular interest do their thing have some way of stopping this behavior.

You aren't in one of those places... you're in a public space or (much worse) in *their space*.  Along comes some group of thought thugs to harass and obstruct you.  This is real harm.  Your activities have been disrupted, people who are not professionals do not know who is right and who is wrong so they only understand a small part of the interactions.  Unless you have a posse of your professional peers with you willing to throw down Harvard-Style with these idiots you're on your own.  You can't explain yourself, you can't educate them, you can't fight them and you really need to continue whatever-it-is you were trying to do to begin with.

517,"So, to give background we have been friends for almost 3 years. We are very close and I had no reason to believe this would end up a problem.

My friend (19M) has always struggled with money, and hasn't got a job. They dropped out of University, which was a reason why they didnt get a job last year (studying, living off student loans etc). We meet up fairly regularly to smoke, listen to music, talk about personal subjects etc. Over the course of a few months he has continuously owed me money. He refers to it as putting it on ""tab"", which I also used to refer to it as when it was a smaller amount. In short, he owes me £250 which isnt a small amount at all.
He got a job in a factory and assured me within a few weeks he will have paid me back. This was at the beginning of July. He hasn't worked many shifts due to the nature of the job and him hating it. But he also hasnt made any effort to find another job. Ive bugged him repeatedly about needing my money back. I have bills to pay, he doesnt. I insisted at the beginning of August that I need my money back by the end, and he said he'd have it by then.
Its the middle of September now.
He told me he might have to sell some stuff he gets for his birthday, but he will get it back to me.
I told him Im not taking from him on his birthday, first and foremost. But im also not waiting until the end of november to get the money back that I need. I keep getting on at him, but there seems to be no sense of urgency whatsoever. He told me not to put him down for failing and I just donr understand. Ive never put him down, and certainly havent told him he has failed at anything ever.
Im at a loss of what to do. Ive also learnt my lesson in never lending money to a friend, because quite truthfully Im infuriated that he hasn't kept his word.
I dont know what else to do to get my money back, because I desperately need it back and he knows that.

520,"I finished college in July and I'm taking a gap year out because I couldn't secure accomodation at my university on time and I have no way to travel there. For the last couple months I've kinda just been sitting around stewing in my room, playing games, watching TV and shit, bored out of my mind. I had a fairly sizeable friend group that's been together through high school and college but we're at a point in our lives where everyone is splitting up and going their own way (some are going to university this year, others are starting full time careers, are behind a year, travelling etc) so I'm pretty lost and not sure what I can do to fill the time. 

Travelling is out of the question because I'm poor, obviously I'm going to try and get a job when I can but I live in a rural area with one bus route and I could never afford a car so it's difficult. Usually people take gap years to travel abroad and take job opportunities in other countries but that's sorta out of the equation, so I'm just wondering what I can during this time that's relatively cheap and keeps me productive, any help would be appreciated, thanks!",18Sep2019,1
521,"Sorry, but this is gonna be a long post.

I need help deciding a couple things and I gotta ask and get some things off my chest because I’m so confused with college right now.

So, I finally figured out what I want to do. The “dream” job  would say. I’d like to be an art director. After taking a bunch of assessments and just checking myself with what I really want to do instead of doing what society thinks I should, it feels like it’s something I can 100% to do. I like to manage but be creative and implement ideas to make some sort of difference or just a customer/client happy. 

But is marketing the right major to do it? It does teach me things that I need if I wanted to eventually become a art director but a lot of job descriptions I’m reading are saying to be knowledgeable in graphic design, typography, digital media, being proficient in Adobe, design and visual arts. But marketing isn’t going to teach me all of that. I’m looking at the classes I have to take for my last two years and none of that is listed in the course catalog. 
So how would I learn those skills? Should I go out of my way to learn it? Join a club or something? Change my major all together? Minor is something like digital media? 
I ask because maybe someone who has a Marketing degree has become a Art Director or knows how to achieve said skills?

Also I’m not like this amazing visionary who has this unique gift. I’m realistic and know that I’m not the best in the world but I do feel like I am hella creative and can be very successful because I’m determined as hell to do something in the creative world because god knows I can’t sit behind a desk and log numbers in excel for the rest of my life.

524,"Literally too fucking wacky to make up, I swear all this is true. 

I have known this guy since I was 15 or some. He is a 40 year old gay black man who mainly hangs out with young boys between the ages of 18-25, but sometimes even younger. 

He does these things he calls ""Readings,"" which he claims to be able read someone's fortune through. Claiming to be able to read someones fortune is delusional enough, but the way he does it is perhaps one of the weirdest things I have ever heard.

First he has you take off your shoes and socks, while he strips down to wearing nothing but this underwear he made with a hole in the butt. Then he lies down in spooning position on his bed and has you lie down behind him and stick your foot into the hole on the back of his underwear. Then he presses his penis onto your foot and puts a sock on it so they stay together, he puts a shoe lightly over this to keep everything in place. Then he has you reach around his body so you can touch his nipples and rub them with your fingers. He then asks you to simultaneously rub his nipples and wiggle your toes on his penis head. During this time he'll ask you random questions and have you make up stories and such. Usually lasts about 10-15 minutes. The craziest thing about all of this is how many people he tricks into doing it somehow.

He did this to me when I was 15 or so and I definitely felt uncomfortable, but I had plenty of friends who had done it so I just went along with it. I hung out with the guy occasionally in highschool mainly because he gave me free weed and alcohol. He would always ask me about doing a reading and I'd usually decline. But I did it a few times over the years. I knew how the readings were conducted before I ever tried one and I consented. And I never felt scared from it or anything, so I just never cared.

527," I have been struggling to get through different university courses for about 6 years. I've taken time off at times and I finally thought I found a career and course that I was happy with. However, I decided to take on some hobbies to find new passions and meet new people. I got into theatre, and got cast in a theatre production, the first one that I auditioned for. I was only doing it as a hobby, but I loved every minute of it. The rehearsals and the time I had to put in. Once it came time for the production to open, we peformed over 2 weeks. This was 2 of the best weeks of my life. I had such good feedback and everyone said I was a natural.

Also, there was another guy that was in the cast with that wants to do acting and screenwriting as a career. He plans to write a TV show and wanted me to help him write it. And finally, for years now I've been wanting to try stand-up comedy. I've been writing joke ideas in my phone for about 2 years now, and this creative bug that I've caught has a lit a fire under me and made me want to start writing stand-up sets and perform.

Now, I know all of this can be done as a hobby as there is no way to make money from it right now, I understand that. But because of this, I have lost all passion or motivation to do any uni work. I have sat down and stared at my computer for hours on end with no result.

532,"As of now I work a retail job at a gas station, I've worked there a week. Before being hired I told them I'd work at least half a year there, but I'm a college graduate and have been applying to jobs. I got two calls back. One is a sales position at an insurance company and would make double the pay I'm making now. I have an interview today, which I'm contemplating not even going to.

I have guilt about leaving this one job. The manager is really nice and kind-heated and there are a lot of nice people there, but the pay sucks and the work sucks. I feel guilty and that I lead them on about how long I was going to work there, now I'm jumping ship after only a month? I know they could easily replace me and there is a high turn-over rate, it's just hurting my conscious. 

Now I know I'll hate this second job, but the pay is good and its close to my house. I'm a creative person and have a degree in journalism and political science, working at a established insurance company isn't for me, it's everything I hate in a job. 

My mom is sick though. She has a new medical problem everyday, and she can't work. The only way shes surviving right now is government assistance and me helping with the bills (which at this current job I can barley afford to have a life and help out with bills). 

I don't like my home town. I hate it. There is nothing here, people go here to work 9-5 jobs and have their dreams die. You can't be more then a speck in the dirty beach that is earth. I want to move somewhere and pursue a different career, one in journalism and media. I want to accomplish something with my life and help people, I can't do that here. I can't save enough to move and provide for my mom at the same time though, especially working at a gas station. This new job would let me save faster and better. 

Then theres one more job opportunity. Thats teaching English in China. I wouldn't be making good money, but I would be in another country experiencing something new. I've always wanted to travel and do something, but as a result of growing up in a poor family I've never left the country. Teaching in China would give me a basis to travel and teach other places, I'd be able to teach all around the world. 

What about my mom though? Thats whats always been in the back of my mind. I really want to leave America and experience a new culture. I don't know how she'll survive though. I planned on sending what money I could back to her but I don't know if she'll be physically okay for a while. My brother just had a baby and my younger one is going to graduate soon so they aren't in the position to care for her. 

Every ounce of my body feels guilty to leave her. I grew up poor, and am poor. I just know, deep down, if I stay in this small town with no opportunities I might be poor the rest of my life. I can't do that to myself or my family. I'm already clinically depressed, every day I'm here in this town makes it worse. Every day I walk into that gas station or any other minimum wage job brings me a step close to giving up on everything.

539,"THIS MIGHT BE A LONG READ....sorry


So, where do I start...I have been in a relationship with this girl for almost 5 years (my first love and first relationship). We started dating when I was a freshman out of college. We both attended different universities and we started our relationship as a “long distance relationship” since we were about 2 hours away from each other. My first time going over to her dorm was the best thing ever but I ended up crashing my car, which at this point think it was a sign from god to end the relationship. But I persisted and we often saw each other throughout the year...not as much as we would want but made it happen.

She then joined a dance group on campus and they would often have parties with alcohol (it is illegal to be drinking alcohol under the age of 21 but it’s college so whatever) Which I know is a bad recipe for a relationship. I’ve been brought up in a very conservative family where we were taught and had it drilled in us that alcohol is a very bad drug and was looked down upon. On top of that, I had family issues with alcohol abuse (my brother) and I just ended up completely hating the idea of ever drinking alcohol. Me being hesitant about my girlfriend(ex-girlfriend now) going to college parties and drinking. So, I simply told her just please go to the only a few parties and not drink(I know that’s asking a lot for a girl in college but it was just due to my own issues with alcohol) So, she went to a couple and told me that  she did not have anything to drink at all and she goes there to dance with her friends. Then later I find out from Instagram stories and snap stories that she in fact did drink and often got drunk. When I confronted her with pictures of her doing shots and drinking. She instantly started crying telling me “oh you don’t let me have fun and alcohol is so good”. To me at the time sounded like I was being a conservative and wasn’t allowing her to have her “college experience”. But I had to stand by my belief about no alcohol Because I was raised into that mindset for 19 years. After a day of fighting and arguments she simply told me “I love you a lot and if alcohol is something you don’t like me drinking I can have fun without it”. I was taken by this statement and made my love for her grow even more. Then a semester of parties and college passes and she goes to another party and i just wanted to see her friend stories etc. there was she again drinking and dancing. So, I confronted her about it all over again and again she started crying and telling me “oh why can’t you just let me have fun...I’m in college...I don’t want to have have FOMO(fear of missing out)”.  She also told me that she drank at every single party she went too(I’m talking at least 2 parties a week). To which I simply responded by saying “you lied to me and I don’t want to be in a relationship that lie to me with such ease and only confess when I catch you in the act”. After that I ended all communication with her and then she got her friends involved in our relationship and they all started texting me and calling me saying dude it’s college let her drink. After weeks of talking with the ex and her friends. I just told her if she wanted to drink she had to do it in a limited amount and at least tell me about it afterwards or during the party. I don’t think that a tough thing to do.

Then after a year or so...she continues to tell me about the parties she goes to but she always told me she didn’t drink Bc of how much she loved me...blah blah. Then guess what??! Yup, I caught her drinking again and she confesses/cries “oh you don’t let me have fun...you’re like my dad...Etc” I broke up with her as soon I found out which was when she was at a party. After she came to the room...she started crying and bawling her eyes out and threatening to kill herself. To which her friends call me and ask me to call her and make things better. I just don’t want anyone to hurt themselves because of me. It’s just not how I want anyone to feel. So, out of guilt I got back with her and she reassured me something like this will never happen again. Having your girlfriend lie to you constantly about going to parties and drinking took a toll on me and I just started thinking is she also cheating on me? But I never asked her the question Bc I knew she would simply say no and I just didn’t trust her word Bc she lied to me all the time. 

Don’t get me wrong we also had good times...that was mostly when we were together in person and it just made me feel like nothing else in the world mattered expect the moment I was in...it just felt so peaceful.

Then her lying about going to parties and drinking became a norm and I would just confront her about it and we would go through the whole cycle again. I want to say this scenario happened at least 12-16 times in the relationship. (Which should of been my clue to end the relationship but she just always told me she will do better). 

After a year, she used to meet up with her childhood friend at family picnics, and FaceTime him from time to time. Let’s call him Bob. I talked to the guy before and I didn’t like the vibe he was throwing at me and in my gut I knew something wasn’t right. I often would question my ex about him and she would always so defensive and angry with me for asking. Until one day I asked her very late night to tell me what’s she hiding from me(Bc I could see it in her eyes..that she was hiding something from me) and she finally told me that she went on a hike with Bob and they held hands and hugged (romantically)...to which my heart completely sank and she started crying saying I love you and I kid you not she said to me “I was thinking about you the whole and I was just missing you a lot” like WTF. I ended it with her AGAIN...like a broken record player she threatened to kill herself and made promises (that she never kept) about this never happening again and how much she loved me. She told me she didn’t know what she would do without me and needed me to live. Me being a dumb gullible idiot listened and felt bad to which I simply said “it’s okay it was just a hug and holding hands(but to this day I felt like they kissed as well) we can get through this”. So, now we are back together. 

Then after a year of things being sort of okay minus the parties and her constantly telling me to start drinking and go to parties (which just isn’t my scene) I officially got drunk at my brothers wedding and I kind of felt goodish to let loose but it’s not something I would do every week. So, afterwards me and the ex made a plan to meet up and go to a bar with her friend on Saturday night. So, i call her Saturday morning trying to tell her I’m about to leave but she doesn’t pick up her phone for some reason...so I look at her location (she asked me to download this app in freshman year to share each other’s locations). I find out that she was at this dorm on campus when one of her childhood friends 2 years younger than her lives, let’s call him Steve. So, I naturally got furious like how are you not gonna tell me that you’re spending time at another persons house over night. She pleaded with me saying that she didn’t sleep over at Steve’s place but she was at one of her other friends Rebecca’s place. Rebecca was a friend that I had never heard of before that incident. So, I just told her I don’t think I’m going to come anymore Bc I just don’t feel good about this situation. But she kept pleading that please I’ll explain everything blah blah. So, my dumb trusting self went over to her place and talked everything out and I was finally like okay and we went together to a bar and danced together and came home and even had sex on that day. Fast forward 2 weeks (a week ago from today) Steve is coming to her house drunk af and talking about “I love you and if Your bf wasn’t there would you be with me”. I heard this Bc I was on the phone call with the ex when this happened. to which I got really suspicious and asked to see the text messages between him and the ex and she just instantly refused saying “don’t you trust me” and I just told her I need to see it. Then she tells me “I started having feelings for him for like a little while and I told him that look I’m having feelings for you but I have a bf” to which I just erupted and demanded to see the chat and asked her if she did anything physical with him but she refuses. Now I really think she slept with him the night before she slept with me.

I just don’t see what’s so freaking wrong with me.",18Sep2019,1
540,"I have SUICIDAL thoughts dozens of times( mostly thinking about future). There was an incident yesterday at family get together. My grandpa asked us all brothers-sisters about future plans, many of my brothers- sisters said actor, doctor, teachers and first thing came to mind is that I won't be here ANYWAYS. ( I would be dead in few days).
 I am extremely depressed and SUICIDAL. I can't change my thoughts or the way I think.
Let's say for example
I am waiting for my admissions and I don't get the college I want, first thought comes to my mind is "" SUICIDE"" or maybe I engage in self-harm ( cut myself on wrists) or watch videos about  SUICIDE on gore websites.
I can't think straight. I think in extremes, if a guy is nice to me, I am ready to do anything for him and if someone is mean to me, I even have a homicidal thought. We can say I have splitting type of thinking pattern.
How should I change my thinking? No matter, I try I can't get rid of suicide thoughts and stop planning about commiting SUICIDE.",18Sep2019,1

545,"Hi! 

I have a trip to Tokyo that I would be leaving on Monday. I booked through Expedia. 

It roughly costed me $1,500.

This past Sunday, I tripped over some stairs and hurt myself pretty bad. I have fractured my left toe base and my right ankle is swollen to the point that I cannot walk on it. So, I have been in a wheel chair and using crutches when necessary. I have also been doing the R.I.C.E. method (rest, ice, compress and elevate) for the past couple days. It is still not comfortable for me to walk or stand alone. 

I have considered not going, since I would be an inconvenience to the rest of my friends going. The problem is that my flight and money I have already paid is non refundable. I am extremely bummed. 

I need advice on if I should wait until the last minute and see if I can heal or cancel everything now and eat the money I already spent. 

Please let me know if you have advice on trying to get money back or flight credit from Expedia as well.

551,"Yo, this is my first post on reddit.
I’m (19M) currently in my second year of college. At my school, a lot of people care about pop culture and the internet and trends and celebrities. Specifically in my major (basically comic making) the main focus is basically pop culture and comics and movies. I enjoy my classes but I often feel really isolated and alone because I can’t relate to other people when they have conversations about movies or comics or tv shows or most video games. For whatever reason I just haven’t seen the majority of movies, TV shows, etc. I don’t think I was sheltered growing up per se, I just didn’t have the opportunity to grow up with popular movies or go to the theatre a lot as a kid. I honestly I don’t think I’m interested in taking the time to watch what most people are into watching or have seen anyways like naruto or marvel movies. Most days I don’t let it bother me but some days it’s just hard to basically hear conversations constantly that I can’t relate to and have to explain to people that I’ve basically seen nothing and know no celebrities or actors. But at the same time I don’t care about celebrities and actors and whatever they do and Star Wars (And other movies) doesn’t seem appealing to me enough to go watch it just so I can partake in conversations about it. I don’t really have friends at this school who I can talk to about things I do enjoy or can talk about (I’m thankful for my friends from high school who I still talk to though) and I don’t know if I’ll be able to find my “group” at my school anyways.

557,"Hi all - I've been working for this company for two years. I have a review on Friday with my boss (he recently has said he wants to do these quarterly - this being the 3rd quarter and the final one in December is generally speaking when he tells me about salary/bonus). 

I'd like to bring up a raise to him in this meeting to have him consider for the end of the year. Here are the reasons I think I should get one, but I don't totally feel comfortable saying it in these ways:

1. My job description has expanded - a lot. This wasn't completely unknown to me that it would happen -- they basically told me it was to be expected. And my boss has acknowledged that they've given me way more than they ever expected me to do....so it's almost like it doesn't need to be brought up again? 
2. The big boss and his assistant are the other two people in the company (total of four - one owner, 3 coworkers). They are incredibly difficult to work with, but I manage to do so pretty well. I've brought this up (delicately) to my boss previously, so again, not sure that I should bring it up?
3. I've been getting contacted by placement agencies a LOT. So I've had a lot of success with getting jobs through agencies (including this one) and in the last couple months, I've had a ton of interest from these companies. I'm getting contacted weekly for open positions. A lot of them with starting salaries higher than mine, better benefits, but with no bonus potential. My current job is slightly lower salary, not great benefits, but with a 5-10% bonus opportunity at the end of the year. I know since I'm getting contacted that the market for my position is really good right now to find something else, but ultimately, I think in the long run my money earning chances are better to stay here.

I feel like all of these are valid, but also kind of irrelevant, too? Or things that he already knows (except that I'm being recruited by other places, which I've always felt isn't something I should share with my boss). 

I'm just really unsure about whether I should bring it up, how to bring it up if I do, and what way to approach it. Any advice?",18Sep2019,1

563,"THIS MIGHT BE A LONG READ....sorry


So, where do I start...I have been in a relationship with this girl for almost 5 years (my first love and first relationship). We started dating when I was a freshman out of college. We both attended different universities and we started our relationship as a “long distance relationship” since we were about 2 hours away from each other. My first time going over to her dorm was the best thing ever but I ended up crashing my car, which at this point think it was a sign from god to end the relationship. But I persisted and we often saw each other throughout the year...not as much as we would want but made it happen.

She then joined a dance group on campus and they would often have parties with alcohol (it is illegal to be drinking alcohol under the age of 21 but it’s college so whatever) Which I know is a bad recipe for a relationship. I’ve been brought up in a very conservative family where we were taught and had it drilled in us that alcohol is a very bad drug and was looked down upon. On top of that, I had family issues with alcohol abuse (my brother) and I just ended up completely hating the idea of ever drinking alcohol. Me being hesitant about my girlfriend(ex-girlfriend now) going to college parties and drinking. So, I simply told her just please go to the only a few parties and not drink(which was my mistake that I resolved after the first semester as I didn’t want to control her choices).So, she went to a couple and told me that  she did not have anything to drink at all and she goes there to dance with her friends. Then later I find out from Instagram stories and snap stories that she in fact did drink and often got drunk. When I confronted her with pictures of her doing shots and drinking. She instantly started crying telling me “oh you don’t let me have fun and alcohol is so good”. To me at the time sounded like I was being a conservative and wasn’t allowing her to have her “college experience”. But I had to stand by my belief about no alcohol Because I was raised into that mindset for 19 years. After a day of fighting and arguments she simply told me “I love you a lot and if alcohol is something you don’t like me drinking I can have fun without it”. I was taken by this statement and made my love for her grow even more. Then a semester of parties and college passes and she goes to another party and i just wanted to see her friend stories etc. there was she again drinking and dancing. So, I confronted her about it all over again and again she started crying and telling me “oh why can’t you just let me have fun...I’m in college...I don’t want to have have FOMO(fear of missing out)”.  She also told me that she drank at every single party she went too(I’m talking at least 2 parties a week).

She told me she didn’t know what she would do without me and needed me to live. Me being a dumb gullible idiot listened and felt bad to which I simply said “it’s okay it was just a hug and holding hands(but to this day I felt like they kissed as well) we can get through this”. So, now we are back together. 

Then after a year of things being sort of okay minus the parties and her constantly telling me to start drinking and go to parties (which just isn’t my scene) I officially got drunk at my brothers wedding and I kind of felt goodish to let loose but it’s not something I would do every week. So, afterwards me and the ex made a plan to meet up and go to a bar with her friend on Saturday night. So, i call her Saturday morning trying to tell her I’m about to leave but she doesn’t pick up her phone for some reason...so I look at her location (she asked me to download this app in freshman year to share each other’s locations). I find out that she was at this dorm on campus when one of her childhood friends 2 years younger than her lives, let’s call him Steve. So, I naturally got furious like how are you not gonna tell me that you’re spending time at another persons house over night. She pleaded with me saying that she didn’t sleep over at Steve’s place but she was at one of her other friends Rebecca’s place. Rebecca was a friend that I had never heard of before that incident. So, I just told her I don’t think I’m going to come anymore Bc I just don’t feel good about this situation. But she kept pleading that please I’ll explain everything blah blah. So, my dumb trusting self went over to her place and talked everything out and I was finally like okay and we went together to a bar and danced together and came home and even had sex on that day. Fast forward 2 weeks (a week ago from today) Steve is coming to her house drunk af and talking about “I love you and if Your bf wasn’t there would you be with me”. I heard this Bc I was on the phone call with the ex when this happened. to which I got really suspicious and asked to see the text messages between him and the ex and she just instantly refused saying “don’t you trust me” and I just told her I need to see it. Then she tells me “I started having feelings for him for like a little while and I told him that look I’m having feelings for you but I have a bf” to which I just erupted and demanded to see the chat and asked her if she did anything physical with him but she refuses. Now I really think she slept with him the night before she slept with me. 


I just feel so freaking down and like I gave my everything to this girl even when I was at my worst I made sure she was okay....


Summary: I understand that I’ve made a mistake of telling her not to drink in the first semester but then I realized that in college that’s like a very popular thing and I ended up starting to drink later on as well. But does that really excuse all the lying on cheating on me two times? I don’t know what to do to get her out of my head and the picture of her kissing another dude. I just feel so depressed right now...",18Sep2019,1
564,"I've been dealing with anxiety for 6 years now and one of the main symptoms I have is excessive sweating. When I'm at home I'm basically fine but as soon as I step outside, even if it's just for 5 minutes I get completely drenched. This really bothers me cause I feel vulnerable and feel like everyone is looking at me cause of my sweating, also it is extremely annoying to sweat this much because it makes me feel uncomfortable.

I have been seeing a  psychologist for about 6 months and have taken medication for a little bit over a year but I stopped the medication and haven't had an appointment in 2 months. When I talked about my problem with sweating to my psychologist she basically made an argument about would I want to be friends with someone who judges me just because I sweat a lot, and it's a good argument but I don't think my sweating problem is about making friends, it's more about me being uncomfortable and being anxious because of it. I don't think I expressed how important this particular issue is to me to my psychologist so we never spent much time on it, and that's something I will talk to her about when I start seeing her again.

What made me write this is that today was my second day at college, first day I went with a jacket so that no one would notice my sweating ( which is predominantly in my armpits ) but it's still summer and hot outside so it doesnt make sense for me to just wear a jacket until winter, also wearing a jacket when it's hot outside may hide my sweating but also makes me sweat more making me even more uncomfortable. So today I went with just a shirt making my sweating visible to everyone. If this was 1 year ago I would have just keep hiding it with a jacket but since then I've been trying to make myself go out with just a shirt to get used to sweating in front of people in the hopes that by getting used to it I would stop constantly thinking about it and in turn the sweating would stop. So far I haven't been able to stop thinking about it and today I got huge spots on my armpits during the trip to college and what's even worse is that, since I'm in music college I have to bring my guitar in a bag with me, the problem with this is that I smoke in my room so the bag is a little bit dirty with smoke, not much, but all the sweating mixed with this smoked bag made my shirt yellow in the armpits which was really embarrasing.

I felt so anxious that I had to leave before the second class started, which is really pissing me off cause I'm finally studying something that I really like and from all things, sweating is keeping me from being able to enjoy it.

So I realize that this might not be something that many people would think is a big issue but it's something that really bothers me and I kinda hate myself just because of it. Any advice that you can give me is greatly appreciated and I'm sorry for the long post.

Also English is not my first language so I'm sorry if I wasn't clear at any point.",18Sep2019,1
565,"Last night my best friend and I (Both 14) were out walking his dog. We were walking past the fire station at the corner of our street when a car came around the corner and hit this guy on a bike. He looked a little bit older then us (Maybe 16 or 17). I gave the dog to my friend and told him to go get help from the fire station and I went over to see if there was anything I could do to help. I have some first aid training from the cadet program and I have a lot of first aid knowledge in general. 

He seemed fine, more shocked and pissed off than anything, and he got up on his own. The lady in the car stopped her car (Still in the middle of the street but it was a multi lane street so people were still driving past) and got out. She ran over to the boy and started crying and asking if he was ok and apologizing. The boy kept repeating « what the fuck what the fuck ». He and the lady were standing right bedside the road (It was a pretty busy road and cars were going really fast) so I told them to come over onto the grass near the fire station. The lady left despite me telling her not to. 

By now, my friend was coming back and there was a paramedic driving over. He started talking to the boy and I went back to my friend. We kind of stayed a few steps away, not really sure if we were needed for anything else. We were the only witnesses as everyone else had already driven off. One of the firetrucks was coming back from a call and I guess somebody told them what happened and a bunch of the firefighters came running over. They looked like they had it under control and my friend was getting uncomfortable and starting to look pale so we left and kept waling towards the place I wanted to go (Which I completely forgot after so we just walked around aimlessly). 

Nobody stopped us so I figured we were ok. Where I live there’s a law says you don’t have to perform first aid if you see somebody who needs it but if you do you can’t stop until either the person doesn’t need help anymore, you physically can’t continue, the scene is unsafe or somebody with a higher level of training relieves you (Usually first responders). I’m not if what I did counts as first aid (Checking him over briefly and sitting him down) but paramedic and firefighters came either way so technically I was relieved. 

I’m just wondering if I should have stayed? It’s really bothering me so if somebody could tell me what I should’ve done, that would be great.

TL,DR: My friend and I witnessed somebody get hit by a car and helped out a little bit. We left after the paramedics and firefighters got there but I’m wondering if we should have stayed?",18Sep2019,1
566,"Guys, my entire high school career has been a joke.  I have twelve credits, this is ten less than I need. The problem is I can’t make myself do anything about it.  If I were to try, which I have, I give up immediately.  I feel powerless and apathetic.  I think I’ve subconsciously accepted the fact that I’ll probably be homeless.  I want to be successful but I can’t commit to a goal.  My school work is simple, extremely simple, but I can’t do it.   I’ve been trying to become more productive by self-medicating, it hasn’t gone well.   I’ve built a hefty tolerance to stimulants like caffeine, so much so that it isn’t even waking me up.  I can’t focus, I can’t commit, I can’t do anything.  It gets worst and it gets better, but it’s always there.  I feel reliant on substances, without them I am much too hazy.  I feel that I have so much potential, but It’s locked up somewhere.  I’m afraid that I’ve ruined my life.

571,"I had felt like I was on a good roll with teaching my two teenage sons on how to respect women and their choices lately but we had a bit of a setback this weekend. We live in area that has a short but warm summer. The weekend weather brought the heat so I brought my sons to the beach for a little sun before the winter.

We were having a great time and the beach was anything but packed. It was turning into one of those memorable days of family life. Then, a middle aged couple (man and woman) had to put a damper on our great day.

The woman walked past us when we were sunbathing. I was laying on my stomach, half asleep taking a quick beach nap. I heard the woman half whisper ""shame on you"". My mind thought I was dreaming at first. Then, I heard her say ""shame on you"" even louder. I looked back and said ""excuse me?"" in a not so nice of tone.

Turns out the woman was mad that I was wearing a thong to the beach. She said I should cover up and should never dress like that in front of my sons. Went on to say that she could see my sons erections under their swimsuits (I have no idea if they did have an erection or if this woman was just projecting her sexualization of the beach onto them). By this time, I was quite upset and had lost all rationality, I fired back that they are teenage boys and that is just something that happens. She continued to pearl clutch and finally said that any swimsuit is too risque for a mom to wear in front of her son. As if I should never bring my family to the beach?!?!

They finally walked away and I was stunned. None of us knew what to say. It was just a terrible end to a great day. I am still working out what to say to my sons but I am sad that I have to say anything at all. But, I feel like the situation was so startling that I have to address it with them. Any ideas on what to say?",18Sep2019,2
572,"I (22M) spent the summer caring after my girlfriends dog. He is such a sweet and loving dog and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t completely fall in love with him.

Anyways, I go to school in a separate province so for the first few months february-april my parents took care of the dog by themselves at their house. 
Once late april came around it was my turn to start to take over for my parents. It was a lot of work at first but I got used to it and he (dog) made any amount of work worth it just so I could have him around. He truly was the source of my happiness.

I went to the bathroom for a quick wank and took my laptop with me (my phone's battery was dead and a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do) with my freaking PS4 headphones and wanked then took a shower. My room is literally right infront of the bathroom (like 1m between them or so) and I thought I could get away with just quickly going from the bathroom to my room with the big ass headphones and laptop without anyone noticing me. As soon as I opened the door, my father was right infront of the door as he was going to knock to check if someone was inside. He told me ""wow, so we reached a point where we're taking the laptops inside now?"" now I'm not sure if he knows what happened or pointed towards the fact that I took a freaking laptop inside and not the phone (which is usually the case with pretty much everyone in the family) and headphones. I'm pretty sure I played it super super cool and didn't give a single sign of any nervousness, etc. and he just went inside, washed his hands and then talked to my brother who just woke up at that point.

574,"This is embarrassing, frustrating, and I feel like a ball of negative emotion right now. 

My wife and I met in college and we ended up getting married when we were both 19. We were young, we were stupid, and there are also reasons that I cannot mention here. Before we got married she had cheated on me but I was convinced after some time had passed that it was an accident never to be repeated again. 

Her parents are very wealthy (not a factor in why I married her). And have been very accepting and have helped me tremendously over the years. We all loved each other, share food together, and cuddle and even sleep in the same bed at times. My wife and I have been married for 4 years and she has been a compulsive liar for quite a while. Unfortunately, I have conditioned myself to take everything she says with a grain of salt. 

Well last month I had a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach and decided to invade her privacy (bad move, I know). I saw that she had been talking to the guy she cheated on me with before she got married. I didn’t think anything of it because she said he was family / a friend of the family. I tried to invoke trust. I failed. Miserably. She has a history of lying about this type of thing so, through some very unconventional means that I won’t mention here, I found out that she fucked that guy again. And was making plans to continue fucking this guy. I devised a conversation to give her hints that I knew what happened and see if she would tell me the truth. She didn’t. She lied as hard as she could for as long as she could all the way down to the minute details. 

I want a divorce. I want it now. I don’t want to see her. I don’t want to talk to her. We had a very expensive wedding with a few hundred guests and were even in a few magazines, so this embarrassment is MASSIVE.

Her parents always said that they would always love me and always help me out,  and have said that they still feel the same even though I want a divorce. But honestly I can’t say that I trust them. They’ve never give me a reason to doubt, but I’ve seen divorce bring out the worst in people and in families. 

I have no job, I have no income, I’m currently in school. I have no where to go and I have nothing to fall back on. I was the golden child of my family and honestly 

I AM SCARED. 

I’m scared because of how fucked up this is, I’m scared of what my life will be, I’m scared because I’ve isolated myself over the years and have no one to talk to about this. My dad is out of the picture and my mom will be heartbroken. 

My wife is saying I can stay with her for a while but just the sound of her voice is enough to drive me insane right now.

575,"So without giving too many details about my job I need some advice to help my supervisor.

I work for a company that handles government documents. These documents are for repair on machinery and need to be safely stored which we do. Our biggest issue in our department (internal planning) is people placing the wrong document into the wrong cabinets upstairs. Our supervisor hasn't worked in Data entry in over 15 years and how we do things is very, very different than what she did back in the day.

How we were doing things: Paperwork is filed in a huge open cabinet down stairs. We can have documents for up to 15 machines at a time. Let say Machine 1 is Item: 0001, and machine 2 is item: 0002 and so on. We would ""work"" the document and enter it into the customers database/program. From there we sign off on the document and we would place it IN ORDER on our desks. At the end of our shift we would stack the documents using dividers and go up to records to file them in the correct cabinets marked ""0001"", ""0002"", ect.

My system was placing all documents on an open table upstairs, double, triple checking to make sure I have correctly separated the files. We also have work that comes back from our customer reps that needs to be re-status and put into order... All in all, by the end of our shift we may have worked up to 15 machines at a time averaging 500 cards a night. As far as I can tell, my system was working. I have no clue because she won't tell us whose doing it.

It seems that she will not out the person that keeps doing it. I'm sure we all make mistakes, the paperwork flows through multiple departments before it even reaches us. We are data entry. There is also Quality control, Audit, planning, Records. The last people to touch the documents are records as they scan them into a system. 

My supervisor's solution is to have us work one machine at a time, finish that, take it up stairs, go back down stairs, do another machine, and so on, and so fourth. This can include doing as little as 3 'cards' on a single machine at a time as they go through audit to us. I do not want to go up these stairs dozens if not more times a night. I work 3:30PM to 2:00AM. I am already exhausted come my weekend and this is going to make it worse. We also have to go upstairs to help our mechanics and other agencies find documents. Some of my co-workers are older and have knee issues, or just their age alone makes this difficult. The only elevator we have is pretty far from our office.

This is just not doable. It started because some how a machine we had greened RTS was found to have 20 documents vanish. She said she is open to suggestions. I want to tell her to have the company buy a large cabinet where data entry takes all paperwork they have completed and places it in there and records files it into the correct cabinets. This issue has been brought up in our monthly crew meetings for the past 2+ years. Data entry is always blamed for it. Now we're being punished even though it may not even be us! The keys to the cabinets are not hidden, everyone knows where they are. They keep having to hire new people and there is almost always a slew of mistakes when we get new hires. She's being completely unreasonable by making us do this.

I could use some suggestions or help refining my idea. I go back to work Friday and would really love to be able to give her a educated sounding suggestion. Thank you!",18Sep2019,1

578,"TL;DR: Would it be wise to go back to school and get a degree I need 30 credits for, so I can also get internship experience?

Longer story: I was a navy brat, and in the course of moving about, I graduated from high school on a Navy base and ended up attending Temple University, Japan campus, graduating with a B.A in Political Science in 2017. Now, while I loved attending university in Japan and wouldn't trade it for the world, I've come to realize that I missed out on what turns out to be a core part of college, internships!

Despite being an American university, by virtue of it being in the heart of Tokyo all internships required essentially Japanese fluency (for obvious reasons). I struggled with Japanese, and while I was able to pass the language requirement for my degree, I was in no way competent enough to actually use it in a professional context. 

My ultimate goal right now is to attain a Masters in History at ODU in Virginia, but if I end up not making the cut for the Spring semester (my GPA is my concern with that), I've also toyed with the idea of going to attain a Bachelor's in History and working on a linked Bachelors-to-Masters from there. I've spoken with an admissions advisor, and they informed me that with my Poli-Sci degree transferring, I'd need **roughly 30 credit hours** (give or take), to obtain. On either of these paths, I'm planning on making up for lost time in regards to internships. Being in the Colonial Williamsburg-Jamestown-Yorktown area, I've been aiming for a curatorial internship in some capacity.

Does this seem plausible, or might I be making a big mistake?",18Sep2019,1
579,"Hello,  so I just had an interview for a position with a large company that recently came to my city. My city is very popular and one of the largest in America so the company is not going anywhere. 

Anyways, I applied for a position that's considerably lower than my current position. Let's say its 3/4 positions lower than my current. However, the base pay is almost the same and the commission is miles ahead in terms of amount. 

I got an interview and during the interview, the manager asked me more than once as to why I am doing this. She said I'm over qualified and I should apply for a higher position. The first time she asked, I explained that I understand sometimes you have to take a step back to achieve your long term goals. I wanted to engage more with clients and partners within the company and this position will give me the best opportunity to do so. 

Later in the interview she asked again about me being over qualified and why I didnt apply for the higher position. At this point we became comfortable so I told her that between us, it would've been tremendously harder to score an interview for the higher position since my time in said experience is only a year, and given that the company is opening a shit load of new store, they sure would rather have a more seasoned individual to run an entire BRAND NEW store. 

She agreed and complimented me being strategic about my approach. And in the end when I asked her how I stack up with all the other people for this position she said that you're good to go in terms of being qualified because, again, you're over qualified. 

And she mentioned that it will be a pay cut from my current job (little does she know itll be a huge raise technically.)

582,"Hi there, I'm an 18-year-old guy in his Freshman year of College. So far it's been... interesting. The campus is gorgeous, the professors are mostly great, the other students are alright. I haven't made any real friendships, but's only been four weeks and I commute so I'm not really bothered.

Yet I feel lost. I've never had a real life long goal, and I feel no motivation to be here in College. I'm only here because people told me that I should. My parents are great, so I never doubted their recommendation of College. Until now.

 I like to write in my spare time, I occasionally entertain the idea of becoming an author but I'm not very enthusiastic about it. Or anything really. My dad pushes me to be a Police Officer like himself, it pays well, and he loves it. The way his coworkers describe him is like a superhero version of himself, he really loves helping good people and enforcing the law when needed. I don't think that really fits me. I'm kind of a passive guy, I usually avoid conflict where he isn't afraid of it. 

Those two jobs are the only things that slightly interest me. I've researched explored and searched for careers and jobs but absolutely nothing piques my interest. I've been looking for even the bearest thread of interest in anything for about three years, but I feel so aimless. I'm just wasting time for a stupid Criminology degree for a job that I'll likely washout of due to sheer apathy. I feel like a clock is ticking above my head, yet I'm unsure of what it means. Like I'm wasting time in these classes that should be used for something else. Again, I don't know what that something is.

What should I do? Is this all just my immature mind running too long? I've tried all kinds of personality tests, Major test, my University job centers with their many quizzes, and all kinds of things in my search but I'm still lost.

583,"Okay so I just got into a physical fight with a former close friend (I don’t really need to explain context but if you really want some I’ll update). So basically we were walking and bickering as we already fell out. And I said ‘don’t fucking disrespect me before I throw your ass in the road’ and she said ‘fucking do it, go to jail bitch your life is already ruined anyway’ the my life is already ruined was a trigger so I shoved her while she was trying to walk away and she almost hit the floor. So then we start fighting and I can’t remember much. I think she did the petty girl fight thing so scratching me, pulling my large hoop earrings, she couldn’t pull on my hair cos it was tied back. And I don’t remember much of what I did or what we did. I’m pretty sure I fought back cos I remember the adrenaline suddenly hitting me and me acting on it but we didn’t get to finish because my friend was in the middle trying to hold one of us back. 

Then I said ‘next time fight like a man, don’t fight like a bitch’. And then we kept cussing eachother out. I guess I was and pretty shocked since it happened like half an hour ago and I don’t remember anything much, I don’t even remember her stumbling almost to the ground until my friend told me, I don’t remember her hitting me or me hitting her, all I remembered was the adrenaline,  me acting on it and her aggression. I have scratches on my neck and blood on my ears cos she tried to pull out my earring.  I understand that what I did was wrong because I started it and well I threatened her first so please don’t lecture me. I’m jus kinda lost with myself right now I don’t know what to do. 

She’s a loud part of the friendship group and it’s too dangerous putting us in the same space as each other. So I guess I’ll spend my time  alone, which I don’t really mind. I usually go out and walk by the park listening to music during lunchtimes. And it is my last year till I’m off to college so I’m not really worried about this long term. 

But I do have a feeling in school tomorrow she may try to pounce and that’s something I want to be ready for. For starters I won’t be wearing hoop hearings or heels or anything that makes me look vulnerable. And I want to be in control of my body and actually remember things but I don’t know if I will, since I’ve never fought before.  

Anyways, to give you some context about the person I am, I’m so far from perfect, I act on anger a lot, I make stupid decisions and say things before thinking. Moreover the reason why this whole situation happened in the first place is because of me, I haven’t been myself lately, I’ve been cranky,disconnected and numb. And I guess she was the breaking point. 

I wanna better myself tho but I don’t know how, I want to  do extra curricular, spend time by myself, focus on my studies,get out of my own head sometimes.

Although it doesn't happen as often, this attitude has carried with me until now. I hate feeling sexual urges.

592,"I‘ll try to be as precise and give enough information as possible. I really don‘t know what I can do in this situation, and noone in my friend group can relate or help because it‘s too private to talk about or they were never in a situation like this. Maybe some of you here have experience with something like that.

My best friend and I are both 20, started university not long ago and are living in different cities. He‘s in a big one and seems to experience many new things and meet new people, and I‘m happy about that. The things is though, he clearly has mental health problems and is probably depressed. He is seeing a therapist and  I don‘t remember if he had a clear diagnosis, but I won‘t say I don‘t believe him when he is saying that he has depression. 

Over the years I was with him through his worst times and am really glad that he got help. But even though he has a therapist he is always miserable. I don‘t know what to do. It got really bad when he had a boyfriend for a short time, but „cheated“ (wanted to have sex with someone else, but didn‘t do it). Of course this boyfriend ended it and since then my best friend cares immensely about his appearance, he has to look hot 24/7, asks me what photos to post, and sleeps with one guy after another. Obviously he has huge self image  issues and I tried to help with that. We talked a while ago, and I thought finally I could do something good for him, but yesterday he texted again how his depression gets worse and worse. And even though he seeks validation and compassion by his friends, he is unpleasant to be around sometimes because he’s super emotional and can take things very personal very fast when confronted with critique.Its pretty complicated.

So, what could I do here? I can‘t give him thousands of compliments anymore because it won‘t help. I can‘t tell him that he needs to love himself first because thats easier said than done. But also it seems so cruel to just let him talk and wait for him to get better somehow. He has a therapist, and I know he texts me because I‘m his best friend and he feels safe with me.

Most of the time it’s locked, but the times it turned out to be unlocked (in a sketchy area, valuables in the car, etc) was enough to make me question myself every time. If I don’t do this, I can’t reassure myself that “it’s probably locked”.

*TRIGGER WARNING* Mentions of racism, abuse, se*ual assault 
  This post may be long, scattered, and sound like a lifetime movie. Bare with me. 

 When I was 18, i packed my things and moved over 1,000 miles away with my cat to live with some friends. Within hours of arriving to my new home, I met my now husband. Who I seemed to be the most genuine, loving person I ever met. Well so I thought. 
   
  I have to admit I was naive. I noticed some red flags within him. His anger, his hovering, him ""falling in love"" with me after a week. But I chose to ignore it all. I dont know why. Maybe I loved the attention? All I know is, if i had known what i know today, i would have ran for the fucking hills. 

  Fast forward about 5 months. We got married (stupid. I know). And everything wonderful seemed to fall apart within weeks of saying "" I do"". He started to control me, would throw tantrums for me not having sex with him, would hit my cat, started to show his homophobic and racist traits. I was honestly mortified. I started to seek advice from people I knew. "" The first year is the hardest"" "" Just show him how to not be like that"" What the fuck? I think a part of me was just too scared to come to terms that this *amazing* person I fell in love with was a piece of shit. So I stayed and tried to change him. How stupid. 

  Things got worse and worse. He got violent. Broke a door and dresser down trying to get to me because I found out HE was talking to other women. He made me believe I was crazy and I started to question myself. 'Am I trying hard enough?' 'Am I not being a good wife?' I know now that it was none of these things. Hes just a piece of shit. So I made a plan to leave. 
 
  Then I peed on a stick. Boom. I'm pregnant. 

   A month later, I left him. I reached out to a group of wives in my town and found somewhere to stay until I could find a way to drive back home. I had no money, no job, and my tires were too bald to drive 20 hours by myself. He texted all my family and friends, said he was going to kill himself.  Someone in the group doxxed me and he found me. I ended up going back. He promised he would stop drinking. ( This man drinks everyday. And starts at 7am on the weekends ) He would respect me. Would not make me cry, etc. Lord was I a dumbass. 

   Those 'promises' lasted a week - if that. If anything he became more controlling. Then was openly racist and sexist all the time. I myself am a snowflake. I stand for black lives matter, gay rights, equal rights for women etc. When I voice my opinions he tells me I'm stupid. He claims our baby isnt allowed to be around queers or black people. I have 3 mixed nephews and majority of my support system back home is made of black women. When I tell him I think HIS opinions are fucked up, he says I dont have the right to tell him that because he hates gay people because he was se*ually assaulted as a child from a male family member. When he says that, I honestly dont know what to say so I just walk away. 

   I'm at the point where I do not love this man in any shape or form. I dont want to kiss him. Cuddle him. Have sex with him. Or even be around him. I work a job just so I can be away from him. I have already moved on, and grieved our marriage and the man he used to be. He hates this all and begs for my love and attention but I do not have it in my heart to care. I cant be with this man. I cannot have my child grow up with a father like this. I dont trust him. I just dont know how to leave. 

   He deploys soon and will be gone while the baby is born. I plan to move back home and have a safe place to live with the baby. A part of me wants to wait it out and when I go home, just not come back. But I'm scared about divorse and custody issues. I really dont have proof of his behavior and dont know how we would co parent from 1,000 miles away. I'm just lost. 
  
  I've honestly realized that nobody is coming to save me, and this is something I need to do myself. I just dont know how. 
 
   I'm looking for advice on how to go about leaving him. I know I am done. There is nothing left for me here. I am so miserable and cannot neglect myself any more than I already have. I just dont know what steps to take or what to tell him. I apologize for the long, scattered read, but I am begging for help. I need to get the fuck out of this state and move on with my life. Too bad he will be in it until our child is 18, but I'm hoping he will realize he doesnt want this and will cut us out. Is that wrong? 

 ;TLDR; My husband is a racist, sexist, homophobic man and I dont want to be with him anymore. I am pregnant and want to leave but I'm not sure what steps I should take to get out of this situation.",18Sep2019,0
596,"16, male, no hobbies, always bored, feel awful about myself. Overall I've seemed to be a happy person, but as of a few months ago I can't seem to find that happiness.

I bounce between school and making YouTube videos with the occasional video video game and friends, but I feel worthless, like I'm wasting my time, or as if I have something better to do. 

The new school year started and I'm trying to make more friends. The few that I currently have seem like they are shaking me off sometimes and though I try my best, I think we are drifting slightly.

I've adopted minimalism to my life because of my generalized anxiety disorder. That helps. No notifications on any social media, limited apps, get rid of physical things I don't need. That has helped me a lot. Social media really emotionally drains you.

I just don't know what else I could do in my spare time. I feel useless, like I'm wasting time, and my anxiety isn't doing me any good on top of that. I just want a sense of direction, or something beneficial I can put my time towards. I'm open to any and all ideas and I appreciate you taking the time to read this",18Sep2019,2
597,"Recently my friends went out to eat at a popular wing restaurant. We go out weekly and meet up to eat and hang out for a bit. This time I wasn't feeling great so I missed out of the chance to go. My friends continued without me.

Well when they went they saw a black family near them setting up for a birthday party with some dollar store decorations. From what i was told was that the decorations were maybe 10 dollars worth. My friends thought it was cute and went back to looking at the menu. 

Their waitress enters and basically says ""That's cheap for us(white people), but expensive for them(black people)."" My friends awkwardly laughed and then just tried to order. They all sat and thought that was weird but moved on. 

Then the manager came over and said something racist as well. ""I don't know why black people keep setting up over there."" Again my friends didn't say anything and just awkwardly laughed and ignored them. Later when time came to pay and leave one of my friends left a pretty sizable tip of 5 dollars. This is what hurts the most. I know that servers live based on tips but if there was ever a time not to tip this was it.

The friend who tipped told me about the situation thought I would get a kick out of it. I didnt. I was really disappointed because of how often I, and they share the sentiment of saying something when you hear something wrong. I tend to be the one in most situations doing this and leading. 

While I recognize others may not share in my confidence in shutting down bad behavior it hurts that they couldn't bring themselves to do it in this one instance. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth and now I'm uncomfortable.

602,"So as the title says: I got sexually assaulted in my sleep. This happened July 14th 2019 and I've decided to report him. It's a really tough and stomach wrenching decision, because I've known the guy for 5 years, but I need to do this. 

The assault happened at a small gathering, 6 people, with really close friends. We are all underage. Three of us were drunk: the one who assaulted me, a friend and me. But we were all close friends so we could trust each other. I wasn't drinking with strangers: I was drinking with my best friends who I've gone through many hardships with.

We slept in a tent together with the 5 of us after one of them went home for work. We all had separate air mattresses, but slept close together. The guy had tried to make some sort of advance to get me in the sleeping bag with him, but I refused because I did not feel comfortable with it.

That night while I was asleep, he decided to stroke my back, which woke me up. I ignored it, because I didn't think anything of it. But when he started to touch my ass I froze up, I was paralysed and couldn't move. The shock and fear that I felt made me unable to move or react. He got more and more handy, first touching my breasts over the clothes and then under. He touched and squeezed my ass. Kissed my neck and mouth. He almost slipped his hand into my panties but stopped himself.

He admitted to everything in a text conversation he had with my SO. I don't know if what happened counts as assault, if it's punishable and if the proof I have is proof. I really don't know how to handle this situation. 

All I need to know is, did he assault me?",18Sep2019,4
603,"Context: My mother had to work overseas so I was left with the maternal side of the family. My father had left us when I was eight, and I had never heard from him since. 

My grandmother and relatives were abusive to me, but my best friend had helped me through some rough points in my life. Aside from my mother, she was the only person I cared about and trusted.

Given my difficult childhood, I worked very hard both at school and at work, so that I eventually managed to move out. I also became top of the batch in college, something that I would always be grateful for. 

But this came at a price. My best friend became competitive and I felt our relationship drastically change. Over the years, and even after graduation, I felt the gap between us growing wider. Eventually, she stopped contacting me, and I had to initiate all our interactions. She would reply after a month, sometimes longer, and always with one-liners.

Recently, I found out that she got herself a boyfriend, and I was hurt that she never mentioned it to me. I had to find out on Facebook, of all places. 

My longterm boyfriend said that she has always been jealous of me, and that I should let her go, but it's hard. I try not to think about it, but it still stings to know that someone I really trusted and cared about could cast me off so cavalierly, as though I was nothing more than a house rag. 

I know this was a long time coming. I've been trying for 4 years now, but I'm so tired. I don't need this kind of pain, especially after everything I've gone through in life. 

Sorry, I just want to vent, and share this. :(",18Sep2019,5
604,"So at work we were talking about our exes and our worst ones. 

I mentioned how one ex was controlling and said “she was the one that cheated” 

I just said it then realized “I’ve never proved it” 

I mean shs had dreams of me cheating. Made me block a female friend. People said she used to flirt with this guy and she snapped him on a consistent bases. She said it was for work. Yet they had a work group snap. She snapped separately. 

Then a week later she was dating him after the breakup and rubbed it in my face. 

It sounded like she did. 

Again I wasn’t perfect in the relationship and no where near will I claim to be. I made a lot of mistakes. Nothing concerning cheating tho. But like when we fought I said mean things to her. I’ve since learned to control myself and not go off. It took a lot of learning tbh. 

Anyways now I’m a bit suspicious that a co worker will tell my ex this. Cause one co worker went to school with them but was 2 classes lower than them.

606,"Hello, sorry for the longish post and messy post, I am sad that my cats are fighting and am a bit emotional that I may have to re-home one of my cats.

I have two cats. One of them I've had for 7 years, and the other I adopted as a kitten at the beginning of 2018. Kitty is my oldest, and Zephyr is the one I adopted almost two years ago now. It took a little bit of time for them to get used to each other, but I followed all online articles on how to introduce cats and they got along fine for the past almost two years, up until recently. 

Currently in my home situation, my roommate has a dog that is generally aggressive (not towards the housemates, but to strangers and the cats), however mostly stays with my roommate in his room. When the dog is out of his room, he's leashed, however I don't trust my roommate enough to keep a tight enough hold on the leash to let my cats out all the time. They mostly stay in my room unless I make it known to my roommate that the cats are out or I have a day to myself in which I let them out of my room. It sounds terrible, but my room is the largest bedroom in the house and is just barely smaller than the apartment I had when I first got Zephyr and lived with the cats for a while. 

Recently I had to bring Zephyr to the vets as we had a brief encounter with fleas (taken care of immediately and the cats are on Frontline), but Zephyr kept itching at the flea bites to give herself two concerning welt. I had to bring her to the emergency clinic (because regular vet appointments couldn't be scheduled until about a month and a half out) where she had the scabs removed by the vet and I was given some ointment to treat her with. All is good with that now, however as soon as I brought her back from the vet that day, the cats weren't getting along. 

I wrote it off, as Kitty can sometimes get testy with new smells. For example, I recently watched a couple of cats who stayed in our guest bedroom and Zephyr hung around the door to that room a lot. When Kitty noticed a different smell on her, she and Zephyr fought a small bit and kept their distance for a few days, then all was well. 

Unfortunately this time they are still fighting a month to a month and a half later. When in my room, Zephyr would go after Kitty (it was hard to tell if Zephyr was just being playful or not at first, but I'm certain it's no longer playful) and Kitty would stay under my bed growling and hissing the whole time, fending off Zephyr when needed. After a day or two with no resolution, I put Zephyr in the basement because the stress isn't good for the cats and it broke my heart to see them fighting. The basement is half finished and it's not too hot or cold at this time of year. Brought down toys and a bed and bought a litter box and another food and water dish. I spent time with both of them every day and this soon became the norm. 

I tried reintroducing them a couple of times, in which Zephyr attacked Kitty immediately and Kitty would run and hide and Zephyr would not hold back. It breaks my heart. 

I switched Zephyr to my room and Kitty to the basement which works better for both of them now, as my boyfriends room is right next to the basement and we spend time with Kitty every night (I mostly stay in his room for the night because on top of Zephyr's attitude towards Kitty, she's also a nightmare in every other aspect which I'll elaborate on a bit later). 

There have been a couple of times where Zephyr escaped my bedroom and found Kitty and immediately attacked her. Today I have the house to myself, so I figured I'd chill in my boyfriends room with Kitty and let Zephyr have some freedom in the house. Kitty was just laying peacefully by the closed bedroom door when all of a sudden I hear a loud hiss and Zephyr's paw jut under the door and attack Kitty. Kitty hid under the bed for a long time and wouldn't come out, and I had to go put Zephyr back in my room. Zephyr wasn't even out of my room for 15 minutes before this happened. 

I am completely beside myself and don't know what to do. As a lifelong cat owner, I've never had to deal with anything like this and there doesn't seem like a way to remedy it without re-homing Zephyr. 

When I got Zephyr as a kitten, she was a bit of a troublemaker, but I loved her and could deal with it at first. She destroys toilet paper rolls, knocks things off of shelves, always jumps places where she's not supposed to. She rips my clothes off their hangers and even once in the past two weeks ripped down the pole holding my hung-up clothes. She doesn't clean her butt and smells a lot, so I have to clean her with a baby wipe sometimes just to be able to spend time with her. She also destroys a lot of my things. She pees on the mat outside of the litter box that's supposed to catch the litter off of their paws, despite having a clean litter box. When it's clean and she's not peeing on it, she drags it into the litter box to help ""bury"" her soils. When she uses the litter box, she digs for a long time, stirring up clumped urine and making her paws and my room smell. I clean the litter box often, but I can't get to it every time she pees especially working 9 hours a day and having a little bit of a life. She drags my dirty clothes from my laundry basket into her water dish (I read that it's an instinct to ""save"" it for later) which I've half remedied by buying a dish holder and a filtered water bubbler for the cats. I've basically had to Zephyr-proof my room, which doesn't work that well because she's always finding new ways to make trouble with my things, despite buying her multiple different kids of toys and scratching posts etc.

When I do sleep in my room, she jumps up on my nightstand and knocks things over (something I've been working with her on but to no avail) and that is the only time I use a squirt bottle on her. She'll jump down after getting sprayed, but jump back up immediately. This can go on forever and she knows she's doing something bad, because she'll act like she's going to jump down when I reach for the squirt bottle, but never does and I usually have to physically remove her, just for her to jump up again in a minute or two. I have a large walk-in closet in my room where I used to keep the litter box. She is so noisy and bothersome at night that sometimes I have to put her in there until the morning just to get some sleep (because I can't kick her out of my room for the night because of my roommate and his dog). I know that also sounds terrible, but I make her she has food and water when I put her in there and move the litter box in there too. It's either that or she'll keep me up all night, which I can't afford every night. I'm honestly avoiding my room at this point because I can't sleep with her in the room and she destroys things and just honestly stresses me out being around her. She's adorable and cute and nice sometimes when she feels like being good, but this whole situation has me on edge and all the things she does that normally stress me out are stressing me out even more with the whole situation with her and Kitty fighting. Her overall behavior has honestly just gotten worse over the past year or so.

I really don't know what to do and am beside myself with this whole situation. I adopted her with the intention of her being a lifelong pet, but even working with her bad behaviors as a kitten, she's only developed more bad habits. And the fighting is something that I absolutely cannot tolerate, especially when Kitty is so good and is now suffering because of the situation. I don't want to contribute to unadopted animals at shelters, which is why I adopted her in the first place, but I don't know how to remedy her behaviors and especially her nasty attitude towards Kitty that happened out of nowhere. I've worked with animals my whole life and really have not seen anything like this. 

Does anyone have any advice to this situation or do I really need to find another home for Zephyr? Thank you for anyone who actually read this entire post. I know it seems like a lot over a cat situation, but Kitty is my life and has been through so much with me over the past 7 years and I love Zephyr too, but my life is a mess because of Zephyr as I can't even enjoy my own bedroom anymore and my heart breaks over her attacking Kitty.",18Sep2019,1
607,"I need advice on how to deal with noisy downstairs neighbors. It is a family, husband and wife and two kids. The first kid is 2 years old and he was born when I bought the condo.

612,"There have been a lot of problems surrounding me recently. I always feel very sad, tired and sleepy when I arrived home from school. 

Most of the problems are about academic. Because of ""studying"", my relationship with my friends and parents are worsening. I don't have the time to bond with them and most importantly, my parents won't allow me to bond with them(they would tell me to study everytime I try to talk to them). I also obtained very unsatisfied grades in a lot of subjects and I even regret saying that I aspire to be a vet in the future. I have to get a high grade in the diploma in order to get into the one and only university with vet as a subject in where I live. However, studying vet in another country costs a lot(other subjects are fine though). I hope to study overseas so I kind of want to give up studying vet. The thing is, my teachers and parents hope that I could study vet, I don't want to let them down. I now despise studying and I don't want to face the future. 

Someone important in my life is now leaving and I am going to miss her a lot. Contacting through social media platforms is fine but she rarely uses them. I also have very low self-esteem. I quit my only hobby because I need to ""study"", I am also short and heavy. I am not fat and I spent months exercising. According to my friends, I got heavy because muscles were grown. It still won't help stopping me from feeling like trash.

I also feel so helpless because I cannot talk about this with my classmates as I simply can't trust them. My situation is probably not bad comparing to other people and I shouldn't be whining so I am afraid to tell people who know me.

613,"I'm 21(m) and I'm currently in my fourth and last year as an accounts major at university. I found accounting not too bad in highschool and in my first year, but now Ive lost alot of any kind of passionate I had for it, I don't have a drive to really want to learn it any more.  People always tell me "" there's good money in accounting"", but good money doesn't necessarily translate to happy for me. Id gain more happiness from being a public accountant helping people.

I have though gotten into a taste for cooking and have really into creating meals and learning techniques too.

614,"Alright, so this might sound Far fetched, but last night, approx 2am In the morning I was woken to my phone playing a YouTube video.

Now that’s not the issue. I ALWAYS put my phone on DND (do no disturb) an lock it when I go to sleep (around 11pm). I’m a very light sleeper and none of my family members know my password so it cannot be them.

When I looked at my phone, which was in my drawer, it was on the YouTube app, and was on the page to buy YouTube premium, with the video playing in the background. Now, not only was I COMPLETELY UNABLE to use any buttons on my phone, I couldn’t turn it off, go to home screen, nothing.zilch. 

It was repeating the letters ‘h,t,y’ over and over in the password box to purchase the premium (even though it’s the free trial). After about 10 minutes I had control of my phone again. Albeit very low battery, but I got it back and everything was normal I guess.

615,"My GF (we're both 30) lives in apartment complex where she regularly walks her dog. About 3 weeks ago she met a guy who claimed to have autism (he announced after she said she worked with kids with autism) and he claimed he was 27. She said the initial vibe from him was strange but her dog, who normally barks at strangers, seemed very calm so she kept talking to him. 

The guy adds her on facebook and the next day ""loves"" tons of her pictures and messages her constantly. She tries to make it clear she can't always chat online because she's busy but he can't seem to understand. 

The next couple of weeks whenever she's walking her dog he meets up with her, even when she tries to avoid his usual hang out spots in the complex. He drones on and on about how lonely he is. Another neighbor even said they try to avoid him because he never stops talking about how lonely he is.

Yesterday she gets home from work and sees him behind her parked car. She pretends to be on her phone for a few minutes and he waits outside her car, eventually leaving.

Later that night she's finishing a dog walk and he sprints up to her prepared to pepper spray him. She tells him not to ever do that again. He proceeds to ask if she was wearing a dress (she was wearing a nightgown) to bed last night and tells her he knows what building she lives in.

She calls the police later and asks if they can patrol her complex at night to which they agree.

This morning after a dog walk she sees him running toward her as she's going inside, then she sees him looking up into her window and proceeds to send her a message saying ""I saw you this morning.""

She's contacted apartment mgmt, the cops (again), letting them know she wants him away from her. She has also deleted and blocked him on fb.

He lives alone and has an aunt that checks up on him but no living parents.

618,"When we first met, we got along really well. You know that feeling where sometimes when you meet someone, you feel like you've known them for really long? It was like that. We exchanged numbers and texted almost everyday.

Then he would wave at me in class everyday. Would text during class. When I didn't attend school, he would text me and asked why. He also helped me out with other stuff

A few days ago, it felt like something was wrong. He smiled and talked but Idk, something felt wrong. I asked him and he said he was fine. A couple of days later, he got scolded for not studying by the teacher. I talked to him that day and he said ""I'm fed up. I really am"". I kept asking him what was wrong but he just told me to forget about what he said. So I asked him to study and he refused but then later at night said he would. Next day in class, he answered all the questions that the teacher asked. It genuinely made me happy

But the same day, he started ignoring me. No ""hey's"". No texts. I tried to talk and smile but he just simply acted like he didn't see me. The next day I was talking to a guy. He walked and stood near us. Then he interrupted and started talking to the guy. I looked and smiled, he looked at me but then turned his head away

Today, I cracked a joke in class. Everyone laughed. He laughed the most. But when our eyes met, he stopped laughing and looked away. I often see him looking at me but then he just rolls his eyes. I don't understand this behavior. Help? :)

Now im sorted out my hair, my achene is basically gone and iv started weight lifting, so im doing better.

628,"*I've never posted here before, throwaway account for reasons, and I'm on mobile :)*

First off, I dont think there is a ""right person"" in his life right now. But it's not his current fiance. I know I sound like an a** for saying this, but hear me out.

He met his current fiance in highschool. She was a cousin of one of my friends, I helped set them up on a date. She is a very nice person when you first meet her and she seemed like a great match for him. But, as they've dated these past 3 years, shes become more and more emotionally manipulative, I'd almost even say emotionally abusive. She has threatened to leave the country because he wouldnt leave his job asap to come see her (""I'm currently at the airport, waiting to get on the next flight, if you dont show up within the next hour, then you dont really love me"". She was sitting in her room watching netflix). She's screamed at him because he came over with a cute present and she wasnt in the mood. Things like that happen at least once a month. Smaller, but still painful and manipulative, things happen far more often.

We are a very religious family and he used to believe in it wholeheartedly. She has convinced him to leave our church completely and he wont even talk about religion in any context with us. The reason she left our church is a reason I almost left, but then worked though and came back with the help of my husband. She has a strained relationship with her family and is convincing him that his family is just as bad. I used to be best friends with my brother, but now he won't talk to me except for short replies like yes or no.

I met my current husband a few months before my twin met his current fiance. My husband and I had a slightly rocky relationship in the beginning because of mistakes we both made, but we've been insanely happy and life has been near perfect since we got married a year ago. We were never abusive to each other, but other than that, my relationship with my husband and my brother's relationship with his fiance have been very similar, because they made similar mistakes. I think my brother thinks his relationship will turn out as well as mine did, but I really think he will just be miserable and will just take it (like how my grandpa has just taken emotional abuse from my grandma for almost 50 years). He's a people pleaser and he genuinely does love his fiance. And I think his fiance thinks she's in love, but I think she mostly sees my brother as a way out of her family's grasp.

They're getting married in 2 weeks. I've danced around talking with my brother about his fiance before, telling him he might want to date other people before settling down, but he got upset and shut me down. This was over a year ago. He's never had any other relationship than this one and so he doesn't have anything to compare this with. I think he thinks it's normal.

How should I tell him I think he's making a huge mistake? Or should I stay quiet and help him from afar somehow? I cant just let him be unhappy for forever. The rest of my family feels the same way, they just also aren't sure what to do. Everything we've tried has pushed him further away. The last time I saw them smile together was over 6 months ago.

A bit of context: I've moved each year for the past several years, and so am constantly adjusting to new environments and layouts. I moved into a place recently that I like very much and believe I want to stay in for the foreseeable future. However, I always do this thing where I move in juuuuust enough such that it's habitable (e.g., mattress gets laid down, desk gets set up, clothes get separated), but everything else just kind of falls all over. There's a number of reasons for this: I have a lot of shit, I'm fairly busy and usually don't get home until very late, and I'm a fairly disorganized human being when it comes to physical objects. But I need to take care of this and address the issue.

It bothers me that I don't have a comfortable living space, and it *especially* needs to be addressed since I need to do a lot of work at home when I am there.

651,"I (F32) have been with my boyfriend (M36) for 3 years,  we live together and have a 7 month old baby. And although this is so, I still feel like the newbie at family gatherings. 

My boyfriend has a brother (M34) whom has been married (F28) for like approx 10 years. Together they have an 8 month old Son.

The wife makes me feel so uncomfortable, its like I can feel a negative and heavy vibe from her towards me. Whenever she is around I can feel her penetrating stare....when I turn to look at her, SHE WONT LOOK AWAY, its like she hates me that much, I cant interpret it another way. So I look away, but feeling stomped on, disrespected, and belittled. It eventually makes me feel angry. 

In the 3 years that I have been part of this family, I feel like I have been more of a kiss a** with her  than with my Mother in Law (F57) whom I have also started to dislike a little because I know they are buddies, and its understandable since they do know eachother longer. And even though my Mother in Law says she loves all her daughter in Laws equally, I feel its not true. But that doesnt really matter to me.

Its the attitude and staring I get from the wife that is really starting to get under my skin because I feel I havent handled it well. I want to put her in  her place, but avoid starting an argument or getting confrontational. 

I have talked about it with my Mother in Law and my Boyfriend, and all i get is that she might be jealous because im prettier. Thats doesnt make me feel forgiving of her actions. I really wish we could get along. But I already had enough of trying to be on her good graces. 

And now my Brother in Law doesnt talk to me either, its like he is forbidden to do so. Which causes me to feel angry when I see my boyfriend being friendly to the wife for the sake of keeping the ""peace""....

Lately I have just been feeling like i dont want to be around at family gatherings anymore.

What do you do when someone stares? How to handle it?",18Sep2019,2

This psychosis came suddenly after a set of symptoms, during and after my psychosis certain symptoms persisted and new problems emerged. Being pyschotic was a scary experience but I am fully recovered. I hear no voices, no hallucinations, no paranoia. I am now exercising twice a week, eating maximum healthy and avoiding every stress.I have told symptom to a doctor but since I'm an Arab living in a European country healthcare can be the opposite of what you would expect of an European country. When I tell it to my GP he refers me to psychiatrist. When I tell my psychiatrist he treats me like i'm some sort of 'thing', he's not really listening. I told him about the symptoms, but i couldn't really talk well. First I'm an introverted quite guy, second is that I felt this overwhelming feeling of hopelessness knowing the way he is. I told him for instance I feel like my head is swollen (I mean my brains obviously). He took this literally and believes I have a delusion that I believe my head is literally expanding like I'm some sort of balloon. I was just stunned and left speechless, I never knew mental stigma's could be this horrible.

I'm not complaining, it's their house and I'm grateful to stay here, but it's really thrown a wrench in my plans to try teaching ESL online. I even paid a life coaching company $25 to ask them advice and, predictably, she just came back with a lot of stuff about self-love and starting a gratitude journal.

I have nowhere else where I can go and set up my laptop and teach online.

It didn’t work out and they said they had none but would keep me on the waitlist just in case. 
I never got a response so I became a commuter commuting from home, though I wasn’t thrilled about it because of the stigma it can have as well as how it would affect me socially.  
Weeks passed, classes began, and now I’m in the habit of commuting. My parents knew how I wanted a single room badly, so they were fine with having me stay because they knew it was a stressful factor for me. I kind of got used to it and enjoy the commodities of home compared to campus because I hated living in a dorm.

671,"  About 2 1/2 hours ago I (M17) got into a verbal altercation with a group of students that lead to one of them unconscious on the floor..... Infront of all of his ""homies"". Heres what happened, and based on this information Id appreciate if you can make your own observations and thoughts on it that will attribute to the advice you conclude with. Theres a walkway inbetween two sets of tables in our cafeteria that lead to the lunch line, this is where the altercation and the fight happened. So basically me and my bro are headed down it to get our morning breakfast, as we usually do, and a group of kids (the hostile type), lined shoulder to shoulder, were walking the opposite direction as us towards our schools hallways. They took up the hole width of the walkway, so the only way past them was through them, seeing as they were not willing to make way for us, or atleast turn a shoulder. So to avoid completely ramming the kid directly infront of me (1 of about a group of 6 or 7) and minimize the force of impact, I did the only thing I could do, and turned side ways so I can lightly graze his shoulder and squeeze between him and the table on our side. Yes, as small as this is, this was what lead to the altercation. I dont remember the exact words exhanged between us (but I do believe I initially tried apologizing or atleast explaining myself) but I do know most of them werent too friendly - or reasonable, on their part. Of course my brother being my brother (16) stood by myside the whole time, like every other time weve dealt with assholes,  and usually when hes involved I get very defensive and the chance of an altercation getting physical increases significantly, so hes kind of an important factor as to why it went down south so fast. It was when I flipped them off and turned around to leave the scene that I realized they werent gonna let this down, because they were still yapping and my brother was still upset with them (we deal with stupid shit  like this alot so I guess today was our breaking point). I ran up to defend my bro because they were getting too close, like within punching distance, and pulled him away from the group and told him that were outnumbered. But, ironically, it didnt stop me from socking the most hostile kid,who was bigger and stronger than me (Idk the age difference) in the face when he started getting loud and threatning. Boom, fight breaks out. He swings back hard and in an overwhelming amount, so naturally (because I have baclground in MMA) I close the distance and manage to take the dude down, from there I got a punch or two in before he tried reversing the position by getting to his knees and attacking my legs, boom, guillotine choke from guard. I held it until he went limp and humiliated him infront of a great portion of the school and all of his friends, who I have reason to believe are gang realated (my main concern). He slept for a good minute as I screamed at the crowd and acted crazy, even cussed his friends out some more. I yelled things like ""nobody fuck with me!!"" and a bunch of other warnings-I, being extremely introverted and dealing with anxiety, felt this was neccesarry and a perfect opprtunity to gain my respect while I had the adrenaline to. Now, I regret every bit of it. My brothers are already getting threats and people are warning me that the kids friends are gonna come after us. Im honestly scared, mostly for my brothers, and I dont know if school will be safe for us anymore.  Im worried that we will have to fave hostilities for the rest of the year.

The only other 2 jobs I had were cashiers at these 2 stores which I absolutely hated. I can’t stand sitting around and waiting for the time to pass. There was just no way of making those jobs fun.

679," Hello,

**Background:** I am a PhD level engineer and have a decent salary. After seeing my family member's 1998 Ford breaking down and how expensive the fixes were, I decided to sell my 2010 Honda Fit Sport and get something a little bit newer without spending too much. I sold the Honda Fit (with 63K miles) for 8250$ and added 5250$ and bought a 2016 Corolla LE (with 9K miles) this month, both from private buyer and seller respectively. I may consider buying a home soon so I did not want to spend too much on a vehicle either.

**Why I went for a Toyota?** I used to have a Camry before Honda Fit and enjoyed it for 6 years, so due to my issues with the wind and the rain with the small Honda Fit feeling unstable, I was ready to go back to a larger and reliable vehicle. I also liked the 2015 Prius's and I could not find a clean one under 16000$. Instead, I found a clean Corolla, which was owned by an elderly person, thus it was in immaculate condition. I like how my 2016 Corolla LE drives, I like the null steering wheel and stable ride over a shaky ride. The speed of 1.8 CVT engine is totally sufficient for me and I like how corners feel stable, compared to my light weight Honda Fit.

**Now, here is the question:** I still look at Sea Pearl colored 2015 Prius's and wonder if I kept searching more until I found one. At the same time, fall and rainy season started kicking in and I had to buy a car sooner than later and did not want to miss a clean car with 9K miles on it. After all, I don't do more than 5-10 miles a day and use the car from work/home except some short weekend trips in town.

**Why am I worrying:** I should be grateful to find a great deal like this 2016 Corolla LE that I fully own (no car payments), but why do I second guess it? What is wrong with me? I think If I went with the Prius I would worry about batteries and so on so Corolla felt like a good choice. The only issue is the light gray interior, which I am unable to find good seat covers yet.

Obviously the chances of being able to have a creative job full time/earn a decent living is pretty much 0 (and I know PMA! haha) and so currently I'm working in retail and have been for years. 

Recently, I got a new job working in a different store, however, it's worse than the one I was at before- I left my previous position as I had an opportunity come up (regarding potential creative job), but it didn't work out. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful that I have a job and that I'm earning money, I just want to vent online for a bit to clear my head. 

I feel like I'm wasting my life- stuck in a job that I really don't like and I'm trying everything I can think of to get closer to my goal, but nothing seems to be working. I don't earn an awful lot of money, so I feel like I'm just existing rather than living haha.

I want to make friends - and crave a fabulous friendship group (which I also realise may be a bit ambitious at present) - but I struggle so much. Any advice?",18Sep2019,1
693,"I'm moving to a city I've never been to before for my first job. I have always lived with my parents even during college, when I went a college and ran back home in a week and joined one near my home. Now I have to move to a new city cause I don't have any other options.

1) I'm really anxious and scared of being away from my parents and feel like there's this huge weight on my chest preventing me from breathing. I love them and don't wanna leave them but I have to, so I don't know what to do.

2) I'll have to get an apartment, and it'll be over a month before my friend joins me and so I'll have to live there alone. And I'm really terrified thinking of that, and it's both rational fears like someone robbing me and irrational fears like ghosts and what not.

3) I know I have to do this, and I don't wanna run back home this time, so I'll have to be brave, but I already feel like crying, thinking of these feelings that I've experienced before and I know will experience again. 

4) I don't feel like being away from my parents, like if I was getting an apartment 2 hours away by road, cause I cant commute daily cause of the traffic feels less scary than moving to a city 2 hours away by flight. Also my friends would be there and we would've gotten a place together in the former situation. 


Any advice on how to overcome this and move on? I am just terrified and don't wanna lose. Every time I feel like this I get an anxiety attack or something, and start panicking and I know it'll just get worse.

Please help me...",18Sep2019,3
694,I’m identifying as non-binary and I’m 16. I was born female. I hate myself and I hate my body. This body isn’t mine and it’s really scary.

700,"A little under two years ago, my partner and I were living in Utah. He had a great job, as did I. We had friends. A handsome saving account under our belts. We discovered we were pregnant, and after confirming and telling family, my mom instantly bombarded us with “so when are you coming home?” The rest of our family lived in Georgia, and we were essentially alone in Utah. After giving it a lot of time and thought, we decided maybe it was time to go home. My mom promised she would help me babysit once he was born. I work from home as a small freelance artist and business owner. 

Shortly after he was born, we discovered my moms dog absolutely hated the baby. He instantly snapped at the car seat and I was out of there within seconds. So she decided she would just have to come to my house to help babysit. It was fine at first. She came about 2-3 times a week. Enough to get some solid work in. About 4 months later, she got news that my dad’s company was under new ownership and they were offering him a job in another state. She asked us to come along, and while we were hesitant, after some coercing, we agreed. With what little we had in savings, we found a place only five minutes away from  their new home, and thought things would be just peachy from then on. Before, we lived an hour away from my mom, and she was still able to come frequently, so we thought this would be even easier for her.

However, after we all moved, things just got... worse. Two visits a week turned into one, always with excuses like “I have a headache today” or “the dog is acting up” or “your dad is being grumpy so I’m staying home.” The move really put a dent in our bank account, so all of these missed days, all of this missed work, really started adding up. We’ve been scraping by for months, living on a shoestring budget. Even though she lives five minutes away, we never saw her. Never got invited over for dinner. The few times we did get to see her, she would lock the aggressive dog away, but we weren’t allowed to make so much as a coo or a giggle or it would “stress the dog out.” 

Now just last week, after countless excuses, with no warning, she says she can’t babysit anymore. Whatsoever. I was told this the morning she was supposed to come over, an hour after not showing up. I feel at a loss. As I mentioned earlier, with all the missed work, I hardly have enough for bills let alone a babysitter. I feel like I gave up everything to be stuck in an even worse situation than I was before.

We gave up family, friends, and a career to move here, and now I feel like we have nothing. I haven’t seen them in two weeks aside from my mom popping in unannounced to cause a scene because I had been “ignoring her.” I feel completely and utterly isolated and depressed and I just don’t know what to do. Ever since leaving Utah, my partner hasn’t been able to find a career in his field and has settled with a job he absolutely despised. As a result, he’s also obviously depressed. I just don’t know what to do at this point. I’ve been watching over my baby from 6am-6pm everyday, making dinner, and then working from 8pm-12am every single day to make ends meet. My partner and I barely spend time together anymore. We haven’t been on a date in months. I just don’t know what to do.

Are there any other work-from-home moms that have any advice on keeping sane?",18Sep2019,2
702,"In all my fourteen years of life, I have been described as a range of characterstics: quiet, loud, extremely clever, terrifyingly silly, e.t.c, e.t.c. This is a product of a process I developed from around the age of six where I pretend to be outgoing, bold and the usual fun, relatable bundle of joy people gravitate to, and show pinpricks of intelligence if the situation calls for it, when in reality I would rather observe interactions than participate. 
As you may imagine, this has caused many problems in the past, from identity issues, to random people telling me life stories.
In year seven, I moved to a private music school, which resulted in sheltered me becoming even more sheltered. I had a small friend group of three girls (I'll call them Mary,   Maria and Kit) and we laughed and joked alot, but Maria and I never spoke of actual information about our lives, whereas Mary and Kit frequently were open about crushes, family life and their private issues.
Fast forward to today: A friend confronted us with the information that Kit is extremely sad because we don't really talk about *deep stuff* and she wants to tell us so much. According to this friend, best friends can share everything with each other and rely on each other.
To my ears however, this sounds ridiculous. Firstly, I have no entirely secret secrets. Sure, I have the whole fake character problem, but I simply don't mention this information. Crushes seem silly at the age of fourteen. Humans are fickle creatures and are not trustworthy enough to tell your secrets to. Also, my friends and I kind of had an unspoken agreement of not mentioning anything remotely privacy related so as to always have a safe ground. I guess you could say we all have trust issues lol. Our friendship is more of a mutually beneficial relationship to learn the strong points off each other and not mention the weak points to them.
Of course, we care for each other! It's  just in a rather cold way.
Is this what a friendship should be like?",18Sep2019,1

If I don’t move with him I can’t stay in the house I’m living now in for much longer. I’ve been talking to a recruiter for the Air Force and that is the route I would most likely take.

To compare that, last year, and the entirety of this year up until recently, he had only fallen once. For the past week I've been doing the things my grandfather usually did. Cooking, taking my brother to school, shopping, and some other things. I don't know what to do. The only reason I've been able to keep up so far is my uncle and brother. My uncle showed me how to wash dishes, and my brother has been helping my grandfather while I was busy. Soon I'll have to do laundry, and I have no clue how.

They haven’t claimed whose it was, but that SHOULDN’T matter right? So the next morning I’m trying to do dishes and  run the garbage disposal and hear grinding. Oh no. Glass is everywhere and I turned it off as soon as I realized what happened. So i to go through picking out the glass and wait to see what we should do.

Fast forward to today where we are just now getting the bill long after I’m gone. It’s not cheap and one of my friends asks for me to split it. No problem there either. Then she says people won’t be happy splitting it evenly.... meaning I’m guessing most of the burden will fall on me because it’s “my fault”. I don’t see this as fair because by that logic, whoever left their shot glass in the sink should equally be at fault.

715,"So to start off I guess I'll just set some things up. I just turned 18 on September 12, I'm in my first year of community college after a disastrous and traumatic high school experience. The challenges I faced were high in number and extreme in difficulty. However, I just squeaked by and now I'm studying while living at home.

I think to make this a bit easier to read and easier for me to write I'll split this into three main parts.

***1. The Past Events***

So, up until around 8th grade, school was incredibly easy for me. Then I turned 13 and depression hit. Middle school was horrific and I think I've repressed most of my memories of it. I was also a rather horrible person, and since I turned 16 I've worked hard to be more self-aware and not bring harm to others.

However, through all of 8th grade and all of high school, I suffered from extreme depression, self-mutilation, ADHD, and insomnia. More recently, chronic nightmares and moderate anxiety have been added to that list. Around late March 2019, I tried to kill myself and nearly succeeded.

Beginning in late 2018, I discovered something that I didn't know I could do. I fell in true love for the first time. Won't go into too many details, but the experience left me broken and now there are many things that cause me heavy anxiety and emotional pain. I'm sure I'll never forget that girl. She's one of a kind.
Also. You know how you hear about girls who sleep around to feel wanted? I used to not understand that at all, but after the experience with that girl, I was a man-whore for a bit and kinda still am and it just leaves me feeling horrible and empty. To people who feel horrible or alone or lonely, sleeping around is NOT the answer.

I graduated High School in June 2019 with a very low 2.3 GPA. I am not a stupid person, I really, really think I'm intelligent, I've just got problems. Ranging from personal flaws like arrogance, short-sightedness, stubbornness, etc. or stupid things that I can't control like insomnia or nightmares. It's hard man. However, still graduated and made it into a local community college with computer science as a placeholder for my major.

***2. The Present, and how past events affect me today.***

Starting off with personal stuff I guess.

I currently still suffer from depression, anxiety, ADHD, insomnia, and chronic nightmares.

Love is still a hard and touchy subject for me and I don't know if I'll ever get over that girl, but I'm still here so I guess that's something.

Difficult, very difficult, but manageable.

As for academics and stuff.

The date is September 18, 2019. I am currently taking courses in English, Communications, American Sign Language, and Statistics.

My family is well-off, but not especially wealthy. I would suppose that we are pretty middle class but in recent days my parents are working harder than ever for luxuries like their Audi cars. So, I guess we're slowly going to high-middle class. 

However, we don't have all that much money to just be spending around so a serious university that costs a whooooole lot of money would be a problem. My sister just graduated from a CSU School here in California which are supposed to be relatively cost effective and she is drowning in around $30,000 of student loans after her 5 years studying there.

As for what my major or career is going to be in? Well I have always loved technology and computers. I took two computer science courses in high school but it was just so hard for me to concentrate and I ended up having to retake one of them. 

My current thoughts for majors are: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or a strange outlier for me, which would be Forensic Science.

No idea how to progress from here. Right now I feel like I'm just in school because it's ""the thing to do."" I enjoy my classes and I enjoy being a student now that I'm free from the toxicity of high school and I'm a more mature and developed person. But I don't have a lot of time here in community college so I gotta make a decision soon.

I truly do want to learn and I really love learning about the things that I'm interested in, but being a student is *expensive*.

***3. The Future***

So, after this semester I'm not entirely sure what I'll be doing. I need to think about what universities I could transfer to and if it's even remotely affordable or what I'm doing with my possible career options.

My parents just bought a house, I'll have a place to live if shit goes bad even if right now we're really tight on money at the moment cus stuff is expensive. 

I've never had a job so applying for and getting a job will likely prove difficult. Especially if by the time I get a bachelor's degree I still haven't worked a job. 

This is really just a big ramble and I'm sorry if it seems *really* self-centered. A big part of this post was just to get some thoughts and stress out and see what other people think. 

Please share your thoughts. Thank you.",18Sep2019,3

717,"I recently got the new Samsung Galaxy S10 plus back in July. While I am enjoying the phone a lot I am noticing that I have some battery problems with it.

The first problem is how quickly I drop from 100% to 99%. Right now it takes me 4 minutes to drop from 100 to 99. Before it would take 10 minutes or so before it would drop.

The second problem has been charging. My phone has been charging very slowly. It would take a few minutes to charge up to the next number. And recently it has charged down when I would start using it. For example it would go from 68 to 67 even plugged in. Sometimes it would be stuck on a charging percentage.

These are the main problems I have had. So far I tried restarting the phone and powering it down. I even got a new wall plug since my old one does not work. The only thing I have not done was get a new charging cable.

There are no names, emails, or otherwise. Nothing is specified.

I'm 18, and I live in Virginia.
Almost all my life, my dad's been very verbally abusive (amongst other things) and sometimes goes into insanity. He's bipolar, easily. He constantly makes random noise, even when he's happy and whatnot.
Just, y'know, random noise. Annoyance ensues very quickly. Dunno how I put up with it for 18 years.

I'd just like to clarify that this can be technically seen as ""running away"" but it's also seen as ""moving out"" since I'm an adult and it's my personal decision.

Anyways, uh...He's gotten worse and worse throughout the years.

I don't think I can live with him much longer, so I've had my friend book a flight for me to come over and live with him over in Washington.

*I am going alone, this is my first time flying alone.*
But I'll find out where my gate is and stuff.
This is my first time flying alone. As an 18 year old.

*The flight is going to be Saturday, September 21st.*

The flight's trip will be as follows:

Depart from DCA (Reagan National Airport, Virginia) at 6:00 PM EST.

Land at DEN (Denver), wait for 2 hours for my layover.

Get on plane from DEN and head to SEA (Seattle, Washington).

Before anyone asks, I've known my friend for years. Met him some times before he moved away.
Hell, I shouldn't even say friend, it's my boyfriend.
I'm gay, and I certainly know my dad wouldn't like it if I came out, which is why I haven't.
Anyways, uh...I'll be heading to the airport (DCA) on Saturday morning, before my dad even gets up.

And, I am using Frontier Airlines.
And yes, I know, if the flight gets delayed or cancelled, I'll have to take an Uber back home. My boyfriend'll order me one. He's already paid for my ticket over and all that. He's going to call me an Uber Saturday morning so I can get to the airport, since it was too expensive for him to come and get me, then go back to Washington together.

When I get to Washington (if I even do. Might be delay or cancellation, who knows? Highly doubt it though. Weather is good in Virginia, Denver, and Seattle this weekend.) I'm going to tell my dad and close family in a groupchat together about why I'm leaving and where I'm going.
That way they can't file a missing persons report. I mean, they can, but it won't be truthful. They'll know I'm safe and all that.

I don't care about how pissed my dad will be, I just want out of here. Is there any advice someone can provide? Nobody really knows of this Reddit account, so I wouldn't need a throwaway. 
I'm leaving out some tinier details.

All I'm bringing with me to the flight is just my backpack, and it'll have my laptop in it, some desktop PC parts, some clothes (we'll get more in Washington), and some papers.

I have my DMV permit as a form of ID.
I don't know what else to add, but this is a serious issue, and I want/need to get out of here.
It's not good for my mental health. I don't know if this is even the right sub to post this to.
If someone wants to open my chat or send me a message in private, you're welcome to.

I have a bank account that my dad helped me open.
But he doesn't know my PIN or anything, at least I assume so. I'm going to change my passwords and all that.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask, I'll answer anything regarding more detail or otherwise.

727,"Long story short a girl (F18) and I (M19) hace admitted our feelings between each other, she broke up with her long distance boyfriend, and most recently she has told her parents about the whole thing. Life’s good. 

But I’m so stressed and conflicted. Here is the source of most of the problems: I’m agnostic and she is very Christian, and so are her parents. She says it’s not a barrier to date me, but only because I respect Christianity and I share its values. Her parents are extremely worried I will convert her whether I’m trying to or not. She believes this is all happening for a reason and she wants to try to convert me and I tell her I am open minded but I can’t choose what I believe and don’t. She’s okay with that, I’m just worried anyways because I honestly don’t think I’d ever convert and that means I can’t make her happy in that regard. 

More than that... there are things like sexual abstention that worries me. She wants to abstain, which makes sense because her beliefs, but because i don’t share that belief I am afraid it will be difficult for me. It feels like a selfish problem, so I’m afraid to bring it up. Believe me that sex is not my primary motivation for pursuing this relationship, I think I genuinely love her, but I worry how I will feel in the future. I don’t want to guilt her in compromising her beliefs...

On top of all this, her parents are understandably skeptical and I feel like I have to prove myself as worthy to them. I worry if I am worthy in their eyes.

I feel like I’m about to explode from the mixes of feelings. A huge part of me just wants to ignore all the problems and do whatever it takes because I love her, but a different part is telling me it’s a mistake, or it will end badly. I feel like she might be going through more serious, less selfish problems then I am so again I am hesitant to bring it up though she understands I am concerned. We both are.

730,"I really need to get this off my chest as I feel super stressed about it.

I (14F) have this friend (let’s call her M) who is physical, e.g. leaning her head on my shoulder, wanting hugs etc. I don’t mind this, we have been friends for about 6 years. However, she started doing it quite recently (since the start of our school year) so me and another friend (we’ll call her E) were a little suspicious. Long story short, we found out she kinda liked me. I don’t think she knows that I know this. Again, we’ve been friends for so long so I wasn’t going to ditch her or anything, although I didn’t like her back that way.

Today I had a detention (I don’t usually get them, but I had homework issues), and so I was going to walk with the other people in my class who also got detentions. My friends M and E were going to leave but M kept asking me for a hug. I really just wanted to get the detention over with so I refused. But then I saw two girls (who had detentions too) glancing at us. Now, these girls usually get into trouble, and they aren’t the nicest either.

My friends left the room, and under her breath one of them said, “Are they together?” This honestly made me feel uncomfortable, and I had an urge to tell them no. However, they did ask if me and M were a couple. Of course, I said no, but that she was just “really clingy”. They snickered a little, and I thought that would be the end of it.

They then asked me, “Does she like you?”

In the moment, I told them the truth, and they snickered to each other again.

I’m not sure what they’re going to do with this information, or if they’ll make fun of M. My class is pretty accepting of LGBT, but from the way they laughed it seemed that they didn’t. I didn’t want to tell them a lie, in case they decided to ask M herself about it, or try and investigate into it. I haven’t told M or E about this yet.

Should I keep it to myself, tell one of them, or both? Should I have even done that? Is there any way to fix this situation fast before it gets out of hand/hurts somebody? I’m just scared if something bad happens sometime soon.",18Sep2019,1
731,I’m currently in high school right now and want to make my body better. At the moment I’m not overweight or unfit but just kind of on the heavier side. I’ve read countless articles on how to be in shape and such but despite doing what they all say (for over 1/2 a yr) my weight and shape is unchanged. I bike for at least an hour everyday and I’m on the hs swim team. I also strictly eat vegetables and healthy meats and don’t even touch fast food or desserts at all. Yet somehow my body shape hasn’t changed at all and it’s kind of making me depressed. I see kids at school eating all the junk in the world with great bodies and I’m over here looking like a fucking peanut. Please help,18Sep2019,1

733,"(Warning, not a native english speaker)

When I finished high school I started working in a cleaning/moving company so it has been about 6 years working for same company. There is no development for me here, I have been seeing same people every day and seen same things every day. I am starting to freaking lose my mind. To make things worse I live in a small city where there's nothing interesting happening, only the gym.

The only good thing going on for me is that I am good at saving money. I have saved pretty good amount but I am afraid if I go and throw myself into the big water, like moving out and pursuing something I will be eventually losing all my hard earned money if something fails.

My biggest problem is I have absolutely no clear goal what I want to do. I never had, I just don't want to waste my life anymore.

I feel so fucking trapped even though I could probably move to anywhere I wanted in Europe (I am from Norway). But I don't know if I want to. I don't know where to move. I know most people here are from USA so I am wondering if anybody could tell me if maybe moving to your country would be a nice choice? I am literally open to anything, I have nothing that holds me back, I can quit my job anytime I want and I only rent a cheap apartment with chill hosts.

I have absolutely no one who can point me in the right direction. No one I can talk to and share my feelings and issues. If I am going to continue living like this I might as well shot myself in the head. There is no fucking purpose in that kind of life. Beside work I work out at the gym and that's pretty much it. That has been my life these past 6 years. Fucking sad, right? lol

I know everyone is responsible for their own lives but God dammit, it would be so nice if someone grabbed me and wrote on paper what to do next. I know I would follow that plan, but figuring it out on your own is fucking impossible. At least to me.

If you read it all thank you very much.",18Sep2019,2
734,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. This July I was, I believe, sexually assaulted by one of my best friends. It has taken me two months to really comprehend all of this and I think I'm finally ready to report him.

To give some information on the situation. We were at a gathering of close friends. There was alcohol and we both drank. 

Before the assault he had made comments about my body and appearance. Telling me my body was disproportionate (he meant the fact that I am shaped like a 'sex doll'), that I dress like a whore and, because he looked up my skirt, that he preferred black underwear over white. He also grabbed my ass several times and tried to touch my breasts. I made it clear I did not want him to touch me there.

At night he pushed me on his lap and wrapped his arms around me, I was tired and intoxicated so I didn't fight back much. He kissed my neck and ear while I was sitting on it. He also loudly announced that I was ""grinding on his dick"" which I was not. I felt really uncomfortable with that comment and my friends confirmed I was not. 

When I went to the tent to go to bed he followed me. We talked for a bit about a friend of mine and he kept asking if I wanted to cuddle and I told him no. Then he encouraged me to take off my bra which I didn't want to. He got upset because of the conversation so I comforted him by holding his hand, but it was obvious I wasn't interested. 

Now onto the assault. I was lying in bed with him next to me. He had moved his mattress next to mine, forcing a friend to lay somewhere she didn't want. He hugged me for warmth because I was shaking and I didn't think much of it. I fell asleep and I thought that was the end. But then I was awaken by him stroking my back, slowly going lower to my butt. He caressed it and squeezed it. I was shocked and not moving. He had no clue I had awoken and I couldn't react. He went on to touch my breasts under and over clothes, kiss me, get on top of me to kiss my neck, touch me over my underwear and stopped himself when he slipped into my underwear. He also moved my hands close to his crotch, but just left it there. He did not rape me and I'm really confused as to what to call this.

Every definition I read tells me sexual assault uses threats or physical force, but mine did not.

I don't know whether what he did was a crime, whether he can be reprimanded and what I can do. I keep telling myself he could have raped me, I got of lucky and am overreacting. But if I'm still having panic attacks when I remember how his fingers touched my skin, am I really just being dramatic?",18Sep2019,33
735,"My boyfriend and i have been together for 4 months but dated since February but we only hang out once a week, sometimes if I’m lucky 2 times.
He’s not very romantic and When we do hangout it’s Almost always at his house, in his room in his bed or with one of his friends and don’t get me wrong I do enjoy hanging out with them but I feel like we need more alone time.
I don’t want to come of as annoying so I haven’t mentioned it lately and it is a little harder for us cause he’s a dealer and i’m in high school and I work.
I feel like the couples I know spend so much time together and i don’t like to campare him to others but i’m really jealous of those who spend so much time together and i feel like I would make time for him but when it comes to the other way around idk.

For background I grew up in a very abusive household and have always had toxic relationships with boyfriends. Basically my life has been one big slow cooker of trust issues.

I'm going to a really good school, and I've met some really good people. The only thing is that I have no idea on how to be *friends*, or have an actual functioning relationship. I'm used to constant fighting, abuse, narcissism, back stabbing. I always had to defend myself and just take punches. The niceness of people is throwing me off completely.

745,"I worked my ass off, granted, I slacked off here and there and I wasn't the best coordinator, for this in-school Charity program at my high school.

I'm 2 years out now, but you don't fucking reuse designs from two years ago, do you?

I noticed on Facebook today, they had reused a poster design I had made, just photoshopping on top of it with some comic sans like font with updated information (as the event poster is something that happens annually).

I am beyond annoyed and pissed.

That's just pure laziness, and it also feels like an insult to how hard I worked on that poster.

If I'm honest, the charity organizer within my old high school, never really liked me, so I fear if I contacted her, she would dismiss my claims.

What should I do...? I don't really want them screwing over some of my best designs I made while in that program, and should I mention, I had worked for free!

I can post the pictures if it helps...though I'm on mobile and I'm not sure how to add photos via my phone.

So I received good news that I have two in person out of state interviews (I am a college senior) at big companies! The bad news is.. they are the same days.

Now my family has usually ended up in a bad place due to drugs, and I don’t want the same thing to happen to them to happen to the one person i care about most in the world.

I don’t want her to get involved with anything more dangerous, but I’m really not the kind of boyfriend to control the choices she makes, it’s her own life, her own decisions. We live in a fairly safe area but one with fairly high drug activity, would she be safe to smoke weed and not get involved with anything more? Am I just overreacting?

761,"My boyfriend (24 year old M) and I (24 year old F) have been dating for over a year.

We love eachother very much but there is one thing that makes me a little sad from time to time: lately, we have had opposite work schedules (I work 9 to 5 monday to friday, boyfriend works nights and weekends) so we don't get to see eachother much. We find time to hang out once every 2 to 4 weeks on average. I'm not sure if this is normal or not, but we both truly are very busy people and it is hard to make our schedules work. On top of that, he still lives with his parents. They don't allow me to sleep over, or him to sleep over at my place. He doesn't fight them on it because he knows it will probably cause an argument.

The good news is, he is making an effort to move out on his own. But he applied for a job (that is highly likely that he will get) about 3 hours away, in the town of the college we used to attend. We have been through times of distance before, and I'm not worried about it working out, I know that we can do it. But between us not being able to see one another lately, and that, I'm just feeling a little down because i miss him. He suggested that when I'm able to, I could move where his new job is too- he knows i actually love the area that this job he is looking at is in, and have thought about moving there before myself, but as of right now I haven't seen too many job postings in my field there. When i bring it up to my boyfriend that I miss him a lot, or that it makes me feel a little sad that we hardly see one another, he seems unphased by it, and it's almost as though he thinks I'm worrying about nothing, and maybe I am? I don't know. He had a relationship a couple years before ours in which it was super long distance and they legitimately only saw one another every few months. I wouldn't say that's ideal, but it seems as though my bf is accustomed to not seeing his S.O. a lot, to the point where it doesnt phase him.

Any advice on this situation would be great. Just trying to figure out what to do to make this feel a bit less difficult. I love him so much and don't want it to strain our relationship by me missing him too much.

Always brushed them off because he was married and I always was involved with someone. I was never attracted to him, btw. But I knew he had a crush on me years ago. 

So about 2 months ago he tells me his wife has cancer, is going to die. Being empathetic we start talking more, he’s venting to me, I’m offering a shoulder to him. I’ve never flirted back with him, always was brushing it off trying to not hurt his feelings. 

So, then she dies. He requested I attend the funeral. I go, he comes out of the receiving line to embrace me with a long hug, too long. I haven’t seen him in person for about 15 years. He held me there and it was awkward. 

So that night - of the funeral- he texts me saying he wants to take me out to show me a good time. How I looked amazing and he was so happy to see me. 

He keeps pushing to see me, won’t take the hint. I’m taking days to respond and keeping the convo dry but he keeps coming back. 

I have a boyfriend and even if I was single I wouldn’t be interested in anything but friendship but honestly now- I’m creeped out and don’t need him as a friend- but don’t want to abandon an old friend that’s in need of a shoulder.

Besides I'm female and they are males). So from the time I was a newborn baby to the time I became 12 years old. I had seen them. But when I was 13 years old, I got seriously ill so my paternal grandmother had to lose almost all the money she had saved to financially help my parents, to help them pay medical bill. I was crying and screaming like crazy all the time and my father even lost consciousness and collapsed in the street due to stress. The whole situation was chaos. and a year later my stepgrandfather died and my grandmother decided to give each of her two sons same amount of property but my uncle's wife who was crazy at her religion and had been complaining about my grandmother giving financial help only to my parents, not her husband ( but that was because our situation was always so much  harder than theirs because of my incompetent father who's lack of responsibilities) manipulated my uncle and took my father's property. So my furious mother asked for help from my maternal aunt who is a lawyer to take the property back but my father never agreed on doing a law battle with his own brother though our situation was really bad and we desperately needed that money.  Eventually my mom and dad got divorced and time has passed. I'm now 19 years old. Lots of things happened to me. My uncle, my father and my half aunt  are not seeing each other almost for 7 years. My uncle is not even seeing his mother, who is my grandmother. And I don't see my father often after divorce but stay in touch.
And lately, I just miss my cousin.. and 4 days ago I accidentally found L's Snapchat account. I want to send messages but I can't... what if he doesn't give a damn what if he blocks me what if he misreads the situation and blane everything on me? my cousin brothers were decent from what I remember  but they think their mother is a nice person and they probably don't know what their mother has done.  Guys... should I just do nothing on this? or should I just day hello to him? is it normal to miss cousins this much?",18Sep2019,1

772,"I'm currently in undergrad and I'm about to graduate soon. I'm not sure if I should graduate this Fall or in the upcoming Spring. I'm majoring in Math/Staististics and minoring in Biology; I want to follow the Biostatistics path. I'm pretty good with the Math/Stat part but I'm concerned with the Biology. 

I basically failed Cell Biology last school last semester and the course is only offered in the Spring semester. The material was difficult for me due to not only the vast memorization but the type of details that we had to know. In addition, I was told by my degree counselor that I would also have to complete another Biology class this spring in order to obtain my minor. 

If I graduate this Fall, I will spend less money for college overall and I will get a head start to shorten my student debt and prepare for graduate school. If I spend another semester, there's a chance that I could rectify my Cell Biology grade and obtain the Biology minor. The main downside to staying longer is spending more money on undergrad and accumulating more debt. I'm not sure what what to do. If you have any advice, please feel free to share.",18Sep2019,1
774,"There is a bit of a story here, but it's important towards understanding everything about the situation.

I've known this girl (let's call her Alex) for nearly two years, and we met each other in college. When I first met her, I had every intent of asking her out then, but we ended up just becoming really close friends. I used to skip classes just so we could get coffee together. She's the first girl, the first person, that's made me feel alive. She's beautiful, fun to be around, and easy to get along with. I really do love her.

Here's where things start to get weird. One day, she'll rest her head on my lap. The next, she'll stay on the far side of the couch. She complains about guys who just wanna hook up with her, then calls them cute seconds later. She calls me attractive one second, then calls me bro the next. Hell, she's even changed in front of me before and left a box of condoms in my car. I flirt with her occasionally, she compliments me back, but there's so many conflicting details. 

I've had feelings for her for so long now, but I've kept them stuffed down for a few reasons. Firstly, I value our friendship so much that I'm scared me opening up to her will drive her away. I'd love to be her boyfriend, but if telling her how I feel would scare her away, I'll keep quiet. Second, she always says she wants a baby daddy who isn't white. Spoiler alert... I'm about as white as white could get. However, she has been seeing a guy on and off recently who's somehow whiter than me, so maybe that's not as big of a deal as it seems. Third, this girl is so hard to read sometimes that I don't know for sure if she's into me or not. 

So, what should I do? Do I confess my feelings for her and risk losing her?",18Sep2019,1

I assist a PhD candidate, started about a month ago. I noticed we‘re getting kinda close, like we talk a lot about politics (which is pretty much our field of research too), I know a lot about her opinions and she knows about mine, she knows what party I am in, I know about her life situation, how she grew up, her morals, her interests, her hobbies, her uncle‘s unemployment, her past relationships and as she likes to listen to podcasts I also know her take on certain relationship problems.. While I like it as it is fun and enjoyable I can also feel I am kinda developing a crush on her. She has very playful body language (like winking etc). She’s extremely friendly and it feels as if I am working for a friend. I find myself thinking about what it’d be like to be in a relationship with her which I know I shouldn’t. She once said that issues at work are kinda similar to issues in marriage etc as you don’t become a different person at work and it got me thinking that working with her is a 10/10 and constructive and positive experience so what would dating her be like?",18Sep2019,1

He was drunk because he is a lazy piece of shit alcoholic loser and he got mad about what I said. So I left. Since this shit went down things haven't been the same between my friend and I.

783,"Some details: 

here where I live in Europe it’s quite common for kids to stay in their parents house all the way trough college and only leave once they find a stable job.

My mom is a very insecure, manipulative and obsessed person. I told her I am moving out in a year to go to college in another country and since then it’s been hell. Everyday she will start arguments with me, telling me I will never have a future if I leave the (bum) ass country I was born in. That moving out is a waste of money (money that I am making in my full time job to be able to emigrate next year). She constantly puts me down (either about me wanting to move out, my weight, my love life, pretty much any thing)

She is obsessed with me and doesn’t want me to move out, she will call me everytime she’ll get the chance (even tho we literally live together) she tries to control who I talk to and constantly talks shit about my friends and say they are shitty people and I need to stay away from them.

Sometimes I even caught her trying to go trough my phone while I’m sleeping at like 4am.

So far I've gotten one official offer to start on Monday and another that I'm waiting to hear back from. The last company did also give me an offer but it's contingent on passing the background check which I was told was completed yesterday by the third party background check company.

793,"Really at a breaking point here and don’t know what to do. I’m a 27F who feels like I missed the boat, that life is passing me by and that I’ve totally failed. Lost a lot of years to depression, anxiety, and financial problems. I was finally able to go back to school and finished a fairly useless degree last year. 

I have a stable job but still live with my family to save up and plan my next steps. This still brings me a deep feeling of shame despite feeling grateful to have them, as they feel like the only real company I have. Some days I wake up feeling truly pathetic. I’m struggling to find a career path that feels right, and have been enjoying the time out of school to just focus on my own interests but I feel the need to start thinking about what to do next. 

I have a small number of friends, and a boyfriend (more on him later, if you care to keep reading) but for as long as I can remember, I have struggled to converse with people, even about things that I like, and it feels like a huge limitation in my life, and the underlying cause of most of my problems. 

I was always shy, and although I overcame much of that anxiety (I have no problem approaching a cashier, doing what I need to do at work...anything where I get straight to the point or follow a “script” i can manage)  i continue to be plagued by a sense of emptiness, particularly in social situations. 

I have no idea what to talk about. My mind feels totally blank. Even with friends, even about topics I’m interested in, I initiate very little. I can answer questions, but conversations run dry pretty quickly with me. 

On top of all of this, for the past four years I’ve been enmeshed in a relationship with a slightly older man, who felt like the answer to all my
problems. He made me feel like I was safe and like I was finally an adult, that I was loved and that we could build a life together. That I could trust him. Despite this, I felt this impulse to break up with him and I did really abruptly, then got back together with him but was wracked with guilt for hurting him. 

I knew there were a lot of issues I needed to work on, but I hoped I could work on them while with him. It became clear though that my need to socialize, or try to, was going to make him feel insecure. He didn’t understand that I wanted to see friends (who I meet with one at a time) by myself, without worrying about making him feel included on top of my existing inhibitions. He’s prone to jealous outbursts, brings up whatever he knows about my previous relationships, finds reason to be indirectly mad whenever I do spend time with friends and has been disrespectful to me. I’ve included him into my family from the beginning, but he quickly ruined relations with them and now has not been invited to family events. 

Overall though I know that he loves me and that he’s a loyal partner, and that felt so important to me when I’m suffering so much internally and feel isolated from the rest of the world. 

We keep getting into arguments about me spending time away from him though, and I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong. After a vicious fight a few months ago, I’ve been making a serious effort to get out more - going to events, even by myself, just to work up some nerve. But I didn’t see him when he wanted me to, and now he’s demanding answers about where we stand and telling me I don’t take the relationship seriously. 

Part of me wants to leave, but I’m attached to him so strongly and my problems feel so overwhelming that I’m afraid it will be the worst mistake of my life. For the first time in a long time, suicidal thoughts have returned. What should I do?",18Sep2019,1
794,"Earlier today, I was walking through the kitchen, and I saw the head of a dark snake extending out one of the burners on top of my oven!

She got a paper for a teacher to sign to say she wasn’t absent and the teacher refused saying she was disrespectful when she left and when my friend tried talking to the office they said she had the right to refuse to remark her as present. I just wanted to know how can this be solved because this seems totally unfair and her dad wouldn’t talk to the teacher directly.

I enjoyed my hands-on fieldwork at two writing camps this summer but I understand that's very different from the actual classroom. I've visited classes since and have counted down the minutes.

803,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I hope someone can give me advice. Major trigger warnings: sexual abuse, suicide, self-harm.

When I was 10 I met someone on Habbo and ended up adding them on MSN. I think I've blocked out or repressed most of my memories from how it all started but basically I would strip on camera, take sexual photos, ""cyber"". The person never showed me more than one picture and I eventually (after a few months) guessed that they probably weren't who they said they were. At this point, I broke it off, deleted my MSN account and became extremely paranoid and depressed.

I didn't want to leave my house because they might be someone I know or someone that would see me on the street somewhere. It was the summer before I started secondary school and I was terrified it might have been someone who would be there. I was scared that they'd taken screenshots or videos of me and would share it online or with people I know. I told my mum about it and cried to her and she told me I would forget about it in a couple of years (probably the wrong advice on her part). Obviously I never forgot about it. 

To cut things in my life VERY short I was depressed and anxious from then until about a year ago. I've been on antidepressants for four years but in that time I was self-harming and tried to kill myself. I'm very fortunate it didn't work and I'm actually at a point in my life where I'm happy most of the time. I wouldn't say I'm depressed anymore. But this thing is always there in the back of my mind. I had a therapist for a while after the suicide attempt but it never really lasted long enough to get into this really dark shit. A couple of my friends know about it but I could never expect them to know what to say to something like this. 

Only about a year ago did I realise it was sexual abuse or sexual exploitation. Every now and then I google the definition because I'm not sure or I need reassurance that that's what happened - and that actually led to this post. 

I know it's not my fault, that I was a literal child, and someone took advantage of me. But I think it's something I still need to talk about. How do you bring that up again to your mum? I know she still worries because she still checks in on me every day, despite the fact that I live 200 miles away.

I guess I just want to know if anyone's experienced anything similar and has any advice about how to bring it up to my mum. I've never spoken to anyone who's been through anything like this.

&gt;downloaded a bunch of packages with twitch emotes
&gt;get Pepe because it’s funny and love the meme
Two months later get called into a meeting, starts off standard one to one, then goes into “do you know what Pepe is”

Long story short, someone reported it and said I was promoting white supremacy and alt right (live in England, not sure what that even was till I looked it up) 
Literally shell shocked, don’t know how to react. Here I am a heterosexual white male, pretty dangerous when I’m being called out for things I have no actual intention of being. Raised in a open family with lgbt family members in rural London I’ve never been called racist or promoting anti lgbt ways

&gt;fucking Pepe 

Interview continues, just sat there and shocked about it all. Start to cry because think I’m going to be fired for a fucking Pepe emoji.

Interview concludes and they say they don’t think I did it intentionally but because someone reported it they have to take it seriously.

810,"So I live in a gated condo community and sometimes I like to take my dogs (German shepherd &amp; border collie) back behind the building and let them off the leash to run into the woods and play around. Typically twice a day. Morning and evening. 

I also have this annoying neighbor who is a complete puss about our first interaction, as neighbors. 

He lives on the other side of the building, and right when I moved in, I found that he likes to do the same. Let his rat looking chihuahua off the leash to run around in the back. Cool. Their dogs. No access to a street or parking lot or general public. Same reason I do it too. 

Well one day, his dog was out in the back and my dogs were coming out of the unit. What do dogs do when they see each other? They run up and smell each other and do their thing? I've seen my dogs do this a million times at the dog park. 

However, his dog decided to snap and get nasty and scream. Like most little dogs do when they meet a large dog, it's always a life or death scene. He was very upset with me, even though my dog was just standing back and watching his dog throw a fit...my german shep was about as confused as me during the situation. 

So he grabs his dog and storms off. This is the last I see of him for 3 months. This was around the first or second week I had moved to this condo. 

Fast forward to today. I'm out in the back letting my dog run around in the woods again &amp; He sends his roommate out to tell me that ""some people"" are scared to take their dogs out back because of my dogs. 

I ask: ""some people"", as in your roommate with the little dog? 

He said yes, then admitted his roommate was the one with the chihuahua. He tries to claim that my dog bit his dog in that encounter. Which is completely untrue. I was respectful and understood his side of the story when he explained it and I offered to put my dogs electric collar on from now on, just to stop any running and unwanted attention. 

Now at this point we're wrapping up, shaking hands and parting ways. My dogs notice I'm talking to someone. And what do they do? Run up and try to say hi, come by their owner, etc. The roommate freezes up like hes about to be crucified and goes ""Oh no oh no oh no!"" And I'm trying to reassure him that my dog is harmless and has a clean record. Met dozens of people and dogs. Etc. Never had a single issue. 

He finally calms down. I tell him to just pet him and see. He slowly reaches out, and what does my german shep do? Lick his hand and rub his head on his pants. 

We eventually depart and after a little more small talk, are back in our respective apartments. 


So, my question is, should I give a damn what this dude says? Because this seems to be a bit prissy, over exaggerated, and why should I care what you think if you're doing the same thing as me?

Yes we should have our dogs on a leash. But literally dont throw stones in a glass house. 

Am I being too rough? I'm still going to use the collar but it just came off as very....annoying....🙄",18Sep2019,0

They said it’s so common everyone gets it at some point pretty much. She said this didn’t sit right with her and was still anxious so talked to her doctor about what she should say.  The doctor said if she does disclose she should say she had abnormal Pap smears. Anyways before we had unprotected sex this is what she told me, she just said she had abnormal Pap smears, that most sexually active people have it and it goes away on its own. I was never under the impression this was an STD though and I feel like she tricked me since she didn’t specifically mention HPV.

818,"Hello,

I'm a 17 year old male student who just started his second(and final year) of pre-medical studies, I don't want to be a doctor AT ALL, but my parents are forcing my hands, i already tried talking to them multiple times, but their response is always the same. They also made it very clear that they will not support me financially if i do something other than medecine. And honestly i don't want their help. I plan of starting a Bachelor of commerce at another university next year, I calculated how much money i would need for my first year: 16 000$ CAD. I'll be 18 in 2 months and i'll be able to leave the house without my parents consent. 

The only problem is really collecting the money for the first year and i'll start taking loans for the second year.

Since i'll technically be applying as a transfer student, i'm not eligible for any scholarships at the university itself, I will try to talk to the representatives of the university and explain my situation to them, but for now i need to find other ways of making that 16 000$

My parents are extremely controlive and won't let me get a job during the school year, my summer job can maybe get me around 5000$, i have 2000$ saved up since i starting working at 16. My last resort would be taking a loan for the first year

What i'm asking really is does anyone have any experience with finding and winning external scholarships? any help would be greatly appreciated!

Also if anyone has any idea if theres any other way to make money as a student please let me know!",18Sep2019,1

I know she doesn't mean this and she still loves me, it's just that she loses control everytime she gets stressed or sad. So a week ago I told her that I can't live like this any longer and that her behaviour is unacceptable. I told her that she should seek professional help(which she refuses to do). I told her that she's making my life but also my father's and brothers life a living hell. This escalated into a big fight and today she tried to  kill herself by taking in all the medicines she could find. I don't know what to do anymore.

822,Hi! I am a 20 year old female. 7 months ago I started a job in a self owned hair salon business working as a front desk receptionist. Before I had worked at a restaurant serving so this was a different change of pace. When I began the job it wasn’t that bad. It was quiet boring but it was an easy job with decent pay and hours. Half way through the job I requested less hours I was part time working 25plus hours a week. I requested no more then 20 hours a week due to personal reasons. For 2 months it was going great. Then all of the sudden my hours got cut to 6-10 hours a week without any notice. After that I had started thinking about quitting because it was just very inconsiderate. They did it to another girl I worked with as well. I was recently going to discuss this with my manager but she is hard to catch since she just had a newborn baby and her hours are weird. Today she stopped by and I was upfront where I was supposed to be. I was filing one of my nails which probably wasn’t very professional and I apologized. Then she comes back to me and says we need to talk. She verbally assaulted me saying that I need to keep up with my appearance or there is no job here. I struggle with self image and depression. Some days I barely have the energy to wash my hair. Today I will admit I didn’t brush my hair but I didn’t say that to her. As of recently I did tell her I was getting kicked out of my home of 20 years and had 1 month to pack up my whole life and move. Which to me was very life changing because that was my home. I told her and she had no sympathy and never checked up on me. I know I’m not supposed to be buddy buddy with my boss but what she said almost made me cry but I held it together because I am at work. I have been thinking of putting in my 2 weeks notice but honestly I don’t want to come back here. I love some of my coworkers and the benefits of the job. But I just cannot stand my boss and some of these people they are very belittling and toxic. I’m just stuck and need advice before I make my decision.,18Sep2019,2

826,"I'm a student in Health and Social Care. This means I'm learning all about how to care for those with physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and of course, mental illnesses.

Now then, I've been struggling on and off for the last year or so with undiagnosed mental issues.

I've starved myself for a brief period of time, I've had what I can only describe as random and sparadic mental breakdowns (I. E. Crying while driving, thinking about suicide, and self harming). The self harming bit, though fairly uncommon I act upon it, still occurs in my life right now. I've had urges to cut, I've had senses of satisfaction with anything that may resemble a cut (for example, the other day I wore tights and noticed they had lines in them that vaguely resembled cuts/scars on my legs which gave me a feeling of calm that I find disturbing when Im in my right mind and think about it.

Anyway, like I said, I'm in health and social care, and one of the aspects is mental health, something I'm wanting to go into as a career. Whether it be as a counsellor in a school or college or as a full on therapist. But something I've been asked a few times by my teachers when they hear my career goals is why exactly I'm wanting to go into the mental health side of things. To which I always just reply with ""it's just interesting to me"" and move on.

Honestly, I want to talk to someone. My parents aren't understanding at all when it comes to my obviously messed up emotions and coping mechanisms. But I know that if I say something to the teachers they might take it too far and do something I never wanted them to do without informing me beforehand. Not only that but I just want to make it clear that, although I do think of myself as suffering with mental health issues, it's not something that controls my life and that I'm not a danger to myself.

831,"I moved careers twice so far and jumped companies so much and took major major risks. I've managed to accumulate tons of experience because of that too, both professional and personal/life since I got mixed with so many people and traveled a lot. I'm now almost 32 and I'm very happy with that, BUT!!! the last leap of faith I took made me miserable and broke.

This last leap was moving to a different country with my gf, take on a master degree in AI and work part-time to pay for it. It was way harder than planned. I ended up making a lot less than I need, didn't afford public transport sometimes or food, washed dishes, cleaned floors, got yelled at, did heavy lifting... all while having several years of experience in engineering and having worked for major organizations including the UN, but because the country that I moved into with my gf isn't native English (Europe), which meant having to work jobs where language isn't important. I consequently felt extremely depressed and under appreciated. The degree was extremely challenging and my relationship started to fall apart a few months into it. It's 2 years later now. I graduated top 2% of my class, but I'm broke, still in my relationship but deeply miserable in it and fantasize about leaving it, and to top it all off, I had a petty accident at the park the other day and broke my leg.

I sometimes think that I should have never made that move. It was impulsive somewhat. I had a perfectly good job and independant life before this move. Sure, I was itching to travel again and take on a new challenge. Learn AI. Live in Europe. But nothing about this experience was as I hoped it would. Wish I could go back in time a few years ago and tell myself to try to be happy where I am, without wanting to fling myself across the globe being a romantic.

833,"I am in a hurry to post this out as I need a quick answer that can give me some help on how to cope with my situation. I do not know how to write this out without giving you my life story so here goes. I am a 15 year old teen going on 16 in a month, my parents are divorced. My mom remarried early on in my life and they are still married now. They have had two kids as of now, going on three, and one miscarriage. I have one sister who my mom had with my father. 
My step father is currently active military and I have little to no problems with him at all, although I suspect he had Bipolar until recently due to his erratic and often non feasible purchases, such as a sports car. He is now on Adderall, which has mostly fixed the spending issue of the past. Based upon research I conducted on my own I have gathered that my biological father had abused my mother and caused their separation (I am quite literally a bastard). Although that never affected my relationship with him as he is still my father and my mother believed in me having a relationship with my father, (I praise her for this) it meant I have a lot less visitation with him since our cross-country move from my home state. (He has no visitation rights due) I have slight anxiety and a past history of depression, however nothing too serious. While I love my family to death I cannot be with them for any extended period of time due to the toxic nature of our relationship. I suspect my four year old half sister is a socio path due her incessant physical bullying of her baby sister and lack of remorse and responsibility about literally anything, never apologizing unless she explicitly gets something she wants. (I.e. a cupcake, or an extra hour of time on the tv, etc,) however my mother is the wild card of the family. With her hypocritical views on equality between races, genders etc. aside. She lacks the ability to apologize, I cannot recall the last time she legitimately apologized. If there is a mistake in anything she will turn it around on anyone who speaks even if she is the root cause. She often causes me of gaslighting and abuse, calling me names, and saying “your just like your father...” or “if you hate it hear so much why don’t you go live with your father”. Regardless of preconceptions I feel this is entirely inappropriate especially as she knows my father barely has enough money to sustain himself due to prior poor choices in his life. In fact, I recall my mother detailing  a story to family about my father saying he only had 23 dollars to his name, and couldn’t afford a plane ticket for my sister and I’s summer visitation. She goes for the low blows when upset and refuses to take responsibility. I believe she is on medication. I feel guilty for saying this, however I not think she is actively using it as her mod. Swings have not improved very much. This is all I feel comfortable writing at this time and I’ll probably end up deleting this post as I’m not entirely sure if this will be traced back to me, some how some way. I have had a run in with the police recently for a small thing and I take responsibility for that, however my parents refuse to let it go, often guilt tipping me and saying how ridiculous it is I would do something like “that” regardless of me pursuing a job to pay off the small fine associated with said act. I could really use some coping mechanisms to get through my next two years in this house and maybe some financial advise so I can move out on my 18th birthday. Thank you all.",18Sep2019,2

838,"I've been with my boyfriend for just over a year. About 4 months in he lost his job and spiralled into a depression. Around that time I got a new job as a waitress. I would work split shifts - lunch and dinner. After my boyfriend lost his job he refused to work for anyone else, saying he would only be his own boss from now on, yet made no attempt to start a business whatsoever. 

As I said he spiralled into a depression, I would go to work everyday and he would stay in his room all day, he wouldn't leave. Our sex life became non existent and I snooped through his phone to find out why. 

He had been watching porn and alot of it. He would watch it constantly 4-5 times a day and so by the time I'd come home from my night shift he wouldn't want to touch me. This affected my self esteem and I began to feel ugly and unwanted. I told him I was no longer happy and wanted to leave. He begged me to stay, said we would stop watching porn which he did, so I stayed and eventually he started a new business a few months ago. 

So fast forward to know I think I have trauma from going through that for months. I get scared to leave him home alone. He is never home without me because I'm scared he will watch porn again. I fight with myself every day because on one hand it's just porn, I know he still loves me, on the other hand I'm scared he will go back to his addiction and I'll feel all of those negative feelings about myself again. I get anxiety at the thought of him being somewhere alone without me, it's destroying our relationship. 

I can't do any hobbies or exercise which I used to leave because I'm scared he'll watch porn when I leave to do anything for myself. I'm slowly going insane and torturing myself. 

He has promised he won't watch it again and deep down I know that, my anxiety just won't let me except that.

The wall trim has been peed on so much it's actually expanding. It's fucking disgusting, bordering nightmarish. Just imagine a piece of wall trim that's basically bloated because it's so full of pee. We can't get rid of the smell no matter how hard we try, of course, so the only solution is to replace it.

Thing is, this is an apartment, and this is the first time we've had any kind of issue like this, so I don't know what to do. It's our first apartment, but we've been here for about 4 years.

We really can't afford to move at the moment, so I've been looking at how to replace wood trim... and now we just need to decide which strategy to commit to.

He goes in nonsensical rants that leave the class completely confused and wondering if he’s on drugs.

He insists we call him Dr.____. He might have a doctor but he’s certainly not a medical doctor. He gets angry if he call him professor.

I want to report him now; but I’m moving and have to change schools at the end of the semester anyway. Would I go directly to the chair? Or go to him and let him know how I’m feeling first? Or email him? Should I wait until the end of the semester, or do it now?

844,"Oh my god, guys. It's driving me insane. Fairly recwntly I've been having beyobd intese cravings for salt. Lije came pretty damn close to juat gravbing a salt shaker today and eating it straight from thr container.(i *didn't* but it was a distinct possibility I wasn't against.) And I thought it might be stress but my day has been fucking amazing and then next thing I know I couldn't like do anything because I was distracted by beyond an intense craving. What do I do?!?!? Aside from caving and dumping salt in things that should not need salt added to them? This happens every so often. And I think ot's been a problem like at least once a week for about a month and I'm losing my damn mind because it's gone beyond thr basic of ""oh that sounds yummy"" to ""i swear to god if i don't eat something salty in the next few minutes I'm going to be incapable of functioning""

847,"I am a 19 year old college student. Like most guys my age, I want a girlfriend/relationship, or even just a girl that likes me while I like her. I’m not trying for anything super serious, but obviously that can change if I fine the right girl. I’m looking for advice on what to do. I’ll explain what I’ve been doing and what’s been happening and why I’m so frustrated. 

I try hard. Lots of guys will complain and say they’re lonely but they don’t actually put the effort into finding a girlfriend. I have a tinder, which I use regularly, swiping on every half decent girl and always opening with what I feel is a respectful and funny line. I’m never creepy, I’ve never asked for sex, and I’ve never sent anyone a nude in my life. Not only do I use tinder, but I make it a point to talk to many different girls, whether in classes or at parties, always asking for their Snapchats or phone numbers. I will comment on their snap stories and compliment them, and eventually build a casual conversation that could potentially lead to us hanging out. If I’ve got this far, I’ll ask them out on a date or to a hangout, whichever feels more appropriate based on the subtext of our conversation. I’ll take them to a party, or go kayaking, or go on a picnic, or just invite them over to cuddle and watch movies. This step is the easiest, and I’ve been here multiple times. It almost always seems to go well, this initial “date”. I’m funny, the girl seems interested, and about a quarter of the time the girl will kiss me before the night is over. Step one is done, I’m left getting my hopes up thinking I’ve finally found a girl that could be my girlfriend. We continue to talk, whether on Snapchat or text, and at this point I start to second guess myself, just because I’m that type of person. I wonder if they actually do like me, so I think very carefully of how to respond to each message, and how to take them out again. The second “date” is where things definitely start to take a turn. For some reason, it never goes as well as the first time. They start the night off with the same level of attraction they showed the first “date” but slowly something changes. I don’t know what, but this second “date” doesn’t go as well. Not bad necessarily, just not as good. Afterwards, there is a noticeable change in the way they respond. They don’t seem as into talking to me, they provide less to go off of, and they seem reluctant to hang out again. I don’t know what changed, I feel as though I’ve acted exactly the same the whole time. I don’t say anything suggestive, I’m not overly clingy, I keep my boundaries and try to be the “perfect guy” that everyone talks about in movies and books and on tv. Somehow, at this stage in the “relationship”, I ALWAYS screw it up. Things progressively get worse, they respond less and less, and over the span of a week or two we don’t talk anymore. It drives me insane. 

Next thing I want to mention, I’m not ugly. Now, I’ve been told forever that confidence is everything. Deep down, I’m not a super confident person. I judge myself extremely harshly, I hate my hair and face and height, but anyone who knows me will say I’m a good looking, very confident person. I put on the face of a guy who knows he’s cool, knows he’s attractive, but isn’t cocky about it. I have long brown curly hair, it’s big but I’ve been told by a lot of people it’s amazing. Almost everyone will tell me they love it, whether they actually do or not I’m not sure. I have a strong jaw, long eyelashes, and a good smile. I’d give myself a 5 or 6 or maybe a 7, if I’m being generous, and I typically go after girls I consider to be at my level. I’m 5’10”, and wear stylish clothes and put effort into an outfit. I always shave, smell good, and drive a cool car. I’m skinny, if not fit, and I’m not weak by any means at all. I don’t want to think my looks are the problem but I do, I guess it’s just part of my nature. 

Here’s the problem, I’ve looked at this from every angle and I don’t know what to change or what to do. I’m slowly slipping further and further into depression, which is absolutely infuriating to me because I’ve always been an extremely happy person. I’ve never tried for a relationship as hard as I have been these last couple months, and they always fall apart the exact same way. I need advice. How do I keep the girl interested?? I’ve tried giving them space, texting first, waiting for them to text first, sending funny memes, not snapping at all and just asking to hang out, I’ve taken girls on romantic dates, I’ve taken them to hangouts with friends, I’ve asked them to go on picnics or to go pick raspberries or to just hangout. It’s killing me. How do I keep them interested, how do I let them know how much I like them? Because I do, I really do, and I don’t know how to make it clear. AND IVE JUST STRAIGHT UP TOLD THEM I LIKE THEM. I BUY FLOWERS, I BUY CANDY, I SMILE WHEN I LOOK AT THEM AND I ALWAYS STAY RESPECTFUL. I’ve made sure not to come on too strong, I’ve practiced trying to show just the right amount of attraction and admiration and I don’t know if I’m too intense, or not intense enough, because they never tell me. They act like nothing is going on, like their slowly rising lack of interest isn’t happening. I don’t know how to ask what’s going on, I don’t know how to pull them back in, I don’t know what is causing this change. 

The girl I’m putting my time into now is amazing. I find myself saying the same things I always say to get a girl to like me, but this time I can tell I mean it. I really really feel it, this girl is AMAZING. She’s insanely attractive, like, super cute. In my opinion, way too good for me. She’s mysterious, and she likes poking at me and confusing me, but in a good way, at least while we’re hanging out. I know she’s too good for me, it blows my mind that’s she’s hung out with me at all, and that she seems to like me. She’s said I’m cute, she’s said she likes my hair, my clothes, and my smile. I like this girl, A LOT. Way more than any other girl ever. Like literally, ever. And I feel like I’ve done really well so far, but the same pattern is happening again and I’m terrified. I’m so scared. I’m losing sleep, cause I can feel her responses to my messages going the same way they always have with these other girls. I’m terrified it’s too late, and that I can’t turn it around. Because I’m not going to be okay if I lose this girl. I don’t know if I can handle this, what with school and work dragging me down as is. 

I need advice. Girls of reddit, what is this?? Please..!I’ve talked to other guys and they’ve experienced the same thing. Do you just get bored? Do I come on too strong? Is it just that these females enjoy messing with my f**king head? How do I change this, how do I keep their interest, or at least how do I turn it around once they start drifting away? In particular, how do I let this girl know how much I like her without scaring her?? I’ve been told my soo many people to just be chill, take it slow, be cool, but wtf does that mean??? I’ve asked her to hang out twice this week, and I feel like that’s too much. Do I stop snap chatting her for a while? Do I snap her more? I need help, or at least an explanation. I don’t know what part of me or what part of my personality is freaking them out. I like who I am, all my friends are very nice, intelligent, outgoing people, and they all love me. So what is it that these girls don’t like? 

Also, I never call these girls out, I never get mad, I never say anything because I don’t want to be that guy. Should I ask?? It seems pathetic to do that. Anyways, please help me out if you can.",18Sep2019,1
848,"So I live in a 4th floor apartment in near a busy city.  I’ve lived here with my sister for about 2 months. And two really weird things have happened over the last two weeks that make me sure someone is sneaking into the apartment during the day while the two of us are at work. 

It started with the hair stopper in my shower... My sister and I have separate bathrooms, with here’s being behind her bedroom door in the back bedroom. On Friday morning, before going away for a weekend, I took out the stopper out of the drain and put it in the tub to remind myself to clean it before I took my next shower. On Sunday, when I opened the curtain, it had been cleaned out. I was surprised and figured that my sister had cleaned it for me. Gross, but thanks I guess. When i asked her about it the next evening she didn’t know what I was taking about. No one else was in the apartment. It was strange but I let it go. 

Then, yesterday, when my sister came home from work, it was very clear someone had been in our apartment. We’ve had issues with our dryer, so maintenance has been in and out for a few weeks. But whenever they come, even just to check, they leave an official thing on the door with a note with why they were there. Because strangers have been in and out, we’ve gotten into a particular pattern of shutting all the doors , including both bathroom doors, before leaving in the morning. When sis got home, every door was completely wide open, and fans that were turned on were turned off. It was very unsettling. Nothing is missing. We have 3 big TVs, iPads and laptops were out. We’ve searched for cameras. The only reason I can think of someone coming into our apartment is for something perverted. I should add we have balcony with access to the living room and a bedroom. They lock from the inside and were shut, but I guess it’s possible they came in that way? 

We immediately called the landlord and got the locks changed today. The landlord was really freaked out and was very quick to say no one had been in our apartment. They claim they changed the locks after last tenants but frankly I don’t believe them. Also got a cheap camera on amazon...... but We’re both pretty creeped out. I have this weird feeling that it’s either an old tenant or a maintenance guy coming back on his time off. *barf* 

What do you think could be happening???",18Sep2019,1200
850,"Are there any knowledgeable car guys (or girls)  on here? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to figure out a place to start in terms of a car to get as a daily driver for a while now.

&amp;#x200B;

It's tough because I don't know enough about cars and really like the nostalgic/classic look of cars from the 50's-90's. I lean more towards 80's-90's cars because of how they're more available and, at least the ones I've seen thus far, are within the goldilocks zone in terms of being solid machines that have the ability to be driven up to and beyond 200k miles all while looking kick-ass with their flip-up headlights. 

&amp;#x200B;

BUT, and this is a big butt because I'm an ass man, I don't want to fall into a trap where I get a car from that era and it becomes a money-pit that I only got because of my rose-tinted glasses. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been running in circles for months (arguably years, on-and-off) doing ""research"" on cars as a whole and trying to find the one that fits be best. It'll have to be a daily driver because I can't own more than one car and I drive it through all seasons and through rural and city areas which means both long straightaways and bumper to bumper traffic for hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

A part of me wants to say ""\*heck it\*"" and just go find one of these MR2, Corolla GTS, Prelude, Supra for sale in one of the states around me and buy it... but at the same time I'm not in a financial state where I can buy a car that will cost more than $3k post-purchase in maintenance fees / corrections within the first 6-7 months of owning it.

Yesterday, I had some friends over so we could play Cards Against Humanity in my dorm. It was me, three friends, my roommate, and my roommate's boyfriend. At one point, I was drinking water and someone said something funny. I started choking on my water (of course), but I didn't want to spit it out so I tried to swallow it. Bad move. I ended up turning around and throwing up in one of my trashcans (thanks, gag reflex). My friends were immediately worried and asked if I was okay and I was able to pull myself together within a few seconds. I told them I was more embarrassed than anything. After that, though, my roommate left with her boyfriend and ended up spending the night with him. My friends left soon after they left. All I can say is that I'm really embarrassed by what happened.

Everybody in my family seems to have moved on from it but me, whenever i talk to them they tend to brush it off saying ""it's just your dad"" or ""that's why I dont talk to him""

But i know he can get drunk and violent and when I stay with him he quite often seems tired and has a beer in his hand and that makes me very anxious. To add to the anxiety he hardly ever talks to me otherwise and completely ignores me until my sister is forced to be assertive.

The anxiety gets worse with each day as I am being pulled out of lessons during panic attacks or sobbing.

I was referred to a counsellor for about 25 weeks and it didn't help at all.

It feels like there's nothing I can do as friends dont understand, family don't care and councillors can't do anything so is there something I can do or a place I can go to help with the anxiety

855,"Background:

I have my undergrad in Early Education and am currently going to grad school full ride with an assistantship that pays for my college and then some. I'm also in an accelerated pace program to be done within a year to get my Master's in Reading Education.

I also have a job at my local hospital as a Nursing Assistant that pays me exceptionally well and works with my school schedule.

I was offered a job as a substitute teacher in my home district but I'm worried that I won't be able to give them as much attention as the job would need with my other responsibilities as a grad student with an assistantship. I am also worried that I might put too much into the sub position and not enough into my studies.

At some point earlier this year during the spring semester, I noticed one of my coworkers had huge bruises on her forearms. I don’t remember how many there were but there were at least 2, and one of them was probably about the size of my palm. She kept it covered with one of those big bandaids, but they were there for at least 2 weeks if I had to guess. 

I moved to a different city and got a text today from one of my friends that still works with this girl saying that she has big bruises on both of her forearms again. When my friend asked her what happened, she said she bumped her arm on something. This girl is so sweet and fun to talk to, and I would hate to think someone out there is intentionally hurting her. 

I made a mental note to myself that if I saw bruises on her again, I would do something because it definitely wouldn’t be a coincidence. So now here we are. I am scared for her but I have no idea how to help or if I even can help since I don’t live there or talk to her anymore.

The other day I was looking at the list of people I was having a chat with that day, and my eye caught my bully's name. I knew it was her because her name is very unique.

Her chat came and she entered my office. It was a very awkward conversation. I was panicking because she was in the same room with me and all those terrible memories from the past played in my mind. Those memories also made me feel a lot of anger towards her. I was trying my best to be professional, and I didn't snap at her or anything, but I also know I didn't manage to hide the passive tone in my voice. It was the shortest chat I have had so far.

I was driving normally, albeit a bit absentmindedly because I hadn't eaten for about 14 hours, and before I knew it I was face to bumper with another car.

I've never been really good at talking to people and breaking the ice and going to college has been really difficult as everyone there is new to me. I've been finding it difficult to eat anything as I begin to feel sick and nauseous when I think about college.

I love going to the college and the course is really interesting to me. I've managed to make some friends and we get along well, but, I still can't help but feel inadequate in a way. I don't feel as though I fit in properly; everyone else seems to be more confident and outgoing then me.

866,"So, ever since I was about 11 or 12 years old, I've dealt with depressive periods of my life.

I have never been diagnosed with depression in anyway, but I think I fit the criteria to the T. Not necessarily the whole crying in my bed, catatonia deal but it's like all the colors and flavors in my world have become dull. Between now and then, I don't think I've ever been truly happy, more like just less sad/depressed. Last year it got really bad, probably the worst it ever got since the beginning. I've been coping with it to some extent and I'm not actively suicidal or anything, not like last year but I'm just sick of living like this. 

Especially because it's starting to ruin my life in many different ways. My head is a constant loop of self hatred for the most part, also doubt and guilt plague me. Also, I've tried to open up to people about how I actually feel and some have said I should really seek help. 

I'm extremely concerned because now I don't want any sort of human relationship. I actively do not want any romantic or sexual relationship after a bad relationship, it's like a lightbulb went out in me. Or better yet, the lightbulb has been completely ripped out of the socket and thrown on the ground. I don't know if I can really love again or if I even want to. On top of that, I'm one of those people who refuse to have sex without actually loving/caring for that person because it makes me really uncomfortable with myself, so I don't have sex or any romantic relationship. Also, when I'm in one of those depressive periods I have no desire to talk to anyone/be friends with anyone because they drain me. That applies even to my family, the people I feel closest to and love the most. I just feel like I'm just too stupid and worthless to be loved by them or they just exhaust me. Besides, it's just like I cannot stand anyone, they just annoy me too much.

I've approached my mother about therapy, last year specifically. She just shut down and got angry with me because she says she gives me everything and I have no right to be sad. Same thing goes for my dad, who had to go through his fair share of therapy. I think though, that they would both benefit from it because they both came from traumatic backgrounds.

Didn’t go to well, and now I’m in my final year of high School. I have no idea what I want to do, what I want to be. My parents pressure me which gives me major anxiety. All my best friends are in college, most of them are majoring in things they want to do, but there is one that’s majoring in physics and computer science, but doesn’t know what he wants as a career. So he’s the closest I can resemble to. I wish I had somebody to talk to about this, my parents would just pressure and doubt me, my brother would just tell me to major in something I don’t like. And my grandparents want me to be an “Islamic Priest” haha. I have many interests; graphics design, video editing, music making, etc, all of these are things I can’t major, and even if I do, it’s a waste of money and time, because I have to build my own audience or whatever. I just wish I had luck like all these  big time YouTubers, artists, etc. I’m just lost",18Sep2019,1
869,"I am 13 years old, turning 14 in April. My little brother just turned 9. He has severe dyslexia, A.D.H.D, and an auditory processing disorder. (He goes to a special school because of it). He gets on my nerves, hes not funny, and he makes me want to scream sometimes. Both me and him have anger issues which doesn't help anything. When I get mad I call him an idiot, stupid, retard, etc. I also have a problem with punching and hitting him and making him cry. He also punches and hits me as well (probably because he learns from me). I'm a horrible influence on him, and I'm worried he will have a really hard time getting over the crap I've put him through. Inside I feel really horrible, and sometimes looking back at the things I've done, I want to start crying. He goes to a psychologist for this (and partly for his school). My mom tells me that he looks up to me and he really loves me, and whenever I'm mean to him he acts it out because he looks up to me. School for him is hard enough, but when he gets home and hears me cussing him out, it probably makes it 60 times worse. He has been acting out at school and the psychologist says it has something to do with my bullying. My mom had a conversation with him when I wasn't home and recorded it. My brother says that he really loves me so much and he would do anything in the entire world to get me to stop being mean to me, and that hes really depressed because of me. He really wants me to stop. One time I was being mean to him and he starting tearing up (I noticed this and started to feel really guilty) he went to go hug my mom and he hugged her 40 seconds. Once I saw that, I felt so so horrible. I love my brother with all of my heart and want to stop. I've tried everything. I've ruined his childhood because I'm such a piece of shit. Is there anything I can do to change this? I sometimes just want to walk in there and give him the best hug ever and apologize for everything I've done in my entire life. He would be so happy, I just cant get myself to do that, I'm way to shy. I love him so much and I know that I will need him later in my life. I fucked up, what do I do...

870,"I’m sort of tired of explaining my situation, you’ll forgive me. 

My mom (68, f) was perfectly healthy by all outward appearances two weeks ago and today she’s in a medically induced coma on a ventilator with a diagnosis of some kind of major cancer, we still don’t have full biopsy report yet.

It’s been terrible, she’s been through so many tests, so many procedures already and I think we’re still at the beginning stages of this horrible process.

I’m trying to figure out how to cope during this period. It’s a bit of a selfish request but I know I’m not going to be able to help my mom if I’m burned out.

I’m doing my best to support my father through this and my sister is also helping...but I also have a family of my own, a full-time job (and now also trying to help my dad keep HIS business up and running), and other family commitments to boot.

I’m hoping there’s someone out there who’s been through something similar that might be able to give me some advice on how to balance this all. I need to support my mom and dad through this, but I also can’t ignore my own family or job either. My advice?

Tl;dr: my mom is very sick and I need to help my dad deal with finding her proper treatment while also not letting my own life implode. How do I balance this?",18Sep2019,0

874,"Almost two weeks ago I got into a meeting with my boss. He said that he questioned my commitment to my school because in a grade level meeting he was outside the door and heard me ask “why” something. It wasn’t hat I asked why but it was my tone. From that and maybe he has a spy, idk. He questioned my commitment to my job.

Fast forward to yesterday’s team meeting. He has one of his spies another teacher who has a part time teaching position was in our meeting. We were going round and round about something they asked us to do, why? What if? What happens when? I could tell I asked too many questions and felt like I’d be called into a meeting. 

I check my email and had a meeting invite and all it said was, “let’s chat!” On it was my assistant principal and the other teacher who was in the meeting. I emailed and asked what the meeting was in regards to, all he replied was, “team level meetings.” Nothing else. So all day I’m worried about this meeting. Is it him just answering the questions I had or did she frame it in a way that I’m about to get in trouble. 

Long story short she felt like I was being negative in the meeting even though we all talked about the same things. He had her in this meeting. After he asked me, how do you feel about the meeting, what were you doing during, etc. He asked her what her perception was and she flat out lied on me. I couldn’t believe it. He goes on to say in front of her that he has talked to me before and she was in there because he didn’t want he said she said. I was in there based on he said she said. He didn’t hear what happened he took her word and called me in. I was blindsided. He didn’t give me time to prepare for this, I walk in to A meeting with all eyes on me and she has already told him her lies and he believes her because she is one of his team leads.

After the meeting he told me not to discuss what went on and to “be careful who you vent to.”

Should she have been in that meeting? Should I go to HR and tell them I truly felt we intimidated and blindsided. I feel like he played us against each other. She is my peer. He said, “I hope when she comes up it doesn’t give you anxiety.”",18Sep2019,1
875,"This is written on mobile. That being said, I’m sorry for any grammar or spelling errors!

TL;DR: My mother says I will only bring my sister down and that I am difficult to be around when I suggested that I should move in with her (my sister).

 I’ve also decided to exclude most ages because I think they are irrelevant to the story and I am not aware if any person involved frequently uses Reddit.

I am very depressed and have basically lost any motivation to live. I am currently trying various methods to pull myself out of this depression, but it is very hard and I’m suffering greatly. Part of the reason why I  am struggling so much is because I am also trying to heal from a chronic illness that has left me bedridden. 

Yesterday, I spoke with my mother (who I am currently living with because I am too ill to hold a job) about moving in with my sister who lives about an hour or so away. I thought this was a brilliant plan because,

1. It would force me to be out of my comfort zone.

2. Perhaps a change in scenery would spark my joy for living again.

And,

3. Despite how much I love my mother &amp; father and how much I appreciate their support, I question if their negativity is putting a monkey wrench in my healing process. (When my sister moved out, she told me that she felt much happier getting away from my parents negative attitude.)

Basically, my Mom told me that would be a very bad idea. She told me that I was a “hard person to be around” and that I would only bring my sister down. (Which hurt like HELL considering I genuinely feel like a worthless shell of a person.)

My mom is someone who is constantly complaining. She is extremely negative, is always the victim, and is quick to point the finger at someone else. Even when my sister left, she had said she could barely come back to our house because the atmosphere was so oppressive. (Fighting, chronic &amp; mental illness, money issues, dysfunctional relationships, etc.)

Now, I am so confused. My sister is the person I trust and love most in this world. I was going to politely ask her if I could come live with her... even if it was just for a few days, but now I’m completely questioning myself. My mother told me not to speak about this with my sister, because I would just bring her down/overwhelm her. I feel as though I can’t speak to anyone about this and it is eating me alive.

Am I really so horrible? I know chronic illness and depression are extremely hard to be around. I also know that I am the biggest screw-up, but surely I’m not so horrible that it is unbearable to be in my company. Maybe my sister is better off without me? I genuinely don’t know. My self-confidence is already rock bottom so I don’t doubt that I have only caused my sister pain, but I also feel like what my mother said was unnecessary and hurtful. Please, any advice would be welcome.",18Sep2019,1

877,"Ok so bit long, bear with me. So from the age of 18-21 I dealt with an on/off relationship. Super insecure, all kinds of good leftover crappy childhood trauma, have been dealing with it and am a lot better now. Dated a guy for 10 months after that where I stood up for myself to him and his friends and grew significantly as a human being, he tried coming back to me later I told him no and pointed out every issue we had and that he wasn’t going to change and do right by me. Surprisingly he agreed and dropped it and moved on. Dated a third guy for 10 months, turns out he never cared enough to have dated me in the first place. There was about a year between all three of these relationships. 

Then at the very end of relationship #3 my childhood best friend admitted to having serious feelings about me and there was an attempt made to see how it would go. He withdrew, stopped talking to me, I ended up dating another guy for about six months. This guy was gone for most of our relationship working on the road. He almost immediately began ignoring me when he left, this was around April/May of this year. I waited out how bad things were until the very start of July telling the guy I needed to see improvement or else I wasn’t staying. He said he would never make changes, I ended it. 

I met someone a few days ago, we haven’t stopped talking yet. We’re going on a date Saturday. If things go well for the next three months, we’re thinking about moving in together. The area I currently live is dying and it’s hard to find work. Where he lives is a lot better as far as jobs go. I had to move out at 18 (25 now) onto my own and I have been barely affording basic necessities. Rent, electric, heat, Internet because I’m in college, college payments, food. Literally basic necessities. I can barely afford a $20 pair of jeans when I need them. This guy is willing to help me until I find a new job in his area, two hours away. 

No one close to me has bothered acknowledging my personal growth and thinks I’m not demanding proof of what this guy is saying to me about his life. They refuse to acknowledge that I have made huge strides in bettering my issues. One friend has tried shutting this idea down, and he pisses me off more than anyone because he moved his girlfriend in with him after less than a month of knowing her. 

So what I want to know is, has anyone got any advice who went through a similar situation or just opinions about it?",18Sep2019,1

879,"So this may not be the place for a post like this, but we are desperate and not sure what to do. Perhaps someone here has experience with purple mattresses and can give us advice. Anyway- we got our mattress last Saturday and noticed almost immediately that we had a weird feeling in our mouths and throats- as if they are covered in powder. We saw online that there is supposed to be some powder in the mattress,  however the amount that is coming out of this mattress is alarming. It is all over the house and is so concentrated in the bedroom we can't even go in there and it is hard just being in the house. We can feel it in our eyes and mouths, it's making us cough and our lungs and throats hurt. We called purple and they said it could be defective and that they would send us a new one, but in the meantime we have no idea how to get rid of this powder. Has anyone here had an experience like this? Does anyone have any advice on what we should do? We currently have all the windows and doors open with fans in front of them and are using face masks but it is not enough. There is just so much of this stuff in the air.

880,"This is... long to say this least, but please help if you can. Back in October '18, my partner (m24) and I (f23) got a new place - a nice three bedroom. Shortly after, my (then underage) brother needed out of our mother's place so I invited him to one of the spare bedrooms. No biggy, and it's gone quite well. Exceptionally good roommate and we all get along. That is, until this summer when we started looking for a third roommate because the extra household income would allow us (partner and self) to save more easily for a move out of state come next summer. My brother immediately suggested his friend (19 yrs old) who we'd heard much about but never met to the point that we thought we might as well know them. We decided to meet a few times and since it went well enough we proceeded with moving them in. 

Almost overnight, it all went downhill. I could spend a long time listing nuisances but a few of the highlights are the new roommate announcing that he had roaches at old house, has brought them with him, and it's our (mine specifically as hoh) responsibility to take care of that. Not keeping up with his cats' litter box or keeping them out of the common room (as specified because two household members are allergic), and general rudeness like walking around partially clothed while guests are over and loudly injecting himself into private conversations, being loud at all hours of the night, opening windows during the heat of the day while the ac is doing its best to keep up, taking household items to his room and not returning them when asked to (ex. chairs, scissors, lamps, etc). The only redeeming factor about this situation is that he does pay his share of rent. After many, many talks about how all these little behaviors add up and him not progressing (it's been two months),  the solution would be straight forward enough: get out. 

Here's where the advice is needed. My brother has gone from ""pretty alright roommate"" to almost just as bad as his friend if not worse in other ways. He's starting becoming very lazy with household cleanings, is defensive of his friend's inappropriate actions, has got generally snippy, and hasn't paid rent two months in a roll - which I'm trying to be understanding about since it's job related but still. I know my brother well enough to know that if we tell his friend to leave he will take it very badly and either leave too or make life worse than it was before. I don't want to loose that solid relationship that I've always had with him, but I think under these circumstances that might be just what happens. 

My solution has tentatively settled on moving out of the nice house when the lease is up in a little over a month. Explain that it's best for us financially - we would go live with my partner's grandparent's until next summer which would give is plenty of time to save up money. But both roommates would have to find somewhere else to go. It would be still be rough for both of them since as far as I know their only options would be to go live with family. 

Am I leaping to this solution? Is it too unfair/selfish? Advice needed, because I'm struggling under the weight of too many lives to decide without external input.",18Sep2019,2

890,"I'm sorry, this is so pathetic. I get too attached, always against my better judgement. I tend to always have my guard up, but once I trust someone enough to let them in, I get attached. I never act on the attachment. I internalize it because I know it's not healthy. when things are good, life is fine. But the second things go bad, I feel it deeply. I get very anxious, to the point of sometimes being physically sick. I get very emotional, and cry often. I hate that I am this way. But, here we are.  


Things in my current situation seem to be taking a bad turn, and it's affecting me deeply. I can (barely) keep it together during my work day. But, as soon as I get in my car after work, I start crying. And from there, I cry pretty much off and on until I go to bed. As soon as I get home from work, I crawl into bed and just lay there. I can't focus on anything productive to do. I just lay there, scrolling on my phone, and crying. At this point I never have enough of an appetite to eat anything after work. I literally just lay there until it's time to go to bed.

The hardest thing for me when someone leaves is learning how to live again without them. It's always hard for me to think about what my life was even like before they were in it. When it's someone that's affected my life so much, it's devastating to even imagine how to go forward without them. It's this that kind of paralyzes me. It's like I don't know how to live without having him to talk to, confide in, and vent to. Perhaps it's having so few close people in my life that just makes this hole seem so much bigger.

891,"i will try to keep this short as it is a bit complicated. basically, me and my ex prior to being in a relationship have been best friends for roughly 3 years and we consider each other family, so when i decided to end the relationship (for a myriad of reasons) we of course remained friends. however shortly after the relationship ended he initiated a friends with benefits situation and i agreed but only on the premise that it meant absolutely nothing. 

to me it genuinely meant absolutely nothing but in his head he thought that i still had feelings even though i made it very clear i didn’t. so one day i decided to download tinder, not for any particular reason probably just boredom to be completely honest. i didn’t expect anything from it but i ended up clicking with someone on there and hit it off. now before me and my ex basically spent every weekend together, so when i announced going on a date with someone from tinder he got very upset. 

fast forward a tad and he’s still upset but i thought we’d worked it out and could just be regular friends again, so we arrange to hang out. however when we hang out it was the most awkward thing ever, he’s asking constantly about the tinder person and gets very depressed and asks if it’s okay if he drops me off early which of course i understand and oblige. on the journey i decide to reply to a text from tinder person and my ex looks over at my phone, and completely snaps. yelling at me saying “are you texting him right now??” and generally just very snarly, he has never snapped at me like this before and i was visibly shocked. i can’t even fully remember what was said i just wanted to exit the situation. i understand it is was inconsiderate to text tinder person whilst with my ex but i didn’t expect him to look over and check who i’m texting. 

so, he blocks me explaining why, saying it was too soon to see me etc. unblocks me and unloads a lot of emotional baggage so to speak, i won’t lie i am pretty fed up at this point as it’s been about 2 months now of me being his emotional diary to unload onto and pessimism and delusions and a lot of reassurance on my part and it was very draining. and so, i now have him blocked, he has messaged me on another platform again unloading emotional baggage but i also blocked him on there, i need space.

892,"My boyfriend (24 year old M) and I (24 year old F) have been dating for over a year.

We love eachother very much but there is one thing that makes me a little sad from time to time: lately, we have had opposite work schedules (I work 9 to 5 monday to friday, boyfriend works nights and weekends) so we don't get to see eachother much. We find time to hang out once every 2 to 4 weeks on average. I'm not sure if this is normal or not, but we both truly are very busy people and it is hard to make our schedules work. On top of that, he still lives with his parents. They don't allow me to sleep over, or him to sleep over at my place. He doesn't fight them on it because he knows it will probably cause an argument.

The good news is, he is making an effort to move out on his own. But he applied for a job (that is highly likely that he will get) about 3 hours away, in the town of the college we used to attend. We have been through times of distance before, and I'm not worried about it working out, I know that we can do it. But between us not being able to see one another lately, and that, I'm just feeling a little down because i miss him. He suggested that when I'm able to, I could move where his new job is too- he knows i actually love the area that this job he is looking at is in, and have thought about moving there before myself, but as of right now I haven't seen too many job postings in my field there. When i bring it up to my boyfriend that I miss him a lot, or that it makes me feel a little sad that we hardly see one another, he seems unphased by it, and it's almost as though he thinks I'm worrying about nothing, and maybe I am? I don't know. He had a relationship a couple years before ours in which it was super long distance and they legitimately only saw one another every few months. I wouldn't say that's ideal, but it seems as though my bf is accustomed to not seeing his S.O. a lot, to the point where it doesnt phase him.

Any advice on this situation would be great. Just trying to figure out what to do to make this feel a bit less difficult. I love him so much and don't want it to strain our relationship by me missing him too much.

The program is intense and honestly compared to the friends I have at others schools is kind of over the top. I am doing good tho and have had good grades all the years I’ve been there. My issue with the school is the administration. We have some of the most incompetent people running our offices especially financial aid and the business office. They have screwed me over every single semester. Freshman year they told me I owed 6 thousand dollars more than I actually did so I took out way extra on a loan. I ended up using it for summer school to get some extra classes out of the way. Then the next semester I go in for clarification and they give me the amount I owe. It ends up being about 7-8 thousand short which my family and I had to pay out of pocket. Now this year I did the same thing except I had multiple offices confirm my amount. Then I took out extra just in case. Now they are telling me I owe even more and that my balance is overdue. So yet again I would have to pay out of pocket. At this point it is just pissing me off to deal with my shitty run school, and it just makes me feel like dealing with the psycho teachers obnoxious class loads and high expectations (we have to maintain a 77% average on all exams to pass no matter what our final grade is) should I just stick it out or should I explore other schools and maybe just find a better run university",18Sep2019,1
