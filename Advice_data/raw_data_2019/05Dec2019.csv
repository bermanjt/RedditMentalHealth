0,"So a bit of backstory:

Couple of months ago, was still late summer, I was planning the bday present for one of my two best friends. He's a absolute geek and I thought that a full-fledged CaH set + several expansions would make him really happy. So I hopped on the Internet and after a short research I found out I can only get him the basic set from the local stores and a shipment(for the cool expansions) from CaH's office in USA would cost ridiculously much to circle half the globe.

So after several days of desperation and further research I found out a seller, who presumably had all expansions of the game. In the passion of the moment of gifting my best busd such experience it never went through my mind that I might be scammed. Well I made the deal with the guy, payed him through one of the recently-emerged payment platforms and he then proceeded to stop all contact to me - I was utterly devastated as I had saved those funds especially for my friend for a long time. 

I turned to to the company but they pointed out to me that its clearly written in the T&amp;C that all transactions within their system are final and irreversible.

So, fast forward couple of months, yesterday, due to really unforseen and unimaginably coincidental circumstances, I came across the credit card info of this guy.

Since I live a moderately normal life my family in Eastern Europe, after I lost that 400 EUR(which I saved for a long time since I knew my friend was turning 20) I didn't have pretty much anything left and shamefully apologised to him for not gifting him anything.

Now, empowered by the newly-obtained information, I would only like to get back my money. However, although being relatively tech-savvy, I would like some guidance on how I can make a payment or take my funds back from the card, without getting on the authorities radar.

A VPN would probably be must-have, but I'm sure that there's more than meets the eye. I know that many of you won't think that's what I need to do, but I lost money I saved for over a half a year, each day not eating so I can collect them for a friend.

If someone is willing to help, it would be my pleasure to listen to all he/she has to say. To make things even clearer, I reached out to the police, however, due to being in Eastern Europe, our cyber-crime department is practically non-existent and they straight up denied to help me and that's why I'm taking this matter into my hands.",05Dec2019,1
1,"To keep it short, I've been chatting with this girl for a few months.
About a week ago or so, she told me that she gets really sad and depressed randomly and that she has really dark thoughts.

Her bday is coming up and I want to get her a little jar and write uplifting quotes and jokes on them so that when she's feeling down, she can open one &amp; smile.

Is this too soon?",05Dec2019,1
2,"I've been at my current residence for about a year now and coming to the end of a 13-month lease which I was planning on renewing. For the past several months our upstairs neighbors have been extremely loud throughout the entire day, most of the time going all the way until 10 pm-11 pm, and on several occasions all the way up until 1 am. Most of the noise seems to be caused by extremely heavy walking or jumping. For the first couple of months, we dealt with it and just hoped it would go away since I'm pretty sure they moved in after us. The noise was constant and there had been no changed so we decided to bring it up.

About 3 months ago we brought it up to the office and they said they'd talk to the neighbors and offered to move us to a different unit if it bothered us so much. At first, I was open to the idea but then realized how much work it would be to pack and move everything, changes of address, and anything else that comes along with a move, when we weren't even the ones causing the issue. Any time we would bring the issue up to the office they said they'd forward it up to the property manager and we had to follow up several times until we were actually able to schedule a sit down meeting with her. On the day that we were scheduled to meet she tried to say she was extremely busy and asked if we could reschedule which we told her was not an option.

During the meeting, she told us she had spoken to the wife a few days before and the wife apologized for the noise and said she'd look into possibly placing rugs or something on the floor to suppress the noise. We told her during those few days in between their meeting and ours there had not been any change in the noise levels. She said she'd sit down with both the wife and husband and tell them it's gotten to the point where they could possibly break their lease for not complying with the noise policy. We had already contacted the courtesy patrol several times over the past few months any time the noise got excessive after normal hours. The Property Manager said they receive a report from the courtesy patrol every morning so they were tracking our complaints as well. 

About a week later there was still no change in the noise so we follow up with the property manager again and she said she offered to move the couple to another unit and they agreed but eventually said they were staying in place. And that was it. Nothing else was being done. When my girlfriend went to the office to try to get an update on the situation she was asked whether or not we'd be renewing our lease since it was near its end. She told them she's not sure what we are doing since she has not heard anything back from the Property Manager regarding our complaints. 

She has sent the Property Manager and the Property Group e-mails asking for an update but has not received any response. I'm not too sure if the property manager is trying to retaliate but I also did notice that my lease renewal proposal had been removed from my resident portal.

Minus the noise, I do enjoy living where I'm at. I had stayed in the same complex prior to deployment and didn't have any issues with anyone. I don't want to be forced to move somewhere else because the property manager is refusing to enforce the noise policy (posted below) but it doesn't seem like they're doing anything about it and the only response I got when I contacted the property group was referring it down to the property manager. Been renting for several years and I've never had any issues like this so any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

""Any noise caused by you, your occupants and/or your guests must be kept within the confines of your apartment. In connection with
the use and occupancy of your apartment and when using any of the common areas, you must keep noise to a minimum to avoid
disturbing other Residents. You must at all times be considerate of your neighbors both adjacent to and/or downstairs from your
apartment; keep audio speakers off the floor, refrain from slamming doors or pounding on walls, floors, or ceilings, and avoid noise which can carry into your neighbor's apartment. If you are disturbed by excessive noise from an uncooperative neighbor or guest, please do not confront either your neighbor or the guest directly. Call the courtesy patrol service if applicable and/or the police department first. Be sure to notify the leasing office as soon as possible but no later than the next business day.""",05Dec2019,1
3,"So this issue has been getting worse the older i get. I've had issues where i get light headed and super do and ny eyes will start rolling back and I'll get pale and pass out. Not like head rush when you stand up like I'll be sitting or usually it happens when im standing or moving around and i get really shaky and feel freezing even if its hot out and shaky uncontrollably and shove for a couple hours but I'll be conscious and I'm able to walk and talk still. The passing out scares me because I've done it in public, been rushed to hospital before, passed out in a road before which was personally super terrifying considering it was a main road and i woke up with someone over me and ran becausw i didn't have insurance at the time for them to help me. I've seen multiple doctors and have been getting tests done for years now and they tell me everything looks completely fine they dont know what's going on with me and it's been happening more often but they still cant find an issue. It's been holding me back feom a job no one wants to hire me because I'm a risk not to mention my severe overactive blader. But i don't get it what should i do amd does anyone have any idea what this could be and why can't any hospitals find anything wrong? If ot helps the issues i have is part schizophrenia, bi polar, weakened immune system, oab , amd they think i have tachycardia but i seen a therapist (i though it was a mental relate issue the passing out) but my therapists said the dizziness maybe but passing out he doesn't know",05Dec2019,1
4,"I am currently attending high school (not what I thought it would be). 
This year was on the hardest for me. I had many problems. One of my old friends (close friends) created stories and rumors about me. She started to talk bad behind my back. Naturally I stopped talking to them. They were my friends since 6th grade. I didn’t know who to talk. I started to sit alone during lunch. I started to talk with people. I have many acquaintances now, yet I am in a state of solitude. 
I care about my friends, but recently I stopped talking with my friend. I don’t know why, but I don’t want to talk to him. I don’t really want to talk with anybody. I am not sure why. 
I want advice, because I want to understand why I have a sudden loss of interest.",05Dec2019,1
5,"I'm writing this as an update to my previous posts, as recent developments have increased my concerns about my personal safety. I'm posting this as a way to put something on record because, after contacting the cops, I'm not confident in the help they are able to provide. As I mentioned I have posted about this several times since this whole thing began, so I'm going to try and clearly label any new information. I'm also going to go over any existing info and provide whatever relevant updates I can.

For the past few weeks (5-6 weeks ago now) I had been thinking about starting a vlog and I had a few pretty good ideas (at least I thought so) brewing, so I decided I'd get a channel started to get myself motivated to shoot something. Once I created a new email ([heyitsbrianjennifer@gmail.com](mailto:heyitsbrianjennifer@gmail.com)), signed up on youtube and created the channel, though, I noticed no more than a few minutes later that a video had already been uploaded. For obvious reasons, this was already pretty weird and kind of startling. Then I noticed the video's thumbnail, and things started to get very weird, very quickly. What you're about to read still makes very little sense to me, so any help is welcome.

The person in the video's thumbnail **looks exactly like me**, except for some minor differences (no glasses, facial hair, etc.). At this point I was getting nervous, and being the anxious person that I am, about a dozen potential conclusions came into mind, but I kept reminding myself that there has to be a logical explanation. I played the video and watched as the reality of the situation set in. He looks and sounds like he could be my twin, but I have no idea who he is or how this video was uploaded to my channel. I immediately think it's some kind of elaborate prank, but I have no idea why anyone would go through the effort of doing that to me, especially to just play a prank.

But there he was. Me, but not me, talking about his 10,000 subscriber special, on a channel with no subscribers that I just created moments before. He also mentions that the video is sponsored by something called ""Meadowfield by Whitesquirrel"" and plugs a website ([https://whitesquirrelresearch.org](https://whitesquirrelresearch.org/)). Shortly after this I uploaded my own video to say on the record that whoever that guy is, isn't me. I also sent a message via this ""Whitesquirrel"" site's contact page yesterday (by the way, they appear to be some kind of independent research/technology company based on their site). Today I got a reply from someone at Whitesquirrel named Robert, basically saying that they had never seen that video, never heard of Meadowfield and have never worked with any YouTubers ""or other media entities"". He also explained away the mention of their domain name, saying that they had just launched their site recently. I wasn't very surprised that this random company wouldn't be of much help, but for some reason I find the fact that they had zero information about anything I mentioned a bit strange, or at least a bit too convenient.

One thing Robert mentioned that I found odd was that other people had also contacted them asking about Meadowfield, though this could just be other people from the forums I've been posting on, or from youtube, etc. I might still want to reply back and see if he'll tell me more about the other people who have asked about it, or at least why they asked.

\*UPDATE\*

About a week ago I received another video, uploaded to my channel from a ""security consultant"" called 'Path'. This video was basically some kind of public service announcement about an ""experiment"" that was conducted by this Path company, which, ultimately seemed to explain away any weirdness and said to disregard any strange activity that may have happened on my account. My initial reaction was honestly to make fun of this video, because at this point I felt as though whatever was happening was ultimately harmless and probably someone trying, for whatever reason, to target me for their epic troll. So I did. I uploaded a response video which was essentially, what I considered a pretty playful fuck you. The ironic thing was, at this point, after uploading the video, I may have continued digging for a while, but I feel like I would have ultimately dropped the whole thing after a week or so.

Last night I received yet another video, which is the reason I created this post. I don't want to put any of my own preconceived notions on it, but it's difficult to not feel somewhat threatened and since this all began I have not been feeling like myself. I've been feeling uneasy and paranoid. I'm just doing this so that this information exists somewhere. As I have said before, any help or insight is welcome and appreciated. Obviously, after watching the video, you may understand why I'm now more concerned than I was before. I've linked my youtube channel below, as I have previously, but I have also decided to start a twitter account which I have also linked. If you're reading this, thank you in advance for just knowing this is happening. That's the best I can ask for right now.

6,"A little backstory here: I am a full time college student with a psychiatric disability. Early on in my employement (2-4 months) I had to call in frequently because of school and my schedule not being entered correctly— I was frequently scheduled during school. My manager said this was fine, I wouldn’t be penalized for it.

Fast forward to now, about 7-8 months into my Walmart Journey. I got fired for 21 “occurrences”, mostly because my boss lied and didn’t keep track of my school absences. There were a few genuine absences (6) where I called out because of issues related to my disability. 

My psychiatric disability is OCD. I experience extreme daily anxiety, and it is completely debilitating. I have a service animal. He does not come to work with me because I work in food. Obviously, this has caused me to miss some days.

And of course, my shitty fucking boss fired me three weeks before Christmas. I am $1200 in debt on my credit card and $3000 in debt at school. Thankfully I’m still living with my parents.

My question is: what the FUCK do I do now?",05Dec2019,1

Issy and bell are really close but after me being in the friend group for about a month Alex got kicked out for some reason, Issy and bell wouldn't tell me anything and I was told if I ask Alex I would be kicked to. I wanted friends to I listened, bell would make back handed insults at me all the time and I laughed them off, at the time she (11) and I (14)  didn't really click, she would insult my likes and dislikes like she hated the fact I watch anime, and ever since I've known her if were on call and you wanna do something that she doesn't, you have to leave or do what she wants. its always about her she doesn't care what me and Issy wants, but about a year into our friendship I reached out to Alex cause I missed her and I wanted to reconnect, bell heard about this and went MENTAL! so I tried to explain that she cant control who I'm friends with and she said that Alex steal all her friends and that since I'm friends with Alex I clearly hate her, she made me choose I picked Alex. Alex told me why she got kicked from the group she was going through the same thing I was so she called Bell out and Bell kicked her, everything went find for about two months and I got added to a group on day, Issy, Alex and Bell are fighting as soon as Alex adds me Bell leaves. Bell doesn't want me there cause "" I don't need to be involved"" even tho Bell was talking shit about me to Issy and Alex. we all made up but Me and Alex told Bell she cant make me not be friends with Alex. now in the present Bell has gotten to much worst she tried to guilt you into doing what ever she wants. she insults my chest size daily (I have a small chest) and she over all justs emotionally exhausts me, should i try and help her to see the wrongs in her ways or just drop her as a friend?

For some background,  I had some issues with my parents in high school (I'm now a college sophomore), but that was really more of my fault, and they were very patient with me. And my relationship with my dad is great 99.9% of the time. We go shopping together, cook, etc. and we're very affectionate. It's just that once in a while, he gets so angry that I feel like he's a totally different person. 

We haven't talked about it &amp; I'm not sure it would be productive even if I tried. He usually just pretends it doesn't happen afterward, or asks to watch Tv together, or something, and I go with it. Sometimes I feel like I just imagined the incidents, since he's so chill the rest of the time. I thought it might be because of alcohol, but he drinks every day and doesn't blow his shit then.

18,"Hello Reddit, chronic failure here [20M, USA]

When I was 18 I went to college for accounting and dropped out before the semester was over because I hated it. I then tried to join the military and after a long wait and a lot of hoops to jump through I found out I wasn't eligible. 

Now, I'm pursuing an education in aviation, that I'm really starting to struggle with. The practical side isn't too difficult, but the theoretical side feels impossible to me. I struggle so much with studying. I studied for my private pilot ground test for 2 weeks and only pulled off an 80.

I feel like I'm at a dead end. I love flying, but I feel like I don't have the concentration to finish even my first license because of all the studying and theory I would need to learn. I've already put thousands of dollars into it.

I've become several depressed because I feel like I've backed myself into a corner. Because of the FAA, I can't get any sort of medication for depression or concentration issues. If I quit with aviation now, I miss out on one of my dream jobs. And now I'm already 3 years out of high school with nothing to show for it except a year of retail experience and a few months working at a restaurant.

It feels like it's too late for me to go back to college. By the time I'd graduate (assuming 4 years) I'd be nearly 25. I just want a career that makes a reasonable amount of money (40k+ after a few years) that I can work in while taking prescription medicines that I need. I also don't think I can stand a super long education because I far prefer working over schooling. Manual labor blue collar jobs don't seem to be the best fit either. I just feel lost and I'm at my wit's end.

I should draw a whole picture to present how annoying is that situation. 
3 years ago I started job in city A, but after 2 weeks they offer my relocation to headquarters in region B (about 200 km from city A), raise and money for the apartment so I move with my new GF. After 2 years, happy living there we got married, and decide that next year we're coming back to city A. And after a year we moved. I started new job in a field I always was interested in buuuut after one week my project stopped and they offered me another one... In region B. It was told that it will last only 2 month, maybe 3, till Christmas but not longer, again some more money and apartment. I had no choice in fact, was furious but money is money and it is only 2-3 months. So here I am, 2 month later and my boss just told me that they need me till end of January, maybe longer, here. I was shocked and said that we should talk about it tomorrow because and don't know what to say. The worst part is I have nothing to do here most of the time. I can make all my tasks in 2 hours and then just wandering on my container-office. 
2 month of weekend visits and phone with my wife, lonely in apartment far in the suburbs, my depression coming back, can't sleep again. Legally I'm obliged to stay till end of January can't quit my job, but I'm thinking about dropping it right away in rough way.

Moving onto my current situation, I ghosted someone I just met fairly recently but we got along great. This isn’t the first time i’ve done this to this person and I feel really bad.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm not in school right now because me and my parents spent all these past months looking for schools for me. I found out I have APD so I cant attend normal schools anymore

&amp;#x200B;

My mom found some, and I have decided which school I want to go. The question is: Should I start or wait?

&amp;#x200B;

On Nov-Dec its usually exam month. Should I just start next year?

&amp;#x200B;

And even next year, from my experience; school is supposed to be finished with the final exams which is on June. So if I attend next year, I will have to attend the final exams too which contains materials for students that have learned from the past year? Or am I mistaken?

32,"So me and this girl in sophomore and junior year (this year) had a pretty great relationship, it lasted about 5 and a half months and it was only a couple days before our 6-month ann., Neither of us cheated or did anything to wrong the other, we just kinda... Fell out you know? Anyway for a while we both refused contact with each other for about a month and a half, then we started talking again and we both kinda agreed to be friends. Fast forward another month and she's one of my good friends and we sit together during lunch with our mutual friends (not best friends cuz I think it'd be too much). So we only really talk either in-school or over text, but never outside of school face-to-face. 

And I know this sounds a little silly/childish but I wanna play Minecraft or some other Xbox game with her but I don't wanna seem awkward? Maybe awkward isn't the best term but you know what I mean.

I tell her she is the best or she is killing it, or she looks amazing. she said it's fake flattery. I told it's not fake and I stop telling her things like that. we still continue to message each other. recently she tells me everything I tell her are lies. I am always honest with her and I keep it 100% but she say its lies. so I was upset about it and I said I am done with you. she said that hurts and I told her you hurt me multiple times but I am still talking to you. she said we should not message each other since she is saying hurtful things and she said I'm sorry if I hurt you. that was the last message and we never speak to each other since. going on 2 weeks now.

I am 85% sure she does not have the same feelings for me. I am trying to get over her but I am losing this battle with my feelings. I do not want to make things awkward between us by telling her how I feel. I just want this feelings to go away. random hookups are not helping, it's just making it worse.

just to let you how deep these feelings are: 
I HATE people who are stubborn, want things there way, and demanding. she is all of this and I LOVE it about her. i love everything about her. from her voice, to her laugh, to her smile. I can easily get lost in her eyes because it's so beautiful. I love the way she ties her hair up and let it down. it drives me crazy. she is perfect in every way. I love her imperfections and even on her worst days she looks amazing. I dont even want to have sex with her. I just want to hold her in my arms and never let her go. her happiness is truly my happiness. I dont mind if I cannot be with her. if she finds someone who loves her like I do, I am perfectly fine with it because I know she will be happy. 

I just want these feelings to go away. if you are a female, please let me know what I should do. if you are a male who went through something like this. please let me know how you over came it",05Dec2019,1

I work full time &amp; don't have my parents to rely on for money. I was in a car accident a few months ago which put me out of a car for a little while. In a nutshell: this semester was tough outside of school &amp; I wasn't just blowing off her class.

I responded to her email asking if there was anything I could do. 
She is the kind of professor who puts ego before the actual learning of her students. 

Would I be able to dispute this with the department? I'm very non confrontational and dread this becoming a whole ordeal to where she would, god forbid, have to argue against me or something.

46,"my dad has been an alcoholic since i was born 17 years ago. he is very self serving and has never developed an emotional connection with his family- my mother, my brother and i. he steals my money and my credit cards for alcohol, he gets verbally abusive with my mother and has caused her a lot of emotionally and financial grief, and he isn’t exactly a positive role model to my younger brother. i rarely speak to him unless i need a ride to work. it hurts that our relationship has never developed past that point. 

i want to be angry at him and the pain he has caused but instead i feel terribly depressed about the state of his life. his father abandoned him as a child, he grew up in russia at a very difficult time. he hasn’t been in touch with his family members for years. he doesn’t speak to anyone other than the people he paints houses for once in a while, he is barely appreciated in this household, with reason. 

i can’t imagine if i were in his place, sulking and waiting for the next sip. i can’t imagine having no one to talk to. it must be so frustrating for him. maybe it’s stupid for me to feel this way. maybe i am being emotionally manipulated by him. maybe he does in fact have no remorse or care for his universal standing. maybe he wants to be left alone.

48,"Before any of this started, I was a nearly straight A student.

In 9th grade, (a year ago), I started to lose motivation in school. I wasn't able to focus in class, but I was good at what I did and I managed to still do well on tests. My test grades were the only reason I passed 9th grade that year. Things have only gotten worse since then.

Now, it's virtually impossible for me to focus at school. I can do some work at home, but I still am very easily distracted. I went to the doctor, and they told me that I was physically healthy. They tested me for ADHD and a few other conditions, and I didn't have any of those either. I started seeing a counselor for unrelated reasons, and that counselor told me I should get tested again for ADHD. The second time, they told me I showed some symptoms of ADHD, but I was still able to focus on some things, so I didn't have it. 

Since then, everything has only gotten worse. I can't focus in conversation at all. The slightest auditory or visual distraction will ruin my focus, and my grades are terrible. I am always fidgeting, to the point where it's annoying some of my friends. Over the year that this started, I've developed tics, but they're not that noticeable. However, when people do comment on it it's kind of embarrassing.  If somebody explains something to me in a verbal format, I get distracted too easily, and I'll never be able to understand what they said unless I have a lot of time to absorb it, and they're willing to repeat themselves for me. I'm very quick to daydream in class, and no matter what I do to remove distractions, (put my phone out of reach, get rid of my pencil so I don't doodle, etc.) I still manage to never focus in class for longer than a minute. I've tried many times to focus as hard as I can, but that causes me to focus on focusing, which causes me to lose focus. I can't sit in one place for very long, especially if that area has a lot of distractions. I can't sit through movies or long videos (10 minutes or longer). I constantly forget what I'm doing unless I have a todo list of some sort, so I can stay on track. I get bored of conversation topics faster than others, I change conversation topics constantly, and I'll sometimes speak at a much faster rate than other people. My room is an absolute mess, and at this point I don't know what to do with myself.

Because of my complete lack of work in school, I've taken up learning independently online, which has been a lot easier on me. I use Google Calendar to keep track of when I'm supposed to be doing what, and I also record how much work I do so I can refer back to it. Because I'm still able to learn things, I don't think the issue is that I'm stupid.

I do just fine socially at school, and I'm typically an outgoing person. This is, when I'm not in a state of being absolutely consumed by a topic. When I'm in this state, I usually have some kind of personal project I'm working on. I'll work on it for hours, and it will interfere with my basic needs, like eating and sleeping, and I'm just too far into what I'm doing. I'll work for 7 or 8, or more hours straight. My conversations will be purely about things related to what I'm working on. It'll be all I think about. This has never lasted more than a week, and often will only last a few days, if that. I think this is the main reason it's suspected I don't have ADHD.

My main problem is that everyone keeps telling me that this is normal, and I just need to try harder. I've been trying as hard as I can and it's caused me to become extremely frustrated with myself. When I say I'm trying as hard as I can, I'm told I still need to try harder. That I need to learn to control it. I'm trying as hard as I can to control it but I just can't. 

I have high hopes for myself, and I don't want this to ruin it. I got a new counselor and she told me I could get tested for ADHD again, but I don't think it's going to do much. I really really just want a word for what I'm going through, so I can research it, and understand what I'm going through so I can regulate it. I don't need to be diagnosed with any kind of condition, I just want to be able to control myself. I want a word for what this is so I can explain myself to others.",05Dec2019,1

50,"For context, I'm 30, female, have severe faceblindness and mild-to-moderate autism, live with my parents in the middle of suburbia in SoCal with no public transport options, and can't drive (and currently lack sane relatives or friends who could teach me).  I have never received government benefits due to my parents political beliefs (they're extremely right wing to the point where I get screamed at for hours if I suggest going temporarily on Medi-Cal until I can pay for my own health insurance so my dad doesn't have to continue to pay for my health insurance through his work), but disability benefits are iffy if you don't have severe autism so it wouldn't be worth pursuing. 

So the situation I've suddenly found myself in is my mom's mental health has drastically declined to the point where she is convinced I am ""psychotic"" despite multiple doctors telling her that I am not psychotic in the slightest and what she thinks is psychosis is actually me setting age-appropriate boundaries over how she interacts with me. She's a victim of severe child abuse and also a brain injury patient, but she has been threatening to kick me out at least weekly for months now, which has led to an increase in stress for everyone. She also has a floppy heart valve and constantly tells me that if I don't take antipsychotics she will die from the stress of being my caregiver for the rest of my life. Nevermind that both my previous and current psychiatrists have repeatedly told her that I do not need antipsychotic medication.  I've been trying to market my art and move it from a side hustle to full-time job...and I could do that if I wasn't under so much stress living with my insane mother. I do digital art mostly and have sold it, I just need to spend a lot more time marketing it and thats really hard to do when my mother is screaming ""I REALLY want to throw stuff at you but I'm not going to because I know you're sick and I'm really talking to a sickness not my daughter"" and worrying about what I'm going to do if she does throw something at me. 

Legally my parents need to give me 60 days from the date they get an eviction order, once they do that I can sell all my non-essential belongings, contact neighbors and extended family, apply for Medi-Cal and Food Stamps, etc without fear of being kicked out because they will have already started the process. 

Due to not having any debt, not having a car, not having kids, and not being chronically ill and requiring expensive meds, the minimum I need to make per month to move out with roommates and survive on my own is $800.

I’m finding things like unnecessary comments that could’ve been solved with some extra thought incredibly annoying. I can tell I’m being an asshole but certain situations are just enraging. 

An example; I was sat watching Netflix using a NowTV remote. We also can get it on Virgin, which requires a different remote. The virgin remote is 3x the size of the NowTV remote and they are very different in appearance. My friend sat with me on the sofa and I went to go upstairs. The remote for the Television, Audio System and Virgin were all on a table across the room. My spot solely had the NowTV remote in. As I’m getting up he goes “well what’ve you been watching Netflix on, Virgin or NowTV?”, this was such a small comment and honestly shouldn’t of even made me the tiniest bit angry but I just blew up “it’s very fucking obvious it’s on NowTV by the fact that the only remote next to me that I also used to pause it was the NowTV remote.”, again I’m aware I’m being an asshole I’m just trying to show you how bad it’s getting. He replies “yeah okay that could’ve been the Virgin remote” so I blew up again saying “maybe if you paid more than the minimal attention you do to life you’d realise that the Virgin remote is on the other side of the room and wasn’t being used”. 

Do you see how silly this argument is? Typing it back is almost making me chuckle. But these little interactions keep happening and it honestly feels like it’s getting worse. I’m just looking for general irritability handling or maybe other advice I’ve just not thought of. Thanks.",05Dec2019,1

61,"TLDR: Do I transfer out of my crappy University and stay with everyone I know or go to a top school for my major where I'll be alone.

Hello world, 
This is my first Reddit post after years of learning so sorry if my formatting is awful.

I have been in college for a very long time. (5 years) This is due to my parents starting me in Dual Credit classes in highschool. I got my associates degree at my local community college when I turned 18 and then stayed another year to get my hard math and science classes done. I am now 20 and a ""Junior"" in college I have all my classes done except for my core classes for my major. I've done all my science, math, history English, government etc... and I'm left with all computer and technology classes 

I had a hard time transferring and getting accepted to University because I had too many class credits. Even though my GPA was / 3.6 most universities didnt want someone with tons of credits. My SO is in a similar situation. But we finally found a school and decided to go together.

The university I'm in is mostly criminal justice majors and the school puts all of their resources into them. While my major (computer science) has the worst buildings teachers and resources. 

I had an unfortunate situation both semesters this year of dumb advisors registering me for classes I didn't need and bureaucracy bull shit and I didn't get to take any classes that helped me get closer to finishing my degree.

I took a forced break this semester because my school had dropped me from all my classes due to a computer error. And I couldn't register for any more on my degree plan because they were all full. But fortunately I found a IT internship instead.

So I decided to apply to other schools.
I applied to several top universities for computer science just to see if I could go anywhere else besides this hell of a school. To my surprise I got into one. As soon as I got the letter I was shocked and so happy.

But the longer I thought about this the less sure I was about going. I have bad anxiety and I would have to leave my friends and my SO of 6 years. I would have to live in the middle of one of the major US cities all by myself. I know this school would be amazing for me but I'm not sure if I can go through with it. 

I just want to finish college and be done with it. Any advice would be amazing.",05Dec2019,1

I wasn't concerned at first but then I saw that they said to get more time I would have to write in notepad 48 hours. That made me scared because I thought how would they know I said that if they had no access. Please help.",05Dec2019,1
64,"I really want to keep up my working out habits, but sometimes I deliberately stop working out just to let my skin clear up. How would I go about by still being able to workout, but also have clear skin?  Also why is this the case? Do I have bad sweat or something?",05Dec2019,1

 he responded saying, i said i would kill your cats and steal from you. I asked him why he would say something like that he said i told you im an asshole.

Ive never known for him to act on impulses like that nor has he directed them at me before. However i do find it concerning after everything i went through with my family. He is loveable so i am reluctant to call it quits.",05Dec2019,1

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",05Dec2019,1
67,"The guy that lives in the room next to me is the loudest person I have ever met. He is on the phone basically the entire time he is home - yelling, screaming, cackling. I have only been living here for three months and I am steadily losing my mind. My mental health is in a terrible condition due to my constant state of aggravation. I've asked him to reduce the noise, take his calls elsewhere, etc, and he will say ""yeah sure no problem"" but then won't actually change his ways. He simply cannot NOT be talking to someone for more than ten minutes.

What else can I do besides just asking him to keep it down again and again?",05Dec2019,1
68,I can’t take another day seeing them together. I just went through our texts from 2 summers ago and she was definitely into me but I was way to focused on my business and didn’t date her when she had the chance. I can no longer take her to prom or homecoming. All those memories don’t exist and I wish they did. Now she continues to go on without me even thought he’s a junior in high school and she’s a freshman in college. I swear when I get my hands on what I need I’m done with this life. I hope they break up.,05Dec2019,1
69,"So my ex broke up with me about a month ago. I was pretty heartbroken, as we were dating for over 2 years. I tried to reach out to her a few time, to try and work things out, and if not, just try and be friends. After a few attempts it was obvious that she didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. I’ve been moving on slowly, knowing she’s not thinking about me.

However, the other day she posted a YOLO thing on her snap story.

(For those who don’t know, YOLO is an anonymous way to send a message to someone. People often post on their snap stories, then repost the messages with their reply to them, but never knowing who sent the original message)

I didn’t reply to her thing, even though I wanted to say someone to her anonymously.

At school, me and my buds were talking about it, and they said they didn’t see her post that. After checking on over 10 people’s phone, no one could see her story.

Besides me and one other person, the girl that has been helping me through my breakup.

So, she tried to bait me and my friend to send her an “anonymous” message, but she’d know it was one of the two of us.



So, my question is what should I do? Should I confront her about it? If so, over text, call, or in person?
Or should I leave it alone, and just move on.

I guess I’m curious what she was trying to gain from it, because I thought she didn’t want anything to do with me and had forgotten about me.

Sorry about school drama... but I am curious of others opinions.

*Hello, to whoever gets to read this. I’d like to place a disclaimer that none of these transcripts are my own, and they belong to my late roommate Edward. I figured he would like this attention, and decided to publicize the transcripts of his last video blogs taken before his body was found. Weston, the last person to see Edward, was a video editor and frequently worked with him to make internet videos so they could go “viral”. Hope it was worth it.*

December 7, 2009

Edward: Today is Monday, 8am, and we’ve arrived at Laney’s. Weston is here with me

\[pans to Weston\]

Edward: And we’re gonna explore this infamous carnival, and hopefully not die in the end. 

Weston: Man, I gotta admit, this place is starting to creep me out. Do you even know what time it is? Do you even care or do you just wanna explore some fake tourist trap?

Edward: Relax, Jesus Christ. It’s not fake and you know it - some little kids got on the water ride and never came back. Man, not even security cameras see them leaving the ride, only entering. You wanna tell me that’s fake?

\[Weston sighs. Edward places the camera back - the sky is pure white. He doesn’t seem to notice, as he checks his watch\]

Edward: It’s 12:30.

Weston: Stop \[redacted\] with me, we’ve been here for thirty minutes.

Edward: Jesus man, what’s your problem? Do you want me to call the watch company and file a formal complaint? Chill.

\[End of Recording One\]

Weston: Hey, I’m sorry for pulling that shit. I don’t know what got into m-

\[Screams of joy can be heard in the background\]

Edward: Can you hear that? The rides don’t work, is somebody messing with us? Weston are you pulling this?

Weston: No dumbass, it’s probably coming from outside the park.

\[Edward pans camera to a roller coaster dropping from the peak\]

Edward: No that’s way too many voices, listen.

\[Screams of joy gradually become agonizing shrieks. Edward takes camera. Next shot are his feet, running away from something\]

Edward: Guys, something insane’s happening. I bet it’s something evil, maybe the souls of the children who died here?  
Weston: Are you slow? Stop lying to your viewers, you don’t even make money off of YouTube.

Edward: I hope you know if some demon chick demands a sacrifice, I’m offering y--

December 8, 2009 - the time is unknown, but takes place after recording two.

\[Cut off - pitch black. Next shot is of Edward standing next to a broken down android as Weston can be heard from inside the camera\]

Edward, jokingly: Dude get my face in the shot. Isn’t she kinda hot?

\[Weston nods camera up and down as to say yes\]

Edward: She smells awful but it’s fine. Should we rename this video ‘Hottie found in Laney’s?’

Weston: Do you hear that?

Edward: Hear what? It’s silent.

Weston: Exactly, I told you the screams were from outside the park.

Edward: What about the rollar coaster? 

Weston: What are you talking about? They were all off.

Edward: Nevermind.

Edward: Wait, get a shot of me putting my arm around her!

\[The android has ripped apart clothes and a Laney’s employee badge\]

Weston: Hey I don’t think you should touch that.

\[Edward touches it anyway. The ‘girl’ falls in front of Edward. Her head rolls off to Weston.\]

Edward, screaming: Oh \[redacted\] I told you this is the real deal! Quick, point the camera at her! Do you know how famous we’ll become? We’ll expose this amusement park and make millions. I can sue for emotional trauma!

Weston: That’s what you’re worried about? You’re way too calm for this to be real. What, did you come here Sunday and place this doll here?

\[Weston points camera at android/corpse. Maggots crawl out from her ears. End of Recording Three\]

December 9, 2009

\[Edward points camera to himself. He’s in a blue portapotty\]

Edward: I left Weston, or more like Weston left me. He said he’s sick of being here and took the first memory card - so far, I’m traumatized. That dead body was in the shed. The shed! I made some stupid comment about profiting off it, which to be fair, isn’t that bad of a response. I like to look at the silver lining of things, alright guys?

Edward: I have to go get him before he screws up our whole plan. I didn’t drive here all the way for nothing. I came here for footage and I’m getting it. 

\[Edward places camera facing up in the portapotty, and steps outside\]

Edward from a distance: You’re kidding me.

\[Edward takes camera and spins it around the area - the lights of all the rides are going off, the rollar coasters are sped up, and the sky is still white\] 

Edward, yelling over the noise: It’s so loud my ears are gonna pop off. I have to call Weston, if this happens to him he’ll freak out.

\[Edward pulls out his flip phone and dials a number\]

Edward: Hello, Wes? \[static, continuing for eight minutes\]

76,"Background: I posted a thread in the social anxiety subreddit, because I didn't know any other better place to put it (sorry I was a little bit new to reddit). But for those of yall who dont have time or didn't read:

I basically sucked at talking to people, I realized i got really nervous around people and straight up didn't know how to uphold a basic conversation with people around me. As a high schooler I'm trying to make the most out of socializing in order to develop/use in life.

Update is here:

Great News - I'm actually talking to people, however still extremely uncomfortable. I'm able to hold up small talk and don't always intimidate people with my extreme awkwardness. I even gained my first friend (although he just thinks of me as an strong acquaintance.. His words!). I still sit by myself at lunch and in class, but I've noticed that a couple of new people try to start conversations with me (only to be disappointed ofc).

I still stumble on my words a lot, but have gained some confidence. I still see my social skills as bare and borderline unacceptable, but at least I can make it through the day with some decent practice. I still have trouble intiating with people that seem interesting to me, but I figured out if I throw myself out into conversations, its either swim or drown.

Anyways, I'm still seeking out some advise on the behalf of my lack of continuing and carrying out a good conversation. I believe I struggle due to some lack of confidence and the feeling of not really knowing what to say. I also can come off as too nice, which I notice is a turn off, especially for girls. Another thing is, I want to be abke to bring up my friendship level with some of the people I know, but have no idea how to start.

Honestly, thanks for sticking around or reading, even if you don't reply, I just hope yall learn that it's possible, I had no idea I would be making this much progress so fast.",05Dec2019,1

81,"I’m 18 and in high school. One of my friends hangs out with this scrawny kid. He’s my age and a bit of an asshole, and that’s where I thought it ended. I don’t like him a whole lot so I usually try to avoid him. 

He’s a creepy guy. He tries to fight people over the smallest things, and his parents are very well off and pretty much have the county government and police in their pocket. The guy got off a drunk driving arrest and several car accidents where he was most likely high or drunk with a slap on the wrist.

Today I was talking to my friend and this kid is telling the world about all the different kinds of guns he’s buying. Submachine guns, assault rifles, the works. One of my other friends has a little bit of knowledge about guns and he knows that some of those were most likely smuggled or illegally imported. The creepy guy says its fine because he’s buying them from the dark web.

I don’t believe him, but sure enough he’s showing me a website selling assault rifles (he’s telling me that the vendor doesn’t need a permit to sell and he doesn’t need a permit to buy). Thoroughly creeped, he tells me the process of how he finds the websites and that he’s actually bought from them before. I wouldn’t care much usually but if any guy is going to wind up killing someone it’s this guy. 

We stop talking and a few minutes go by and he starts bragging about how much child porn he can find. He shows everyone pictures (I ask not to see it and he’s fine with that). Obviously this is very illegal and pretty alarming. 

I guess what I’m wondering is if I should do anything about it? If he finds out I did I’m probably going to be dragged through the coals by his parents and/or shot by him. Who would I even talk to about this? And how do I keep myself anonymous?",05Dec2019,1

I’m not going to say her name because I don’t wanna risk it, but I’ve known her since elementary school. Now I just started to have a liking towards her in a “like like” kind of way, and there are multiple reasons why that happened. One, there was a girl who was talking about how I should have never made varsity team, cuz I did and ima sophomore, and the girl I like stood up for me basically. She was telling me this when we were walking together before our practice. She also told me that I deserve my spot and that I’m such a great player and a great person, my family are great people and what not. Now I know she said this in a friendly way. She’s also definitely straight. But when she was telling me this I knew then and there that I liked her. I also have a class with her that is really fun because her and I make it fun. We sit next to each other also so that makes it better. But I know that I can’t like her. She doesn’t like me like that because she doesn’t like girls in that way. And liking her feels so wrong and I feel like a clown for having feelings. I just feel stupid and I don’t know what to do. I’m obviously not gonna tell her how I feel because I’ve learned from my past, or look at my post from the past when I did tell this girl I liked her and things went down hill so I’m not gonna say anything. I also don’t wanna ruin the good friendship we have and make things awkward even tho she’s not the type of person to make things awkward if I did tell her.

85,"So I’m a freshman in high school. My school has block scheduling, so we only have four classes at a time, but they’re all 90 minutes long. We have four the first half of the year and then completely change for the other half. It sucks. Anyways, my classes right are gym, science, history, and English, in that order. I have all A’s in all classes except history. I have a D. It is an honors class, along with my English class, but it’s still something that I’m capable of, I thought.  My science and gym classes are the lower classes, as I’m not good at either. Gym isn’t a problem. I don’t like it, but there’s no triggers or anything. Science class is a different story. I’ve always had problems with the same group of people. I have selective mutism, so I generally don’t talk if not required. I have only five students that I’ll talk to, and I’m honestly fine with that. We’re all really close. I is quiet like me, L and K are loud and crazy, and A and C are both kinda in the middle and super sweet. Anyways, science. Nobody I talk to is in there. My friends are all higher classes. There’s a group of about five people in there that absolutely despise me. I guess they see me as an easy target or whatever, I don’t know. They’ve always been mean to me, but this year it’s gotten worse. They worked together to spread a rumour that I threatened to shoot up the school. I wouldn’t even think of ever doing that, and they’ve literally never heard me speak a word, so how would I even say that? Anyways, that’s definitely the worst, the school resource officer escorted me out of the school in front of everyone, so that was humiliating. So obviously I’m shaken up every day after that class. When I go to history, I cannot function. I have second lunch, so I go to history for a half hour, go to lunch, and then back to history for another hour, lunch is almost as bad as science. I sit with the people I mentioned that I talk to, and K has a “friend” (we all know they like each other) named Z. Z is an asshole, to put it simply. I’ve written about him on here before. He tells me, in front of my friends, that I’m a waste of air, I should give up, and makes fun of my weight. Nobody stands up for me. Today, he started and it was getting out of hand, so I got up and I left. I locked myself in a bathroom stall for the rest of lunch. A and C are the only ones who came in after me. They waited the entire lunch and brought their lunches to eat in the bathroom, because that’s how big of hearts they have. I did come out and just sat with them in silence, right in the corner of the bathroom. People gave us looks, eating our lunch on the bathroom floor, but it was better than sitting with Z. So I’m shaken up after lunch as well, and he gives me frequent panic attacks, and I’m falling behind. I cannot concentrate on my teacher with all of this on my mind. My parents are demanding answers, but I don’t want them to worry. My mom’s mom and my dad’s mom both died recently, so it’s hard for them. Please help. I don’t know what to do.",05Dec2019,1

So I dropped out of boardingschool in Germany and left with a degree that enables me to study at some specific colleges, but not all of them. I dropped out of boardingschool because I couldn't stand the pressure there, it was hell, I was bullied, the caretakers there pushed me with my grades to the point where I learned from 6am to 10pm, I was spiraling down and called it a year before my  final degree. from their on I had to do ''community service'' for a year to validate my degree basically, I worked as sort of a small paramedic, I transported patients and assisted where I could, was great, wanted to pursue a career in this path or as a mechanic. Then, about 9 months into the service I got runover by a car, I suffered some pretty bad injuries, my arm was blown to pieces had some fractures in my upper leg, nerves ripped, concussion, broken rips, you get the idea, it was a miracle that I didn't broke my spine. The surgeon who first tried to patch me together quit mid op because he couldn't do it, they called in an expert who finished the job.   
From then on I had to go to rehab, my left arm was just one big lump at this point that hurt like hell, the   physiotherapists  did an amazing job but confronted me pretty soon that I won't be able to get back into the field, or any other physical work, and they couldn't tell me if and when the pain from the ruptured nervers will go away.   
I spend two years in rehab and trying to get myself together and getting frustrated and more and more depressed.  
At some point the insurance basically told me there is no point in keeping on doing that, I am as good as I would ever be.   
I enrolled in college and went off, after being told by the doctores my arm is basically messed up to the point where It would break if I regulary lift something more than 20 KG.   
When studying my family became Ill, my grandpa developed cancer, my grandma too, my mom developed throat cancer (Not deadly, but it was tough for a few months) and my dad dementia. I made the call and moved back into my hometown to support my mom and because I realized that this thing wasn't going to work out.  
My mom and grandparents pushed me to enroll into architecture and I did. Iwas always a person that wasn't really good at making decisions; I always tried to live up to my parents standards and do what expected.    
My dad got worse to the point where he forgets that I am living here, and my grandparents need intensive care now.  
My depression is getting worse and worse, I am just doing whats expected from me,  I hate every second of college, and I don't know how to move forward, I need to get a degree at some point, I understad that.   
I try my hardest to be decent a college, but I can't do it, I  was never the type of learning, I was the guy that had to work hands on, and that's what I enjoy. I always was a repair and diy type of guy. I always worked on my car or on something else, and I can't do that now. I feel like I hit the ground running before it even started, I am a disabled guy, with no perspective of what to do and where to go.   
Should I just end college and move maybe to something more my type? That feels like dissapointing my family again, and maybe even upsetting them to the point where they cut contact.   
I am crying myself to sleep every night, and having breakdowns when I close the door to my flat behind me.   
I have no plan b, nowhere to go, I am just stuck.   
And I don't know how to break this cycle of self pitty, depression, me failing college etc.   


Have you any advice for me? or some Ideas on how to fix it?   
I am in a pretty dark place now and I don't know how to break it.",05Dec2019,1
87,"I was born into a fairly poor family, we always had food and a roof over our heads but most of the things we had were second hand. I developed a stutter at a young age but in primary school I was a fairly normal kid. I was friends with some of the “cool” kids, and some of the “losers”. I was pretty in the middle. When I went to secondary school, I made new friends who convinced me they were good friends, as they kept me around but bullied me for a year. I remember them locking me out of my house and taking photos of me crying with my phone, forcing me to send them nudes which they spread around, etc. I was 13, I was going out with my dream girl, and they said that they’d make her leave me. I don’t know what they said, but she left and it broke my heart. I realized that I’d rather have no friends. Fortunately, I found new friends, and I wanted to get into filmmaking so at 14 I spent the summer playing guitar on the street everyday until I made £300 for a DSLR. My stutter was much worse at this point, but I was optimistic. My siblings had left home, and when I was with them and my parents I was treated as the inferior child. It felt like no one cared about me as much as them. I couldn’t talk to girls the same way I could as I felt that any girl would judge and hate me because of how my ex and my old friends did. Me and my friends started smoking weed, as everyone does here. I decided that I wanted to film music videos, and even though I was very socially anxious i started reaching out to local rappers and asking if I could film their videos for free. I was only 15 and still had that same camera, so these were low budget. I reached out to a gang that sold most of the drugs around my city, as they make rap music, and I started working with them and charging them money. I felt important, but my friends were losing their virginities while I still hadn’t kissed a girl since I was 13. I was diagnosed with depression just before i turned 16, and I didn’t do any revision for my GCSE exams. Both my parents gave me a lot of shit, and I hated myself for it. I just couldn’t get myself to engage. when my small group of 3 friends starting branching out and meeting new people. I was excited, as I felt cooler as we were now friends with girls and I thought I might get a girlfriend soon who could help me mentally.

One year on, I am known by most people in my city, people stop me for photos and my Instagram is doing very well. I am known for being a key figure in the brighton music scene. My friend group has grown to about 20 people, and every day we smoke weed. I still have no girlfriend, as every girl I talk to eventually decides that I’m not right for them. I dropped out of college to shoot videos full time, but unfortunately I have to pay £80 a week to my mum for food and bills. I am angry and depressed all the time. I live at my friends houses, and when I rarely go home I argue with my mum. Last night she said “why can’t you be nice” to me, and get she doesn’t know why I hate myself. I haven’t told her any of what happened to me as I don’t want to hurt her.

88,"I had a very aggressive door dasher deliver me food to my apartment today. They were cussing me out because they couldn't find the right door and getting overly angry with me. 

I told them multiple times that it was okay and they could just cancel the order but they refused and said they drove all this way and wasted gas already looking for me that they wouldn't. 

Eventually, they found my door and again we're aggressive, almost to the point of threating, about how it was bullshit I couldn't meet them and how long it took to find the place. 

I am now fearful that they now have my address and will come back or stalk my location to seek some sort of revenge because of this. 

I only say this because they kept exclaiming where they were from and how they were ""hood"". 

I don't want to report them to door dash because they will know it's me and have even more reason to seek vengeance. 

I am just not sure what to do in this situation besides lock my doors and hope they aren't outside or in the parking lot waiting for me.

89,"so this new guy started working with the company I work for a little over a month ago. This guy has asked me out for drinks after work more times than i can count, but I always make up excuses as to why I can’t go hoping he would take a hint after a while. However, I have failed because he came in my office today asking when I could get drinks this week. After he kept insisting, I said maybe we could do lunch since it’s more appropriate (also because I have no desire to go get drinks with him because I’m afraid he will think I’m into him. Not to mention I work 45 minutes from home and I honestly don’t know the guy outside of work). He told me that he has a girlfriend, but its an open relationship. On the other hand, I am in a serious relationship and if the roles were reversed, I would not want my boyfriend going out for drinks with a co worker (disclaimer: we are happy with the boundaries/respect we have within our relationship)

anyways, as you could imagine, I have felt total betrayal from my
siblings and parents..

now my brother and I are in our late 20's, and we're more alike at heart than anyone else in the family..

yet he's been so distant with me as far as building trust and me feeling acceptance from him...

the other day i was in tears and I asked him to explain how he supports who I am and wants me to be who I am etc.. and he said nothing..

he's always so emotionless and never really gets personal with me... we've been distant for years and he has said how I'm the most important person in his life, but he just doesn't go to the personal lengths to illustrate trust, respect, acceptance etc that I would if he were in my shoes..

he cares, he's just not personal at all with me and hasn't delved deep into talking about my values in relation to how i was betrayed...

I myself have never drank or done drugs (I'm in college too).  My family has a history of alcoholism, although neither of my parents are, and my brother has admitted that he believes he's an alcoholic.  From a young age I was literally taught that drugs and alcohol are the devil... you could imagine my shock when I finally learned in high school that many people smoke weed.  

Over time my thoughts on it have loosened up, although I don't do it myself.  I don't think poorly on alcohol and I think weed should be legalized.  My main problem is when it comes to me or my (20F) girlfriend.  We've been dating for two years and I was pretty open about how I felt on the subject and she, much to my pleasure, agreed with me... although it seems now that she might've been saying that just to agree with me.  

She is by no means an alcoholic, she hardly drinks, I've never been around her when she does, and I don't know of her ever being truly drunk.  However, on the handful of occasions that she texts me or sends a picture showing that she's drinking or that she's ""tipsy"", I literally get sick to my stomach.  I try to play it as cool as I can in my response, but in real life I believe I'm having close to a panic attack.  Even thinking back now I feel sick.

When I talk about features, in this case, I'm referring to physical traits. However, I notice that my ""type"" is also very rare, so the chance of actually getting in a relationship with them is unlikely. I understand that I should give other people a chance, and if I was asked out, I would consider it regardless of his appearance. Still, I cannot help to feel a bit of disappointment knowing that I'll probably never get with my type, and that I may have to settle.

So my question is, how can I accept the fact that I'll never get with my type? How can I ignore this so it doesn't affect my future relationships? I feel really bad about this and I feel like I'm being overly particular.",05Dec2019,1

103,"My boyfriend and his sister are pretty close I guess. Well she feels more close than him, like she’s basically obsessed. We’ve been dating for three years, when we first started dating we were at his sisters friends house, drinking. She was getting hot and asked her brother, my boyfriend, if he would mind if she took her shirt off. That was the first red flag, I was shocked and weirded out, I would never imagine taking my shirt off infront of my brother. She’s also usually pretty touchy with him and everytime I’m around she always has to make it feel like a competition. She’ll say thinks like “he loves me more than you” or “he’ll tell me anything before he tells you” just things that are pointless to say. She always says it when he’s not around to hear, so when I try to talk to my boyfriend about it he gets irritated with me and says I’m just talking shit on his family. We recently just got a house together, I was showing his sister pictures and instead of being happy for us she got mad and said “I told him I wanted to get a place with him and split the bills” and she got up and walked away. Like why would you want to live with your brother, especially when he’s in a full committed relationship. Why would she think that he would choose to get a place with his sister over his girlfriend?

108,"So I was a bit hesitant on wether to put this question on r/love or another relationship related community, but opted for this one instead because... why not?  

I’m a 19 year old female virgin who, unfortunately, has yet to be kissed as well. Initially this didn’t bother me but, considering that I’m finishing yet another decade of my life without a single romantic/sexual experience, I’m beginning to grow impatient. 

I consider myself fairly pretty— not the prettiest woman in the world but I don’t think people struggle when looking at me. This year, I’ve had quite a few guys interested in dating me and, although some of them were my type on paper, I simply could not see myself dating any of them. 

After analyzing myself for a while, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m not ready for a relationship. I don’t feel comfortable with the idea of holding someone’s hand, going on dates or doing all those cheesy things you people in relationships have to do. I’ve been single for so long, I don’t feel mentally prepared to NOT be single. I know that if someone I really like comes my way, that mindset could change, but regardless, that hasn’t been the case. 

Yet, there is something I really want to do. Have sex. Maybe not go all the way, but I think I would feel plenty satisfied if I make out with someone and do the other things that come before the “main act”. 

My problem is that I’m not experienced AT ALL, and I’ve always wanted to lose my first kiss (and virginity) to someone who cherishes me. However, now that I have another mindset, I don’t know where to start. I know that after having my first times everything will become much more comfortable, so I just want to get rid of them. I’ve tried Tinder, but I don’t really feel much connection to any of them, and in real life I have very few friends (and I don’t want to kiss any of them), so I don’t feel like I have that many options. 

What should I do? Should I give in to my desires? Should I just do it with some random guy at the club? I feel like I have a little angel and a little devil on top of my shoulders that simply can’t stop bickering.

My two oldest brothers (not including the one that is the subject of this post) were very successful in high school and college and are going on to be well-established people. The brother that is the subject of this post has truthfully always been the underachiever of the family but it was only recently that this really started to significantly bite him in the butt. He is incredibly smart and capable, but he has low goals and he doesn’t really take life seriously. Unfortunately, he chose classes this year (largely under the persuasion of my other brothers) for school that were incredibly difficult, even for my other overachiever brothers. He was doing fine in the first half of his classes, but in a series of low-performing grades, he is very discouraged and starting to struggle significantly, and I truly feel worried for him as his younger brother. I have tried to talk to him and encourage him, but his “carefree” personality has just made him lash out and get angry at me, but I can tell that he is truly depressed and of the few words he has spoken to my parents, he says he doesn’t even want to go to college now because of how strenuous and painful his classes are for him. His grades are continuing to drop, 2 of which will likely reach C’s and one of which has a possibility of a D. His classes are only harder next semester (block schedule) and he is now starting to turn in assignments late and incomplete, play video games, skip track practice and all around show a complete lack of motivation in life, but he is unwilling and angry to talk to anyone. I am seriously worried about him and I really can’t even concentrate on my own life because of my extreme anxiety for how he is feeling.

119,"Just over a year ago, my ex boyfriend showed up at a hospital 4 hours from his house covered in blood and said ""I think I might have killed my mom"", police went to their house to do a wellness check and found his mother dead on the property.


A little bit of backstory — I've known this guy for years, he was my cousin's best friend all throughout middle school, high school, and after. My cousin and I were neighbors and they used to hang out at his house all the time, so I saw him a lot. I swear, he was THE nicest, sweetest, smartest, friendliest, gentlest guy I've ever met. I had a serious crush on him for years. In early 2013, he reached out to me on Facebook, we began talking, and had our first date in early spring. We dated until November of that year when I finally felt it needed to end. When we first started seeing each other, I began hearing things from my cousin and his other friends that he was not mentally well, that he'd say bizarre, nonsensical things, and that it might not be a great idea to date him, my mom warned against it too (even though she really liked him and would have deep, philosophical conversations with him often). But I was a naïve 20 year old and didn't want to believe that about this sweet guy, so I ignored it for a while. I can't properly express it but I truly loved this guy and cared about him so deeply. Our relationship didn't last long but the friendship we had was incredibly special to me and always will be. He was never anything but kind to me and the memories I have of him and our time together now will always be so precious (and painful) to me. 
I did start to notice that he wasn't okay over the months though. I blocked so much out, but he did often say things that just simply didn't make sense, he thought my cousin and other friends of theirs wanted to hurt him, he thought people on his computer, or the internet, were listening and after him, he would go AWOL for days, etc. 

I only met his mom once but she was VERY clearly mentally ill to the point where you couldn't have a coherent conversation with her at all. HE wasn't like that back then though, most of the time he was still logical, coherent, seemingly normal. But things did progressively get worse and so I ended it in November 2013. He took it well at the time but after that he seemed to go downhill. He would show up to my house looking for me (I was always either not home or pretended I wasn't, so I never actually saw him after I broke up with him). He never said or did anything threatening, just wanted to talk to me, or would tell my mom he wanted to marry me, or leave gifts in my mailbox. He even walked all the way there from his house several miles away once or twice in his pajamas and wanted to stay there (what I now see as a cry for help). This continued for 2-3 years after I broke up with him and moved out of state. 

Both he and his mom were undiagnosed as far as I know, but I'm pretty certain they are/were schizophrenic. One of the saddest parts about all of this to me is that I've since learned that he would often try to leave and his mom would hide his keys, or if he did leave, she would harass all of his friends looking for him or call the cops and report him missing (he was in his 20s). I even recently heard rumors that she sexually abused him, though I don't know if that's true. 

All of this to say, I care about him deeply and I think about him often and am sincerely worried about what will happen to him now. I finally decided to start calling different state law enforcement agencies a couple of weeks ago to try and track him down since it had been a year with no news. I found out that he was initially booked at a local jail with a murder charge, but he's currently at a psychiatric hospital and has a court date in February. 

So I guess I'm just looking for unbiased opinions as to what I should do? I've done nothing for a year but lately I've been feeling very strongly like something is nudging me to reach out to him. I want to visit him but I'm apprehensive for a few reasons. First, I don't know what kind of mental state he's in now and I'm afraid to see him in a really bad place, so different from the person I knew (which is selfish, I know). But I'm also worried because I don't know how he will feel/react to seeing me specifically, only because we used to date and I think he really loved me, and then of course I ended things. And as I said, he did seem to deteriorate after that and continued to show up at my house unannounced for a couple years thereafter. 
On the other hand, I'm sure he's on medication and in some sort of therapy now, which I would imagine has stabilized him to some degree. And the way I see it is - maybe, just maybe, having someone show up who cares about him, and who he cared about, could be a good thing. That's all I want... to help him in any way I can.

All I know is he is very seriously mentally ill, and otherwise never could have been capable of such a horrific act. I can't even imagine what it's like for him now to have to live with what he did and to be so alone. It truly haunts me and completely breaks my heart.",05Dec2019,1
120,"Ok so this is a really confusing situation but here’s the story 

TLDR at bottom

So two of my good friends don’t really get along , one of my friends, let’s call him G makes fun of my other friend, H, all the time. G calls H racial slurs about him being Jewish and him being poor and not being able to afford certain things.

This all usually happens in our group chat with about 10+ of us. If G doesn’t agree with H he starts to make fun of him while we just watch them fight in the group chat. It usually happens at time to time.

During thanksgiving, one of my friends let’s call him I, asked everyone what they ate for thanksgiving, H said he ate strawberries and steam tips and then G comes in and starts ridiculing H about how he can’t afford a proper thanksgiving meal As we are we just watching and chanting them on. This group chat is too secret, we talk about a lot of private things about other people in our grade, basically just like any other friend group would.

It all started today when I saw H in the lunch line and he told me that he screenshotted some of the stuff that G said to him and me and I where in some of the pictures, only me, I, and G. The thing is H showed the screenshots to the guidance counselor and now we are basically screwed because me and I ended up saying shit in the screenshots 

After school we all hoped on a Instagram call, all of us and a few other friends. Me and I are usually respectful and nice to H and H said that he was only trying to get back at G for all the shit that he said. Our Instagram names aren’t actually our real names so the screenshots don’t actually say our real names. H said to G that he is not trying to get me and I in trouble since we are actually nice to him. Then G started acting innocent and tried to make friends with H which I guess worked but H said that he still wanted to get G in trouble

G isn’t the brightest person when he is pissed. He was saying how if he got called down, then he would try to mention our names but idek if that’s even true. 

I honestly am worrying about me and I getting suspended for nothing because kids have done other things on Instagram that got them suspended. G said that he will take the suspension as long and him and H are friends but I have no idea if he is gonna try to snitch on me and I. H said that he only mentioned Gs name when he talked to the guidance counselor so if g mentions our names me and I and possibly a few others might be screwed. 

What’s your guy’s opinion on this?

TL;DR: one of my friends, G, makes fun of my other friend H, which led to H showing the guidance counselor screenshots of G insulting him in our friend group chat. Me and my other friend I, got caught in the screenshots talking shit about other people. H said that he only mentioned Gs name when telling since me and I and actually nice to him. The problem is there is many things that could go wrong and one thing is G mentioning our name when talking to the principal or someone else or even if anything’s gonna happen",05Dec2019,1
121,"Hey people of reddit, obligatory throwaway account and on mobile.

Going straight into this, I have really, really bad issues with auditory stimulation. Specifically the sounds of people eating or chewing and really loud or repetitive noises . For example, was in the car with my brother today and he had chick fil a. He wasn’t exceptionally obnoxious or anything, but once I heard him chew, I couldn’t focus on anything else.

 I asked him to stop, but my mom, who was in the backseat, immediately said, “ He isn’t doing anything wrong, you have no right to ask him to stop.” 

I responded with, “Sorry, I just have trouble with the noise.” 

She said, “We’ll it’s not his problem.”

I just said, “Okay, but I’d really appreciate it if he stopped because it makes me very anxious and I can’t focus.”

She said, “Okay, but that’s not his fault. You’re all over him and you won’t stop,”

I said, “Sorry.”

As the ride continued, I began feeling extremely anxious, and my breathing was irregular. Then my hands started to tingle and I couldn’t catch my breath. Thankfully, we pulled into our destination. I went to the bathroom and my vision became weirdly spotty and my hands were numb.

When I’m in the car, when someone is chewing loudly, or just for no reason I become very anxious then my hands tingle and my vision becomes spotty. Sometimes I have to sit down because I can’t see or I think I’m going to pass out. To provide a bit of backstory, I won’t go into detail, but I was abused by a family member. I have had anxiety for a long time, but I don’t know why the auditory stimulus

I don’t know how to stop this from happening. It’s really impacting how my life works. It also happens if there are any sudden, loud noises or very repetitive noises. I’m scared that this will get really bad in a situation that I can’t remove myself from, or I’ll be driving and won’t be capable behind the wheel. Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!",05Dec2019,1

124,"Hello, I’m a freshman in highschool. Over this year, I’ve made a few new friends that I really enjoy being around. They’re all very good kids who don’t pressure me into doing anything, make fun of me, etc,

There’s this one really friendly girl, who’s said things here and there about her family life, and from what I’ve heard, it isn’t very ideal. Her family is fairly poor, due to her mother’s spending habits and her dad never paying child support. Her brother has paid for her phone, her clothes, and other items of hers for the most part.

She said they’re getting evicted in the next 4 months because they haven’t paid the mortgage. I believe it’s around $4,000. She said once they’re kicked out, they’re moving to Montana (roughly 1300 miles away) and living in their car. She doesn’t know what’s going to happen after this, and isn’t even sure if she’ll get proper schooling. 

I don’t know what to do, and if I can even do anything. My family can’t (and won’t) take them in, and I don’t want to find out that she’s ended up in foster care or her life is ruined. I barely know her, but I have known since the first day of pe, I’ve wanted to make sure I keep in contact.

130,"So i don’t have a problem studying and reading books, but I have to admit, it’s been a while so that is one reason why I’m struggling. It seems like I don’t have the focus or patience to actually read and comprehend something anymore even if it’s a topic I’m actually interested in. I feel overwhelmed or bored sometimes. I’m constantly thinking to myself “get to the point already” while I’m reading a book. I know it’s wrong, but I keep thinking that the information could just be summarized and listed without all the excess words/sentences that lead to the point.

It’s the same with watching movies. I can never watch a movie from start to finish unless I’m in the theater. I’d get bored and stop watching within 10-20 minutes if the story isn’t that intriguing.

131,"Okay so, backstory. I'm 17 and female. I go to car meets a lot in my area, which is where people show up with nice cars and cruise, do burnouts, swing their cars, etc. I met a guy there who was talking about selling coke (lets call him B), so I jokingly was like ""let me get a line!"" because that's just my personality, I'm vulgar and out of pocket. This struck up a conversation, and we became friends. Later, someone else at the car meet told him that the week before this specific meet, he got a little angry because B was bragging about his money. I'm not gonna lie, I love money, so this was interesting to me. Him and I started talking about how he got it. He told me how he's 20 and owns three businesses. I jokingly said to him ""I'll be your sugar baby"" and he was like ""okay cool"" and I was kind of shook that he was serious, but we spent the rest of the night hanging out at the meet and then exchanged information. That night when I got home, I looked him up, found his full name, his Facebook, and his business on the secretary of state website.

We started texting a little and went out to the car meet the next week, then hung out the day after and got food. He told me about how he graduated at 15 with a 4.4 GPA, got emancipated, and moved to Montana and went to college at 16 (which I already knew, I saw it on his Facebook from years back). So I was like, okay, I did my research, he's telling me stuff he didn't even know I knew, so he's honest. We had some deep conversations, and we pretty much have the same mindset. Him and I are just on the same level about pretty much everything. We both are focused on long-term things, like careers, money, etc. We have the same interests, like we both want to travel and deepen our knowledge of other cultures, and we love cars, and we watch the same people on YouTube. 

Anyway, so we continued texting and hung out yesterday and today. It's been like two months since we first met at a car meet, but we never really started talking until two weeks ago. Yesterday we went to the mall, and he bought me a sweater and bought himself some things, then we went to KFC. After that we sat in the parking lot just talking. He told me he's interested in me as a girlfriend because I'm focused, smart, and eye candy. I was excited when he told me this, because I like him too. He was saying he wanted to take me to Europe, because he knows how badly I want to go. He then started telling me stories of things he's done and how he's gotten where he is, showed me how he started up his business, like all the documents and PDFs and all that bull. How he has a double minor in mechanical engineering, and also studied psychology and business. He told me owns a car dealership and two logistics companies. And then he offered me a job. I already work at Pizza Hut, making minimum wage, maybe a little more than $100 a week. He told me he makes about $400k a year, and is projecting to be a millionaire in two years. He told me all I'd be doing is paperwork, like filling out w-9 forms, and also making phone calls for loads and negotiating prices. He also said my weekly pay would be $500, which is a LOT to me. 

We hung out today and didn't do much except just sit in my room and watch movies. I told my mom about the job offer, and she started warning me about this kind of situation, and now I've just been sitting here completely freaking myself out, and I don't know if how I'm feeling is valid or not. The thing I am most worried about is that the loads he's transporting could be drugs or guns, internationally. Or even worse, human trafficking. Not to toot my own horn, but I am pretty, but I'm also smart. I don't want to be completely naive going into this. Here are my points, sorry about the format.

On the good side:

\-he's truthful (from what I know so far)

\-seen evidence of college and businesses

\-I have his full name and he's met my mom

On the bad side:

\-started talking to him because he was talking about getting coke from Mexico

\-making almost half a million a year at 20

\-three years older than me

\-buying me things I want

\-incredibly smart and has a way with words, gets his way (the kind of traits you see in serial killers)

\-offering me a high paying, easy job

\-offering to take me around the world with him

\-moving fast with me in terms of relationship

The thing is, most of the bad things are explainable. Have I hit the jackpot or am I stupid? What initially attracted me to him was the money, because I just thought it would be a kind of business relationship, but now that we've gotten to know each other, I kind of like him, and now that my mom has brought up the danger, it's making me scared of how I feel. I always go with my gut because it's always been right, but could this be the time it's wrong? Am I just worrying too much?

I could just be extremely lucky and have found a great guy who I could have a perfect life with, or I could be putting myself in a dangerous situation. I just don't know and need a little guidance right now. Am I freaking out? How should I move forward? What are tricks traffickers use? What kinds of people do they target? How can I find more information on him?

Also, I don't feel like I'd be a target. I come from a stable life, I'm clearly independent and he knows I don't need him, but I probably also came off to him as super money hungry. I'm sorry for the lengthiness. I just don't know.",05Dec2019,1

 So... I attend a university right now being declared in mortuary science. Yet, I don’t think I can commit to those long stressful work schedules with such a low pay anymore. I wanted to do embalming specifically because you’re in the background, you don’t really need to communicate much, and you can just work. I also liked that art and science are in this occupation.  That’s all I want. I want things outside of work like free time to make art, vacation, and hang with my family, but this occupation doesn’t allow that. 

I don’t have any other goals for myself. I always see other occupations that are interesting and find myself being capable of like a cosmetic chemist, or writing, but I get scared that I will hate it or not do well in a position and fail. I have low-self esteem and it really impacts my decisions.


My mom is urging me to quit school and go study being a radiologist? (X-Ray technician) so I can just start doing something and make more than minimum wage. And because I’m not assertive, or a people person. it eases my stress from university and crippling debt but, I don’t know ... if it’s the right trade for me either

Okay so I really like this person where I work at but sadly she’s a CNA while I’m an EVS (environmental services a.k.a housekeeping) and ever since I saw her I became smite by her beauty. Every time I worked at the ER I would always wish she wasn’t working because I could never handle myself around her. Every time she came to work I will always try to act like I’m bussy. So whenever she passes by me I would immediately feel better but at the same time sad because I didn’t say my usual hi and what’s sup. There’s times I wish I could hold conversations with her that could at least last just a couple of minutes. I used to watch her Instagram feed but never fallow her because I didn’t want to seem like a stalker. I know what she likes and I always try my best to memorize everything she says or looks there’s even times I remember her blue and red retainers and he cute tan color she had last summer. I remember when she didn’t come to work for almost a month I would start to fantasize about other people but when she came back I suddenly felt so guilty. But I always feel like I’m never good enough for someone like her, I feel like I don’t deserve her because I work as EVS and I don’t have a better education. But I did applied for Security Guard at the hospital that way she won’t see me as a person who works with filth. I want to show her that I’m more then just a toilet cleaner I am also going to community college so I can get credit for the university I want to go to. I want to be a screenwriter so I am able to support her and me. And since I know she wants lots of kids And I don’t mind having a huge house for all of us. I know having feelings for the same sex is a sin but I can’t help it. Every time I see her my heart just flutters. There’s times I wake up from thinking about her to having my last thoughts about her when I sleep. But yet she is the opposite of me she’s a country girl while I’m from the city. She loves running while I don’t because I am too short. She has a good job while I don’t. She’s well spoken while I am not. She’s not from the ghetto while I am. She has a better education while I went to a public school. I feel like I’ll never impress in anyway until I get my job as a screenwriter so I can shower her in love and riches. I know loving the same sex is wrong but I can’t help it she makes me feel like something I never felt before, I can’t even describe how I feel when I even think about her.

146,"I’m a pre-med student in my Sophomore year at a standard four year college. I began as an Criminal Justice major, then switching to IT, and now to pre-med. And honestly, this semester has been mixed. In terms of classes, I love them. I’m taking anatomy and chemistry, and I find both of these classes incredibly interesting. However, I’m only doing average. It looks like I’ll be ending the semester with an A- in anatomy and a B in Chemistry. Although these are usually good, they aren’t good enough for pre-med. Due to some unfortunate circumstances in past semesters, such as multiple family deaths, my gpa fell to a 2.9. My advisor though, (and still thinks) that I am okay. He thinks I can raise my gpa enough in time. However, I don’t know. I’m not sure if I’m just discouraged, or what. I’ve had to study intensely for all my exams, and I usually wind up doing okay (usually 80’s). I just don’t know if I want to struggle through the rest of my undergrad, barely passing. 

Besides, what happens if I fail the Mcat, or fail to get into med school? Then I’m stuck with a useless degree and no aspirations.

I know there is no point in switching to a new major, I would be so incredibly behind. I’ve been thinking of switching back into IT. I didn’t hate my major, but I also didn’t love it, so that’s why I switched. But maybe it’s worth doing slightly boring in exchange for a safe career with a solid salary.

I don’t hate IT. In fact I love new technology, and I love tinkering with technology.

I know I get weird and want to prove myself because I get bullied sometimes. I guess to me, becoming a doctor was my one shot at proving to people that I am capable of doing incredible things, and I’m sad because I don’t think I can do this anymore.

But I’m also afraid of what happens if I fail.

150,"I got a job as a marketing intern in a startup 2 months ago. Obviously, I had to learn about the company industry and my manager told me to update all content on the website to optimize and learn information at the same time. Then she asked me to do the content marketing for the website's blog and social media, basicially online.

At first, and with the blog with all the long articles, it was fine. However, after 1 months, whenever my task was to focus on social media content marketing, she said to just copy content from somewhere and make a simple poster, ""don't care too much about it, it's not important"" she said. And she has an awe every time we analyze the competitors and see that they posts contents regularly, like every day or twice a week. We never had a content calendar or anything, just the social media content writing task whenever the manager suddently remembers about it.

I'm seriously so confused. I'm an undergraduated student in Digital Marketing major, I was also hired as the Digitial Marketing intern. And all I do when I go to work is social seeding, though the start up is an online facilitator that's still in the raising awareness phase--like we still haven't had any customers at all.

I brought this up with my manager once. I said why don't we create a content calendar and give every channel an equal amount of time. She heard it and shrugged it away. Everytime I spend my time in designing a poster for social network for more than 10 mins she starts looking at my laptop and tell me you don't have to care about it that much.

Can anyone in the field tell me if this is the reality of the marketing??? At university, we have to follow strictly to the rule that any content has the similarity over 10% will be penaltied. But at work, it's totally a different story and it makes me so confused though I find my university updated program is more believable.",05Dec2019,1

But I’ve grown a lot since then. I make more of my own decisions. And I’ve noticed that a lot of the people in the fraternity are good people to hang around in an otherwise toxic music school environment. I’m just worried that I’m too late, and I’m generally regretful that I let this opportunity to rush a brotherhood be delayed for so long.

I don’t want to put myself in a situation where I’ll just get shot down and get more depressed over it. But I also really really want to be a part of this excellent orginization. 

Should I rush PMA?",05Dec2019,1
152,"I move around a lot because of my job, meaning that purchasing a house is probably not the best option for me. I recently moved because of work and met roommate #1 through a mutual friend. I genuinely enjoy roommate #1 who is super helpful and friendly (also my landlord), and provides professional advice and support, I also brought my own dishes and the table. Roommate #2 came a bit later and is a friend of roommate #1; however, I don't know him and he hasn't really brought anything material-wise or friendship-wise to the table. He tends to use my dishes and sit at my table and also brought his entire family over on short notice. He has also tends to borrow some of my personal items that he should own and uses my items. My impression of him is as sort of a mooch even though he makes more money than me. He seems like a nice enough guy otherwise and his habits are only slightly annoying.

154,"Before you bring out the pitchforks... please read. 
I’ve had cats my entire life. I accept them for who they are, sassy personalities and all. A little cat scratch? Doesn’t bother me. Couches, walls and drapes torn to shreds? Who *cares*, as long as I have my furry companions by my side. Before now, I have always been vehemently against declawing (and still am, in most cases). My three cats were litter-mates. I found them outside in rough shape, bottle fed them, and decided to keep them all. Two of my cats are completely fine. However, my other female cat has always been a little crazy. That was never an issue. The issue is her extreme, extreme displaced aggression. She’s generally sweet and can be cuddly, but one little smell of another cat, or an outside cat coming to close to my house... all hell breaks loose. This isn’t a cat who gives a hiss and a swipe if you get in her personal space when these triggers are present, this is a cat who will stalk through the house looking for the nearest live being to attack with intent to seriously harm. She has, with no warning for me to get away, attacked me and corned me into my bathroom where I have to stay for hours because I’ve smelt like a stray I’ve pet before coming home. 

This sounds dramatic, but when you have a vicious animal coming at you howling and growling while bleeding profusely from the wounds conflicted, it’s terrifying. She doesn’t stop, either. It’s a continuous attack until you manage to get away. A couple times I’ve thought I might need stitches. There’s no taking control over her. Several hours after she’s calmed down and the trigger is gone, she’ll come cuddle me and my bandages. It’s the craziest thing. I’ve researched and researched this, and have tried everything to avoid all possible triggers, but I never know what all of them are. When I see an animal outside, I shut all the blinds. When I go visit people with animals, I have anxiety over what I may smell like and viciously wash. When people come over, I get very nervous, because even knocking at the door will make her puff up. Loud noises, even people wearing boots can set her off. Some attacks worse than others. I’m scared to take my cats to the vet, her due to seeing other animals, and my other two due to them smelling different when they come home. I feel like I’m living on eggshells in my own home, paranoid about any little thing that might heighten her senses and set her off. 

There’s been about 5 big episodes this year, and this last one was completely out of no where. I was sitting on the floor, thought one of my cats had something in his mouth, held him down to see what it was and bam: attack on him, attack on me. Wounds that bleed *a lot*. There’s nothing wrong with her medically, she’s been to the vet, this is just her personality and always has been. I finally talked to my vet about it, and she thinks that declawing and a low dose of Prozac could really restore peace in a home that I have extreme anxiety in. However, I feel so absolutely awful and guilty. It makes me cry thinking about going through with it, and I don’t know what to do. It’s to the point where I think I’ll never be able to live with a spouse, due to not knowing what her triggers exactly are and over fear of how she may be treated by someone else if these episodes occur, and god forbid I ever want kids. I’m at a complete loss at what to do.",05Dec2019,1

157,"Never been on this site before but it's 2am and I need to vent so I can actually get some sleep. 

A few days ago our house got robbed, they broke in through the fence in the back yard which has a mini alley way on the other side. We were all out when it happened, me and my brother were at school and my parents were at work. I was the first one to get home to see the patio door smashed and all our belongings tipped out of our drawers leaving all our bedrooms completely trashed. It was obvious whoever did it (we suspect there was more than one person) went straight up the stairs after smashing open the patio door since downstairs was completely untouched. 
They've stolen all the Christmas presents my parents worked so hard to get for everyone in our family including our little cousins, as well as mine and my brothers. They've stolen my brothers watch, and some of his money. They've stolen my (empty) purse along with the necklace I got from my mum that I really loved. The worst thing is that they've stolen my mums jewellery box, which contained my mums christening stuff, her wedding stuff, as well as the jewellery that belonged to by great-nana who meant the world to my mum. 
Her stuff isn't replaceable. And that's what pisses me off. 
It's been a few days since all of this happened, the fence and patio door has been covered and we have security cameras set up now. We're getting an alarm system soon as well. But that doesn't change the fact that I'm scared, which is understandable. I guess everything just hit me now and that's why I can't sleep. 
I keep thinking about if they'll come back. What if they come back and we're still home, I'm scared they'll hurt my family and I have no clue what I'd do if something happened to them. Yeah, all the alarms and cameras and stuff are great but that doesn't necessarily stop them from getting in again, does it? They can still come back and that terrifies me. 
I'm struggling to feel safe in my own house, we only moved in in May, and if this can happen in the span of around 7 months, who's to say it can't happen again in the years we'll be staying here? 
Some part of me says I'm overreacting but I can't help it. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before, and I don't really want to talk to my mum and dad about this yet because they're already so stressed and I know they try to hide it but that doesn't stop me worrying about them. I might talk to my friends about how I'm feeling just to let some of it out. 
I would go stay at my grandparents house but I don't want to leave my parents. 

And I'm just so angry at the people who did this. I don't even want to call them 'people' because what they've done is inhumane. They've essentially stolen from children, which they KNEW they were doing because they've been through all mine and my brothers stuff, and they saw the presents we got for my little cousins, the youngest is 5 years old so you can easily guess that the gifts were for children. They've stopped us feeling safe in our own home for christs sake. They did all of this just so they can get some money out of it. The fuck. 
Why the hell should we have to fucking barricade our house just so we can feel a little bit safe. Who gave you the fucking right to steal our shit that we've worked so hard for. My parents are running their own business for fucks sake, they've earned every single penny they make on their own, and you just come along and take it. Sure, we'll get most of our stuff back because of insurance, but that doesn't change what you've done. 
It's fucking disgusting. 

I just needed to get all of that out of my system. If anyone has any advice on how I can feel safer, that would be great. And if this has happened to anyone else on here, how did you get through this? 
Thanks to anyone who read through this, because I know I wrote a lot wow.",05Dec2019,1
158,"I’ve never posted on reddit literally ever, but I’m a little stuck and need to vent about this and ask for advice. 

I met this dude when I was getting my glasses fixed (he worked there) and he asked me if I wanted to hang out after we talked for a while. 
I gave him my number and we set a time and place to meet. We met up, chilled, and had sex. 
This was a month ago. 

Now, I texted him a few times throughout the next few weeks, few times a day, and we hung out about once a week. Everything was cool. We have everything in common, the sex is great, and he’s extremely attractive. Tbh, he is way to attractive to be interested in me, but I digress. 

Fast forward to the last 3 days. I texted him about 5-7 times each day, mainly to suggest music and tell him about this place that’s looking to book acoustic gigs (he plays piano and sings). Now, throughout these last few days and all the texts I sent him, I received 0 response to any of them. I asked him if he was okay, no response. I asked him if I did something wrong, no response. 
It’s important to note that we had talked before about how he doesn’t really look at his phone, but he never voiced any concern over me texting him. 
Then, there was last night and today. 
I sent him a text about how I thought it wasn’t cool that he was ignoring me and that I just wanted to make sure he was okay, and I received no response (this was last night).
This morning, I called his phone to see if maybe he blocked my number. It rang, so I hung up and sent a text telling him I wasn’t sure if he blocked me, and was confused as to why he didn’t respond, and then I told him to disregard the call. 
Then, he finally texted me back. He told me it wasn’t going to work out and that I was overwhelming him with the amount of texts I was sending (keep in mind this was 5-7 each day, so that many in, let’s say, a 16-18 hour time frame). 
This is where my confusion lies. 
He had never voiced his concern to me about how much I was texting him, and he straight up blocked my number after that instead of talking about it and getting it sorted out. 
I thought about going to his house and posting a handwritten note about how this is a misunderstanding, but my friends tell me it isn’t worth it. 
My question is this: how does this dude, and his actions, come across? Was it messed up to block me and ignore me without ever even talking about this minor problem? 
Should I post the note on his door? 
My friends tell me this dude is an asshole. I really just need thoughts about this, because I’m frustrated that I was cast aside. 
He is charismatic, and at one point told me about how he has 300+ matches on Tinder, and that hurt me, because it seems like he was just rubbing how attractive he is in my face and wanted me to know that I could easily be replaced. 
I just feel so angry and defeated at the level of inconsideration.",05Dec2019,1
159,"Three days ago my partner and I managed to pull a baby starling out from behind a panel in our wall, after it had been in there crying for about four days. 
Once we had gotten it out, we spent a while trying to research all we could do to help it survive, and the bird was doing surprisingly well considering. 
Yesterday he was trying to jump/fly out of his box, spent a good deal of time sitting on the back of my mouse hand while I was at my PC, and even got to spend some time outside. Overall, things were looking great.
I got up early to feed him this morning, all was well. 
When we both got up later this morning things had gone down hill terribly. The bird could hardly hold itself up, was swaying and falling over. At one point I thought it had died completely. 
We live way out of town and I dont think taking a baby starling to the vet is something people do.

160,"How do reconnect with a girl I was talking to?

I’ll keep this story relatively short
I am in Highschool. I met this really nice girl at my one of my clubs. She was a transfer from another school, and we hit it off. For a couple months we talked almost constantly.  We hung out to study really often and I got the vibe that she liked me, she talked a lot about her life and we struck a solid connection. Sometimes we couldn’t hang out because she had minor medical issues that kept her from school, but I figured that it was no big deal. I decided I would ask her out to go to the homecoming game. Unfortunately, she had made other plans but we rescheduled to the next week, something she suggested.

So the next week rolled by and she wasn’t at school for the entire week for the medical issue.  I texted her to ask if she was alright, and she said that she was sorry but she couldn’t make it because of her illness. but sometime we could reschedule again. The next week she went to the doctor to her her medical issue fixed, but after that I noticed a change when she came back

It seems as if she was actively ignoring me. I tried to walk with her to class, but she walked sorta fast, like she didn’t really wanna chat. I texted her later about hanging out and was ignored. She texted me again, asking how I was, and how my life was going. I responded I was doing okay, and we talked for a while.  She said her medical issue had came back, but she’s doing okay as well. I am hosting a holiday party soon, and I invited her. I got no response. We haven’t talked in weeks since then. I want to reconnect with her, but I don’t know how I pushed her away to begin with. We seemed like we really hit it off, and I’m confused. What should I do?

163,"First of all, my problems aren't important. If there's someone else who needs help, answer them first. I don’t even know what I have. I'm probably insane at this point. Just, any advice would be appreciated, I don’t know how much longer I can do this, cause all my methods are clearly not working. But if you’ve got more important things, don’t waste time on me. Second, this is long as hell, i'm sorry about that. There's just a lot i needed to say and get off my chest. This also helps for context. I just don't know what to do right now.

My earliest memories are from Pre K. There’s one major thing I remember, being happy. I had a best friend. Steve. He was awesome. Me and my perfectly average Pre K self got along like brothers separated at birth. Even as a little kid, I remember leaving the classroom each day and we would say stuff you'd say to your family, like, “Can’t wait to see you later.” or “I love you.” Not in a gay way of course, but in a, your my family way. I remember this particularly because my dad would yell at me for it, calling it unnatural and unacceptable.(I come from a very conservative christian family, and he was a super conservative. Don’t think modern day Trumptard, but more like Bush and Cheney but without the racism. Also, to add to that, my dad is also the greatest human being alive, despite some of his views. A hero if I’ve ever known one, so don’t you dare trash him.) Me and Steve even played little basketball together. It was great.

Then one day, not long after Steve’s sixth birthday party, My mom sat me down and explained that, God had a plan for everyone, and Steve’s just so happened to be one where he slipped and smashed his head on concrete, and the final part of the plan, is him never coming home from the hospital. It hit me hard. I developed what I assume to be a form of depression, even considering ways, at five, to join the only person I truly made a genuine connection to. As the next few years rolled by, I retracted. I don’t know why, but I could not become friends with anyone. At all. I developed anxiety after a short while, getting extremely worried over insignificant things. This got worse until about eight years old, where I tried telling my parents this. The response was a bit… not good. At first I was told it was normal, then that it was stupid. Then I was told my my dad that I was just, quite simply an entitled, prissy, son of a bitch who can’t stand anything going wrong. Again, don’t complain about him, I genuinely believe he thought this was whats best. So I shut up. I also had an experience where I woke up, and was totally frozen, unable to move. couldn’t do anything for thirty seconds. It happened once or twice, and I called it freezies.

Through eight till seventh grade, I kept my head down. Didn’t play sports didn’t make a bunch of friends. Only one or two who I genuinely was friends with. I avoided attention. I slowly fell sadder and sadder, eventually attempting and failing at suicide. The main thing stopping it was, of course, this girl. Her name was Breane. Looking back now, she was gorgeous. Long shiny black hair, beautiful smile, glasses that actually made her look cuter, so much more. I still wonder what became of her. I knew she liked me, and she knew I liked her, but neither of us had the courage. When I finally got a phone, wed stay up for hours talking. I even talked her out of suicide. Though it wasn’t all rainbows at this point. I had grown to develop some horribly bad anxiety. While my depressive feelings had gradually got worse, the anxiety and self loathing took off like a spaceship. I started to beat myself up over everything, self harm, bleach, you name it. Some weeks id break down every day. But honestly I’m thankful, I learned to be a great actor during this time. Anytime I acted odd, my parents immediately thought drugs, so I learned to cover my tear ridden trail pretty effectively. By the time seventh grade rolled around however I was no longer content. I wanted to be rid of these feelings. So, like any rational teen, I went crazy. 

I decided the way to get over my problems, was, to make them a hell of a lot worse. Actually terrible. I started acting out, and like a dick. This was right at the middle of the edgy, asshole part of school, and I decided to capitalize. I was a total dick wad to every and all teachers, actually took credit for one quitting. Id do the same thing to other kids too, except not nearly as extreme. This was during the whole, fuck the establishment mood the trump campaign had brought on, so some of my antics were indeed noticed by students up above me. And just happened to be luck, our principal was universally hated, staff and students, so anything against her was a bonus. I actually got a lot of superficial friends this way, and everyone knew my name. While the social situation, improved, from an outside perspective, my mental situation deteriorated to nothing. My anxiety was now giving me nightly breakdowns, and all I ever thought about was suicide, but my whole reputation was based on this secure level headed say it how it is kinda attitude, so Christ fucking forbid I say anything. Then Breane moved away. Soon the Adrenalin and Adderall, that I illegally obtained, and I soon became addicted to were the only thing getting me through the day. Not to mention, the freezies got a hell of a lot worse, lasting up to a minute, and, (I know this part sounds like bullshit, I don’t know if I even believe this) where id actually see things, like weird shadow looking people attempt to attack me, and id see animals and shit, and it was so vivid. I honestly don’t know if I was literally insane or what. I this ended up fucking my sleep schedule beyond reason, to the point I became, and still am, able to operate after being awake 56 hours straight. I can be up for days and it wont bother me. Beyond that, the Adderall got balanced out by my parents telling me about how I was a fuck up, and that they thought I was useless, not great for my psyche I don’t know why but most of the time I just cant sleep at all. Sleep or not, this cycle of Adderall and adrenalin to stave off the helplessness and sadness became my life until the end of eighth grade.

Fortune would have it, going into ninth grade, the kids above me knew a neutered form of what I was. They all knew my name, but they only knew me as the guy who fucked with the principal, and made their life hell. Thus, I was extremely well liked by the juniors who the principal treated like shit. And even better, I got pun in classes with mostly older kids. I dropped the edgy shit, and acted like a decent person for once, and slowly over ninth grade year, I got to know the entire eleventh grade class, two grades above me. Thanks to the anxiety, I was able to keep my mouth shut when I needed to and thanks to the not giving a fuck, I could make some decent jokes that got me into the inner circle of the entire junior class. I was generally well liked and known around. Meanwhile my mental situation kind of didn’t get worse, but it didn’t get better. The freezies and the weird hallucinations continued, and I was still able to ignore my anxiety for a while. I still couldn’t sleep, but this hardly bothered me by now. Id grown accustomed to days without rest. What little sustainability I had in my head got me through ninth grade, all while slowly, after realizing how much it cost me, getting off my Adderall addiction, which I still cant believe I did. And actually, tenth grade would only be better.

I got super lucky tenth grade as well. I got a lunch period with all the most popular and liked juniors, now seniors. Unbelievably, they invited me over to their table, first day, this kid two years younger. Over the course of the year I became close friends with most of the now seniors, and actually, finally, had a bunch of genuine connections with about ten of them. I slowly got a bit less depressed, and actually was happy with some of these people for the first time in my life. While genuine happiness was great, it was balanced out with guilt. Of all the shit id done to people. All the fucked up stuff. I tried to distract from it by going out with a bunch of different girls, most of whom I didn’t like, but that didn’t help much. Speaking of, there was one girl I absolutely adored. Head to toe stunning and an amazing personality. A senior, like most of my friends, she, unbelievably, asked me out. Twice. And I said no. I never told her this, but I said no because of myself. I genuinely liked her, and there was absolutely no way in hell I was gonna drag her amazing self down with me. I was only a burden for her to bear. Either way, my anxiety slowly got better around certain people, an honesty I was on top of the world. I was mentally recovering, no longer addicted, and I had genuine connections to so many people. The year ended. Over the summer we all hung out, having a great time, me not really expecting the shitshow that was about to go down. All but one of my ten moved to an out of state collage or joined the army. I currently maintain regular contact with basically the entire grade, but I was not ready for the beginning of this, my junior year. 

Quiet. Thats all I can describe it as. All of the people id come to know and love were gone. Of course I had, what, 6 people I genuinely liked still there, and I could strike up a conversation with just about anyone, and that I all figured would get me through this year. But it has not. And as luck would have it, I have maybe two classes with anyone I like. I ended up taking a trade class, and the entire class hates me because of the school I go to. I suppose my luck had to run out at some point. Mentally, I’m a train wreck. I'm getting even less sleep than I normally do. The freezies are back, and the hallucinations are more and more common. I don’t know why. This is all very confusing. Its hard to describe my feelings these days. Words don’t do them justice. Suicide is now a constant idea I entertain, somehow, I find the idea of death welcoming. Its just so hard, going on like this, it feels as if every day I’m being crushed with the disappointment my father feels in me, the loneliness, all coupled with the guilt is heart wrenchingly painful. The hallucinations don’t help. I've almost become content with the motives of the killers I hallucinate. Is that a sign, by the way, the dreams? I don’t have a clue. At this point I feel empty and lifeless, and its only so long before I can no longer put up the act. Any advice is appreciated, but, as I said, don’t waste your time, I’m likely a lost cause.",05Dec2019,1

169,"So I graduated in May with a very unfortunate degree in history (I know, I wasn't thinking straight). I was living in Mississippi and my family moved back to Tennessee in July and I moved with them, and have been here ever since. I have been working as a cashier since August just to have a job and combined with what I already had saved I have nearly $5000 in savings now. I also have no debt of any kind. 

I'm a gay man and am wanting to move to at least a moderately sized city for obvious reasons (there's no one out here right now, save me). For a long time now I have been fixated on the idea of Chicago. I honestly despise driving with a passion and would give it up if I could which is a major reason I was focused on it, as well its much lower cost compared to the other first tier cities in the United States. 

My plan was to save 10000 by the spring next year and move and try to make it work. I have no faith in my ability to get a job sitting here on machines talking to a company's unhelpful machines. Every job gets at least 200 applications here in my tiny town. I can't imagine how awful it is in any large city let alone somewhere like Chicago. I also have no particular distinctions. I had a 3.9 GPA, and wrote a thesis but have no experience relevant to anything I'd want to do. (The word experience makes me want to punch a hole in the wall. I could do any of these fucking entry level office jobs). 

Anyway, I wonder if my fixation on Chicago is boneheaded, despite its lower cost and sweet sweet public transportation (why do you hate public transportation so much America) I worry it still may be too expensive for someone in my current state. I have been wondering if perhaps I should try somewhere else like Austin Texas or Minneapolis Minnesota. Cities that often come up on best places to live if you're young lists.

I have no idea what I want for a career. At this point I just want to get settled somewhere and start actually dating people and have some office job.

170,"So I have this problem with my parents: My parents super super restrict how many times I get to go out and hang out with friends.

For context, Im a 17 year old girl who's turning 18 next month, and I have asian parents. I've always been a social person and love spending time with my friends when im not focusing on school, but whenever I plan to go hang out with my friends, my parents make it a whole big deal. Someone these rules just eventually developed on its own in my house: Ask at least 3 days before, ask one parent then ask the other parent, and continues a complete background check on who im going out with. Whenever I ask a parent, they won't decide right away, and they'll say something like, ""Let me to talk to your dad (or mom)."" Let me tell you, i've never EVER done anything or any sort for my parents to doubt or lose their trust in me. Recently, last month they said that ""I ask to go out too much"" (i asked at the beginning of the week if I could go out with my friends on saturday each week for 4 weeks"", so basically 4 times in a matter of a month. They declined 2/4 times, and recently they said I go out too much and will restrict it to 2 times A MONTH. I believe that im mature and old enough to evaluate who im spending time with and what Im doing. I usually just brush off my parents' complaints and im reasonable when it comes to what I ask for, because I know my priorities and boundaries, in terms of school and other activities.

That being said, life has been extremely fucking difficult lately. I’m doing too much at one time and I don’t know how to put a brake on it or if I should be stopping myself. The only relevant information about me personally is that I’m in high school and I have an anxiety disorder. I do a lot during the day, I have high grades, play 2 sports (3 this year because of an impulse decision to join the wrestling team), and participate in a business club outside of school. My schedule has lately been to wake up, go to school (where I spend 11 hours of my time on an average day), come home, do the minimum amount of homework I can and finish the rest between classes the next day, get 7 hours of sleep, repeat. I’ve been flaking out of the business club recently because of wrestling and I honestly don’t know whether to quit the club or not. On one hand, I don’t have the time and really much of an interest in business compared to everything else I have going on, though at the same time, I don’t want to quit because it’s a great resume builder and my parents would be much happier with me if I stayed involved with it. As much as I wish I could just grit my teeth and do it, I’m too close to my breaking point and I have too much going on right now to add something new, not to mention the fact that my personal creative interests have been extremely stifled but I’m assuming that will clear up once exams are over with and I’m a bit more relaxed and have more time for myself.

Should I quit or should I stay?",05Dec2019,1
172,"So I have two friends who I've been friends with for about 3 years. I'm gonna call them M and N. I started being friends with M in sophomore year. Him and and I got along great and everything was fine. Then junior year rolls around. I had a couple of classes with N but we were just classmates and weren't really friends. Me and M would both play together on xbox. One day M told me that N had xbox so then we started to play together. In junior year N seemed like a cool dude so I had no problem. So then all 3 of us basically became this group. But then senior year rolls around and then I start to get to know N more. N is the type of person who likes to mess around a bit. But it really annoys the hell out of me. Most of the time we would play xbox he would throw insults at M. I realize now that I'm an idiot for seeing this behavior and not doing anything. But M would just kind of laugh it off or insult him back but with me it just annoyed the hell out of me when he does this.

Fast foward to know nothing has really changed. Now he starts trying to throw insults at me and it pisses me the hell off. We're in college now and honestly I just want to cut ties with both of them. It feels like the same crap everytime. We get on xbox, N constantly insults M, and then he just laughs it off. Like seriously what the hell. And now he just tried doing it with me yesterday and he almost made me snap. He also talks behind his back too. Another thing about N is the way he is with me. At first, he seemed like a chill guy. But then I just kept feeling this weird vibe from him like he secretly doesn't like me. And yesterday was when I really noticed it. He was trying real hard to push my buttons when we were playing. But now I'm really just tired of this shit. M lets N walk all over him, and N likes to drag us down. I don't know if I should just straight up tell them this. That M is always letting this guy insult him constantly and how N wants to get on my nerves now. I'm also fully aware that I'm being selfish right now by only getting tired of it now that he's doing it to me. But honestly know I just don't want to talk to both of them anymore. If I cut it off with just N, then it'll get messy because M is also part of our group so then he'd basically have to pick a side. For the most part I don't like having friends for too long like this and feeling like I'm glued to them. I like having friends for a while but then eventually having us move on in our life and meet other people. What I'm really asking is, do I call them both out about how I feel about them or do I just become distant and let them get the hint? If you're reading this, I'm really thankful. I don't know who else to ask this to.",05Dec2019,1

181,"Hi sorry for crappy formatting. I’m on mobile

Well. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 4 1/2 years now, and are looking to get married in 2022/2023. I love him to absolute bits and we have a strong relationship..but our biggest problem is his family.

His sister in law (brother’s wife) we will call her Stacy has been trying to run me out since the day we met. She screamed at me for sitting in her sister’s seat accidentally during thanksgiving dinner and ever since that moment goes out of her way to treat me like shit. 

She always tells me that I’m not good enough to marry into the family, has said she wouldn’t attend our wedding, and has even suggested my boyfriend go on dating shows. No matter how many times my boyfriend has asked her what I did, and what the problem is, she never has an answer. Her harassment has gotten to the point that anytime they come around to visit I get extreme anxiety and practically break down because of the way she treats me. 

My boyfriend has tried to get things fixed and yet she refuses to budge..for 3 years, my boyfriend and his brother tried to talk to her about being more respectful to me and to apologize but refused to budge and just recently  has gotten her husband to begin harassing me as well, such as keeping their daughter away from me, and calling me “it” in front of the child and other family members. We’ve brought up the issue with his parents all they tell us is that it’s not their problem, and that we just need to keep our mouths shut, and just continue to be the better people. They admit she’s a terrible person, and that they don’t see what I could’ve done wrong but refuse to help us have everyone sit down and talk about the issue at hand. 

Everyone dislikes Stacy because she’s terrible to everyone, but loves to focus her hate mostly on me. No one knows why she’s so hostile with me and I have no issues with any other family member but her. Because of his parents, and brother’s reluctancy to help us overcome the issue, I’ve become more resentful towards them and don’t even want to be around them anymore. 

My boyfriend is contemplating to cut everyone out of his life at this point because of their behavior towards me but I feel as if I’m tearing apart a family. I don’t know how to deal with the situation anymore because Stacy and her husband are so toxic in my life that I refuse to be around when they are, and because the parents’ refusal to help with any type of solution has made me lose touch with them..I used to be able to talk to his parents about anything but now I don’t even feel as if I can trust them with anything. 

I don’t know where to go from here. Do we just cut off his entire family as my boyfriend wants? do I just move on and let him find someone his whole family will approve of? Do I tell her off myself? 

Any advice here would be welcomed.",05Dec2019,1

185,"A friend (31M Caucasian) invited me (30F) to a “Bollywood themed party.” He’s been watching lots of films in this genre and annually throws a very extravagant party each year with a different theme. I think he expects guests to show up in Bollywood attire, dance like a Bollywood star would, etc. I anticipate most (if not all) of the attendees will be white. 

I feel conflicted about this. My gut reaction was like “couldn’t you just pick a different theme?” (Images of culturally inappropriate college parties come to mind). I don’t know much about India’s culture or history well enough to give advice on how to “do the party right” (if one can at all). My friend mentions it’s similar to having a Hollywood themed party and I wouldn’t have any problem with that. He feels really strongly about this theme and has already purchased most supplies.

Before responding: please don’t vilify us for even considering throwing/attending a Bollywood themed party. I’m really looking for mature responses from people with a bit more knowledge in this field to be able to have an open dialogue about what they consider to be the best course of action here. Thanks.

186,"I \[19m\] have been friends with her over a year. I moved into college as a freshman late August 2018 and from there my life turned around for the better. I got over a lot of social anxiety and became much more confident. Along the way, my soon to be best friend at college helped me along the way, as she lived right next to me. It wasn't until this summer I started to catch feelings. I came back to college this past August again for sophomore year, and shortly after I told her how I felt. She felt the same way, but it's only a few months since her boyfriend of 5 years broke up with her, so she just couldn't get into another one like that again. Things got weird (my fault), but we became friends again two months ago. She started acting flirty and I guessed she still felt the same way. So two weeks ago while hanging out, we talked about it again and it was the same result. I told her I won't wait for her and she said good, we agreed things wouldn't get weird again. I was relieved and thought I was good to move on.

Now tonight after not seeing her for a while, I realize that **it just hurts too much**. I see her and I get anxious, eager to speak with her, and then get sad because obviously I still have feelings. I care about her so much, and I know she does for me as well, but I just won't put myself through this. I have too much to focus on and I need to move on fully.

now this might sound really dumb and indecisive but i don't know if i want to get them now or not. i plan on switching from iphone to samsung when i go to college next year, and the airpods wont really work at their max potential then. i could always resell them but no one wants used airpods, lol

But I am an 18 year old horseback rider who will be going to college next year (if I actually get accepted). I’ve been riding for 11 years and I love every second I can spend around the horses.

Like any athlete, I want to become the best I can possibly be. However, right now I am at the level in my riding where the lesson horses available to me are below my riding skill level, and there aren’t any other barns I can move to even if I wanted a change of setting. So every lesson I have just feels like I’m not getting anywhere, and it’s beyond frustrating. I just can not afford to lease or buy a horse of my own and save for my college education.

189,"I help run a club at my school only lately we’ve been facing lots of obstacles from our district. They basically took away any chances at trips (where we usually volunteer our time to better communities) and we have to have constant adult supervision. They made us suspend all club activities for about a month and a half and it’s killed everyone’s spirit really.

We have a group chat for the all the members who are running the club (they like file and record important info we need to function along with presenting in meetings.) but three leading members made their own group chat and came to the conclusion that we should just end the club. I’ve been helping run this club for years and they excluded me on coming to this idea and it hurts. 

I was told in a phone call all of this and when I questioned one of the people in group chat #2 he asked me why I was “making it personal when it wasn’t.” I think deciding to end something I genuinely care about and have spent so much time and effort into keeping alive  is personal. 

They also said they wanted to go to the district to complain about the way they handled the situation and bring someone who was in involved in an incident that resulted in the district coming down on us to give her story. It’s a terrible idea. I can’t give out all the details but if they do this someone they care about will lose their job. I told him this and he just laughed and said “oh yeah,” like an idiot. They’re acting so self righteous and like their going to accomplish anything by making it public. Nobody wants to listen to me and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried so hard to be patient but time and time again they let me down and don’t think I’m incapable of anything. 

I’ve spent 3 years dedicating my time to this club because I care and now they’ve just decided to end it. I forgot to mention they decided this a week ago, keeping two of us completely in the dark. 

They’re supposed to be my friends but they constantly exclude me in some way or another. By bringing up classes I don’t share constantly, by literally making a new group chat without the “whiney/toxic people,” by gaslighting me about my emotions. I don’t have another friend group I can just bounce to because I’ve dedicated so much time and we just happen to be close by. I don’t know how to function after something like this happening. 


This is really long and disorganized sorry. 

They wanted to hold a meeting to tell the two people they hadn’t told yet (me and some other dude) and I couldn’t show because I had to do something at lunch and the dude who gaslights me gave me shit. I texted the other people he was with that knew about ending the club that he had told me the night before so it wasn’t so bad that I hadn’t gone because I was up to speed. They told me he made a huge deal about it and basically was speaking badly about me, but he conveniently left out the fact that he told me the day before. I don’t know what’s he’s trying to do... make people hate me? I meant to go to the meeting but the thing I had to do at lunch ran longer than I thought it would and he texted me after lunch giving me shit for not going. He started interrogating me about why I didn’t show up and I told him why but my answers weren’t enough and he left me on read. He’s being petty. I don’t want to interact with him ever again anymore really.  I don’t want him to ruin my reputation because we used to be really close and now he’s being a dick.

I first held a pencil properly when I was 18 months old and was able to draw an identifiable picture of Ernie from Sesame Street (as that's what I was watching as at that age).  Ever since, I've been known as ""the kid who's really good at drawing."" That is until high school.  I'm a very quiet and shy person, so I'm often (and by often I mean always) ignored or forgotten about.  I don't have many friends either, but I've always used things like my talent as a way to reassure myself that there is still something special about me.  I've done this all the way up to around the end of my sophomore year (I'm currently a junior).  But recently, I've begun noticing how small a drop I've become in the rest of the ocean.  And I realized that my talent isn't that remarkable anymore.  I'm really not interesting or special or anything.  I'm just an extremely introverted loser.

So yeah there's that.  But now I'm also worried about something else.  You see, just yesterday my girlfriend showed me a project she had to do and she had to draw cartoon characters for it.  Her drawings were amazing of course.  But I also got a really weird feeling.  Like I couldn't have her be better than me at my own talent.  Recently I've wanted to try get better at drawing so maybe I can perfect it, but I'm already way to stressed about school and my SATs, and my obligations with band, that I don't I have time to practice something like that properly.  So the weird feeling just continued, I'm starting to think I'm becoming jealous.  Jealous because other people are better than me, and that no one notices me in the first place.  Sometimes I feel like not even my girlfriend notices me, but that might just be my anxiety talking, I don't know.  But I'm worried that I'm becoming a bad person for being jealous.  I know I shouldn't be getting mad at people I care about because they enjoy something and are good at it.  But I just can't help feeling this way.  And every time I want to try to get better at it, I get some sort of anxiety attack because I know if I take time out of my life to do that right now, I know for sure my grades will suffer due to my distraction.  I becoming a bad person? What should I do?

At 14 years old I felt I had nearly nothing to live for, but I had found something that made me happy.  Speed up my 9th grade year and I'm beyond anxious every single day, I'm depressed, suicidal, etc.. so one day I just snapped and I told my mom i had to leave.

Then, the next year (10th grade) I went back. I had done some online so I didn't have to completely repeat my grade, just some classes.

There are a lot of bad dommes who take advantage of these men and a lot of creeps, but there are also some wonderful dommes who help use their influence to inform the community about consent and help their “subs” to find purpose and joy in their lives. 
For a couple weeks now I’ve been helping men online, making sure to domme responsibility and engage with people I feel comfortable with and make sure people are taken care of. 
I’ve become a voice of morality in a darker side of twitter and have had multiple people approach me to say they’re so glad I’m there. 
Because I’m not just after money and I actually care I’ve become very popular very quickly. 
I get some creeps in my DMs, but I’ve also made quite a tidy sum of cash from men who say they’ve never had a domme who’s able to be dominant but also respectful of them. 

The only problem? I think I’m addicted. 

I think about it constantly. I get a high every time someone sends me money or a tweet gets a lot of exposure. I can’t seem to stay off of Twitter. 

I have several men who have pledged themselves and their wallets to me, and say they’ve never had such a wonderful “goddess” before and I don’t want to abandon them to other goddesses who will take advantage of them. I’m even helping some of them overcome their addictions. 

Am I addicted? Is there a way I can stop without hurting anyone? Should I stop? 

Any advice is appreciated ♥️",05Dec2019,1
205,"I'm 29, so I'm not so terribly old as to be disconnected from pop culture or even a lot of children's media, but I don't have children and didn't grow up around children younger than me, so I have very little experience with kids. I didn't used to live near my cousin's kids, so it never felt necessary to buy gifts, as I only saw them in passing once a year or so. 

Now, I live near them and I've gotten a lot closer to the family, and her two boys - 5 and 7-almost-8 - have grown to like me quite a bit, and I love them and want to show that I care about them at the holidays. They are whip-smart, funny, hyperactive kiddos with good hearts, and their interests span all kinds of things related to science, technology, and nature as well as science fiction, fantasy, and age-appropriate horror.

As I'm trying to find presents for them, I'm finding that because I'm not ""plugged in"" to what's the hottest toys/media for kids right now, I'm mostly just remembering what I liked as a kid. At first I was like ""Oh, when I was that age, I loved Animorphs, I should get them all the books"" but is that actually something that's held up? It's more than 20 years old, maybe that's too long for children's books to stay relevant? Are kids at that age still reading as voraciously as when I was a kid? Should I be focusing more on tech based toys and entertainment? 

The obvious answer is to ask their mom, my cousin, what they want, but she's vague and says they like lots of things but it's hard to find the perfect thing. Most of the stuff they explicitly said they wanted, she's bought for them already. 

Should I be trying to find presents at all? Is it worse to give no gift, or a gift that ends up not being just right? When I look to my own childhood for inspiration for gifts, am I just projecting my childhood (which I miss) on two kids who are completely different? Or are some things universal to childhood and will hold up over time? 

Thanks in advance if any parents can weigh in on what they wish their non-parent friends/family would or would not gift their children. Thanks!",05Dec2019,1

207,"  

So I wanted to date this girl *(let’s call her Z from now on)* for a long time and i've really tried, i always invite her out, talk to her a lot and every time we go out I can tell both of us really enjoy it! Which is always really cool you know? But I’m not sure if i still want to. So I’ll tell the story of how everything is going so far.

We ended up school so we won’t be able to see each other as often but Z and i we are good friends, so outside school I was always the one who invite her out *(will make more sense after)* which was fine cause she is a little bit shy on those type of stuff, and one day she finally invite's me! i was quite excited that day, so excited i even get a little late for the place we were supposed to meet up *(i was 5mins late but still)* anyways i wait and i wait and she doesn’t show up, so 25mins goes by and I check Instagram it said she disconnected 5mins ago so I’m like *“Uh so probably she just left his home or something”*, important to point out most of the times we meet up she gets kind of late which it doesn't bother me, so i decided to keep waiting. Another 25mins goes by and still nothing, nothing, so I’m like *“Okay I’ll just go home”*. I was dead on the inside on my way home, really sad won’t lie here and thank god no one was at home at the time or they would have seen me come home after just 1hour of “going out”.

So i get home with the big sad, I turn off my phone cause I didn’t want to know anything about anybody. After like 5 or 6 hours I turn on my phone and she post a story on Instagram with her family and stuff and I’m like “*at least she is ok haha” (sarcasm).*

Like 2 or 3 days goes by and she doesn’t say anything to me, which I’m super confused you know? And a friend of Z talks to me and in short words say: *“Ohh Z feels really bad about what happen the other day, she’s got sad and all”* i genuinely didn’t knew what to say so I just went with the *“ahh it’s okay no worries and next time it will be”* something similar, so more days goes by and she finally talks to me on Instagram and she says she’s *“sorry about what happen the other day”* and again I had no idea what to answer to that so I said again the same thing to Z’s friend: *“no worries all good blabla”* so she invites me again to go out and i genuinely don't wanna go out, something feels off you know? Like I just don’t want to go out, and I said an excuse so I’m not able to go out *(quite of a coward?kinda)*, so more days goes by she invites me again and this time I just say “*no sorry I can’t go”.*

So finally she says to me why she didn’t show up that day, won’t go into details but depression issues and she felt like she was going to break down if she saw me that day, very very understandable so I say she doesn’t has to worry about it I totally get it and really she doesn’t have worry of me being angry or something like that *(just to clarify I never got angry at her).* So we are both good right now.

After a while of everything I explained above, all of the sudden all of her and my close friends say that she likes me which I really didn’t saw at the time maybe I’m just really blind idk, the thing is what do I do now? I just have no idea. 

Am I still in love with her? I can’t tell I just don know, something just went away you know? Hard to explain, I’m not trying blame her if it seems that way I just have 0 idea on what to do.",05Dec2019,1

210,"I don't know what to do with my life. It seems like life has done nothing but tear me down since I (f21) moved out in June. I moved into an apartment and out of my moms house. My little brother took over my room. I lost my dream job in July and started becoming pressed for cash. I lost my car and health insurance, which will be important later. I couldn't find a job that paid more than minimum wage so I started working at home for a telemarketing company at the end of July. I worked there until late/mid October when they cut most of my department. Then I took 2 weeks out and got my CNA so I could start earning enough money to live. Worked at my facility since November 11 and haven't missed any days. I lost my apartment because I was late on rent, so I moved back in with my mom. My 10 yo brother and I share a room now cause my brothers refuse to move back together. Well I was on my way to a different town to take my state test and I  ended up hydroplaning off the road down 250ft of hills, hit a creek face first, and bounced back up landing on the creek. So now my backs messed up, my wrist is broken in 3 places, and my car is totalled. I had to miss 3 days because of this and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me. Since I don't have insurance all medical expenses are solely my problem. I'm not even sure I can go back to work on light duty cause my back hurts so much.

211,"So I’ve always felt this way, ever since I first met her I just didn’t like the vibe she had, especially when I was around. 

She’s super touchy feely with him, always touching his arm, and laughing super loud at his jokes, never lets me get a word in the conversation, she always makes it a point to sit next to him, even if that means that I’m not, when I post pictures of me and SO she comments about how cute we are together and how handsome he is, or that I’m lucky to have him, one time she used an app to do the gender swap thingy and posted the picture of her on social media with the caption “i look just like my brother” and that “I’d be a sexy guy”...  even when my bestfriend met her for the first time, she had no clue who she was, pulled me aside and asked who she was because she believed she was trying to “pick up on my man”. 

She’s always been about the almighty dollar and my SO has done really well with his own businesses, and she has made it clear that she wishes she could find a man like him. 

I’m just really conflicted and I could just be crazy because me and my brother have never had a great relationship so I could just be misguided, but does anyone else find this kind of creepy?",05Dec2019,1
212,"I smoked weed with someone from a class of mine. We went to his dorm to eat and then he pulled out his pen asking me if I wanted to, so we did. A third friend was there, and she left before anything happened, and when we went back to his dorm after walking her to her car, I don't remember much of what happened.

I woke up in my own dorm room with my clothes put on backwards, my rapist's roommate told me he heard us having sex (but I don't remember consenting or wanting to do anything like that with him) and I knew that there was something wrong. My body physically felt different, and I knew that I was raped.

Maybe I ""consented"" in the moment? I don't know. I feel like.. if I were sober then I would have said no. I feel sick to my stomach when I think about him or or if I were unconscious while it happened and maybe that's why I don't remember?

I was smoking and it happened- I don't know if I would get in trouble for doing that, and on top of that, I'm accusing someone with no evidence. I don't want to get my family involved or for any outsiders to know about what happened. I go to a relatively medium sized college, and yeah- I want people to know he's a rapist. But I don't want people to know about me.

Another girl in my class did some stuff with him- smoking, making out, they went on a date and he told her: ""I only fuck girls before I date them, that's how I know the pussy is good enough."" She even told me that he did the same stuff (I don't know if she was raped, but she smoked/made out with him/was led on) to a girl in the music department they're both in. So he sounds like a sex addict to me that doesn't mind raping people. I don't know the first person to tell, and I don't even know if he's get into any trouble. What do I do?",05Dec2019,1

229,"About 6 months ago
I took a job with an amazing non-profit Children’s Hospital. The company is a highly sought-after, prestigious children’s facility and I was absolutely thrilled to land a job with my dream company. My family was so proud of me. I was so proud of me!

I, however, quickly realized that this job I landed was not one that I would come to enjoy. I am a nurse, and I love doing what I do best- nursing and hands on patient care. The position I took, although a nursing position, is more of an office job... a somewhat menial-tasked based position where I do a lot of insurance/coding/auditing. I have very little patient care time and when I do it is not hands on care, just screening questions and intake. 

As the weeks went on, I grew disheartened but made the choice to continue on with the company, regardless. After all, it was a dream of mine to work there. 

Fast forward a little, I am in my 5th month of working and have begun to see a shift in my finances. One major downfall I walked into with taking this job was knowing I would spend 1-3 hours in rush hour traffic each day. Along with spending a lot of money on gas, I started leaving work an hour early each day to avoid traffic. This lead to me losing about $200 per paycheck and spending close to $100 every two weeks on gas. I am losing close to $500 a month just on my commute alone. This has taken a major toll on my mental health, my physical health, my marriage, and family life. I have a one year old son and I feel so heartbroken only seeing him for two hours a night (for which I am usually in a terrible mood from spending so long in traffic or just the mental drain of not being fulfilled at work.) I started looking for other jobs but I feel very guilty. 

My hardest decision in leaving this company is knowing that I have always wanted to work there... I’ve worked hard to get where I am and I made my family so proud getting the job. I would like to (in the future when I move closer) work there again if I was to leave... I am currently an LPN but am in school to finish my RN-BSN and would want to work there when finished with school. It will be about 2 years, though.

I should also mention, the new job I was offered would be about a 10 minute commute, more money, and more flexibility. I would also be spending much more time with my son and my husband, and could potentially finish school faster and dedicate more time to studying.

So I guess my question is...do I leave my dream company and find a new job to help “current me”, or do I keep my job with my dream company to help “future me” by knowing I would secure my dream JOB there? I just don’t know if the timing is right for me. I feel torn.",05Dec2019,1

We've always been extremely close growing up, and as time went on I developed deeply romantic and sexual feelings towards her. One day I told her everything.

She didn't have much to say back, other than I need to find someone else. Since then, we've still been extremely close. It was awkward for a while being around each other (we lived together) but that went away fast enough, and to this day we're still the same close brother and sister we've always been, joking around and being there in the usual way.

This is the first time I'm consulting Reddit for advice because I'm genuinely clueless about whom I should ask for advice from. Please forgive me if I miss out explaining anything.

Yes, the title mostly explains it, but not entirely. I've been witnessing my mom being harassed physically and verbally since a very small age (I'm 20 now). It was more of physical abuse earlier, now it is verbal swearing on a daily basis.

My father is a regular drinker. He drinks and changes into a different person— basically he sane anymore. One time, my mom was on her periods. Somehow the blood left a stain on the bedsheet and somehow he found it out. Next thing I knew, he was chasing her with the TV remote and eventually threw it at her twice before I intervened.

Last night, my mom served him food (he drank before that). He felt that the fish was too salty, so he started cursing her, saying things about her sister, her mother (my aunt and grandma respectively), about how ""their culture"" is filthy and all sorts of things.

Another fact, I don't remember this very clearly, nor do I come up with this topic in front of any of my family members, but perhaps my father had an affair with another woman (I don't remember this because I was very small and I've a memory problem).

I'm hoping she divorces him, and today she came to me and asked if I would mind if she does. I said I don't. But she and I, both are clueless as to what should we do now? What are the legal procedures? Also, my new semester has begin, so I'm confused how I'm going to handle all of this. Please help.",05Dec2019,1
245,"My dog has been on chemo for the last month and has already  15 lbs (that’s a lot for a dog). Luckily, he is responding well to the treatment but will not eat anything but people-type meat (rotisserie chicken, steak, deli meat, gizzards...). The vet even gave us a medication that is supposed to increase his appetite but he still won’t eat his dog food. I put it out, he will go all day without touching it. I’ve mixed bone broth, cooked eggs and treats in with it- but he still won’t bite. If he goes an entire day without eating his food, I feel like I have to feed him the next morning which results in cooked chicken and of the like. He’s losing so much weight, I can’t let him not eat. 

He used to be a 75 lb pit bull, now he is closer to 60 lb and his spine/ribs are showing and his fur is... shabby? I know these are results of chemo, but concerning nonetheless. 


I’m getting a second opinion from another vet this weekend, but it’s not good for him to keep eating people food as it doesn’t give him all the nutrients he needs (like dog food).  Some people have floated the idea of cbd/marijuana but I’m sure of giving that to my dog (for me- yes. For Oscar- don’t know?)

My “Best friend”- BFF
Girl I don’t like - GIDL
Nice friend - NF


Ok so GIDL has been teasing me for months now in school ever since me and her first met. For some reason she’s developed a habit of putting her arm around me and pressing hard into my throat when walking with me to my next class. I guess she thought it was okay to do that cause I pretended like I didn’t care and didn’t say anything about it but the thing is she presses my throat so hard I can’t even move my head to look at people. GIDL constantly over exaggerates things to the point it’s not necessary and makes a big deal out of everything. She’ll talk about the teachers who get on her nerves, she’ll make fun of people but when people call her out/make fun of her back she gets mad and defensive. 

“If you’re bothered by what she’s doing why don’t you do something about it?” 

The thing is I hate conflict, especially when all the hate/attention is on me so I tend to stay in the background and not really do anything. 

“Why have you put up with her for months?”

A bad habit of mine is giving people to many chances even when they don’t deserve it. I have a lot of patience when it comes to things and don’t get bored easily because I’m relatively a calm person. 

But that wasn’t the same for today
Today GIDL took it way to far and finally pushed my limits.

GIDL earlier in the day found out I have a boyfriend and acted all happy for me saying things like “Go get you some!” And etc. I appreciated it that she didn’t say anything bad about me dating him because usually my BFF says things like “ew you’re dating him?” I went to class like usual and was in my last period which I have the class with BFF, GIDL, and NF. 

Whenever someone found out about me dating my bf I specifically told them not to tell one specific teacher because that teacher knew my parents and if my parents found out they would be very disappointed in me/get very angry with me because I’m not allowed to date. (My parents are homophobic and don’t want me dating a black person) 

BFF, GIDL, NF, and me were all in the library so we could listen to the counselor speak to us about being open minded. Me and NF joked around and when we joke around we say things we don’t actually mean like “I’m gonna fight you right here right now” while pretending to hit each other. Me and NF joke around a bit more and BFF hears our conversation and out of nowhere calls me a ‘bitch’. I go quiet pretending like I didn’t hear her and actually start listening to what the counselor is saying now because BFF tends to call me slurs and other things out of no where with a obvious attitude. Because BFF does that so much I’ve learned just to ignore her when she gets one of her many attitudes for no reason. 

The counselor is done talking at this point and dismisses us to go do our work in the library so me BFF,NF,GIDL, and me go pick a table to sit at. At this point GIDL starts being her usual self. 

GIDL got mad at NF because of a stupid reason and is now grabbing her mini backpack to look inside it, grabbing her binder and moving it onto my seat just so she could sit where NF was sitting causing NF to share a seat with me now. NF who usually likes GIDL is starting to get annoyed with GIDL grabbing her stuff and moving it. 

Watching GIDL purposely make NF annoyed was making me bubble up in anger but I thought about something else which caused me to calm down. GIDL soon had to go to the restroom and told me “If BFF or NF start talking about me tell me so I can beat their a$$e$ but if you don’t tell me if they’re talking about me I’m gonna fight you” 

Mentally I wanted to roll my eyes at her but decided not to since it would only make things worse. Our last period was almost over and I was mentally exhausted and drained from dealing with GIDL but the thing that she did was what ticked me off more then anything. 

GIDL decided to tell my teacher that I was dating my BF even when I told her not to. GIDL has the biggest grin on her face when she told my teacher and looked like she was gonna bust out laughing at any second. I nearly exploded.

I decided to act like I essentially bothered but in reality all I wanted to do was drag GIDL by her hair and let out all of my anger I have for her after all of those months of her hitting, teasing, laughing at me and literally not caring about how I felt when she embarrassed me in front of my other friends and even getting my BFF to make fun of me was hurting me like hell. 

As soon as the bell rung me and BFF went outside to start walking home together like always.Talking about something I don’t remember 

I needed someone to vent to at this point because I knew if I didn’t I would do something that I would regret. I decided to vent to BFF but BFF was next to me anymore but instead she was laughing and talking with GIDL leaving me walking by my self while pointing at me. 



I know I’m over reacting but I really need to know what to do with GIDL and BFF Because honestly I’m getting sick and tired of people treating me like crap just because I’m nice to them 

Should I deal with it or should I tell the counselor? 

If I tell a counselor what do I even say? 

Should I tell my other friends? 

Please tell me what you would do in this situation cause honestly I’m to mentally exhausted to really do anything anymore.",05Dec2019,1
249,"Hey, so I’m supposedly dating this guy from my work place, usually I don’t kiss on the first night.... 

But im going to scan through this story to cut right to the chase. 

So first night we chilled I invited him out, we kissed after spending some time together, second night we chilled we kissed like never before only was with each for 30 mins the second day, the third night he finally took me on a date at the movies than after that hotel. At this point I thought the hotel was just for sleep as we both planned to fall straight asleep, soon as we get to the hotel and it was a different story when we get there it particularly was lets have sex. at this point I declined it in the hotel room but I gave him a handjob and sexual kisses, no 3days We hung out I have told him I was a virgin because I never thought he’ll try to have sex sooooo soon (3 days of hanging out) The day of the hotel after all the action happened I woke up early to go downstairs for breakfast while he was still alsleep he slept until it was time to clock out he cuddled me while we was asleep I came up to get back into bed with him and asked did I eat breakfast I said yes that was it we slept until it was time to go, We drove home talking he gave me a light kiss and that was that, I texted him later that same day to check on him it was all good vibes.. as it seem kiss emojis and all 


After that we just been texting, as if things are fine I texted him to come chill with me on the weekend and he never showed up but we still texting I haven’t seen him at work before that for a while so I figured he comes in at a different time so the other day I finally seen him at work and it was a glanced look he had sorta a different look on his face then I have ever seen since I knew him which wasn’t that long but it was different I finally seen him today it was kinda like he was ignoring me until I stepped up to be a bigger person and asked how is everything going I haven’t seen u in awhile he explained why, it was fine I told him to text me after I left work (we work different times but I come in a few hours earlier then him) he did and I told him to come and visit me for a few mins if he can today WOW! he still doesn’t show up now I’m kinda feeling some kind of way.

Reason for me wanting see him today is to talk to him about our last hangout and why I didn’t have sex with him because everything seems so awkward after the last night we seen each other in the hotel, I don’t want to keep sweating him about when we are going to see each other far as hanging out again and seem like I’m being a bug as we speak I see him online and not tempting to text me to come over but when he wanted to come over and see me for a few mins I said YES and he showed up right away now everything seem so different and awkward 


Ps: Could it just be me or should I simply just speak to him as normal and move on? At this point idk what are we or where we stand. But it’s hella to early to go through this in idk even if it’s a relationship 


UPDATE: he said sorry, about not  showing up today h just now getting off work. could be lies I’m going to text him a sad face and say maybe next time but it’s all so awkward I don’t why did I choose to talk with a co worker to begin with I regret it tbh. Lesson learned",05Dec2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

It was July, on a weekend, I went over to a lake with friends. One night I was drinking and had some marijuana. We went to bed because we rented a boat to go out on the lake. In the middle of the night, I woke up and went to piss. I felt everything going heavy. I fainted as I walked out of the hallway of the place where we were staying. I came about and everything was clear but then I could feel my heart beating hard. I couldn't calm down. My heart was pounding. I was scared. It was the first time it happened to me. I woke up my friend and he took me to urgent care. They told me it was tachycardia and syncope (fainting). I felt out of sync for the next few days. I went home, back to life. Work and all that. I did set an appointment to meet my PCP (Primary Care Physician).  I finally saw my PCP. They said that my EKG looked normal. I avoided drinking alcohol and marijuana ever since. I still drink one or two beer socially. 

Everything has been fine. There were a couple of nights where I was anxious it was happening again. Some nights I was having a hard time falling asleep.  One night, a few weeks ago, I went out to have a couple of drinks with my co-workers. I always made sure I stay hydrated. I drink water. I woke up hot and sweaty. I felt my heart beating. I had an app called heart rate monitor. I could see the rate going up. I couldn't seem to relax so I got ready and drove myself to Urgent Care but by the time I got there. My heart rate went back to normal and I didn't feel troubled. I decided not to go to Urgent Care. I drove home feeling foolish that I perhaps overreacted. 

It took me a bit to fall asleep. After that I was fine. Went to visit my parents for a week for thanksgiving. I had one night where I was hot and feeling weird but then I calmed down. I came home. 

Suddenly on 12/4/2019 at 12:30 am, I woke up hot. I splashed my face with cold water. I can feel my heart beating. Not pounding. I was feeling anxious like it was happening again. I drove to Urgent Care. I got checked in. They hooked me up to EKG, ran some tests, and said that everything looked normal. They diagnosed that I could have Palpitations. I stayed home from work so I can sleep or try to sleep in.  I spend the day recovering. I found myself looking at Palpitations and what causes it. I see words like Diabetes, Anxiety, and all the big words I could possibly have. I'm tired. I requested to set an appointment to meet with a Cardiologist to make sure my heart is fine. I'm just nervous about going back to sleep.

I'm 29 years old living alone. All my good friends, I hang out with, they all live one or two hours away. They're busy with life. My parents live five hours away. I'm working at a job I don't care about but it pays the bills. 

I need to make some changes like exercising, eating better, go out and be more active. Start dating or make some new friends who live closer to me, or find a new job up where my friends are but it's so damn expensive.  I have dreams I want to attain.  I'm just at a loss. There are just so many things I worry about, I feel like I'm just not doing good enough. I just want to be able to retain some control.  This heart thing has always been on the back of my head. I am thinking it must be anxiety. I think I overreact. 

I feel like writing this out is helpful. 

Reddit, I would love some advice on what to do next.

254,"It’s currently 3:30am on a school night so sorry for any errors. 

(15, female)

So in September of last year, I met a guy on a game online and we’ve been talking ever since. We became really good friends and would speak everyday and tell each other everything.

Except I hid my mental state, just like I did with everybody.

(TW!!)

I’ve been suicidal for about 4 years and have struggled with self harm since I was 11. At the start of this year my mental health spiralled and my self harm got a lot worse around January time. I told nobody and if people ever noticed anything I would shut them down. 

Then in June, I attempted suicide for the first time. I took an overdose, admittedly nowhere near enough but enough to make me feel really ill. That was one of the worst days/nights of my life. I was off school and got away with telling my mum I had a stomach bug so she didn’t find out.

Again this boy I met had no idea.

Then around September I got into alcohol and was drinking at school and at nights alone. I would post shit on my story and send videos to people begging for help (I was always wasted so I never remember doing it). This friend I told him my password to my socials and would always remove the damage by deleting everything I would send/post.

(I have never met this friend in person, btw)

In my drunken state I confessed to this online friend about everything, my history of abuse, my suicide attempt, my self harm etc.. 

I couldn’t cope with the fact that somebody knew about my problems and so I got a lot worse. He would always check in on me and tell me not to starve myself, harm myself, drink etc

By this time I had attempted suicide for the second time, I shall not disclose how but evidently it failed because I was too intoxicated.

Then one night, I did something that really really fucking horrifies me. I was severely pissed on vodka and in the middle of a massive relapse, completely butchering my arm and this friend calls me because I was posting drunken shit again on my story by mistake. I picked up this FaceTime call and continued to self harm whilst on the phone and he could do nothing about it. 

Honestly, I feel extremely bad about this and it disgusts me that I put somebody in such a horrible position, I couldn’t stop apologising the next day. He doesn’t really know me in person, he shouldn’t need to be burdened by all this.

Anyway, after this I continue my routine of getting pissed, cutting, burning etc for a few weeks. Then this online friend begins to interrogate me about my mental health but he was asking really stupid questions as if he just wanted an excuse to talk about it like:

‘ When you self harm, does it hurt? ‘

And after stuff like this was continuing I began distancing myself from him, my messages became more and more vague and half assed. Him acting like a helicopter parent (I understand he was concerned but it got too invasive) and asking me questions I didn’t want answer made me not want to be around him.

Then in November, I finally broke. I attempted suicide for the 3rd time in 5 months and this time I was hospitalised for quite a while. 

When I was in hospital he confronted me about me distancing my self and I told him to save this conversation for when I’m not in hospital because I was in a REALLY bad place (still am). 

Then the next day he posts a ‘blog’ on a platform that only I know about, none of his friends and family could ever find this, the only person who knows him and could read it was me. 

The ‘blog’ talked about how he hated his autistic dad for various (some justified) reasons and how he wanted to kill himself but he couldn’t because of his mum. Then he said that he had just started self harming and I instantly blamed myself for this because I exposed him to it and he told me time and time again not to do it.

He has never self harmed in the past. Anyway, I asked him if he was okay because this post and he said he ‘accidentally posted it’. Then he started to have a go at me saying he understood how I felt when he was interrogating me despite me just asking if he was okay. I didn’t speak to him until I was wrongfully discharged. I was in a state where I had to be dragged along the floor, kicking and screaming and ripping my clothes apart but couldn’t be sent to a psych ward because they suspect I’m autistic. 

After I was discharged he began trying to talk to me again but we just kept arguing over mental health stuff. At this point I was a broken shell of myself, I relapsed the morning after I was discharged wouldn’t speak to my family or friends. I hadn’t been to school in over a month at this point. 

Then this friend asked me if we could go back to talking like how we did before all of this mental health stuff. I didn’t want to talk to him at all at this point, let alone anybody so I told him I’m not sure. 

Despite this he pushed to make conversations with me and then always direct it back to mental health (questioning my coping ways and recovery failure) even though he knew it would end in an argument. 

Everyday this guilt that I got him into self harm eats away at me and I can’t stop punishing myself for it.
 
Okay that’s the context. 

Here’s what happened yesterday. 
I posted on this ‘blog’ platform about how I (unintentionally) cut my knuckle open and it made me look like a badass. This friend messages me, yelling at me as to why I won’t let him help me. I was asking him how he expected to help somebody through the internet over a knuckle. 

Then he tells me his dads friend committed suicide and his dad was the only person that person could talk to.

So then this friend then said he has ptsd now and that every time he talks to me it triggers his ptsd (because of my suicidal behaviour and lack of recovery). I told him to not talk to me anymore because I felt physically sick that I was allegedly triggering somebody’s PTSD, it must be horrible, even though he would always bring the topics up himself and message me first. 

Then all of a sudden he apologises and says he didn’t mean to say all of that he just got angry because of this knuckle injury I posted about.

So here’s what I need advice with:

 I really, REALLY don’t want to talk to this person anymore (he’s caused me several relapses in just 2 weeks from these arguments alone, I had not told him this because I don’t like to talk about mental health stuff and I wouldn’t want him to feel any guilt) because I’m supposed to be in recovery but my mental health is still quickly declining and urge to not fucking follow through with my new plans to commit  is becoming a harder test everyday.

However, I don’t want to cut him off because he’s said that I’ve helped him a lot and he’s also expressed suicidal thoughts on that ‘accidental blog’ and I don’t want something bad to happen to him because it will be all my fault.

I feel so trapped. I know this is mostly my fault for exposing him to self harm and stuff but I’ve hardly been sane this past year, and now I’m staying away from alcohol because of what I’ve done.

I’ve been writing this for a fucking hour it’s now 4:30am pretty much. 

I need advice. Sorry this was really long.",05Dec2019,1
255,"Last night I put out a post asking for how to deal with our feminist teacher, and a lot of you guys helped, and were on my side. So, I wanted to provide an update, as well as asking how to deal with this as like the final blow.

256,"I have a close friend of mine, who is named Olivia. We've been friends for a very long time, ever since elementary school. However as the years passed I noticed that Olivia's mental health was starting to get worse and worse. I'm so worried for her but I don't know what to do because our school doesn't do much to help with these kinds of situations and Olivia rejects help from both my friend and I.   
Olivia gets bullied a lot in school due to her appearance. A lot of kids in our middle school call her names or call her 'creepy' because of how she looks. I tried to stop it before, but they just wouldn't listen. Our school office has sort of a bias towards her because she gets sent to the office a lot. This is because Olivia is quite sensitive and if someone calls her names that anger her (which happens a lot), she can get very mad.   
About a year and a half ago I noticed how Olivia started cutting herself. I saw some cuts on her wrist and she quickly pulled up her sleeve afterwards and pretended that nothing happened, and changed the subject. However today my friend just told me that she cut herself again. She then told my friend that she was thinking about suicide and both my friend and I are really scared and panicked.

I'm just so scared and unsure of what to do. I don't want to tell any adults in our school this, because nothing gets done with them. Olivia's parents are also not the best parents (one is a hoarder). I'm so scared and worried about Olivia, because I don't want to lose a friend, but I just don't know what to do without overstepping Olivia's wishes (she doesn't want us to tell anyone).",05Dec2019,1

258,"This is going to be long, TL;DR at bottom.  Also warning about mental illness and stuff along those lines.  This is a throwaway btw.

So, context. Me (18F) and my sister(16F) are really close. We're 14 months  apart to the day close. I'm leaving for college next year, and she'll be a highschool senior.  Two years ago, she tried to take  her life at school, and I was  the person she texted goodbye to. This was traumatic for me, Im the oldest and I'm supposed to protect my siblings. After that she transferred schools and both me and her started to go to therapy. I didn't end up going until it was obvious. One day I just blew up at my mom. And, it helped. 

But, I stopped going. My life got busy, and I was doing fine. My dad started a new job, and in an effort to save money I haven't gone back. I'll let my sister go, she needs it more than me. So, I'll talk to my friends (whom I trust) about it. 

So the problem. I'm not better. I've regressed. I used to get triggers pretty badly. When I was taking anatomy, and I had a really bad attack when talking about the neck bones snapping when someone hangs themself. But, they were going away. She's had  a few episodes since then, all of which are extremely hard for me. I'm trying to be apathetic, and not care, but it's making me void of any emotion.

I don't talk about this with my friends. My sister thinks I'm to blame that people know she has these problems. I know that I can't 100% be certain that I am in the wrong (she posts on her story all the time about being done ((something that  also gives me adrenaline spikes)) )

Yet, If  see a stand alone text that says 'im sorry' My adrenaline spikes and I can't shake the feeling for an hour or so. Today, my mom was at my little brother's bball game, and she was roped into keeping score for the teams. I didn't know that, and when she said she couldn't talk then, my mind jumped to the worst thing possible, My brother was hurt (or worse) and I failed again.

I think I have some sort of anxiety problem now. But, I don't want to ask my parents bc of the money, and I don't have a close relationship with my doctor bc we just changed doctors. Is there anything I can do to help myself without inhibiting others?

Sorry if this was a mess I just needed to get my thoughts out there. I'm thinking im going to bottle up my feelings and wait until college to get help.  Until then I'm journaling how I feel.

Meaning I have a close bond with his sad and he with both my parents to the point where we both have keys and basically don't need to be with the each other to even go to their places.

A few months back he got a girlfriend (F20) and she's absolutely beautiful and was studying hard at college, I was lowkey proud. I was really happy and excited for him when I heard but she has done nothing but give me dirty looks and pulled away from me. In the beginning I just accepted it and thought she needed to realise how close we were before she stopped seeing me as a threat or possibly if she was just really shy and insecure. I wanted to give it a chance to kinda form with time so I try to be nice all the time, show her how much I wanted to be friends with her too.

Here comes the tricky part, she has started being very possessive of him and at first it was just like always choose me first. It's his girl she was clingy I didn't care, then she kinda made him stay home from a trip because she wanted help with studying, he had planned it for several months with an old friend who was traveling away the week after he came to visit. 
Then she started answering his texts. Telling both me and another close friend of ours (who is gay for lol) to back of and not talk to him. She has now told me to get out of his life and stay away from him.

I want to tell him because I feel like he doesn't get to do anything and she's controlling him but it's also his relationship and I don't want to meddle with his relationship. I don't really know what to do and just don't want to see him in a bad situation.",05Dec2019,1

We’ve done two informative speeches in the past for the class, and I’ve had a deep regret for both of them. I didn’t get poor grades, I just felt like I blew my opportunity to influence my peers and teachers. I really wish I would have done more of VSauce topics (really fundamental, world view changing, interesting topics) instead of what I did.

My flaws:
I'm stubborn as hell
I dont like being told what to do by anyone, including bosses
Emotionally sensitive 
Take things too seriously 

I suffer with anxiety and major depression and tonight I realised it's because I'm just always trying to change those flaws about me. I am always trying to be someone I'm not because it makes other people more comfortable. I'm trying to be someone in not.

And so, what if I just embraced my flaws? Let myself be who I really am. I'd have a much better confidence of ever being used like a doormat, or being ridiculed for standing up for myself.

For instance, I dont like being told what to do and people HATE that. I hate it too, because I get so pissed off when it comes to bosses or anyone ""in charge""...of what? me? You think you're in charge of ME? no.
No one is in charge of anyone.

So, what do you think. Do people live this way? I feel like I'd be a hell of a lot happier embracing my ""flaws"" that society thinks I have-with also the positive traits.

Just embrace everything and stop emotionally torturing myself to fit into society's idea of who I SHOULD be.

288,"Hi I'm (F21) a college student in my junior year, graduating one semester late because I switched majors mid-sophomore year, so each semester I take 15-16 credits to keep up. My department focuses on interdisciplinary art/design, so we take a lot of different studio classes to expand our skills across different mediums. It's everything from computer programming, photo/video, sound, graphic design, web design, printmaking and so on. I love it! Anyways, I've been working full time, 40hrs a week to help my parents pay for my tuition since my sophomore year. I work in retail and I'm an assistant manager. Everybody is around the same age, we get along great, have similar interests and so on. My senior year is approaching and I want to start taking myself more serious as an artist, so I'm prepared for life post grad. My classes keep getting more and more intense (which I expected)  and it's getting increasingly more difficult to balance my job and school. I don't sleep well, eat well, or feel like I'm taking advantage of the resources I have while at college because I'm always burnt out or in a rush. If I quit my job, I don't know how I'll be able to pay for my tuition, but if I keep my job, I don't think I'll be able to continue running myself into the ground to get through my classes. My classes are really work intensive, and involve a lot of time spent outside of class to finish projects. I just don't know if I should cut back on my class schedule for next semester so I'm able to work (and graduate even later), or if I should just quit all together and focus on school.

293,"For the last 16 months I've had a serious anxiety
Issue and I think I may have paranoia. It comes and goes now and then meaning that although I always have that worry about few things in my past that I think are gonna ruin my life, sometimes it's worse and sometimes it's something that's more on the back of my mind and only comes up if I have nothing else to do/ think about. At its worst I think about those events for every second of every day. 

I've always been a worrier, but for the last 16 months everything has been significantly worse. 

Additionally, I sometimes get this feeling like I can take on the world. For the last week I've felt very low and hopeless. I would sleep a lot and I would each much more than usual. I had no motivation to do anything and even fell back into my old video game habit. I haven't played  video games since about March. 

Today, I woke up and I felt absolutely amazing. I couldn't describe it. I felt like I could do anything. I was very confident when I was speaking to people, my mind was racing. I study maths and my mind I could do calculations rapidly. I even think fast in general. I was felt really charged like I could run for ages and I was singing so much. It's still there, but I'm kind of tired now/ ready for bed so I'm not A charged. 

I understand this could point to bipolar, but I very rarely feel depressed. It's more anxiety than anything else and I've always numbed myself by playing video games. I used to spend years just playing video games and watching TV almost all day. The rest of the time I would do a sport. I barely studied at all, but sometimes I had a massive urge to do so. 

**What could all this be pointing to**? 

I'm supposed to get psychotherapy for my anxiety/paranoia soon, but I think this is worth mentioning to my therapist. I had an initial assessment with her and she didn't really see depression in me, but she definitely saw a very, very high degree of anxiety. 

I think it's also worth mentioning that I was physically and emotionally abused as a child. I also get suicidal thoughts now and then, but I've never acted on it.

4 weeks later, 4 weeks before the third midterm, and 2 weeks before I was leaving before on my trip I went to his office hours. He said he was thinking about dropping the midterm from my grades (aka I would not take it, it would not be in my gradebook) but needed to make sure if it was possible. I emailed him a week later asking if he had found out if he could, he said he hadn't.

The dark place is a little hard to describe. I never know how I get there or how I leave. It always wants me to return though. As the day goes on, I can feel it making me weary. It gets stronger when the sun goes down. I tried to resist its pull, but eventually I close my eyes and I enter it.

The dark place it's always different. It's hazy. It doesn't follow our laws of reason or continuity. I find myself briskly taken from event to event without anything connecting the moments. I meet doppelgangers of people I know acting in strange manners. And sometimes I am chased by horrid beasts. I do not like the dark place.

Is it real? Is it fake? Have I been taken to another world? Is it another dimension? Is it another plane of existence? I do not know. I simply know I do not like the dark place.

I've been trying forever to solve the problem of the dark time. However, nothing seems to be working. No matter how long I avoid it, it's pull wears me down and I find myself in the dark place. I fear that one day I'll be trapped there forever.

She is fine, few scratches, bruises, a little whiplash, but to think that for a brief second she could have died... My world shattered. So many things I didn’t do. 

But anyway, apparently her ‘current’ boyfriend won’t answer any of her calls or even come to get her, or whatever, so she wants me to come get her instead. All she keeps saying is, “Fuck Him, I don’t need him, It’s Over!” and begins claiming that she misses the old times we had, saying that she has always been thinking about me a lot, and I should come pick her up so we can start a new relationship. At one time, I did care for her a great deal, more than anyone else I have ever been with throughout my entire life. I would even say that I loved her more than anything, but she broke my heart. …  


So now you see my dilemma. I am sitting here conflicted.

307,"So going against the grain here and ask for something rather simple, I am having issues with buying a new-to-me car/repairing my car. Recently I got a flat, ended up ripping the bumper off getting on the trailer to get it home, two weeks later i.e. Saturday I hit a big ol deer and caused about $1k in parts and estimated $1.4k in labor, to my car. I have been more thinking the option to just find a new car and use the insurance money and whatever I can get for my car in its current state to put towards something else.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, my car currently is a 2013 VW GLi and at best my car in good shape is worth $6k. To get it repaired will take a few weeks I'd assume judging on other repairs I've had to get done and by friends experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my biggest thing here is would it be more worth it to fix the car and just let them do what they need to or to look for something new. My area currently really has limited options within about 2 hours from me on cars I'm interested in and price point. I have found, however, a good amount of cars that would need to be shipped to a close dealership in order to look at and do all the normal buying a car stuff. I assume the price on delivery is based on distance and what not so any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. I'm not sure exactly what kind of advice I'm looking for and can supply any other information if needed.

313,"Hi guys, thanks for taking the time to open this. I've been here for a term now. In this short amount of time, I've realised that I'm really not up to scratch on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

I've realised -- especially relevant considering the time at which I'm writing this -- that my sleep schedule is incredibly out of wack. I've been going to Tesco's at around three in the morning for the past couple weeks and if I don't have a lecture I'm rarely awake before three in the afternoon. My typical bedtime has become about half three and sometimes I'll have to get up for lectures at ten the same morning.

Sometimes I suffer from insomnia due to emotional discomfort, but sometimes my late nights will be because I want to stay up with some of my more nocturnal flatmates and enjoy my time with them. I realise that this isn't healthy though. This means I usually skip breakfast. And lunch. Even when I have the time to make either, I lack the motivation to do so and just get on with whatever I'm doing at the time. I don't think I've had breakfast in four weeks, and I definitely haven't had lunch once past the first week of term (we're now in week 10). Dinner is also a rare occasion for me and I'll often skip it. When I do eat, it's usually a load of shit (biscuits, sweets, pot noodles, etc.)

My time management is also awful. I have eight contact hours with the university and so I'm unsure on how to actually spend the rest of my time, or even how long I should be spending studying a day/week. This can mean that I overwork myself for long periods, sometimes up to eight hours in one sitting, and then will do nothing at all for the next two days because I'll be exhausted.

I also have really bad habits where money is concerned. Fortunately, I haven't exceeded my loan (though this is in part due to not buying food some weeks), but I tend to impulse buy the worst possible things, including whatever bestsellers I see in the fiction chart, posters, and a neglected tarantula. This impulsiveness has become typical of my behaviour in pretty much all aspects of life.

Another thing of concern is that out of boredom I have taught myself how to throw kitchen knives into our communal pinboard. I'd never do it when anybody is around, but I realise that this behaviour is incredibly anti-social and runs the risk of causing damage or hurting somebody. Yet I continue to do it when alone because it feels so satisfying to do.

I like to live my life based on having a positive effect on others and making them happy. This was why I bought the poorly cared for tarantula. Despite having good intentions, this decision caused a mental breakdown in one of my flatmates and I'm now looking to rehome it. There's an aspect of my feelings about this that I can't quite articulate, but I know that I feel awful about the repercussions of that decision and that I need to do the right thing now.

As all of these things are both affecting myself and others very badly, I want to get them in check. I just don't know where to start. I'm looking at this list and realising where the points for improvement are, but in looking I only make the task more daunting for myself as I continue to ask myself how exactly I'm going to do all of these things.

What do I do?

Thanks for taking the time to read this.",05Dec2019,1
314,"For some background, me, my ex, and our mutual friend are all 20F. We met in our first year of college and have been really close ever since. My ex and I started hooking up our first year and went in circles with each other until halfway through our sophomore year. She freaked out on me, told me she never wanted to see me again, and I fucked off. Three days later, she started sleeping with a close friend of mine who I'll call Jeff.

Jeff told me all of the details of their relationship. I hated every minute of it and was very uncomfortable with it. My ex decided a month after the freakout that she wanted to be friends again, and I agreed because I missed her. She talked to me about Jeff and asked me for advice about him often, despite knowing I was somewhat upset still. They broke up due to incompatibility after about two months together, but she and I remained close.

Over the summer, she came to visit me and showed up with two rings. We pretended to be engaged for a free dessert and went too far with the game. I had only seen it as a joke, but she got carried away with the details and insisted on keeping up the gag for three days, until she eventually panicked and backed out because it felt too real. She made it very clear that she did not want to have a romantic relationship with me ever again. I said ok, though I was a bit hurt, and let it go.

I went to study abroad for four months pretty much right after the ""engagement"" fiasco. I met someone there who was perfect for me. She was absolutely model gorgeous, kind, intelligent, and just generally fun to be around. We dated for most of the time I was there and I really felt like I had come into my own. I posted pictures of her all the time and told everyone from home how overjoyed I was. Most of my friends seemed to be happy for me, but my ex would get standoffish and annoyed anytime I even mentioned my new girlfriend's name without detail (for example if she tried to Facetime, I'd just say, ""I'm with her rn, can we chat later?"" And she would get annoyed.) Contrasted with how she acted with Jeff, I was confused.

I arrived back in the States two weeks ago and she invited me to come visit her. I said yes, provided that I'd crash on her couch. Our mutual friend found out about the visit and called me. She said that my ex likely still has feelings about me, and it isn't fair that I keep getting yanked around like this. 

I was surprised to hear it because my ex treated me with such disdain and seemed to be disgusted by the idea of having a romantic relationship with me. I currently have plans to continue with the visit, but now I'm not so sure. If you've made it through this whole ass saga, please vibe check me with your wisdom.

324,"TL;DR at the end

I am dating a wonderful man. He's smart, kind, funny... and we have a really special chemistry. Our intimacy is magical, we have good conversations, and we both are seeking a longterm commitment. We have only been seeing each other for a few weeks but spend time together 3-4 times a week. In an interlude between a special, intimate moment, I told him I was vegan, that I was a strict vegan but that it is something I do for myself, and that it comes with no expectations on him or anyone else. I am happy living my life the way I do and am a rare vegan that doesn't seek to control the lifestyles of other people. I primarily eat the way I do for health purposes, but am sympathetic to the environmental and animal cruelty aspects now.

A couple days ago I went to his house to spend a little bit of time with him. It was impromtu and he had ordered a pizza, a combination pizza with all the meats on it. I didnt care.

He was reluctant to eat the pizza around me, and wouldn't kiss me because of the "" processed meat from cage-tortured animals"" that was on his breath (he presented it as a joke, but he was serious about the kiss). He refused to kiss me, and what I thought was a cute joke was actually serious.

He told me that he knew I thought meat was nasty and he didn't want to eat it around me (I made a gentle but honest comment about steak one time). When I realized what was going on, I apologized to him and said that I want him to feel comfortable to be himself around me. He said, ""It's me, not you""....

He also smokes cigarettes and refuses to smoke when we are together. Once again, I don't partake but YOU DO YOU! I like him for everything he is, NOT in spite of his habits.

Laying in bed later, I asked him... what will we do if we want to be together? How will you eat then?

He told me that we could agree on ""no contact"" days"" where he could eat meat when I wasn't around.

While I appreciate him not be defensive or aggressive in response to my diet, I feel like this is weird and could impede our connection if things continue to move in the direction of a relationship. I would love to know your thoughts. Does this sound strange to you? Is there anything I can do to fix this?

Thank you for your advice

TL;DR

The guy i'm dating won't kissing me if he is eating meat (I'm vegan) and has said that we can have ""no contact days"" if we become a couple so that he can have meat when I'm not around. I have no issues with his diet.

This guy is vile. Online, he criticized a school for letting a transgender person be valedictorian and implied that the person should be carted off to a institution instead. His wife is part of an Anti-LGBT organization which seeks to have government revoke the marriage rights of anyone LGBT and also wants to have the ""Day Of Silence"" eradicated in schools.

I'm bisexual and they were supportive of me when I came out.

They refuse to switch churches. They say ""oh those are his beliefs and we can't convince him otherwise. We are not homophobic.""

It’s like so easy for me to talk to her like we talked for hours and I wouldn’t run out of anything to say, and we would laugh like the whole time. Everything was going so great but one day she told me that after she graduates she’s moving to Norway for 2 years, and I didn’t really think about that and how it could affect my chances, but a couple days later when we were walking to our cars she told me we should just be friends she said because she’s moving away it’s not really fair for either of us, and she liked hanging out but she’s not in the position to start anything.

333,"Hello, I am currently a freshman in high school. I've recently transferred from private to public school in eighth grade. A year has past, yet I haven't made a single true friend, only acquaintances. In fact, I never really had true friends my entire life. A lot of my attempts at making friends have ended up in failure. I've also realized that when it comes to my own personal boundaries, I realized that I am not that amiable as I think I am. 

When I first transferred to my new middle school, a group of girls approached me. They asked me if they wanted to eat lunch with them. I thought this was some sort of a joke since nothing like this has ever happened to me, but I gave in. We had nice conversations, but I realized that they were taking time to sit with me for lunch instead of their own friends. Their friends got into an argument and said that they should be spending time with them not me. Eventually, they stopped being friends. After that, I felt really guilty. We still sat together, but stopped talking since there was nothing to talk about. Eventually, I've tried being friends with a girl, and I stopped sitting with the other girls for lunch. 

Let's call her Amelia. So every time I've talked to Amelia, the conversation would run dry in a couple of minutes. She also seemed very uninterested in our conversations. I've even questioned her if she was actually her friend. Obviously to avoid hurting my feelings, she said that of course I was. I believe there was a period of time when I got a bit too clingy since I was feeling quite lonely. I met her everyday after school for about two weeks. Eventually, she said that seeing me everyday was a bit too creepy for her. So, I thought that she didn't like me after all. I mean she could have told me earlier on since I wouldn't have had to bother her in the first place. After all, I try to be as amiable as possible. I felt really guilty as a result and refrained from any social interaction possible to avoid such situations again. Often, I would go to the library and avoid social interaction with anyone. I couldn't even eat lunch, especially because we weren't allowed to eat lunch in the library. 

Nearing the end of eighth grade, I've met a group of girls who were nice. They wanted to eat lunch with me and be my ""friends"", except they weren't. Our conversations always ran dry and they mostly talked among themselves. Fast forward to high school, I still sat with those girls for lunch, but eventually I stopped. 

Amelia came up to me one day in my PE class, and said that she was sorry for that confrontation and that she was depressed at that time. She wanted to reconcile and be my friend again. I was happy about it, but I had and still have doubts in my head. I still believe that we're acquaintances and not actual friends. We don't have conversations with any real substance to it. 

I've met some new people at my school. There is a girl who I share classes with, and I want to be her friend, but the same old situation always arises; there is NO SUBSTANCE to it! I'm also afraid of being too clingy like my experiences with Amelia. Because of these awkward situations, whenever I want to talk to someone and walk up to them, I walk past them. I also am really afraid of saying high to people I know because they don't really know them

Anyways, from these experiences, I've learned that I have nothing interesting to say, I may get too clingy at times (well at least that is what I believe according to my therapist), and that I shield myself too much from the outside world at the expense of my mental health. 

Moving on, I've had weird experiences during my PE classes. People who I don't even know talk about me and act as if I'm their friend. There is this one person who acts like my best friend even though he knows nothing about me. Let's call him Houston. So, Houston would always come up to me during PE and give me a high five or fist bump. At first, it was occasional. I was comfortable with that (kind of), but eventually it became an everyday thing. It was so creepy to the point where I told him to stop since I was feeling extremely uncomfortable. He even made scenes out of it when I passively aggressively declined to partake in his greetings. I've told him that I don't like him and that he should leave me alone. Keep in mind that this kid says inappropriate things and thinks vandalizing school property is both funny and okay. So, I have every right to decline his seemingly ""innocent acts of friendship"". I've even told the counselor about it.  There is this other kid whose name I don't know who occasionally makes a scene out of saying hello to me. He knows nothing about me at all as well. He only does this a few times though. He sometimes yells hi \[insert name\] across the locker room. I ignore him and he makes a scene out of it. This kid has made sexual comments about me though like ""\[Insert name\] f\*\*\*ing b\*\*ches"", so I wonder if that justifies my actions. Today, he approached me and asked if I liked him. I said I dislike him. He said that I was in the wrong, and it isn't everyday when someone wants to ask me about my day. I don't know what to do. His words struck me real hard. Who is in the wrong? Am I? Or is it those weird people in my school.

Overall, I feel like I'm in an emotional mess. I can't go on with literally being lonely every single day. I really need advice on making friends, being as amiable as possible, and being respectful when people are making me uncomfortable. What should I do?",05Dec2019,1
334,"So first off, I love my parents. They're great, loving, supportive, all that jazz. However whenever I've broached the topic of not wanting to finish my last year of college they've pushed me to finish multiple times. To be fair, it's been them and my grandparents who have paid for me to attend and I feel like I owe it to them to finish but I can't. I was kicked out once due to poor academic performance resulting from mental health issues I then attended therapy for and was readmitted for this last quarter. The thing is though, I no longer want to do the job I was going to get my degree for and college is, to put it mildly, the least fun thing I've ever gone through. To put it less mildly, I makes me really want to jump off the nearest bridge most of the time (don't worry I'm no longer suicidal, school just still puts it in the back of my mind). I've decided to do something I'd always wanted to do from a young age (it's a creative field) as opposed to my current science major. I honestly just completely do not want to attend the rest of the year and figure if I need to, I can come back on my own dime when I'm ready. Once again the issue is my parents, I want them to understand and accept why I can't finish and so any advice, especially from those who've gone through similar situations would be ggreat.",05Dec2019,1
336,"So I was reading one question where a girl said this guy didn't message her after the date when guys usually message her afterwards and lots of people were telling her that she looks worse in person or doesn't look like her pics. They were saying it like it's fact. What? Have they seen her in person? How do they know that? None of these people were at the date so how do they know she didn't say or do something to the guy that turned him off or he had other intentions etc.?

337,"My partner and I are planning a move across the country (USA) and we can't decide the best option for getting us and our things to the other side of the continent. We don't have many belongings (could all fit in the back of a small pickup or SUV with a roof rack) A few options we have discussed are:

1: Send our things via UPS, USPS, FedEx, or another shipping company. Sell our car. Fly ourselves.
Pros: safe and quickest option.
Cons: unknown cost of shipping.
Difficulties: things may get lost or broken in shipping

2: Use a moving service, sell our car and fly ourselves.
Pros: safe and easy.
Cons: Estimated $3500-4000 cost
Difficulties: We don't have an address yet to deliver the stuff to and our things wouldn't really require a whole moving truck. Pods and other load yourself moving companies do not serve our area.

3: Sell or otherwise pare our belongings down to nearly nothing and fly ourselves.
Pros: quick and easy
Cons: replacing our things can be expensive, it's wasteful.
Difficulties: We have a few things we wouldn't want to get rid of but would be very expensive to ship ( bikes and surfboard )

4: Load all of our things in our 1994 Ford Ranger and take a road trip after getting the truck in as good shape as we can.
 Pros: Fun and exciting if all goes well, we wouldn't have to get a new car at the other end.
Cons: Being in an older vehicle, we might break down and parts of the US are very empty. 
Difficulties: we are anxious about the car breaking down and getting stuck in a rural abyss

5: Uhaul, sell the car and drive across.
Pros: road trip without so much anxiety
Cons: Will cost even more than a moving company.
Difficulties: Same as moving service, road trip would be very rushed.

6: Put a down payment on a newer car and take that across.
Pros: a more reliable ride, fun.
Cons: expense

For reference, our car is a 1994 Ford Ranger with 160k miles that we generally don't take out of town for fear of a breakdown. We have never fully broken down before but it acts funny if driven more than about 100 miles. We would have a mechanic look at it and fix anything obviously wrong with it. We have about 10k for the move and we are both employable when we get there.

TLDR: We have a bunch of options of how to move CA - MA. Our car is old and other options are very expensive. What is the best option?",05Dec2019,1

Every time I have one of these sudden bursts of interest in a topic or activity, I quickly become obsessed with it and set a goal for some milestone I want to achieve in regards to said topic. I always seem to pick up the next interest before I can complete my goals on the previous and end up regretting this “failure”.

341,"So I'm at college, living in a pretty tight triple as a part of an apartment style suite with four other dudes (triple+double+shared spaces). I've been very fortunate to have had no complaints of any kind with them thus far, except one. 

My desk with gaming PC setup is directly across from a roommate's bed, with maybe three feet in between (if that). Every single time I have attempted to game, the roommate with the parallel bed HAS to stand right over my shoulder. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I'm the type of person that gets put extremely on edge when people hover over/behind them, and I have stated this calmly MULTIPLE times, and still haven't been able to play for 30 seconds without him looking over me for over a month and a half now. Doesn't matter what time of day it is, what game I'm playing, what he has to get done, there will always be laundry for him to fold or something while he stands behind me commenting on what I do, bumping into my chair, playing YouTube videos loudly on his phone. It's completely sucking all of the fun out of gaming for me, something I've been doing for years.

I got especially fed up with it today, he was frequently bumping into my chair and BLASTING a video and just standing there for no reason whatsoever. I hard shutdown the computer, slammed it shut, and quickly walked out to the kitchen to do something else. He pokes his head out from the door to say ""that was pretty rude."" I didn't respond.

Keep in mine other than this ONE issue, he's a genuinely considerate guy. It may seem odd that this isn't a part of a larger antagonist, but he's more than agreeable to be around in any other situation.

342," Ok long story short I got a call back today from a job I applied to a couple of days ago. The manager called me while I was in class and set up an interview with me. I was kind of scatter brained because I was about to take an exam. I know it was a little later in the day but I’m second guessing the time I thought she said. They open at 6am, would it be rude to call in the morning to confirm the time? I don’t want them to think I am unorganized or irresponsible especially considering we just spoke on the phone prior. 

Thanks!",05Dec2019,1
343,"I apologize in advance for the length of this and I hope you take the time to read, my family is in a real bind right now. 

 My 85 year old Granny has severe dementia. My Uncle Dick has power of attorney, and would not use Granny's money to pay a caregiver or put her in a nursing home for the past 5 years that she has been unable to take care of herself. He claims that he is afraid she will run out of money if he does, but my mom said Granny has upwards of 100 grand saved. Dick has moved her entire savings out of her account and somewhere else that no one else in the family knows. My guess is that Dick wants to spend some of it now and keep the money when she passes. 

So, because Granny CANNOT BE ALONE, mom has taken care of her full time for the past 5 years (not getting paid, so she didn't have a job that whole time). Eventually mom needed to start back working to be able to pay her bills. She told Dick this, and instead of hiring someone, he moved in with Granny because he can work remotely. HE DOES NOT TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER. He will not assist her in using the bathroom or showering, and barely watches her. On top of that, he is completely rude to her and insensitive about her condition. Well about a month ago, she fell (shocker, he doesn't watch her!) and she was admitted to a hospital where she laid in a bed the majority of the time and lost all of her strength to get up out of a chair, when she was able to get around the house with a walker before. When Drew visited her there, he spent  most of his time being mean to Granny and attempting to flirt with the younger nurses (CRINGE).

This is where it gets weird. For some reason I can't figure out, Dick then told the nurses not to tell anyone in the family any information regarding her condition except for him.  The rest of the family, who do much more for her and care about her more than Dick does, were shocked, confused, and offended. We just want to know what's going on with her health condition. 

Then Granny was moved to a rehab center (Dick only allowed it because her insurance covered it), where she is never allowed to get up and all she has when no one is visiting her is a TV and her small porcelain dalmatian that she always keeps in her pocket and guards with her life. It reminds her of her ""favorite dog in the whole world"", Jasmine, my mom's dog. The rehab center allowed my mom to take Jasmine to visit Granny. One day, Mom went in with Jasmine and Granny literally cried tears of joy at the sight of her. Uncle Dick is one of those people who doesn't like any dog no matter how loving and well behaved. He happened to show up a couple of hours later, and an argument ensued between him and my mom because he insisted that the dog not be allowed in Granny's house anymore when they go back there. My mother was furious, because as I said, Jasmine brings Granny immense joy in this confusing and depressing period in her life when barely anything else does. After putting his walking cane in my mother's face and threatening to hit her, he had her and the dog escorted out by security.

While I was visiting Granny at the rehab center about a week ago, I overheard a nurse telling Dick that Granny would be released this past Sunday. Dick would not tell anyone in the family this information. I of course told my mom though, who went over to Granny's house which has always been an open door to everyone in the family and we have always visited her regularly with no problems. Upon her arrival with her dog, Dick met her at the locked screen front door. He told her to go away, she and the dog are not allowed in, and if they try to come in he will call the police. They argued, and my mom got Granny's outside plants in her car to take in for the winter and humbly drove home, furious. Dick texted to let mom know he told all the neighbors to call the police if they saw her show up to Granny's house.

Today, my brother who has visited Granny at least once a week for as long as I can remember, showed up at Granny's house. He is the most polite and calm person you would ever meet. He rang the doorbell, Dick kept the screen door locked and told him he can't come in because he is on the phone with a nurse right now and he needs to go away. My brother heard Granny yelling at Dick inside the house, and Dick insisted he leave now. 

I, my other nicer uncle, my mom, and my brother have been trying to contact Dick over the phone for days asking for updates on Granny and he refuses to answer the phone or respond to texts from anyone. 

Granny, in her fleeting moments of understanding who people are and what's going on, has said these things in the past week:

""My daughter and Jasmine are ALWAYS allowed in my house,""

(to Dick) ""Please be kind to one another.""

(to my mom) ""I'm sorry he (Dick) has turned out to be such a fraud.""

My mom has called me crying for the past week and it has me absolutely furious. I feel that legally we are not going to be able to touch this guy because he happens to be a lawyer. I really don't know what to do, or to tell my mom to do. She is planning to send adult protective services over to check on the situation. Hopefully they will determine that he is not taking good care of her and something can be done after that. My mom is also going to demand that he give up the bank statements to make sure he is not just blowing her money. 

What would you do? How would you deal with this? Has anyone experienced anything like this before? Any advice is appreciated.",05Dec2019,1

This school is near multiple military bases, and a buncha federal land. I live on said federal land after moving in about a week ago. It was hard to say goodbye to everything I've done and everyone i met, but i had to do it. The thing is, my family isn't even military, so i don't fit in at all.

This school is also obviously upper-class, as each student gets a chromebook to take home, but luckily you don't have to wear a uniform or anything. I just don't feel right there.

Now keep in mind this chick is white and has no place saying that. In a split second I feel like fucking beating her ass but then I think twice because she’s a girl. Instead I just stood there dumbfounded while they walked away. I contemplated speaking to the teacher about it but decided against it (keep in mind I haven’t even spoken to this chick before and I don’t even know her name). I just want to know if I should’ve said something. If that was a boy I stg I wouldn’t think twice. Should I have said something?,05Dec2019,1
350,"So I know it's not good behaviour to ""hack into"" his accounts like that whatever. He has cheated on me  before and i know his ability at making seem like I'm the crazy one and I needed proof! 

Let start from the begining: his coworker is too friendly and I dont like that shit. One day as I picked him up from work, I saw him with someone else and thought i saw them hugging. I asked him who it was. He said it was his co worker (f) and when  I asked as a joke why they were hugging. He got immediately defensive and said they were fist bumping. It didnt matter i said oh okay and let it go. 
Later on, I was on his phone for directions in the car and his ""coworker"" texted him calling him names, something like babe or honey. And I confronted him about it he got defensive saying it's a white girls thing and we started arguing. During the arguement he revealed that he did hug her (it doesnt matter that he hugs a friend what bothers me is that he lied about it). 

We were super transparent with our phones and we can use it whenever. Until recently. I noticed he would take his phone everywhere he would go in the house. (One time he wanted to charge his phone and also take a shower, the phone charger was next to me, he unplugged and brought it to the bathroom). I know this doesnt prove anything but it also shows that I am not allowed on his phone anymore. 

Earlier today he fell asleep next to me while watching something so I took his phone and I looked through it and noticed he deleted (again) his conversations with her. I say again bc this has been something bothering me, bc one day I see he texted her about work stuff, and later on the whole conversation is gone. 
I had the bright idea to change his text me app password, log onto it from my phone and waited. I then confronted him about it that I saw he deleted his conversation again and dared him to text that colleague and show me their conversations. (I was in a different room and we were texting so he was sending me screenshots) 
It went something like this 

Him : yo 
Coworker : what's up babe 
*H Quickly deletes the answer from C*
*I ask if she answered and tell him to text again* 
H: my girl is testing my loyalty please dont flirt back
C: ok
*H deletes the last two messages* 
H: wyd this weekend? 
.... 
And he shows me only him asking her out and her saying shes working. 

Long story short, I have proof and screenshots shes calling him babe and him deleting that shit. 

What should I do next? Should I come clean? 
Should I wait for more evidence? 
Please note he is very good to make it seem like hes doing nothing wrong and that I'm dumb for not trusting him. He is good manipulator. I have been trying to get out of the relationship for a while but he clings onto me and makes it impossible to move on.

So I broke up with him, no I didn’t not explain to him what happen, I stated I wasn’t happy and that’s all I had the guts to do. I was sure he wasn’t happy either, I think we grew apart and that’s fine but obviously I knew I wanted something new. Weeks before our break up I was thinking about breaking up with him, I imagined this life of talking to whatever boy I wanted, flirting, having sex etc. Although now, I really don’t think I want to have sex or party or whatever.

This is clear to me you don’t like me as well, but i can’t keep interacting with you as if I never confessed anything.

I ended a 4 year abusive and toxic relationship which ended up in court over no contact orders. I've lost friends I've had since highschool and spent most of 2018 unemployed, living with my dad. I got a better job than the one I was fired from and worked to save for my move out. After 10 months at my dad's I moved out found a way better job and met an amazing person that I've spent nearly every day with. That was until she ended things with me. I pretty much started my life over and have few friends that have stuck around. My life has yet again gone through a very dramatic change that I was absolutely unprepared for. 2019 has been one of the best years and one of the worst all in one.

I tried both and it just makes me feel even more alone. Almost everyone I've talked to tries to keep me aware of everything I've overcome in the last year. It's funny how living with your dad and being unemployed looks like rock bottom to everyone. It's wasn't, all I've managed to accomplish is a disguise and a place to just exist. I miss my old friends, I miss my girlfriend, I miss finding joy and being content. My body and mind doesn't have the energy to go through all this again.

I honestly feel like shit. And i have for some time now. I feel like a blanket of sadness is just suffocating me right now. That's the best I can describe it. I have lost interest in a lot of the things I liked. I pushed everyone away and isolated myself. I never feel like eating. I have become apathetic to most things but at the same time the littlest of things upset me. I feel like giving up.  I won't say I am depressed because I never was diagnosed.

I now have trouble speaking to people and I can't even make eye contact. Talking to people has become a difficult task to do and I sometimes panic for no reason when interacting with anyone. My speaking and comprehensions skills are so bad that multiple professors have asked multiple times if I am okay. I must really sound crazy or something.

Nothing bad ever happened to me. So, I don't know why I feel this way. And yes I have thought about killing myself a few  times. But, knowing me, they are just thoughts. And I believe a lot of people what thought about it.

I tried telling my mom about this when I was 16 and she just said that it was just a phase. ""all girls go through this dramatic ass phase. You're fine."" but i sure as hell don't feel fine. I'm 18 and I honestly am feeling worse. It has been the hardest years of my life. I tried telling my mom again but she really just shrugged me off saying that I am fine. She even is getting mad at me trying to talk to her about it. I asked to see a therapist about it just to talk to someone and she said no because they are expensive. I don't have a job or money so I can't get one myself.

So, Reddit, y'all my therapist now. What do you think of this? Am I just being dramatic. I don't know what to do.

I honestly feel defeated and I shouldn't. Especially not at this age.",05Dec2019,1
362,"First off, I’m 25 and just graduated with my engineering degree in August. I got an engineering job at the end of October and now make more than double what I was at my part-time turned full-time job as a bank teller before I graduated. 

When I graduated high school, I wanted to move away for school but my two older brothers convinced me to go the cheapest route by going to a community college and transfer to the nearby university and live at home. Admittedly, this saved me a lot of money in loans but I feel like I missed out on a college experience by living in this tiny town that’s 20 minutes from anywhere with my deeply religious and conservative parents. 

While I’ve lived with them, I’ve needed help paying for miscellaneous expenses like major car repairs and I’ve racked up about $6k in debt to them which they want me to totally pay back before I move out. My dad is retired from the government and my mom was a stay-at-home for most of my life. Now that I’ve got a pretty good paying job, I can finally start paying them but as a single 25 year old who works in a major city, and drives an hour to work every morning, it’s tough. I can’t stand being here anymore. I need more socialization and activity without having to trek across state lines to go home. 

My mom is a borderline hoarder who takes everything personally. I can’t eat as healthy as I would like to because the fridge is always full of random shit,  my younger brother has his girlfriend over a lot and honestly I can’t stand her, I could go on and on. I’m the black sheep of the family with tattoos, admitting to them I’m not Catholic or even Christian, and I’m a fan of marijuana which I’m sure they know but nobody has said anything yet. (Side note: it’s going to be legal in my state come Jan. 1)

I already spend most of my weekends at my friends place 45 minutes away and barely any time at home other than for sleeping. I know that I can pay them off fairly quickly now but it would still take several months and After 7 years, I honestly don’t feel like I can do this anymore. 

I’ve slowly realized that I haven’t actually been happy in years. I’m a happy and easy going person but I’m not truly happy and I think that’s because of my living situation. I’ve had a mostly non-existent love life since the first year of college. I can get dates but once they find out my living situation it doesn’t go much further. I don’t really have a place to call my own and to be myself. I feel like I have to wear this facade whenever I’m home. I feel like I’m being held back in a major area of personal growth. How do I tell them I need to move out for my own mental health without them taking it personally?

Tl;dr   I’m a single 25 year old working in a major city with a decent paying job but living in a small podunk town an hour away. I owe my parents about $6k and they want me to pay them back in full before I move out but for my own sanity and mental health I think I need to get my own place before then.",05Dec2019,1
364,"This happened about 6 months ago: This girl was my really good friend. People stopped hanging out with her because she was lying about certain things, but I overlooked it because she was a good friend. She spread some lies about my friend though, so I decided to cut her off. A week later she tries manipulating me into buying her Juul pods and I blew up and sent her a really nasty message. I regret it and shouldn’t have been that mean. Her boyfriend called me that she was crying and I sent her a message that I regret how I said it, but not what I said and blocked them both. However, I see them both on campus and feel guilty and how I left things when she was always good to me. Should I leave things be and not stir things up or apologize? Thoughts?",05Dec2019,1

367,"She has “quit” more times than I care to count, but it never lasts for more than a month at most despite the constant support of my family. It’s the same thing every time, too: A generally mild inconvenience that overwhelms her, leading her back to drinking and putting her in an even worse place than she was before.  

I have no problem with people who drink, but the way my mom does it puts herself and her health at risk. Not only that but she isn’t herself from the moment she takes that first sip, which can happen anywhere from 10am to 3pm. She gets louder, she talks about anything that comes to her mind virtually without filter, she doesn’t hear half the things you say to her as she tunes in/out at random, she says things that she’ll repeat later several times as if it’s the first time she’s said it, and she loses all regard for responsibility, be it to her job or as a mother to her kids.  

On top of all of that, as if it weren’t enough, she drives fairly regularly in various states of intoxicated, even driving *while* drinking most times. This is rather new behavior, at least to my knowledge, and it’s become the last straw of mine and my family’s with regards to her condition. I try to offer to drive her places whenever possible but she typically refuses and drives herself anyway. My siblings have largely shut her out of their lives, speaking to her maybe once a week if they have to. My dad feels like she has reached a point of no return, and has also largely given up on trying to help her or communicate with her (despite being married 25+ years, living together and sharing a bed). Ultimately they do their best to avoid her, and tolerate her when unable to do so.  

I haven’t given up on my mom, but I feel like she has given up on herself. Despite her knowing that she’s an alcoholic, she’s still a functioning one and will remain that way until she just isn’t one day; a day that will mean either rock bottom or death.  

When my mom is sober, there is no better person to be around than her. She’s smart, talented, funny, sweet, and outgoing. There isn’t a soul that doesn’t like her and that she doesn’t like just as much. I could brag about her without end. This only makes it harder to watch her change, every day, into someone that I don’t even recognize.  

I don’t know what to do, but I can’t do nothing anymore. How can I help her when she doesn’t even realize she needs it?",05Dec2019,1
368,"Idk how to explain it but I grew up very poor in the middle of nowhere in a blue collar family. K-12 I didn't have friends outside of school or any extra curricular activities aside from work when I was in high school. All the very basic childhood experiences that people have had, I didnt. This was a result of my parents being too poor and too busy and never around.

I'm about to graduate college but college is the same with being too poor and busy as a full time worker and full time commuter student. No college experience or lasting colleague relationships. I have some close friends outside school, but I barely see them and my social life is miniscule. 

I feel like work and money has been a drain. Work and money, wether it be me or my parents, is why I can't do anything. And I'm scared of being like this for the rest of my life.

I'm very very sad. I wish I had a life full of good memories but I simply don't. I'm scared of it becoming the rest of my life.

When I get out of college and do nothing but.. work, how am I going to get all the rich experiences that life should have? How do I get to do all these wonderful things that other people get to do.",05Dec2019,1
369,"I was staying with my boyfriend and his parents temporarily in Nebraska. My SO and I had traveled from Arizona to visit his parents before heading to Oregon where I had lived previous to Arizona. While we were in NE I was charged and sentenced with a misdemeanor DUI 2nd offense in late 2014 - 2015. My dumb mistake really screwed up our plans, which were to not remain in NE any longer than necessary. My boyfriend is from a small town in Nebraska and it's a great place to grownup, an ok place to visit but not the kind of place we wanted to stay for an extended length of time. 
Having stupidly sentenced myself to an extended stay in Nebraska I was terribly unhappy. I had no family or friends in the state. I had no support system and I also suddenly found myself in an abusive, unsafe living situation. I was terribly miserable as I went through the lengthy court and sentencing process. 
I was finally sentenced and required to get an interlock device for 6 months, pay a fine, and do one year of probation. Although I made it clear to my lawyer that I was not a permanent resident of the state, it made no difference. Unable to pay for my own representation, my court-appointed lawyer was overworked, had too many clients, and just didn't have the time or want to help me by bringing my situation up in court to the judge.
I went to see my probation officer for the first time. I explained my situation to her. She told me that it was possible to apply for a probation transfer and that she would have to approve the transfer as would the  state that I was moving to and that if I followed the rules of my probation and proved myself more responsible now than I had been when I was arrested, she said she would take a transfer into consideration. She added that having lived in Arizona prior to coming to Nebraska, not being a resident of Oregon, it was unlikely that I would get an approvaI from Oregon to transfer my probation anyway. She also added while reviewing my file that because I had been residing in NE for an extended period of time now, since before I had been arrested and had a job,  (which I acquired to stay out of jail, keep busy, have an income and show the judge that I was a responsible person. I had to do something while I waited the five months for my sentencing) and a car and a place to live obviously I had established residency and could complete my probation. Regardless, if I wanted a probation transfer I would still be looking at a very long process. I would still be looking at many more months in my living situation which had become more stressful and difficult to handle. 
I attempted to get assistance from the three agencies in the small town I was in that helped women get out of abusive situations. Each one was unable to help me and referred me to the next agency until I ran out of resources. I was not eligible for assistance as a woman in a domestic violence situation because the perpetrator was not my SO but his father.
We ended up leaving NE and I had no intention of ever returning. I obtained the interlock device, choosing a national company that serviced and removed them so that when it came time, I could have it removed in any state. I kept it for the required six months, then had it removed on the date permitted. Only I was then living in Oregon. I did not inform my probation officer that I was leaving. I did not pay my fines and I didn't complete my probation. I got in my car and headed for Oregon never looking back.
Once in Portland I spent time in an alcohol and drug treatment center and then received treatment out-patient. I now have substantial clean time and a sponsor in the AA program that I am actively involved in,
I have a full, great life now. I have a support system and love what I do for a living. I'm very happy now. I had been so miserable during the time I was in NE and I still do not regret leaving. It was a horrible time and place in my life that I found easy to put behind me once I was out of the state
Now, it’s five years later, and it's come back to haunt me like I knew that it most likely would. Though I didn’t think it was a huge deal, as it was a misdemeanor charge and probation violation in a state I would never be returning to. I didn’t think it would prohibit me from renting an apartment.
I applied to rent an apartment from an independent homeowner. It is an amazing find at an amazing price in Portland. Given the housing crisis that we are in and the cost of living being more than most single people can afford on their own, a 450 Square foot apartment costs over $1,100 monthly not including all utilities and parking in some areas. The place I discovered is a gem. To even live in my own home where I can run full speed, naked across the apartment from one end of the place to the other would be a dream come true. We have been living with housemates since moving to Portland because the cost of living is astronomical. I've wanted a place of my own for a long time, and I have worked very hard to finally afford it. It's definitely a one of a kind find and just perfect and affordable. The application process was going great, until I found out last night that the owner is denying our application due to the NE warrant. 
I feel that if I can get the process started resolving my NE legal issue, (whatever that might entail if it’s even possible from out of state) explain my situation at that time, and how far I've come from then, and that I have been to treatment since for addiction, have a sponsor and a few clean years under my belt that just maybe she will reverse her decision. She really sounds like a friendly, kind person. (We have not met her. She travels a lot so when we went to tour the apartment, her friend and housesitter was the one that was responsible for showing the place, helping the owner choose the right tenants and taking care of the paperwork.) A friend of hers that I am acquaintances with says that she has a big heart, so maybe if she could see me as a person and not just a background report it willmmake a difference. l can see how a warrant for abandoning probation on a second DUI would look just terrible, and I know it is terrible. What I did was wrong, against the law and terrible. I did not make the choice to do what I did easily. At that time it was self preservation. I still don’t know how I would have survived that year.
If her concern is that I might end up in a situation in which I can’t pay rent my SO can easily afford the place himself so there should be no concern regarding my legal issue preventing me from paying rent. I thought if I wrote the owner of the apartment an email, if I can explain my situation at that time to the landlord, and explain how far I've come since then, she might just possibly change her mind regarding the denial. If I could tell her I have been to treatment since that time for addiction, have a sponsor and a few clean years under my belt, just maybe she will reverse her decision. Maybe I should move on...but I strongly feel that I need to at least attempt to explain my actions. Im really hoping for some advice on this as well.
I need to resolve this five year old legal issue somehow. I don't know what my charge is exactly. Though it is public record, NE requires a fee to release the information according to their website. I'm assuming it's a probation violation on a misdemeanor from 2015.
I guess I’m asking for advice on how to deal with my legal issue without returning to NE. That wouldn't be possible at this time and certainly not before the apartment is snatched up by someone else. I don’t even know where to start and I can’t afford legal representation at this time. 
Additionally, we still need to find a place to live. We have until the 15th of December to move. I would love this place, though I am aware of the fact that most likely we will have to continue our apartment search. Should I write the landlord a letter of explanation? I mean, what would it hurt? I know that the references that she had not checked having pulled my background report first would give me stellar references. There's also my sponsor and other people in the program that I know would vouch for me.  I guess I feel so strongly that I need to explain myself because silly enough, and not really like me at all, I can't stand the idea that someone whom I have never even met before can pass judgement on my character never having known anything about me besides what I look like on paper.

She says she's fallen hard. I'm honoured to be the first she's told this to. First times are always hard and it means she trusts me. We were also quite close before all this happened.

But the past few months I keep fucking up. I went through a bad breakup, and I can't seem to get over my ex. I'll admit I'm quite emotionally vulnerable right now and when I drink I tend to forget about the people around me (naturally).

The past couple of weeks I've been having a secret casual thing going on with another friend. It's going good. I think it might even be something. But the other day we all went to a music concert together and I ended up making out with this casual friend in front of my best bud. And now she hates me. 

I understand why she would. It's like I'm rubbing it in her face. But I can't face her now and I can't seem to look her in the eye. She won't even talk to me anymore.

385,"Ok so my roommate who I used to be friends with (I ended our friendship because she was just very toxic and being roommates I quickly found out how immature she was and that she really lacks awareness and responsibility) is dating this 25 year old dude. Mind I say, she is 18. Just turned 18 on October 30th. But I think she was talking to this guy at least a few days before she was 18. I told my friends (who were also my roommates friends) about it and how it was really creepy and I was kinda worried for her. Especially since she was saying how she wanted to go to another state with him for Thanksgiving break rather than going back home to her family. Dude looks like he is 40 years old. Is this not weird? Like I was talking to my other roommate and she said it was really sketchy too, he even made a comment towards her saying “nice bra” when he came over and then snapchatting our other roommate. Then they claim to be in a poly relationship but she was saying that he told her he wants to get to know her better before they are official. And it’s like how is she not noticing this dude is mega creepy? First off, I’m sorry but any 25 year old man or woman that dates 18 or 19 year olds are creepy to me. I think at 18 and 19 you are still in high school mentality. And my roommate is very much not mature lol. Even if she was, what business does this grown man have dating a girl that has been 18 for barely a month? Pretty sure he just wants sex, for like the past 5 or 6 weeks she hasn’t slept in our room and has slept at his place or her new friends place (who don’t seem to find a problem with this and think it’s cute???). Am I crazy? Because I know I could never date a grown ass man lol, and when I’m 25 I know damn well I’m not gonna want to date an 18 year old. Second, dude clearly isn’t looking for a serious relationship and I’m sure he is using the polyamorous thing just to hook up with other girls. My roommate has been in quite a few relationships but I don’t understand how she isn’t getting better at choosing guys to date?? Like the guys she dates progressively get worse and it’s like, shouldn’t you use those past relationships as a lesson in what you should and shouldn’t look for or want and don’t want? Like I can’t really say anything since we aren’t friends and I kinda want to have the mindset of you got yourself into this mess so get yourself out, but on the other hand it’s like we used to be friends so I still have that small part that cares for her wellbeing and it’s like girl please don’t date that creepy dude. I know you have done dumb shit and been a shitty friend to me but like I’m not trying to see her get hurt by this grown man. She’s moving to a different dorm next semester which is closer to him and it’s like noo sweetie what are you doing. You have to be smarter than this. She talked so much about red flags in dating but the flag is literally hitting her in the face and she ignoring it lol. 
In all seriousness though, I do feel bad for her even after what’s she’s done to me. Like I just want her to get her shit together, she had so much potential. Like before we stopped being friends I sent her this long as message basically saying how much I believed in her and want to see her succeed because she always makes “jokes” about being suicidal and I got pretty worried/annoyed since I don’t like how casual she talks about it. It’s just sad that in like 9 weeks she went downhill this quickly and is like a whole new person. In a way, I’m glad our first fight happened because at least I know the type of person she truly is. This has just been kinda sitting with me, because even though I’ve told my friends who were also friends with her about it I feel like I should say something but I know she won’t listen because one we aren’t friends and two even if we were she would just answer that she knows what she’s doing when she really has no clue. Low key feel guilty because this dude is definitely bad news but none of her new friends are gonna call it out because they are exactly like her.",05Dec2019,1
386,"What do you guys Think of this? For clarification I’m a junior in college. 
So my roommate told me that she wants my partner to start paying rent because she comes over like 4ish nights a week sometimes less tho and sometimes more. (She claims she comes over every night but I am v careful about keeping Track bc I have anxiety over this)  She said that if she stays here rent free it’s not fair to her. But the bills haven’t gone up since I started dating my partner (the energy bill went down) and the rent would only be less for me because me and my partner would split it since we’d share a room. *Also* my partner and I just stay in my bedroom anyway majority of the time. We hardly ever go to the common  space. 
My roommate also said that it’s too small of a space( which is subjective- I don’t think it is) when there are three people here but then she said that my partner should move in so those are two conflicting messages. And when I told her portion of the rent would only change by $12 in the cox bill (depends on the energy) she didn’t say anything. I feel like if my partner is staying in my room and we are not being loud, or disruptive, or my partner isn’t using her things or eating her food (my roommate actually eats my food *sigh*) then I can’t think of a reason how we’re being 
 disrespectful like she claims. Ultimately I feel like it’s my choice what happens in my room and who is in my room and w certain exceptions it’s not really my roommates place to ask this of us. At first she said my partner either can come over 2x a week wo paying rent and now not at all so she just keeps giving me conflicting messages.

I added up the total cost of school and it’ll be just under 40k in all if I graduate in 2-3 years tops. I plan on getting a job while in school(hopefully one with tuition reimbursement) to help lessen the load of the loans when I graduate. I want to know if there is anything I should know or possibly consider before going forward with my plans. Have any of you taken out a loan for school and how much does/has it set you back?

398,"This one is a bit long but let me write a quick context.
I know this guy since my first day at my Japanese classes by an ex mutual friend. We got along very well and now that I think about it he is perhaps the only friend whom I feel totally in calm with.


I love girls and women and I always considered myself the romantic gentleman type with them or at least I always tried to be. I've always tested myself to see if I liked boys too but nothing romantic came out of it.


I've always wanted a girlfriend, I had my first one last year for 3 months and I had my first sexual relationship with that same girl. A few months after I broke up with her (due to things not related to my sexuality) I felt as my heart was not beating in a passionate way like it used to at the same time I got a huge hunger for sex (even though in all that time I just had two more sexual encounters) until yesterday that I hung out with this guy and two more friends.


Let's just say that our girl friend was pointing out that I was only chatting with him and being seemingly enthusiastic with him (which I didn't realize) and I hugged him on the neck to bother her.


When it was just the two of us I said sorry for the hug and he told me to not worry, it also didn't seem to disturb him or upset him at the moment.


When I returned home I was really happy in a calmly way for no reason. I started to remember all of that day and I realized a few things I did:


I was insisting him in a jokingly way to play video games at his house saying it was to try his new game, but it was because I could be more time with him and alone with him in his bedroom (not that I was thinking to do anything)


Since the hug, I started imagining myself being embraced by him and every time I do that, my heart beats at least a bit stronger.


I tested myself imagining being in a relationship with him and let's just say that even though I felt embarrassed because we are both men, I felt pretty happy. And that maybe I don't mind kissing him.


I don't do many manly stuff like sports and so but I always tried to define myself as the man who protects his woman from everything he can. But when I imagine myself with him, I also feel pretty happy being, how can you call it?, the ''femenine role''.


I feel really happy imagining myself making him very happy in any way I can at the same I feel really happy being protected by him and being considered the most important thing for him.


I was invited by a girl friend to stay at her house this weekend since her parents will travel and she will be alone to hang out and have ''coffee time''. This guy also said we could play this weekend his new game and yes we'll be alone in his room. I think you could guess which one I am preferring to go.


Every time I tried to deepen my feelings I started to cry for no reason.


Okay, enough context. There are many questions and problems here.
Do I feel a crush on him or is it just a passing thing I don't know from my age, my generation, my environment (my sister is also bi)?
Is it just a fantasy I didn't know I had?
What should I do to be sure?
Why is he the only guy I feel having a crush on and when there are other guys is an instant ''no'' from my part?
If it is really a crush, what should I do? He has been with many women, but didn't say anything about the thought of being with guys.
I want him to hug me to know how my heart feels. How can I ask him for a hug without being weird?


One thing is for sure, anything that comes from this I don't want to lose him, doesn't matter if it's still friendship or anything more. What should I do?",05Dec2019,1
399,"Hi everyone,

One of my friends just told me she's adopting a dog this week. I'm extremely worried about the kind of lifestyle this animal is going to have if she adopts him. She already has a dog that she refuses to take to the vet because it's ""too expensive"". Whenever I go over to her house her dog has no water, she feeds it the cheapest lowest quality food because that's all she can afford. She barely makes enough money to cover her rent and her kids expenses but she wants to bring another pet into her household. She also has kids that are terrified of animals and scream/cry/kick when a dog goes near them. She cannot even provide proper care for the one dog that she has, another pet is pretty much just a novelty to her. She wants the ""cute"" dog but doesn't want to put the money or time into it. 

I know the name of the place she's adopting from, I've thought of calling and leaving an anonymous tip about adopting out to her but I'm terrified she will find out I'm the one who called. I don't know what to do...",05Dec2019,1
400,"Hi Reddit,

I'm in my late 30s, and was born in the UK. I moved to the USA ten+ years ago. I had a difficult start to life in the UK, my father passed away when I was 12, my sister became estranged due to severe schizophrenia, I left school at 16 and started travelling to get away from it all, and had a brief and interesting career that took me to a lot of different countries. I ended up wanting a stable place to settle, and it ended up being San Francisco. I had a bit of a rough start, started a business, lost it, wasn't sure how to make a career after that, figured it out. Did some dating, lost a girlfriend to cancer, suffered from depression. Figured it out, got a stable job, and found a really good relationship with my now fiancee. She's a doctor, and is doing well in her career, I'm doing ok, but not brilliantly (making rent and able to live in SF), together we're fine financially here, but just started being able to save, (but still have a few 100k in her student date to pay off). All stuff we can figure out.

However the last few years my mother has not been doing well back home. Mostly mental health. and then recently she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  She does not have family or a relationship to care for her in the UK. She owns her own house, but does not have much money past that. If it was just me, i'd move home. There are a few pressing needs (she can't manage her own finances), and she's lonely. She's not great at self care, but is active, and will take guidance. (slowly, and over time). But I also have a wonderful loving partner here, whom I want to build a life with and not ruin her options. It is from what we have currently found out very very hard for her to be able to practise medicine in the UK (she's a board certified maternal fetal medicine doctor). Plus the salary would be much less, and make it very hard or impossible for us to pay off our student debts that she accrued in her training. That is if we can even figure out how she can practise. I have no employment in the UK, but could figure that out, but it wouldn't be spectacular. My networks are all here. 

Moving my mother here would take 3+ years, if she agreed to it. I'd need to complete my citizenship before we were able to sponsor here, and it would be a massive change from here and remove her from the friends she does have there. Plus this goal post moves and gets harder everyday with the current administration. There's issues even getting my mother healthcare here if we could do that right now. Maybe best to just plan for it now anyway, and do my citizenship?

I'm not really even sure where to start. I have a trip planned home to start organizing her finances, and work through any immediate issues she has. I don't know how care works in the UK, as I haven't been there to live for decades. I don't know if I should put my partner first, or my mother. I don't know if Im over thinking it. I just don't even know what the right thing to plan for is. So here I am, asking you the internet for ideas...

401,"So, about 4 month ago I split up with my girlfriend of around two years as I had a MASSIVE crush on this girl who went to my college. I eventually got the balls to ask her out and I was so excited honestly I thought she was the one. We went out got really really drunk and ended up doing you know the business I thought it went really well. I woke up in her bed the next day we made out and talked for a little bit but I headed out as I didn’t want to be a burden you know.

I don’t even think about my previous girlfriend I’m totally over it however I can’t get over this girl I have no clue what’s going on. Going to college is weird we don’t talk like we used to, I catch her looking at me all the time once she even continued to do so after I caught her giving me a smile to say “yeah you’ve just got me” but why would she do that if she doesn’t like me. She now talks to another guy in my group however it’s VERY friendly if you get what I mean.

405,"I am 15 and male, and have been homeschooled my whole life. My siblings all had a different program than I do and my mother wants me to do more than just the basic subjects (math, language, spelling, literature, health, science, history, piano, and vocal). Because I have always been homeschooled, I have little experience socializing (all the socializing I do is interact with friends, family, people at church, my piano teacher, and an occasional stranger). 


In the past year or so, my grades declined slightly (from A+ to maybe C) and my mom is blaming it on the fact that I own a phone (even though my siblings had laptops to watch homework videos on). At 13, my first phone was an Iphone 5 passed down from my dad then my older brother then me, and then one year later I got an Android from my other older brother. My siblings at this time also had their grades decline yet my mother for some reason dismisses this fact. Even if the phone was causing this grade decline, then that's my problem, I don't understand why she has to invade in on my privacy every other night to make sure I am not on my phone, even though I have learned ***a lot*** from the internet, some things I would have never learned otherwise.


Today she lectured me about this and how she wants me to either 1: memorize Bible verses in Russian and recite them in our small church (I have done this before, but I hated it, not the fact it was the Bible, but because it made me anxious and nervous, and it was in Russian), 2: learn solo songs and then sing them, 3: do it in front of my family (nobody has time for that), or 4: start going to a school and do it there. I simply don't understand why this is necessary when what I am doing right now (,singing in choir and plenty of memorizing already) is just fine, yet somehow for her it isn't. One more thing, nobody else wants this, she literally told me it was for her own pleasure, and yet she isn't grateful for all the things I do for her. I am obedient most of the time and do chores and work already, yet she just isn't satisfied.

The walk in clinic started me on prednisone (steroids.) My shoulder/neck hurts so badly! It’s 2:30 in the morning. And it’s been a good month since I’ve actually slept through the night. I’m used to stress. Stress is nothing new in my life. All test results came back fine. 

It feel like a pinched nerve. FH says it’s the stress from my family. (They’re not coming, and I’m glad.) it the stress from my business. (I’ve only taken on one client instead of 5 this season.) Its the stress of the wedding. The insurance issue. (Which I finally got straightened out.) even when we were gonna cancel the wedding, the pain was still there. 

To be honest. I’ve had a lot more stress than this. Has anyone else experienced physical, pain? But nothing to actually show the cause of the pain.

I’ve googled. Tried every home remedy. My mental state is being affected. I can’t take it.

412,"I feel much anxiety with people, social situations, leaving home, etc., especially large crowds and places I’m unfamiliar with, but still a good amount just with all of these in general. 

Well, I’m not sure if it’s anxiety that I have from leaving my house, but I do know I am far more comfortable at home than anywhere else, and this excessive discomfort of leaving often leads me to miss out on things. I always feel more comfortable just staying home and whenever I can I choose to stay home, but I can’t tell if it’s anxiety about leaving home or what it is. 

I always feel isolated but then again I feel more comfortable this way. I know it’s not attachment disorder, because I do love people, it’s just I don’t feel comfortable with anyone really. Part of me is afraid of social interactions, embarrassment, and making mistakes. Another part of me just doesn’t see the point in social interactions. I want to socialize and interact, but I’m afraid I’ll screw stuff up and embarrass myself. I feel I need to hide my true self from nearly everyone, or else... I don’t know, people will judge me, hate me, etc. 

Another very major thing is that I’m often afraid, maybe anxious, I’m not sure, about harming people, either physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. with words, actions, letting someone down, etc. and that is another major reason why I don’t like, why I hate, why I fear, why I see no point in social interaction and leaving my home.

So a week goes by and my friends spread the news I'm back at my old school and spread my snap around for anyone that wants to talk to me, and this girl I didn't know adds me. after a few pleasant messages back and forth I asked one of my friends who this girl was. Turns out to be one of my friends 2 month gf so taking that into account I try to be friendly but keep a distance but then she opened up about her personal life to me and I did the same to her which I never do since I have some weird trust issues. after a few days of this she starts talking about how my friend is a bad boyfriend (ghosting, dosent express his love, haven't been able to have prolonged convos without it getting akward, and how she thinks he doesn't love her and is gonna break up with her) of course as a bro I try and defend him but I digress, anyways after this she starts talking to me about her type of guy and mentions me being  a good fit for her and that's where I started picking up the signals. Now after a week or so has passed I have this longing for her when we don't talk I keep thinking of her and I can't sleep when she has a problem I can't help with.

We started talking and we hit it off really well. We clicked instantly and became very attracted towards each other. We talked day and night. We met 2 weeks later. He was more attractive and charming in person. We were hooked with each other. We used to travel for each other. I used to go to his place and he used to come stay with me and we used to stay in Hotel rooms. This lasted for a while. 

My living situation was not good. I was living in my best friends basement because I was homeless. I was trying my best to pick myself up financially to try to move out but I couldn't afford it by myself. My parents couldn't help me because they were on the verge to become homeless as well due to high rents and economical struggles. Very humble people. They taught me how to become humble myself.
Anyways, kyle saw my living situation and he was very kind enough to offer me love, food, clothing, and permanent shelter. I accepted. After a few months of knowing him, I accepted because I had no other choice. I was looking for my well being as well as I cared about him.  I moved in his house after a few months of knowing him. We got even closer and decided to get married during Christmas eve. The wedding was absolutely beautiful and it was one of the best days of my life. 

My parents became homeless. My dad lost his job and my mom couldn't keep up with the rent and expenses by herself. I explained the situation to him and he was kind enough to invite my parents to live with us. 

As the months passed by, I've started to notice that hes behaving differently. He became more attention seeking, always seeking for my attention. I'm naturally not very big into attention myself. He started behaving more stubborn, petty, prideful, and refuses to learn from my past experiences (I've been through A LOT in my 25 years of age) when I'm trying to teach him things about life. He tries to control and manipulate some things I do. I've dealt with controlling people in my past, so that's how I know what hes doing without him realizing I know what hes doing. And he says comments about other people, criticizing them. He recently told me he doesnt trusts me and that breaks my heart. 
He was a very sweet and caring person but I feel he has changed or hes showing his true colors. 

I can't move back to my hometown because me and my parents have nowhere to stay. We have no home but at Kyle's. 

Hes close with his mom. His parents divorced when he was young and he was raised by his mom mainly. His mom is a control freak who likes to be in disfunction. She smokes like a chimney (probably like 2 packs a day) and does quite the opposite of what the Drs have told her what NOT to do. She the type of person who is all sweet and all but she will talk smack behind you. She's the type of person that has a negative vibe once she's in the house. She has her own house yet she's always here. She's divorced twice. 

I've talked to my mom and dad about it (they've been married for 40 years now) about how I feel and about the relationship between kyle and I. They told me to give time it's time. Basically to wait. They say it'll all work out in the end. 

I feel like my mental health is deteriorating. I've been so depressed, anxious, and paranoid. It's been 1 year and I still feel the aftershock of leaving everything behind (my friends, my job that I really enjoyed, my lifestyle). I feel uprooted. I feel out of place, homesick, and confused. 

If you have read as this far, I really appreciate your time on reading this! 

I'm just desperate, confused, I feel stuck and idk what to do. :/

Any advice would be very appreciated!",05Dec2019,1
420,"Hi reddit, I need some ideas.

I have winters off from my job and have at least a month of time where that I haven’t figured out what to do. I have saved up a bit of money so have some freedom in that, but I would like to do something productive in that time and haven’t figured out what that might be.

A couple ideas that are appealing to me at the moment have been finding some sort of volunteering with immigration/refugees (haven’t found a good program) or other volunteering opportunities, or potentially finding some sort of certification or class relevant to my work (outdoor education) or interests that I could complete in that time.

I would love to hear ideas and experiences from folks on what some potential options could be",05Dec2019,1

Although I have some affinity to mathematics I wouldn't call it a natural intuition and I'm struggling hard to keep up the pace. Programming has gotten a lot more complex and I don't enjoy it at all. My mood has actually decreased sharply over the last few months due to constant anxiety and fear of failure and sleep deprivation. I really don't know if I'll be able to get a degree or not but I don't want to drop out either cause I'd look like a failure in front of my family and friends and I'd never be able to fulfil any of my goals (support a family, home, etc).

422,"I'm going to start this off stating that I understand that it can take a long time to meet the right person, and everyone gets there eventually. But I wanna yknow, figure out what the first steps I should take to experiencing romance at the very least. I'm a 19 year old male getting close to 20 if that helps give a better picture on my situation. I am currently taking a break from college and live in a town where I only know my mother, sister and my co-workers.

 Growing up I never really stuck around anywhere longer than like 2-3 years, so I was always coming in when people were already in their cliches, and while I could make acquaintances and amuse people fairly easily, there was always this sorta distance me and my peers. Which I was cool with, or at least tolerant of since I could just go online and talk to people that got me. This resulted in my only real semi-exprience with a romantic relationship being this online friends with sexting benefits thing for most of my high school experience with this one girl from over seas. Six months ago she ghosted me without warning, which I was initially fine with since I understand we weren't really anything serious and she owed me nothing. But recently I've been coming to question if I wasted my school years on her, allowing me to let pictures of tits to tell me that I could just wait till later to get skills I would not have the chance to safely build ever again.

 Again, not her fault, she was a lovely girl, but I cant help but to feel like I'm wildly out of my depth in terms of experience and know how. Like, where would I even go? I dont like partying, and I'm ironically super shitty at Tinder. And I know going to a fucking coffee shop or my local FGC scene to find love is a great way to creep both myself and everyone present out. Is there a book I can read? Maybe a special type of psychiatrist I should be looking for? Should I just wait for destiny to hit me when I'm in my late twenties like my manager? I feel like having IRL friends would make this so much easier.",05Dec2019,1
423,"I’m a 18 yo male and I made a post on r/AmITheAsshole. And I was asking about cutting ties with my parents. I got some mixed answers and I’m so confused. 

My dad cheated many times on my mom, threatened to leave many times, gets really angry to the point where I’ve though he was going to hurt someone at times, is an alcoholic, has pushed my mom while he was drunk, has threatened to beat me before.

As for my mom, worst she has ever done is say hurtful things to me sometimes blamed me for things.

They both weren’t emotionally supportive, they’ve always dismissed my problems because I “had no reason to be depressed” or was “too young” to be stressed and stuff like that. I mean I guess they tried to help, but it always ended with them yelling at me for feeling the way I felt or being called lazy or wanting attention. 

They hardly ever took me to the dentist and now I’m having to deal with the aftermath. 

I’ve also dealt with social isolation because they decided to homeschool me and move far away. 

I basically hate them for the way they raised me. And I wish I could cut ties because it’s just really awkward to be around and can’t imagine living on and taking care of them when they grow old. Definitely not my dad, I just don’t trust him. I feel like they are a huge reason why I have so many issues that I’m having to figure out today with anxiety, depression, and possible untreated ADHD. As well as with social and communication issues.

Anyways I feel like I’m just an entitled spoiled brat for feeling this way. They have always been financially supportive, they bought me my own car. And used to buy me things a lot. I’ve always felt like shit for it, and hated it. And my mom is sick with a serious condition. So I feel like I’m just a dumb, spoiled teenager for feeling this way. Especially with the worse lives others have had. I feel like just a little bitch because I’m so sensitive over this when others have been physically beaten and worse things than I have gone through.

Am I just a entitled spoiled brat or delusional or dumb(I feel like I am)? Are my feelings of hate towards my parents okay? Because I can’t change it, I’ve tried not to hate them, but it just doesn’t go away. Did my parents even do anything wrong? Because a couple people said on my post that my parents are normal. And I just don’t know if I’m just being delusional and crazy or if it is normal or okay to feel this way.",05Dec2019,1

427,"Hey, looking for advice on a matter that may be provided by a neutral source. I am currently in a ten year old relationship all while living together. We are partners with everything being 50/50, supportive, and very family oriented. We don't fight often but their is one thing that continues to come up and it is the fact that my partner takes our relationship for granted, as if I'm a passive. If it's something to do with family or things with other couples it is a given we go together. But if that something does not fit  what I listed, I am not included or thought about second to friends. I too use to behave in this manner but changed. I have been communicating for a very long time consistently as to why it is that I am unhappy with examples. recently this argument has arised once more, about me not feeling wanted with putting effort and examples on how we can fix our relationship. They apologize and understand how I feel , all while still directing some blame towards me. Ok, so now I have no social media or anything of that nature, but this evening I skimmed through thier phone to find a text to their friend stating ""Oh I told my partner that  it was just us going""  because I don't like this friend as their life style does not fit our values. Next there was another text to a friend stating ""We can drive there together"" who has more of the potential to be a crush rather than a friend, this taken from research. I confronted my partner, with them acknowledging they were wrong, though they state they had no ill intent planned. This I do believe but the fact that they lied to me stands. It was because they did not want me to go because as I am not friendly around this friend. The trust has been breach 10 years of hard work. An ultimatum was set I or the friend as I figure this behave is influenced from the friend and has not been present otherwise. What are your thoughts?

428,"So let me give some context. My girlfriend (F23) suddenly broke up with me (M20) about 2 months ago (which really sucks but that's life sometimes) and after a long conversation we decided that we would still be friends. Fast forward about a month and tension/awkwardness between us kinda rose and she finally texted me telling me about how she wanted to still be friends but have a break from contact because she was dealing with a lot (she had a death in her immediate family and other problems). I respected that and told her that I wouldn't bother her unless she reached out and that I'm here if she needs me. 

So now that we are all caught up, here's my dilemma. Recently, I've gotten the feeling that she kinda hates me, genuinely doesn't like me, or just really wants nothing to do with me. The only reason this feeling has kinda come up is because some time in the past week she unfriended me on all forms of social media and still hasn't contacted me or anything (and just so you know I wasn't doing anything creepy or anything, I would occasionally like her posts from time to time to just be friendly but I never once directly contacted her). Now while this sucks a lot it's not the end of the world, she's allowed to hate me if she wants, free country. The problem is that I'm going to have to see her for Christmas because our two families are really close and spend holidays together and I just wanna be sure of how she feels so there isn't any awkwardness and I know what ground we stand on. 

So my idea was to send a text kinda just asking if she hates me/doesn't like/wants nothing to do with me/doesn't want to be friends anymore but I dunno if that's kinda too creepy or pushy or just not the right move. Maybe I should just wait it out to see if she contacts me first? Obviously I could just not go to the Christmas party but I have family that I'd like to see so that's sorta a last resort kinda thing. So what do you think I should do?

Also, some additional info that might be relevant. My ex is diagnosed with anxiety disorder and has other mental health issues which she does a very good job coping with. I only say this could be relevant because it's a really stressful time in her life right now and maybe it's affecting her ability to cope. She would sometimes jump to conclusions and try to push me away while we were dating so maybe something similar could be happening now? I'm no expert obviously but if anyone can relate to her maybe that might help.

435,"I (F21) am a university undergrad in third year. I would consider myself fairly attractive. Over the course of this years term, there is this professor of mine (M43) that i have developed sexual attracting toward.

He has his cell number on the course syllabus, which i thought was a little odd but i heard some professors do that. It pretty much all started when i needed to go ask a few questions during his office hours. At first i sent an email asking if i could come by and then confirm the appointment via text the day of. He said  sure no problem. 

Went by his office, nice guy, easy to talk to and joke around with. When i talk or email any of my professors i refer to them as Dr.Soandso out of respect. However, this became a bit of a running joke between us. He said he liked it. 

The class after this interaction i noticed that he would make eye contact with me much more often. Sometimes when i would be looking down and look back up, i would catch him looking at me and he would look away. 

This is not to say that i think he is interested, i highly doubt it. But these are the things that got me thinking of him. 

One night i got drunk and texted him asking if i could come by his office again. He replied in the morning saying yes. I felt guilty about it because i was drunk and i had no academic reason to go by his office. 

I panicked and told him i drunk texted him and that i was sorry. He was extremely nice about it and said it wasn’t a problem. We texted till 1am that night and he revealed some personal information about himself when he was younger. Later in that conversation he said this - “even though something might sound good on paper when you’re drunk, it often comes with regret” and then i said “im glad i kept my feelings to myself”. The conversation continued as normal and ended there. I wasn’t even drunk when i said that but i regretted it. I just couldn’t help it. 

Long story short i realized i was attracted to him. This started to mess with my head and haven’t been able to concentrate during class. I feel terrible keeping this secret and i havent told anyone. Its been eating me alive. I have been debating going to talk to him once final exams are over to tell him Ive been acting out of character because I’m attracted to him. He even told me i can go by his office once the semester is over if i want to talk.

437,"So I am a recent college grad who is taking gap years before medical school. I originally intended on taking one gap year, but I have decided to take two years. In the process of deciding whether or not to apply, I essentially ghosted references who had agreed to write letters months prior (I did not follow up with CV/submission info). I am looking for advice on how to get back in their favor.

I am fully aware the ghosting was incredibly unprofessional. I’ve been unemployed and depressed the past few months and have felt immense guilt towards my letter writers. At one point, I thought I could pull my application together and asked for a few letters on short notice after disclosing my personal issues, to which they agreed, after which I ghosted those individuals again with my application indecision. 

To make matters worse, not knowing professional reference etiquette, I listed some individuals as references for job applications without explicit permission. I assumed they would only be contacted to verify I worked for them vs. providing a character reference, but I definitely made a mistake there.

Anyways, I want to get back in touch with these people, but don’t know if I’ve already burned my bridges by ghosting them and potentially making them get contacted for professional references.

It really hurts my self-confidence and I just feel like shit because I don't like being treated like my thoughts and input doesn't matter.  Is there any good way to rectify this?  Notice the issue: people are usually not patient.  If I take my time to reach the right answer to something (which is a necessity), people will think I'm slow and get impatient.  If I'm much more reserved with what I say (a.k.a. refraining from stating wrong things), people will think I don't know anything or that I have nothing to say.",05Dec2019,1
447,"I’m currently 20 yrs old about to finish an associates degree in computer science. It’s never really been my passion, nor have I ever really wanted to do it 100%, it was just something I did because it involved computers. Going through the degree I consistently hated more and more coding in classes. Of course I realize this is what computer science is basically all about but I just got to a point where I didn’t enjoy it at all. I thought I would understand it and it just never clicked with me. I’ve never really been interested in anything else. I’ve seen the people around me passionately love what they do and definitely enjoy coding and being around software stuff but it just isn’t for me.

448,"This girl i’ve been with for a month now kissed a guy the night before we became official. We hadn’t talked about what we were and i just assumed we both thought we were a “thing” because we had been going on dates and talking for roughly a month. She said she really liked me at the time and she’s super sorry about it. i’m confused why she would even go on a date with someone else or let alone kiss him when she said she liked me super a lot. 

she also told me she thought i was mad at her and she accepted the date in the first place because of her “trust issues” and she “didn’t want to get played” because someone else (which doesn’t know me) told her i could be talking to other girls. are these big red flags for the future? should i still be bothered by this or am i just being crazy?",05Dec2019,1
449,"My boyfriend and I had started flirting in October of last year, and started dating in December of 2018.
Tonight, I was logged into his account on instagram and stupidly thought it would be interesting to read through his messages. We are both very open about these things. 

I found that he was flirting with another girl, i’ll call her Dem, and her and I weren’t on the best of terms anyways. She had talked nasty about me to her friends. I read through things of “Let me see your bra” and he called her “His female.” My contact name on his phone is “My female.” 

I realize this all seems like high school love+petty drama but I can’t seem to stop crying enough to rest. This all feels so strange considering he’s the introvert type and he had the confidence to talk to her like that, it just feels as if he was a completely different person. 

I’ve been tossed aside and replaced so many times in the past, and during the time we were flirting I was doing my absolute best to better myself so I could make him happy. He stopped texting her abruptly on Instagram around the time we started getting a bit more serious. But I still have no idea of what they had together or if it carried on in real life or in other platforms. 

He over a year to at least mention this to me, and he never spoke of any of it. I just worry that if he finds another girl i’ll be tossed aside just as easily as Dem. I’m so confused and just feel grossly lied to. I know he didn’t technically cheat, but I can’t help but feel so betrayed. 

I don’t want to push my own fears onto him, but i’m getting increasingly more scared since he just seems so secretive now. If he hid this for over a year what else is he hiding?",05Dec2019,1

454,"TL:DR: I guess I should start off saying that I'm entirely against divorced because in my situation, I usually end up screwed and I don't want my daughter to grow up with divorced parents. What would you do in my situation? 

Last year, around this same time, I found out my wife had a tinder. It had been several months since her and I had been intimate or showing any form of affection, so I figured she had one, I'd make one too. Ever since then, shit went downhill.   


One of the rules was no getting attached, just for fun. But after she started getting attached to one guy, she almost threw our marriage down the drain. She claimed she quit talking to him around early december but kept contact with the guy only a few days afterwards. This went on until about early April where I had just gotten back home after a training exercise.   


I told her that I was agreeing to stay together and work things out simply because of our daughter and that she'd had to win me back and it's been great so far but there's still a bit of distrust in her.   


I'm currently deployed to a country where she's obsessed with their people. She rarely texted me back with about a 4 hour turn around time, despite her saying she never did anything throughout her days. I wouldn't get any good morning/night texts or any display of affection.   


She recently sent me a screenshot and it had a messenger notification in the background, so I asked who it was from and the entire discussion blew up. Now she's wanting some time to herself because she thought we were over that and I'm just left in the dark. She said I was clingy for asking her to communicate better and that our daughter is being needy now so that takes up most of our time but I don't personally believe it takes 4 hours to amuse a 2 year old.

458,"Some background information. I work as a Police Officer and every once in a while I escort somebody in custody to the nearby hospital. We see the same regular staff there whenever I end up at this particular hospital. 

On a night shift, I saw a female nurse there who I thought was incredibly pretty but as a professional I refrained from making any attempts to talk to her. My partner and I would sometimes be at the hospital for hours at a time so I would walk around to stretch my legs. To my excitement, I ended up talking to said nurse and it did feel flirtatious at times. Unfortunately I wussed out and didn’t get her name. 

Fast forward to the next time I get to escort somebody to the hospital and there she is. I do my best to get her attention and eventually she notices that I came back. We reconnect quickly and we talk every time we encounter each other. I did ask her for her name this time and she asked for mine. I felt like we had a great connection and potentially somewhat interested?

I probably won’t see her in a while, if at all, and I don’t know how I can ask her out. Should I wait until the next time I potentially go to the hospital again and hope she’s working? What’s the best way to go about it?

460,"I graduated from secondary school, plan to study either CS or civil/mech engineering. My objective is to immigrate permanently overseas, like in Canada or UK, as I don't like where I live at all (Hong Kong). 

Recently, a relative in the UK contacted me, and offered to give me financial help to study near where they live (London, UK). They don't have that much money, and a tuition of ~£15k should be the limit, so I'll have to stay at their house instead of dormitories. Compared to local universities, the universities in UK around/below £15k have much lower rankings than ones in Hong Kong. I'm worried I'm less likely to be hired overseas as a lower-ranked UK university graduate, than a higher-ranked HK graduate.

So I basically have a choice: Study in local, more prestigious universities in Hong Kong, or study in less prestigious universities in UK near my relatives' home. There's so many things I'm worried about. This decision will change my future. I don't know if I'm even worrying about the right things, maybe what I'm worried about is completely useless and irrelevant, but I won't know until the time comes.

I'll try to list the things I'm thinking about:

HK / Local:

 - Costs much less

 - I need to work harder to get into university (Need to study to get good GPA at a local community college to have a chance)

 - I need to deal with my close family, who are easily agitated and frequently makes my daily life worse

 - But local universities have a higher ranking, higher employability overseas? (e.g. University of Hong Kong, HKUST, CUHK)


UK:

 - Lower ranking, so lower employability?

 - I can pursue my hobbies much better in the UK

 - I expect to live happier in the UK

 - Much better quality of life

I'm honestly not sure what to choose, the deadline is nearing and I'm panicking.

**tl;dr:** Low-ranking universities in UK, or high-ranking universities in Hong Kong?

I hate where I live (Hong Kong), but I fear my future will become worse if I go to a low-ranked university in UK rather than a higher one in HK.",05Dec2019,1

For PMC I've thought that it's a toss up because it's something I already know and I would have an edge over some other people due to me having two deployments to Iraq (which is uncommon nowadays with everything dying down) and most starting salaries are $85k-$100k. The downside is that I cant really make a life long career/employability of being a PMC.

For college I would do information systems cause I have a love for computers and I have built my own before.

476,"Hi. I, a 19 M attending university for a STEM major am having trouble going on. I keep getting extremely depressed. I'm attending a large university campus full of wealthy people, but grew up extremely poor to the point of near homelessness. I still feel like an outsider because of money despite being here on a full scholarship. I'm also in STEM not out of passion, but practicality, as it makes money and gives stability --something I've never had. This has continued during my current sophomore year.

Second semester of Freshman year was rough. I was losing most of my friends and couldn't sleep anymore. I'd stay up until 4 am thinking. I then got a call one night, ironically during a moment I was sleeping, from my mom. She said my sister had tried to kill herself. This was during spring break, during a time when I was supposed to go on an internship experience to Silicon Valley and see if engineering was a good fit for me. I lost the opportunity, and my sister was hurtful during the stay. Some months in the hospital later, in the summer, she almost died from lithium side effects.  I didn't go to the hospital as I feared if I went, she would die. She's fine now, and while she was breaking out in hives and balding, I got her some wigs with my own money. She just broke up with her boyfriend, which I'm happy is over but feel bad because I know she's depressed and the attempt still lingers over me.

Unfortunately, my own relationship is also going through a rough patch. My girlfriend isn't always the most sympathetic person, and when I did want to break up I got scared of being alone. Then, a month or so later with my sister's event, I got confused as to whether or not I was projecting so I stayed with her. But recently we keep arguing. She doesn't text me back for a while sometimes and doesn't communicate properly. There's been times where she posts on social media but claims she doesn't have time to reply. Despite knowing my budget is low, she orders pricey stuff when we go out. She also sometimes jokes about my inability to perform well sexually, saying I don't give her an orgasm (even though I've asked her what I should do, and she says I should just know).   It fucks me up because I don't know if I'm just so fragile or if she's mean for that.

Lastly, I have no friends here at school. No one hits me up to hangout and many people leave me on read and say they cannot move. I dont know what the fuck to do anymore, its a lot of weight on my shoulders. Wwyd if you wanted to make your life better with a situation like this?",05Dec2019,1
477,"Hey guys,

Take this how you want but after putting thought into the matter I think I may have gotten a tiny bit of brain damage from pulling out my nostril hairs - yea it's pretty laughable. I'm only 21 years old and for the past month I've been noticeably slower and forgetting things so much more quickly. I'd love there to be another explanation but I can't connect the dots for anything else that's happening in my life.

So I was warned prior before I started this new bizarre habit that pulling nostril hairs will expose larger skin pores in which bacteria will enter and head to your brain. In my ignorance I thought it was a rare case and decided to roll the dice and test nature. Now so much shit has happened in the past month that I cannot explain even to myself. I once forgot my coworkers name for a duration of 2 days when we were literally in the car together for a whole day and I must have asked my other colleague what her name was at least 6 times. Also, I'm writing things with obvious typos and also completely different words than what I intended to write before. Just recently I caused a dent on a company car when parking ON THE DRIVERS SIDE. I go out to do something only to immediately forget what I went to set out to do (this happened to me before - like what happen to most people now and then but it's become even more frequent now.

I'm not sure what I'm asking of this. From what I know, I can minimize any potential ongoing damage by drinking plenty of water but I think the current damage is irreversible. If any doctors or medically licensed people are out there I would like to know if this is a normal side effect and that I'm not over thinking this situation (probably the most pathetic thing I've done all year but I'm honestly questioning the well being of my mental health and how much more it could degrade in the years, and perhaps months to come).

479,"My husband and I are planning to start trying for a baby early next year. It will likely take a long time for me to come off of my birth control so we aren't in a huge rush. It could happen quickly or it could take a year to concieve. We are in the US.

I'd like to be prepared in case we do concieve early on but I don't have health insurance. My husband is insured through his parents for another year. I do freelance work so no insurance through work and I could get it through my husband's job but it would be $600/mo which is just not doable. 

I think it is open enrollment now until the end of the year (?) on the healthcare.gov which is why I feel rushed. I don't really know how to use that or how to see which plan is a good fit for me. I found one estimated for $103/mo with a $800 deductible for one person which seems good... Is it? I read that pregnancy related costs are required to be covered by insurance, is that true? Will it cover enough to make sure that baby and I are healthy or is it bare minimum like half of an ultrasound and someone to just catch the kid as it comes out? 

I know Medicaid might work in a pinch but when I applied years ago I was turned down. If I was already pregnant that might change things because they take a current pregnancy into consideration but I'm not 100% sure that I'd get accepted even then. I'd be taking a risk by staying uninsured with Medicaid as the only option if I'm pregnant before the next enrollment period because as far as I know they're the only ones that will take you in outside of open enrollment (and I'm assuming I need proof that I am pregnant? Like a doctor's note lol?).

But in the midst of me crying, I texted them, telling them how I feel like we're drifting apart and that they'd probably be better off without me. I have no idea why I said that but I regret it a lot. They ended up saying that we've both been really busy and yeah I get it but I really just need one friendship to stay in my life right now. I feel incredibly lonely because all my friends are in different schools and I don't know where I'm going with this rant.

I think, to shorten this, I don't know if I should end the friendship because it hurts to try and keep it going or if I should keep it for the sake of both of us.",05Dec2019,1
485,"I hung out with this woman a couple times because she was my girlfriends friend and shortly after she rated over the first time my 200+ dollar raybans had gone missing, three days after her boyfriend rolled up wearing the same shades. She is a known kleptomaniac and steals from the local target and walmart, and her ex is a friend of mine who said she would steal his stuff too. She said the glasses were gifted to her from her mom, I didn’t know how to prove she was lying so I gave up. My girlfriend had her over again and had been drinking all night, then she locked herself in the guest bedroom for 12+ hours. We tried to wake her up and get into the bedroom but failed. When she eventually did stroll out she left immediately. Two days later when one of my friends tried to use the room we found a glass full of aged piss. I tried to confront her about it but she just denied it and refused to speak to me again. She was kicked out of her house recently and now has moved to an unknown location, the dude who rented the room to her found a water bottle full of piss in the room she was staying in.

488,"Very long story short: I took on a job for an NGO to develop some software using the funding they gained through a bank.

The bank gave a small upfront payment and i accepted it on the promise of getting the remaining sum at the end. 

Long story short, we delivered what was promised, and the client refused to pay the remaining money. I could take them to court but my lawyer more or less told me not to as if even we won they could easily get away from having to pay and just end up bankrupt. The court case would be a open and shut case as I have people inside that NGO (who have now been removed by their CEO) supporting my case who have both tried to reason with their CEO and have faced some consequences due to them. 

During this process, I was also largely distracted due to other factors both other projects taking my time up and personal issues such as my father getting diagnosed with cancer (He'll be fine, probably, but still shitty)

I am now forced to accept a settlement that rewards me slave labor of reward for this project (I had to hire developers to do the project who I have now had to largely pay from the profit of other projects) 

Now I'm settling for about 30% of what they owe me, and I want some form of revenge. 

The client in question does have a large profile in my country in the NGO /ECO friendly sector but is a total snake who has more or less ruined 2019 for myself and my company.

Before I get the obvious answers: 

- Yes we have a contract, yes I have emails clearly contradicting the client, but no taking them to court won't reimburse my money, I can't afford a legal battle out of principle 
- Getting media involved would most likely end up in a ""word against word"" situation, where the client might take me to court. 
- Yes, it was dumb of me to accept this, I needed the money as a self-funded entrepreneur I don't get the luxury to pick safe clients.

I left him because 1) He went to jail for violence and wouldn’t change his behavior (he would still easily get into fights with strangers or the police) 2) He was a sex addict I guess? And would have frequent hook ups with various women who were often strangers he had just met and I learned he wasn’t being faithful to me.

I really wanted to just move on from him, and the life that I was building at the time. I moved to a neighboring state, about 3 1/2 hours from where he lives, for a fresh start. 





I don’t want anything to do with him. When I was still with him he got thrown in jail.  I had his two children with me. and we were all out of town, so I paid his bail. He was to pay me back. After we split I just paid the bill, and didn’t bother to speak to him about the money. Clean break. 




I got a call from a bail company last week asking me if I wanted to bail him out. He was in jail again. Shocker. I said “he’s not my problem anymore” and that was that.

I don’t know at what point to be worried. I don’t know what I would do if I got an unexpected visit. He can be very aggressive, quick and tricky, and I can be a “freezer”.

When he is home I crave affection from him like I want hugs and kisses for no reason. I want to feel like he is my best friend. But when he is home all his every wants is to sit on his phone or have sex. Now don't get me wrong I love having sex with him our sex life is great well so I thought. He resent send a dirty message to a married woman and he told he he was sorry for the comment and call the women husband to tell him what had happened. He reasoning was I wasn't sending him dirty picture or fulling his needs while he is in a different state. He want me to just move on and trust him and he keeps telling me it was nothing and that was the first time he had did it. Now I don't feel like having sex or saying dirty things. He ruined it! I send him picture and did fun things before this and it wasn't good enough I guess. He now is made at me because I stayed up all night just to talk to him. All he wanted to do was send me porn and try to be dirty and I am just not feeling right now. I feel like he took the fun out of trying to be fun. Every time I talk to him about how he could help me get in a better mood to even want to do these things like simply stuff like just be interested in the think I am doing and make me feel like u want me for me instead of just a release he get mad and I get so scared he will just leave me.

498,"I live in a doorman building that has a large staff. It is expected that owners/tenants tip all members of the staff around the holidays. Last year, for a combination of reasons (I was laid off from a job and desperately job hunting, and had to be out of the country due to pre-planned travels), I forgot to tip the staff. My bad, I know. This year I plan to give everyone double tips to make up for it.

However, there is one doorman who used to be super friendly with me, who has been ignoring me completely for the past year. I can't remember the timing exactly, but I imagine it has to do with the tip as there is nothing else I can think of that could have offended him so much. I'm polite and have pleasant exchanges with everyone else, and have never made any special requests of them.

It went from joking around a bit, occasionally sharing candy, him giving me recommendations for the best laundry in the area to no speaking or eye contact. Even if I need to make a direct request like collecting a package, he does it silently and looking away the entire time. He's still chatty and jokey with other residents so it's not like something that has happened in his personal life. It's honestly been really unpleasant when I encounter him - almost like in middle school when someone starts ignoring you for no reason!

**So, the question: What should I tip him this year?** Nothing, which I am half tempted to do, since he's been so rude? Just one year of tip as opposed to double? Double just like the other staff? I give out tips in envelopes, so it wouldn't be obvious how much unless they talk to each other.",05Dec2019,1

501,"Hello Reddit, I am finally at my wits end on what to do from here so I decided to come ask you all. TL;DR at the bottom.
I, (18F) am really struggling with this whole adulting thing. It seems like I seriously, and I mean seriously cannot catch a break. 
I moved out very shortly after I turned 18. I quit my fast food job and switched to serving, I was living with my boyfriend, and everything seemed to be going well. 
I don’t know what first happened at this point, so I will try to keep this in as close to chronological order as possible.
In April, I was rear ended in a car that my boyfriend’s family had loaned me to borrow for a bit. I was paying car insurance to them for the time I used it. The person who hit me didn’t have a license or insurance, and it turned out my boyfriend’s family only had liability. Obviously their insurance was not going to cover this accident. I had to take her to court and sue her which I did successfully. 
Then, health problems arose. All of a sudden I couldn’t sleep, was throwing up all day everyday, and couldn’t eat either. This greatly interfered with my life as I couldn’t even stand up long enough to get out the door to drive to work, let alone actually work a shift. Eventually, it had been going on for over a month and I decided to go to the doctor. I went and they said it was a stomach bug, which didn’t seem right. I went to the ER for a second opinion after continuing to throw up, even after being given a zofran prescription. This. Kept. Happening. For weeks, you guys. I was so stressed, and I literally could not function at this point. Finally, i got a diagnosis- anxiety and BPD. But also lots of medical bills.
So after that obviously the next course is medication. I was prescribed SSRI’s which are total shit, in case you didn’t know. But despite that, they did help my anxiety and in turn, stopped throwing up. Except they made me extremely suicidal and manic. I was even hearing ‘voices’.
Then, another car accident. I think this has been the kicker for me. I was at a stop sign coming off a back road onto a main boulevard in my town, and was there for quite a while due to no clearance. Finally when I see that it is clear, I begin to turn and BOOM- t boned. I really did not see him (there was a blind spot, apparently it’s actually a common accident spot in my town).
the accident was my fault, and my insurance hadn’t started yet. My vehicle was totaled which really really sucked because it’s still being paid on, and his was totaled as well. I was also in the works of getting insurance but I sadly didn’t have it yet.
I was pretty hurt and had to go to the hospital. I was taken by ambulance.  Long story short, I now owe a lot of money.
I’m terrified, stressed, and overwhelmed, I’ve began not sleeping again, and getting sick. But I know that this isn’t an impossible thing to handle, but how? I am not even in school (due to being in the hospital) and I’m already ~$15,000 in debt. Had I known I just had some mental health issues, I wouldn’t have gone to the ER as much as I did and help myself get more into this debt. All of my monthly payments are getting ridiculous, and on top of that I am carless and walking to work.
So, here I am. What are ways to easily, but quickly tackle debt? Can I do anything about these medical bills? 
TL;DR- I’m overwhelmed with a large amount of debt for my age/wage, need advice on how to tackle it",05Dec2019,1
502,"So recently I’ve come to terms with the fact that I can’t be with my biggest crush.

I understand that and I’m ok with it, but I still want to keep her as a close friend because I genuinely like her in every way, like her taste in everything and we have lots of similarities.

504,"Hello Reddit,

I am really struggling to deal with someone I am forced to deal with in a social setting; I have been going to a local wargaming club every week for the past 5+ years or so and recently one of the newer members has attached himself to our clique within the club. To give this person their due, they are not an unpleasant, toxic or otherwise bad person to be around and I have met people with more objectionable views and mannerisms over time. But this person just manages to repeatedly press all my buttons every time he hangs around with us.

He is a very excitable man in his 30s and has the enthusiasm for the hobby that a lot of people 20 years his junior have, when he is about to do something he thinks is cool, he will visibly get excited and start to noticeably shake before moving his models into position. He talks constantly, endlessly over people, through people and interrupts people constantly. He also intentionally finds the most powerful ways to use his army, regardless of its realism, so long as it maximises his ability to win in a game. To the point where he is showing no consideration to his opponents, on the plus side he is a terrible tactician and will lose most games through incompetence regardless of his researched list.

The last evening I played was the straw that broke the camel's back for me, as per usual he talked constantly throughout a game I had with someone else, espoused his wisdom about how rules should work in a game he has never played or read the rules for and when I lost he proceeded to tell me what I did wrong based on watching something on the television mostly unrelated to the game we are playing.

I could feel myself, in that moment, reaching the end of my rope and could feel the desire to tell him to fuck off in no polite terms.

&amp;#x200B;

I have discussed this with my closed circle of friends who are also at the same club and my best friend points out that I can't really get away from him unless I don't take part in group activities or stop going to the club. Which is true, however I feel pushed out anyway because I simply cannot tolerate this man, his rudeness, and his complete lack of awareness when it comes to social interactions. 

However, this club is my only social outlet these days due to changing interests and business it work, the people going there were my Best Man and Ushers and obviously mean a lot to me.

I feel very stuck right now, quite angry and resentful towards this person. Even if they are not themselves a bad person, just a human white noise machine.",05Dec2019,1

510,"\[Australian University, 23M\] So i've just finished all my study for a Bachelor of Business (Marketing Major) &amp; Bachelor of Commerce (Economics). Got my results etc. Ceremony isnt for another 6 months though. Took me 5 years to complete 4 year plan (mix of part time and fulltime study). 

Anyway so it is a 32 subject course of which I got: 

3 High Distinctions (85% +),  4 Distinctions (75-84%), 15 Credits (65%-74%), 10 Pass (50-64%) and 5 fails (&lt;50%). 

Normally when people fail large chunks of subjects they just drop out, however I did relatively well in year 1 and 2, and year 5. Year 3 and 4 I was working 50+ hours a week stupidly, never attended classes and lost all motivation for uni where I failed 5 subjects in the space of 18 months and felt I was in too deep to drop out and didnt want to deal with backlash from my parents so I kept going to where I am today.

Ultimately, Im here, 23 years old, with 2 degrees, in debt and 5 fails on my transcript. Im really worried I wont be able to get a job, or even be allowed to gain unpaid experience through an internship perhaps because of my low GPA.

511,"**TL;DR down below! I’m considerate.**

I’m in college and I’m in this class that’s required for my program but not related to my major. Anyway, next week’s gonna be the last day and I’m pretty bummed out about it because most of my classes have been a drag and this one was actually fun. The people were friendly, lots of laughing and talking went on. I’m definitely gonna miss it. So there’s this one girl in that class who I did find on Facebook and I wanna add her. 

Now, the thing is, we’ve never spoken to each other. She’s the shy type and she usually keeps to herself — just on her phone and doesn’t speak unless spoken to. I still wanna add her but I’m not sure how to go about it. I was wondering if I shouldn’t add her at all, should I add her now, should I add her the night that class ends or should I wait a week after class is done to add her? I’m leaning more towards the last option but I wanna know what you guys think. 

Also, I have another issue. My profile picture on Facebook is a blur of my face. I was trying to replicate something like [this meme](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/142/307/2ef.jpg), in case anyone wants to know why my pic is like that. Now, we’ve never really interacted or made eye contact with each other so I feel like if she sees a blurry picture with some name she doesn’t recognize, she won’t add me. I was wondering if I should either temporarily change my picture to a clearer one or if I should message her before adding her asking if she was in my class. 

Now trust me, I know all of this sounds super creepy (especially the blurred pic not helping my case lmao 🤦‍♂️) and I’m trying my best to soften that. Hopefully my acknowledgment of how creepy this all is *does* soften the blow. But I feel like since I’m also the shy type, we’d get along since introverts are like that. And our class is structured so that we really only get along with the people sitting next to us... like, outside of class, I only ever see people that sit next to each other talk. Unfortunately, her and I don’t sit next to each other. But I digress. 

**tl;dr: There’s a girl in my class. Never spoke to her. Class is ending soon. I found her on FB. Should I add her, and if so, how long should I wait to add her? My picture doesn’t show me clearly. When I add her, should I change my picture or should I message her saying, “hey weren’t you in my class blah blah”?**",05Dec2019,1
513,"A bit of background: I was hired in Jan 2018 by a very small company as a Marketing Exec, making roughly $28,000 a year. Shortly after I was hired, the Head of Marketing went on maternity, ( I was unaware before hired) leaving me to manage all marketing activity for a year. 

During that time the CEO of the company started to come into the office to help a little bit, but during her maternity leave he became very difficult to work with, as I think he was stressed. He would micro manage, shout at me daily on the phone to the point where I would cry, make rude and condescending comments, was dismissive and a control freak- I wasn't allowed to say certain phrases or write down notes in his presence (I should remember everything). He was also sexist. I developed anxiety and depression, but held on until she came back on Maternity leave as I didn't want to screw the company over. I felt out of my depth the whole time, had no guidance, and admittedly made a few mistakes.

As soon as she came back she started highlighting all of the mistakes I made, humiliating me in front of the office. I handed in my notice, and now she's being a bully, laughing and joking about me to the CEO on the phone in the office (all my colleagues heard too).

She's mad because I handed it in the same time as my colleague (who was also very unhappy), and has said she's taken it very personally. She even edited my formal resignation letter from the company to omitt the line 'thanks for all your hard work'.

Now I don't k ow what to do? I'm shitting myself as I obviously cant get a reference. I'm also really hurt because I put a lot of my time into the company.

515,"Me [M25] Been with my [F20] ex-girlfriend for 2 years now, she came to me 4 days ago suddenly telling me that we should seperate (we lived together) and that we couldn't live together. I was crying and asking why, and she gave me an explanation, which actually sadly made sense, that she was overseen and that I changed her personality, by somewhat manipulating her. On top of that I didn't do well with her family and friends. I recognized these behaviours and really noticed that I did indeed do those things. I went home to dig deep that day on how to fix them, and I came with a solution and really actually knew how to fix them. What annoyed me was that she never said anything like ""if this pattern of behavior continues, I won't be able to continue""

So I returned to my girlfriend and asked for another chance since I would be able to change them with time (i know no one can tell), however she said no and this time said she needed some time apart and she needs to form her own personality. This confused me but also broke my heart, it was a different reason from the first ones, but the fact that we were over made me so scared and I had to puke.

The next two days goes by, I can't sleep, can't eat, constant feeling of anxiety and unease as if I have to do something constantly(is this normal?)

So yesterday was our last day, I helped her pack her things and she left, she was crying many times and so was I, the whole situation was very sad, and she said once she changed and I have changed we might find eachother in the future, but also told me not to expect anything. I said in a cold tone, that I would do what's best for me, and that torturing myself over someone who didn't stay with me is quite pointless. Her reaction was quite different and she got even more sad about that. She said she still loves me and feels as if I am the one, she just needs some time to find herself, since I influenced her so much in a direction that she's not herself.

I need to go no-contact, I really need to get over her, so I can function again. I see her everywhere, and associate the whole aprtment with her. I deleted all our images, unfollowed on instagram, made her invisible in snapchat and facebook. Also this is NOT a way to get her back, I really want to move forward, and if she decides to ask me to get her back, I think I'll reject, I won't risk anything, the way I feel these days SUCK. Constant anxiety, tense, not being able to eat or sleep. Also the anxiety, I don't know why I have it, I'm constantly shaking. My day consists of me checking reddit, looking at my phone, hoping for a message from her, not eating, shaking, constantly looking for help online.

Any advices people? Some motivation would also be awesome.",05Dec2019,1
516,"It didn’t seem like this post fits in r/Ask_Docs or here, like a weird in between, but i’ll post it here and you guys can let me know if i should post it there instead.

So basically, I am having tons of trouble understanding people. Not like emotionally, but when they tell me to do something. For example: The other day, my friend was showing me where to find the graphing paper. She told me it was in the shelves against the wall, which there were like TONS of. Different ones, too, like thin ones and the metal sorting ones. So when she told me it was the third one from the bottom on the left I could not understand what the fuck she meant. It was like gibberish. It took me at least 7 times of her repeating it for me to find it. Another example: Was playing Doom with my boyfriend on the phone and couldn’t find the exit to the level. Told me all these different directions and we gave up because I didn’t know what he meant.

Whenever this happens everyone loses patience with me and thinks I’m stupid but it’s just whenever someone tells me to do something, even if it’s as simple as sitting at a certain table, I can’t understand. I’m not a stupid person in general, I understand new subjects very quickly which is why I find it odd that this is the only thing I really have trouble understanding. Maybe comprehending is a better word. Like the words just go through my ears and completely dodge my head. 

I’ve told my therapist about this. I’m just wondering if it’s me being stupid or some type of mental disorder, like a weird form of Auditory Processing Disorder or something like that. What’s wrong with me?",05Dec2019,1
517,"I live in a small town in NC. For the past 20 or so years we paid a local water company for our water service but in 2018 for about 8 months there was some sort of issue and there was no one to pay. A place called Envirolink based out from Bailey NC took over, forgave everyone's past debt to the previous water company, and gave everyone a clean slate.

From the jump, we were behind because it took a while to inform everyone in the county. With late fees, we owed $300 for being behind 3 months. 

We paid that off and then suddenly in January 2019 they charged us $2400 for water. They charge a $35 base fee and $10 per thousand gallons used. 

When questioned how why we were being charged for around 200,000 gallons of water they said they would send someone to check if we had a leak but that if there was no leak, we'd have to pay the $2400. 

They claimed they send someone to check the leak but I'm home M - F and saw no one. They turned the water off and said we had to pay or we wouldn't get our service turned back on. They said that the meter is reading that we used $2400 worth of water (at $10 per THOUSAND gallons uses.) 

We made a payment arrangement and have been paying. I missed a payment once when my job put all my hours on someone else's paycheck but have otherwise paid according to the arrangement. 

Recently I saw on the news that others had filed a complaint in another county for similar issues so I thought I'd call the NC Utilities Commission to see if I could get my issue looked at because I still find it hard to believe we used $2400 of water at $10 per thousand gallons but they say that Envirolink is a third party company that isn't regulated by the NC Utilities Commission. So my question is WHO can I call to investigate?",05Dec2019,1

524,"I'm at uni, third year now and the last four years have been crazy. I've been so busy with socials, partying and dating, that I feel I have lost myself. I have become increasingly more unhappy and emotionally unstable. Academically, I went from an average of 90 to barely passing. 

I had a bad breakup and friends who pressure me to go out all the time and drink. They keep on telling me who I am, what I should do. I need space.

I need to sort myself out. I've started by deleting my social media, I've cleaned out my room, im rearranging it. Most of my classes are online next year so I will barely see my 'friends'. 

I am really fit so will be sticking to my fitness routine, but this year I want to study harder, I want to read books and learn things. 

I've been feeling sorry for myself and having break downs. But I've decided I'm over it. Now I'm taking back my life.

I'm a bit worried I'll have fomo, feel lonely and miss out. But I'll be working on improving myself.

525,"(M 17)
So i started playing football (soccer) competitively about a year and a month ago. I started to play for a mens team that was basically playing just for the heck of it (futsal). Basically sunday league maybe even lower. When the outdoor season started i was promoted to 3rd choice goalkeeper in our 2nd team (placed in the 5th division in my country). I played a couple games off the bench, eventually started some aswell and on the last game of the season i started for the first team (4th division). So i went from beliw sunday league level to 4th divison. Im wondering if i should maybe transfer teams to a club that has teams in every division (including 1st) so i can rank up and eventually become a professional in my country. I reckon i could make the 1st division by the time im 19 or 20. It will require aloooot of work but im up for it as it is my dream. The goal is to get scouted and end up playing professional in another country as you cant live off football that well here. Especially being a non superstar.

My question is if its worth it. And if yes how i should go about it. If i were to stay at my current club im now probably the 1st or 2nd choice goalkeeper in the 2nd team. I could start alot of games and get in game experience but if i were to change clubs then the training programme and the coaches would be elite and it would improve my skills alot as im very determined to learn and listen to my coaches advice. Some the coaches at the other club are to my knowledge UEFA certified or something (they coach the higher division teams like 1-3 logically).",05Dec2019,1

530,"I posted this on r/AskDocs yesterday but got no reply so I reposted on r/AskDocs again and posting on her. 


Male, 20 years old, 270 pounds.

For the past few days I’ve started to have at least 3 bowel movements a day when I usually have one. It’s been like this for the past few days. For the first three days, I had pretty bad nausea. The first time I had nausea was at night and the second was when I woke up the next morning but it went away. Then, next morning after that, nausea in the morning and went away when I went to go do something. 

This is the fourth day. I just had a bowel movement, everything was normal. No pain, no nothing. But, when I was wiping, there was a small amount of red stuff on the toilet paper which I assumed to be blood. There was no red stuff at the first few wipes and none after that wipe. I’ve also noticed that my anus has been itchy, especially when I wipe but I thought that was due to me going to the bathroom three times a day. Is this something to be concerned about or no?

Same thing this morning. Used restroom but not as much but also when I wiped their was blood. It feels as if the blood is coming from me wiping too much but I don’t know. What should I do?",05Dec2019,1

532,"Hi everyone,

Currently I am a third year college student and around September I decided to join a school organization. I didn’t know anyone on the org, however, the clubs Vice President was really nice and said if I have any questions etc I can come to him. We ended up talking a lot, and through the course of some weeks we became really good friends. The only thing is that he would flirt with me even though he has a girlfriend.

Later on, he admitted to me that he and his girlfriend aren’t actually official as people think, they aren’t that serious, and in reality his relationship is “single.” It wasn’t too long until we kissed and almost hooked up, only for him to tell me after that he lied and he is officially with his girlfriend. Not only did I feel guilty, I learnt that he told the president of the organization that we did indeed sleep together (which isn’t true). 

I’m really upset and angry for feeling like I betrayed his girlfriend (even though I don’t know her), alongside him spreading information that isn’t true, and that too telling the president. Do I say anything to him or do I just ignore him?",05Dec2019,1

535,"I am currently  in grade 11.My maternal grandparents died  while I was in grade 9. I was close to them and they were a huge financial  support to my mother but now they dont exist. My paternal  grandpa is dead and my paternal grandma hates my family. Both of my sisters are 25+ unemployed.  I am currently  pursuing  medical stream. My family is blessed to have a small car, AC, tv, ps4 but all of them  involve help from my late grandma(maternal) or my uncle. My grandma was a bad mom because of which my mom could not study well and hence she is at a low paid job. I am going to tell you my whole story so please have patience.

I was amazing at studies till class 3. I skipped class 4 and sucked at studies in class 5. I improved myself in class 6 and 7 and got good grades and then I met 'her'. She was my first friend in grade 7 and I loved her handwriting and drawings. Used to talk with her everyday and grew attached to her. Class 8,9,10 came and we were in different  classes. I was crazy after her. Didn't  have any crush other than her the whole time. She changed her bf thrice during the time period.  I helped her with exam stress, bf stress and friendship stress. I was always there for her. She never considered  me a true friend and pretty  much used me. I used to fight with her to change her bfs because  her bfs suck and one of them called her a slut before SHE proposed to him. She never even showed  up on my bdays. I knew each and every thing about her like fav color, food,movie etc.I gathered up the courage to speak the truth to her in grade 11 to which she replied that she is already in a relationship  and I should forget about this and remain friends with her. I removed her from my contacts  sensing  she is just there to use me but I can't  get her out of my head.

In grade 10 I became friends with a guy(Let us call him X)  who said that he had no friends and needed me. He wanted to be my best friend but I always said that he wasn't  my best friend because by grade 10 I had stopped believing  in people. He hated a guy( who was my friend and the dude's friend in the past) and wanted to take revenge on him(Call him Y). Y gave me a hard disk and I joked to X about how he should steal it to take revenge. X took it seriously and took the hard disk with him. Turns out Y wasn't  the owner of the hard disk and I was called a fraud in my school. X returned  the disk after I begged him for it. After  grade 10 ended,  X called me for a meeting in park which I refused because  my mom didn't  want me to go.  My other friend didn't  come to because I didn't  come so it offended X. He broke up the friendship which I restored by constant apologies. His attitude changed towards me in grade 11. He started ignoring me and said he doesn't  have time for me. He also stopped playing online games with me and started focussing  on his basketball  career. I lost his gta 5 game cd and I promised  to pay him back. After  1 week, I offered him the money which he refused  saying he can't  take it yet because  of water logging in his area and his mother won't  give their bank account. After a few weeks he came to me and said that he needed the money tomorrow  and if I don't  give him the money , I would suffer the consequences.  I told him he is a jerk and that i am not a machine who has money with me everytime. It was his fault he didn't  take the money when i offered. I gave him his money back and that's  how our friendship  ended. Turns out, Y is his best friend now. I was just a replacement  friend.

When it comes to studies, I was never a studious learner. In grades 8,9,10 I barely used to study and had a habit of studying  1or 2 days before exams and getting 90% easily. My sisters were to lazy and sucked at studies( they hated maths). I hated maths as well but managed to get 99% in matths due to hard work in grade 10. This made my mom and dad have too many expectations  from me. My sisters are 25+unemployed  and are too lazy for any competitive  exam/ finding a job. My mother is at fault as well since she forced my sisters to go for competitive  exams for civil services and banking when both of my sisters aren't  into it. 

When grade 10 results came I was depressed.  My education board had screwed up my results and had given me 76 % in science and 82 % in social science. My parents and teachers were shocked and I went for re evaluation. I saw my paper and the examiner was the dumbest guy ever giving  3 out of 5 in every  correct answer. I was full of depression  and self doubt during this period. The re evaluation  result cameout  a month after with 95% in science ( I deserved 97) and 95% in social science(I deserved 99%).  However,  this was futile as admissions had already  closed and I couldn't  get my fav school.

My mother wanted me to take medical stream and become a doctor and I went for it to make her happy. Personally, I had no idea what I wanted  to do( I do like biology ) so I went with whatever she wanted me to do. My grades are degrading  in grade 11 but I am still scoring better than most kids. However, this isn't  a beneficial  thing because questions  in school are subjective while competitive  exam questions  medical stream is objective  and most kids are busy doing coaching  and solving objective questions rather than subjective.  As for me, I am tired all day even though I do nothing and going to school alone makes me sleepy all day. I don't  have  strength or motivation  to do coaching/ tuition and the only reason I do better than most kids in subjective exams is because I study 2 days before  exam out of fear of failing in subjective  exams but since I don't  practise objectives questions,  it is all futile. 

I have lost all motivation  in studying  and I just want to just sleep all day. I don't  want to study even though  I know how much my mom will be disappointed  if I don't  get into medical stream. My parents have high expectations  from me but I just don't  want to study anymore. My sisters staying unemployed  and me not getting motivated like others are for medical further depresses me. This depression  worked when I sucked at maths and worked hard for it in grade 10 but I don't  think so that this is going to work again. I just  have no motivation  in studying. It's  not like I dislike science stream ( I will never take arts as history/geography  is too boring and commerce has economics which I could never get) or that I do not want to get into medical stream. It's  just that I don't  want to get into anything,  I don't  want to do anything  anymore and I just want to sleep. I like videogames and cartoons and I waste half of my days sleeping and at such activities but even they feel monotonous  these days. I have no idea what kind of job do I want to do or what subject is my favorite. 

Socially , I am introverted  and have no one I can call true friend. I dislike abusing, modern trends like watching endgame(loved joker though), rock and rap music,  having relationships  just for sex, Instagram and I like to think about society,feminism , nature and I hate it when most teens are selfish so I don't  fit in with most teens. I also have masturbation  and porn addiction  so I am on no fap for 2 weeks. Heck even masturbation  seems boring  now. I haven't  had a crush after the class 7 girl ( well except celebrity  crushes like sabrina carpenter). I don't  understand  why I liked her because she is literally  the embodiment  of everything  I dislike about teens. I am depressed about society and the way things are. Things like rape, abuse, pollution  are simply disgusting. 

As for suicidal thoughts,  I often wonder what does it feel like to go out of existence and I am afraid of death(lol). But I often think  life would have been better if I didn't  exist. I don't  want to tell my mother about such things. She doesn't  know how to handle such issues and she has problems of her own like when my sister ran away from home(but returned later). I hate the way the society  is and do not want to live in a society full of selfish  pricks. I also hate the education system as well as the fact that 90% syallabus  of my country's  medical entrance  exam  is irrelevant  for future studies.",05Dec2019,1

545,"Pretty much after a year of not talking, this person went and most a post about our falling out. I had a few people at this point messaging me and threatening me. I just blocked them and deleted them. Didn’t really entertain that drama. 

Then she makes another post posting screenshots about how I disclosed my mental health issues. At this point I was in tears. The only reason I knew was because a mutual friend was showing me screenshots. 

At this point I messaged her and she apologized and took everything down. She was unblocked and she had all the time in the world to message me but instead she decided to make a post. And because of this I was getting called names and being threatened. 

We made up, for the most part. She’s very adamant on being friends now, but I just don’t trust her. And I’m not sure if I should. 

I let it go and moved on, but then she did it again to another person. This time it was false accusations that were made about him from another girl. The post was just one text of the false accusation and it blew up. This ended up in him being scared to leave his home for months because of the death threats he was receiving. He lost most of his friends and was being witch hunted horribly. He moved out of the area to get away from it. 

After I had heard someone was scared to leave their house, I just don’t know if should be friends with someone like that.

546,"Okay, so this is my first post here on reddit. I don't have anybody to talk to about this situation who isn't directly involved. and i'm not the type to vent about my personal life to friends. So I came to you guys for some much needed advice and outside oppinions.

I recently learned from my fiances grandmother that my FIL was accused of molesting his 4 year old neice. The alleged victim spoke up about the attack when she was 16 but then quickly told authorities she didnt want to move further in the investigation. She's now 18 and still claims it to be true to this day. She said she chose not to coroperate with the investigators because she already moved on and forgave him.

Yesterday my MIL mentioned to me that when she and her husband (the alleged abuser) first got married she discovered her husbands mother was sending his pornography through email. She said she didnt do anything about it...

My fiance isn't close to his father, and even can remember times where he was emotionally and physically abusive to him as a child. 

My MIL side of the family has a history of sexual abuse. her grandfather raped her aunt for years as a child and abused her grandmother and her mom and uncle. to the point where her mom devolped mood/personality disorders. and is a diagnosed shziophrenic. My MIL was raped as a child by a family friend.

My fiance has never disclosed to me any sexual abuse in his own past but i heard from his parents he wet the bed until he was around 10/11years old. and that to me, is an indicator of childhood sexual abuse....sometimes i wonder if maybe he was sexually abused as a child....

oh, and my FIL was 27 when he started dating my MIL who was 17! 

My MIL walks around the house while we are over there naked. completly exposed to us, and she's been that way with me since maybe 3 or 4 months into dating her son. 

The more i get to know my fiance's family the more and more creepy they become....Like their history of sexual abuse and allegations make me want to run for the hills. 

Am i over reacting or does this family sound down right dysfuctional and creepy to you guys too? My fiance stays far away from them and i think i'm starting to understand why. He's never given me a direct reason why he doesnt like going to their house other than it gives him ""anxiety""

553,"I have a problem. I'm a 21 year old guy and for some reason I often get hit on pretty aggressively.

One example would be last week. I got to know a few new people and one of them was a girl. She wasn't my type at all, but she was really friendly so I thought we could still be friends. She instantly asked me if we should meet up after the group meeting was over and I said sure. Two hours later and we are at my place and she makes it really obvious that she wants to have sex with me. I didn't, because like I said she wasn't my type, so I threw her out.

Now I don't get why this happens to me, and it happens relatively often. I'm not unattractive, but I'm also not the most attractive guy in the world. I'm a normal dude. But my male friends who are more attractive than I am AND my male friends who are less attractive than I am both do not experience this behaviour. So it doesn't even have anything to do with how attractive I am.

So what is it? I thought maybe I appear too flirty and therefore girls misunderstand my intentions, but I'm really calm and introverted so I don't think that's the reason. And one more thing. I don't want to sounds superficial, but I noticed that the girls who are behaving that aggressive are usually less attractive than the average. I hope I don't hurt anybody with that statement or appear like a douche, but I just noticed this pattern.

554,So I’ve been with her for a year and the first 6 months were great she had goals in life she was going to school to be a nurse and she treated me great she made me happy and feel wanted but then she moved back to her dads and started hanging out with her old friend.

I broke up with her and she got worse and was crying all the time and me being the stupid person I am I took her back.

555,"I’ll try to keep it short and snappy, so bear with me!

Tomorrow, there’s an assembly where the ‘best students’ will get an award (one for each subject + things like kindness, etc). My mum expects me to get one. The problem is, I’ve been trying to keep up with everything and, although I do have good grades and get close-to-perfect results, I’m definitely not the smartest in the class by any means. Basically, what I’m trying to say, is that there’s no way I’m going to get any awards. I’m probably going to have a panic attack or something tomorrow when that fact settles in though. 

The last time (and first) I didn’t get an award was 2017. I remember it vividly, and how she had slapped me, scolded me and made me sit outside to be bitten all over my mosquitoes. She was so, so, SO disappointed. I’m terrified if that’ll happen again, and I’ve tried to prepare myself all throughout the years since that incident. She’s told me that if I don’t get one, she’ll be extremely mad. That usually means horrid things.

558,"So I work at a fast food restaurant. I work midnights, alone for half of my shift. I always clean and the store always looks perfect. Then days staff comes in 
There’s this one girl, let’s call her Bigbits. Bigbits is one lazy hag. Our rush hour starts around 5am and Bigbits either folds napkins or watches me clean. She rarely puts coffee on, she rarely cleans or stocks her station. But she stays in the drive thru area. Then, when drive thru goes off she won’t. Take. The. Order. It’s a game of me getting so pissed I just do it, but I’m in charge of front counter 
Now I would be fine with this if she helped when front gets busy. When rush happens, Bigbits does well enough, but immediately gets annoyed if I can’t assist her in drive thru by making her food orders. 
So. I am expected to do food. Front counter. And take her orders when she plays her bitchass game of silence of the fucking fast food employee 
So today, she is yelling because nobody is making her food. She also doesn’t help me at front until manager yells at her. By now I am fucking sweating and after I’m done making food I run to the back to wipe my face because it’s legit in my eyes lmao. Manager follows me barking that we have customers up front and to HELP BIGBITS. She asks me if I’m ok tho but by now I am seeing the divine god of my anger and walk back up, because Bigbits has the independence skills of a cucumber. 
So how come Bigbits can play fiddle fart with the fuckaround gang? How come I have to be the flash and zoom from station to station but can’t go wipe my face? How come my coworkers can go out for smokes during rush, go take huge ogre shits or be Bigbits? 
How do I get out of the neverending loop of Bigbits shenanigans? Most Importantly, how do I subtly give Bigbits the crushing realization that she is as useful as tits on a boar?",05Dec2019,1
559,"If I can see exactly where I made a mistake/lost out on opportunities, should I go back and fix it e.g. taking up the studies I should’ve taken, learning the things I would have learn back then etc? Or do I move on and create an alternative path? 

I feel that often that life goes a straight path and when though I’m deviating from the path, the opportunities that were based on what could have been still show up. In a way it feels like life’s predestined. The question remains, I’ve already gotten off track and I can’t take the opportunities without feeling like an imposter. What can I do now? 


Long story: I’ve been diagnosed with AVPD (avoidant) tendencies and probably a mixture of other cluster B (NPD/BPD) traits such as low self esteem, black white thinking etc. This is largely due to my mom being mentally unstable and causing me a lot of issues during childhood. I end up avoiding a lot of stuff that my gut feeling tells me to take and looking back, I can see exactly what I would’ve done and path that I should’ve taken if it wasn’t because of my AVPD tendencies.

My dad offered me a personal loan with 10% interest if I bought a used SUV under $10,000. In addition to the loan, he wants me to work for him to pay it back and has made remarks about how I should quit my job in order to join his startup. I'd need a certification to do the job he's asking for and as a recent college graduate I have no interest in taking and paying for another class. He also wants me to send all of my documentation for my new job to him (job offer, savings, insurance, bank balance, and rental agreement).

The past vehicles he has given me during college have been old and required a lot of maintenance which he didn't pay for. I don't trust him and will be uncomfortable being in debt to him due to past experiences of him repossessing things he has given me when he gets angry and/or making me jump through hoops to get them back.

My parents were extremely clear that they would not support me in getting a dog or help me if I did get one. They reminded me every time they called for months that I was not to get a doggo. A few weeks after graduation, against their wishes, I rescued a husky/German shepherd mix who has now become my best friend. It has been quite some time now and I am getting tired of having to lock myself in a room every time they call so they don’t hear my dog playing. I also have had to block them on all of my social media and I have had to be extremely careful of what I say to them and what friends say to them because it is extremely easy to slip up and talk about my dog!

566,"Hi!! 
 So I F21 am a college junior. I have been working at this grocery store since April, meaning I worked at the end of last semester, the whole summer and the entirety of this semester. I just transferred from community college to university, and so this has been my first semester commuting roughly under an hour to school. As I'm taking upper level courses now, I managed to stay on top of my classes but not without some difficulty as between school and work I at best have 1 day off a week. 

Anyway- this semester I had to drop one of my classes because I didn't feel that with everything else I was doing that I could devote enough time to do any of the work justice. That means, this semester I have to take an extra class. This semester is especially important for a number of reasons, but I won't get into that now. 

I know that in a matter of days my manager is probably going to ask when I can have open availability again and if I know when I have class next semester. I know I'm not going to work next semester, but is it best to tell him now? I'm in at will state so I fear that if I tell him that any little thing I do could get me fired between now and then, and I was really planning on working full time January to have a little extra cash before I go back to school as I will be commuting and needing to pay for gas again. 

Personally, I feel like the more notice the better and like I'd be screwing my manager over by making him think that I'll be around next semester.  But I also am depending on getting 1-2 full time paychecks in January and I don't want to dig myself into too deep of a hole. I'll tell him I'll come back in the summer again if he'd like, but I can't work next semester. 


Tldr; put in my 2 weeks at the 2 weeks mark or tell my manager now I can't work after the end of January?",05Dec2019,1

570,"Alright I'll keep this somewhat short: recently moved to a new duplex with my wife and the following weekend decided to have a housewarming party with friends. In the meantime the other neighbors would say hello and welcome us whereas our immediate connected neighbor would completely ignore us/ we never even saw them leave.

Party is happening on Friday at 8 at night, made sure you couldn't hear music outside and I thought it wasn't loud enough to bother them (they are connected). At about 12:30AM (quiet hours are 11PM to 8AM) we get a call from our cop friend on duty saying they just got a call for a noise complaint in our area and he's sure it's us. Cop comes, wife talks to him for like .5 seconds and he's gone. 

Monday comes and the landlord left me a voicemail saying they received emails and voicemails over the weekend regarding loud music. I went in to pay the rent and he literally didn't even care until I mentioned it and apologized, he just said it's ok things happen and asked if I was comfortable there and settling in. 

Never see the neighbors at all and if we do they are very reclusive and avoidant. Only seen the guy neighbor once and the woman a handful, she refuses to walk her dog past the front porch if I'm walking mine, never ever makes eye contact. And whenever I park in the driveway and she's walking the dog she doesn't even acknowledge my/ our presence. 

How should I even handle this? I don't want to be confrontational but don't want the cops called on a whim everytime they are unhappy with something. And I get this vibe that they would be the ones to try to ""oust"" us via complaints since we are the newcomers. Thoughts?

I texted him “hey, so tell me about yourself since i don’t really know you and it’s kinda awkward haha.” he straight up told me “that’s kinda weird. i don’t talk to people and i dont want to be friends with you and i’m not looking for any friends. we can talk about school but don’t text me about anything else sorry.

Chances are it's her current bf she's been with since we broke up, but she has been known to cheat (granted that was YEARS ago). They seem really happy together and are engaged to be married. 

Should I tell her? Confront him/ possibly out her for cheating? I'm confused, dudes.",05Dec2019,1
587,"Sorry if this is long but let me tell you I’m CONFUSED and the details are important.

So 6 months ago, I met this guy on bumble. We hit it off immediately! He informed me that he just accepted a job out of state, but asked if I was willing to still get to know him. I agreed because I felt such an instant connection. We FaceTimed every night for 2 months, he asked me to be his girlfriend. In that two months we both knew we were falling in love. The compatibility felt too good to be true. Soulmate material. Same favorite movies, tv shows, music, food, sense of humor, political stances, and general outlook on life.He came home, we met in person, and we were just as compatible in person as on FaceTime. He introduced me to his parents, we were intimate, everything was amazing. Once he returned to his place out of state, I tried to bring up the distance, kind of trying to get a feel for his idea of the future. I understood that it was early, but our situation was unique and it seemed reasonable that we have an end goal at some point. He kind of got weird on me, and said that he was taking things one day at a time. So I agreed to do the same. After that things were still amazing. We were great communicators, supporters, he told me I was beautiful every day and most importantly we were each other’s best friends. We absolutely never had an argument. He came home again 3 weeks later, and we spent another amazing weekend together. Again, he took me to his parents house where I met the rest of his family, siblings and uncles. While we were together he said that his time with me the last two days were the best days he’s had in months. We kissed goodbye. I said I would see him soon. It was magical. He got back to his place out of state, and all of a sudden he broke things off with me. He said he had a mental break down leaving me. That he can not have a mental break down every time he leaves me. It’s not good for him. He never wanted to move home, and he doesn’t want me leaving my home to be with him, it was too much to ask. He had convinced himself this would end badly and there was no other solution. He said he was sorry he ever did this to me, but this was the hardest decision he ever had to make. He was crying, he said he loved me and I was his best friend. But he needed to separate himself from home and that included me. I was so blindsided. He had never expressed any of this to me in the past. It is important to note he struggles with clinical depression. 

Not my finest moments but I begged him. I said give us time to grow. We didn’t know what would happen. That he was making this decision for me. I was poking holes in his excuse and he started to get angry with me. For the first time ever he raised his voice to me, saying that he needed to “do him”. This was not like him at all. He never spoke like this. What happened in the 24 hours from him having me at his parents house to him going home? By the way he said his parents and siblings all loved me to death. So what was the problem? He cut off all communication. Deleted me on all social media. No texts or calls. I’m heart broken. I feel used. Was I just an emotional security blanket for him while he adjusted to life in a new place? He claimed distance was the only reason but it feels more complicated than that. I want him back, but he doesn’t want me. Which is LAME. I don’t deserve that. But our connection was 1 in a million. I need ADVICE, opinions, perspective, anything at all because I’m just left hurting and confused.",05Dec2019,1
590,"Okay so quick backstory: My brother had a life threatening illness a long time ago and since then everyone in the family just pampers him and has never said no to him in his life, to the point that any semblance of disagreement. I am someone who he loves blindly but I'm also the one person who actually stands ground to give a different opinion. Everytime this has happened, he has lost complete control over his temper...like 0 to 100 in a span of 5 seconds. And he'll proceed to break things around him and scream enough to be heard from the end of the road. On an occasion or two, he has even gone on to hit me out of pure rage. But that hasnt happened in a few years.

 Recently I have become a little friendly with one of his friends and on one of the ocassions when we were hanging out, he broached the topic of his rage and how its uncontrollable, even among his friends and his wife. I was honestly relieved to be able to talk about it because it is something that has bothered me for ages because my fam is blind about him and they dont see this seriously. And it really bothered me to hear that he gets into physical and extreme situations with other people as well. If I wasn't family, I wouldnt ever look at him in the face again. This friend and I promised this was a conversation that would stay just between the two of us and nothing more. Now a few days back, he had one of those enraged episodes and frankly, it was quite disgusting. I haven't been speaking to him and even though our parents were hurt with his attitude, they are over it but I'm not. Anyway, so today it turns out that the friend had no intention of keeping the conversation between us, and has added colour to whatever I had shared from my end and that has reached my brother's ears and now I honestly dont know what to do. He asked me and I point blank denied because anyway the manner of things he asked if I have said, are untrue...I said them in a far different tone and definitely didnt need such strong words. 

I guess I didnt get things through properly because I am also scared of this being read by family members so I am not putting in details. but I am tired of people buying his bullshit and then me being the wrong one because ""If I didnt disagree with him on stuff, no fights would have broken out"". And now me trusting ONE person to have a mature conversation, something I purely did because i thought it was for the best, has made me look like a giant bitch who airs dirty laundry to random people. I'm especially scared of him asking me more infront of family and a lot of things will fall out of the cupboard (substance abuse, physical, mental...all of him regarding him) and it will break my mother.

603,"I also posted this in r/findapath because I would like as much insight as possible.

I couldn't keep this short but I'll leave a tl;dr. 

I went to college right after high school because my parents wanted me to. Not anything in particular, they let me choose, but it had to be a university. I'll point out education in my country is affordable without scholarships. Up to this point, I'd never had anything clear, I remember having considered every carreer path when I was growing up and not really falling in love with any of them. I've wanted to be a nurse, a lawyer, a vet, a historian, a chef, you name it. I don't think there's anything I haven't considered, and everything I've considered, I haven't really LOVED the idea.

Anyway, I decided to major in English Literature because I knew English and it seemed like an easy enough major. I dropped out after 2 years (4-year major) and started working because it made me so much happier. I taught English in a small school for adults. Eventually though my workplace became very toxic for me, because one of the new hires and I didn't get along and my boss took her side. Suddenly my job was making me miserable. So, I changed jobs and I began working at a call center. Unfortunately I broke my leg halfway through the training and I wasn't able to finish it, so I was told I could reapply 6 months later. But I needed the money so I went to a different call center and got a job there. It was a temporary contract (3 months) and I got really sick a month and a half into the contract. I spent the rest of the time hospitalized and so my contract wasn't renewed. By that time I was already living with my boyfriend so he told me not to worry about it, and so I proceded to be kind of like a Stay-at-home partner (?), where I wouldn't work but I'd run the errands and to house chores. 

This year I started going to therapy and at some point I was convinced that I wanted to go back to school. (i stopped seeing this therapist because I didn't feel very comfortable and am now seeing another one but he focuses in other areas of my life other than my career path) My partner though it was a great idea and he is paying for my education now with help from my parents. I went into entertainment management. I'm not working atm. Also, I made a mistake and also enrolled for an online degree in accounting. I'm on the second semester of both and I don't really like them. I don't know why I agreed to this in the first place. I guess I was sick of staying home all day everyday, and I will say going to school has improved my mental health a good deal, but I'd say any sort of occupation would do that to me. 

Thing is, I'm not excited at all about either major. Actually, I'm not interested at all in accounting. At the beginning I did picture myself getting a job in the field but now I can't picture myself there anymore and I genuinely don't know what I'm gonna do once I finish. I'm terrified of quitting because my parents have always made a point to tell me that I'm very inconsistent and I know I am. And I don't know how to fix it I'm just more of a practical person and I wanted to learn how to do nails or how to bake or something like that. But my parents insisted that I go to college instead because those skills wouldn't get me anywhere. Well, here I am 6 years later and I'm nowhere. I want to have money of my own, but I can't get a job other than in call centers (which isn't my cup of tea) and English schools (but most of them require a degree which I don't have and the ones that don't pay ridiculously bad). 

I went back to school so I could get a better paying job but I'm not sure that's something I could do until I die or retire. I'm so lost and frustrated. I don't want to drop out but ONLY because of how that would make me, my parents, and my boyfriend feel. I feel like I'm not to be trusted because of this. I really want to have a profitable skill other than English, but I don't have any other, I feel.

Should I stick to uni since I don't have any skills or should I start working on building skills instead? Or should I stay in college while I build my skills so as not to disappoint my family? The problem I find with the latter option is that right now my parents and bf are paying money for me to get a college education and if I wanted to learn how to do nails that would mean another investment which they would be paying for. I'm so sad and I don't know what to do. I just know I don't want an office job. And my partner is so happy for me that I'm going to uni... Please help

tl;dr: on my second attempt at getting a degree, failing emotionally. Want to make a living without 4 years of worthless education.",05Dec2019,1
604,"October 2019

I'm currently a freshman at my highschool. So I have this friend (F 15) who was chatting with me through messenger. she was sad and kinda mad at another girl in our class. That girl used to talk trash about my friend and I joked that we should put laxatives in her water bottle and steal her phone and then sell it to some pawn shop or whatever. What I didn't know was that girl was logged in my account and took screenshots of our chat with my friend. She decided to tell her friends about it and all of this reached twitter (where I learned someone logged in my account). Everyone knew of what happened and they were all ranting on twitter about me and my friend. It was like hell seeing all those hate. It hurt so much to even see the people you used to hang out with drop shade about you where EVERYONE at my school can see.

I was lucky that was during a semestral break, so I waited until the break was over to say sorry and to make up for my mistakes. The following days, we had a confrontation with me and my friend and the girl and her other friends. We told everything and explained my side and I cried so much because I couldn't comprehend what was going on. Everyone was just dropping shade about me, even the seniors. After all that confrontation, we already said our sorry and we were Ok now, no more beef

A month has passed. Everything went fine with me, my friend and the girl. Except, when the fighting was still on, apparently some of my own friends sided with the girl and even though the girl already forgave me, my friends are still avoiding me, and a month ago they were also dropping shade about me where there were A LOT of people and so I kept asking advice from the real friends that stayed with me despite all that happened and I did what they told me to do.

606,"I live in a two floor outdoor one-bedroom only apartments. I have had a few interesting neighbors over the years where I live - the neighbor who insists on owning three cars and clogging up our small parking lot, the upstairs neighbor who insists on parking in front of our door instead of allowing us to park there which is more logically, the neighbor who insists on walking her rottweiler off-leash, the neighbor who pulls up blasting loud rap music before turning his car off - but the last family to move in is the worst!

Our little place is not highbrow, but it is nice despite a few bad apples of varying degrees of irritation. But one thing that it always was until recently is clean, but that is gone now that the litterers are here, and no, I'm not talking about a small gum wrapper or a straw wrapper. I mean empty containers that once held food, crumpled and uncrumpled full size sheets of paper, one shoe (this was left on top of a bush), one sandal, unwanted clothes, empty bottles, etc. It's outrageous! I don't know how people do that and I am no eager to see how they are living. 

I e-mailed my rental property which owns a bunch of other properties and they said that they will handle it but I really don't think they did anything. When I came home the next day I saw a piece of paper from the rental community rubberbanded to my door (that is how they communicate important notices to us) saying that tenants should not be littering, but mine was the only door with the notice. Compare that to other times when the notice would still be there on most other doors when I get home since I get off work early. I think that they did not really want to get involved, but put it on my door to get me to believe that they actually did address this issue. 

That I know of, the only thing I can do in this situation is report it to the rental property, which I did. Is there anything else I can do? I was advised not to address the littering family directly because it could blow up in my face and lead to complaints against me where I could get evicted for causing trouble.

I’m thinking about not going back though. And I really want to Indian my education and get my masters (which I can do in one year if I stay at this school). 
I want to take a semester off but that adds a year to my graduation date and I really just want to get a full time job with the associates degree I have and buy a new house etc. 
I’m also super nervous about staying in school because along with my health issues I’ve had reproductive health issues and the dr’s have literally said to think about having kids sooner than later.

609,"T.W: suicide, abuse

I wanted to ask if this happens to anyone, and if this is normal. I guess the header is self-explanatory, but to help you understand, I’ll provide context.

When I was young, I’ve witnessed multiple events that include people (family) being physically and emotionally abused or are in a state of crisis. I think it has affected my way of reacting to everything since I got used to it, given that whenever I am in that situation, I usually remain calm or shrug the thought and continue what I’m doing.

I can’t say I’m apathetic, since I am capable of showing emotions and consideration. But I guess the only thing that bothers me is that I only show a little bit of concern but then I’m back to my usual self as if nothing happened.

For example, a friend of mine was considering suicide earlier. Although the rest of my friends were panicking, I was unusually calm and proceeded to do what I could as a friend. The only catch was, I felt empty. 

Despite the fact I managed to cry for my friend during that time, I knew within myself that I felt too calm - to the point I was capable of browsing through reddit/memes/etc. while I was literally witnessing someone in a crisis.

Is this normal? Or am I just a jackass and am not aware of it? What do I do to improve my behavior?

I need sincere answers/advice, I want to know what you think. Thank you.",05Dec2019,1
610,"First off, apologies in advance if I respond a bit slowly. Not only is this the first time I'm here, I'm also abroad in Taiwan for the next few days so my hours are messy and might not be too quick

Also sorry if this is a bit long

This also happened a few hours ago and I'm unsure on how to repair the situation

Background:

My friend went to Korea over the summer and met a Taiwanese girl also hanging in Korea at the same time. They hung around for a whole month, got along and kept in contact

For simplicity and privacy, I shall call my friend ""Bro"", and the girl, ""girl""

Bro and I met briefly years ago through a mutual friend before he moved out a few years ago. However we've kept in contact by playing games with a pretty sizable group of mutual friends over Discord

Girl has plans to visit bro in America in January during her own school break

Fast forward:

I am in Taiwan now for a few days, my Dad has business with Taipei University and brought me and my mom along to sight see when he's free after

Before I left for Taiwan a few days ago bro says ""hey man, here's girl's Instagram, you should hang out with her in Taiwan!""

On one condition: ""Do not say ANYTHING about me, got it? I'm fucking serious""

Sure, why not? I contact her before I leave, and arrived yesterday. Today, I met up with her, had some lunch, then swung by a local coffee shop to relax a bit

Now unfortunately, this happened:

I am way too fucking honest for my own good I can maybe tell a white lie once, but eventually I'll spill my dang guts because my parents didn't raise a liar.

Since one of the big things girl and I have in common are we both know Bro, naturally the conversation with girl drifted to bro

Since she hasn't seen him in a few months and only contacts him via Instagram, she has some questions about him.

So...here's where the problems come. Girl REALLY likes Bro, as in bro is girl's first love. I don't think Bro quite returns the feelings as strongly. Sure he's got some interest, but he's had some failed relationships before and is (understandably) cautious. Especially with a long distance relationship

Now, I like bro, I've known him for years and consider him a good friend to hang with, but there's no denying he's a douchebag sometimes and I definitely want to punch his face in some days before we cool off the next day

So...bro drunkenly put a picture of himself at the bar on his instagram a few weeks back of him with another friend of ours...hanging with some pretty attractive looking girls and looking quite intoxicated

Girl asked him about this picture and he avoided saying too much

After being asked a few times if he drinks/uses any substances (I attempted and failed to dodge the question) I (not thinking it was going to be too big a deal) spilled the beans that ""eh, bro just smokes a bit and goes out drinking with some of our other friends on Thursdays"". I withheld the fact that he's a pothead though thinking that this would be the danger zone.

Now she starts crying and I'm just like ""oh shit"". I let her cry a bit and give her a few tissues and (stupidly) ask ""are you okay? What's wrong?"".

I was expecting her to go on a story about how smoking/alcohol killed a relative. Instead she explains now that while she likes bro, she's not sure if she can trust him not because of the fact that he smokes and drinks, but because he HID the fact he does these things

I did not know beforehand that he hid these from her. After all, bro smokes...a lot...like to the point my friends and I are legitimately concerned about his health, and from the sounds of things he got drunk over in Korea while partying too.

I (not knowing wtf to really do) spent the next hour or so desperately trying to comfort her and calm her down and give her some advice while the coffee shop owner shot weird looks in our direction but didn't interfere

fortunately I am a good listener, and girl eventually calms down and we talk a bit more calmly

Before we split. I try my damned hardest to ensure the following:

1. She stops crying (Success thankfully)
2. Reassure her that bro is still a good and (mostly) honest person (Success I think?)
3. She is still willing to meet bro in America (Success? She wanted to cancel at first, but my reassurances managed to convince her to go ahead)

So, Bro stays up way later than he logically should and after him messaging me I hop into Discord. He says she hasn't been responding to his IG pings and wants to know what's up

I tell him the truth knowing full well he's gonna be pissed and probably not believe parts of what I say, but I'm not gonna lie and make things worse and not to mention, I'm too honest for my own good anyway.

Damn right he is pissed, yelling at me like ""DUDE WTF I ASKED YOU TO DO ONE FUCKING THING"". He continues to demand I tell him the truth. I keep saying ""I told you the truth"". He just goes ""whatever you fucking say, I'm going to bed"" and immediately leaves Discord

See, I had spent that conversation trying to basically say that I'd calmed her down and reassured her. But I didn't have the chance to say ""she'll still visit you in America"" or ""Dude, you're the one who put me in a tight spot because you basically asked me to lie for you""

So yeah, here I am on the other side of the world from home having possibly broken some poor girl's heart and pissed my friend off super hard because I was too damn honest and broke a promise. FUCK

Fortunately, I have the following going for me:

Girl somewhat ""covered"" for me by explaining that I honestly thought that she knew he smoked/drank

I do not know their exact conversation, but girl claims they are ""okay"" now and says she hopes she hurt our friendship

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm lost. Not only do I wonder if I did the right thing, I also wonder what am I to do with Bro? I DID breach his trust by speaking about him when he explicitly asked me not to. HOWEVER I did so only after being questioned a lot

Furthermore, after the guilt of what felt like betrayal died down, I realized he essentially asked me to lie on his behalf despite him knowing that I'm far too honest AND he refused to believe me when I tried to explain myself leaving me unable to call him out on this fact and fully explain my side of the case

Sometimes I try to contribute and end up confused or embaressed saying something stupid. After a bit of alcohol I seem to manage absoloutely fine.

616,"Background: I’ve worked for about two years at a small company of 35 employees. I answer phone calls, set up reservations, enter payables, cut checks, do light accounting work, etc. There are three other people who I work with behind the desk who do relatively the same tasks as I do. We do not have an office manager anymore, she left about a year ago. Since then we’ve self regulated and gotten along just fine without an office manager. 
We have an “HR” guy who sits in the same office, he’s been here for over 30 years. He doesn’t have any direct executive authority other than handling employee benefits and payroll (so he’s not the mediator or “third party” to go to in an office dispute). 
Then we have our general manager who’s about five years new to the company. He’s generally disliked by the majority of employees and customers here. He is the one with executive power. Able to hire/fire, increase or decrease wages, manage structure of the company, you get it. His car is company owned and his gas is paid for by the company. 
Then we have the owner of the company who bought the place as a “side hobby” to his real estate investments. He is totally hands off in the company. Owner and GM meet ever so rarely, maybe once every four months. The owner is very family oriented and kind from what I’ve seen and heard.
Our accountant manages the finances for all of our owner’s companies, he lives in another state. I’ve never met him, only heard of him.

What’s happening???
After our office manager left the company my team behind the desk has been left to handle her responsibilities. Which means we see more than we did before. Aside from the GM being totally uninterested in what the company does as a whole and repeatedly using his position to manipulate employees/customers, he’s been abusing the company credit cards. 
He’s used the Costco credit card to buy personal groceries totaling about $450. Which we do not use as we have a Sam’s membership. When I confronted him about having the card he’s been super shady about it. He had me expense it under ‘office supplies expense’. 
About two months ago he emailed me separately to go to Sams to buy a mini fridge. I bought it with the company card. He had me put it in the back of his truck. It was $200.
He’s also used his own company card for dry cleaning, oh and a $3000 purchase to which he put under “shop manuals expense”. The purchase was for something to Robert Kiyosaki, but he said he did not have a receipt for it. Hm.
Lately he’s been opting out of using his company card and using the HR’s card which we have stored up at the desk. This card is attached to our amazon prime account. 
He’s ordered here and there on it, had stuff delivered here and we’ve expensed it under office supplies.
But now it’s getting ridiculous. He ordered four orders from our company amazon account on the HR credit card the past three days totaling $1088. This is new lighting and Alexa compatible items (he’s redoing his house right now). 
It’s infuriating just sitting idly by while most of us as employees are underpaid and overtime is frowned upon. Some employees who have been here 30+ years haven’t seen a raise in about 8 years. Last GM was later almost sued for also abusing company cards. He’s since moved out of the state, so nothing came of it.
There are so many more accounts of these transactions, seriously we’d be here all day. Employees here know about this stuff happening or at least a little bit, aside from our HR guy. It makes me angry and sad that this is happening when we have people here who have real lives and deserve more.
Do I report this? If so, how and to who? Should I keep doing what I’ve been doing? 

Oh and ps! Several months ago he had a system installed that tracks everything we do on our computers. Down to the very thing our cursor is hovered over. He’s bizzarre.",05Dec2019,1

619," So last friday we had an inclass assignment that I managed to finish faster then the others. I started talking to my friend in another room about the task and helping him with some little things. So there comes this girl with whom I didn't talk a lot but we had a few conversations related to Uni. My friend leaves and I stay alone with her. I help her with the assignment and as it got dark she asked me if I wanted to eat somewhere. I proposed her a place and we ate there. We had a good chat all along and got to know a little bit about eachother. Next she asks me if I want to continue the night but immediatly says that she is tired and has to wake up early the next day. I accept and she invites me to her place to watch a movie. We entered a shop and she bought ingredients for cappucino. We arrived at her house where she prepared the cappucino while we were talking more.
We watched the movie while holding hands a lot and talking in between the scenes. After the movie talked more but she mentioned again that she was tired. She said that she enjoyed the night a lot and for some reason mentioned that she has never invited anyone like that to her place mentioning that she feels safe with me there. I jokingly asked if I may come over anytime I want. I still didn't mention a lot of sweet dialogs happening that night but it finally ended where I was talking with her and playing with her hair while she was falling asleep. She wasn't answering so I realized she fell asleep. I hugged her and left. I feel like she gave me a lot of signs that she liked me, called me cute and so on. So immediately after I left I realized that I didn't even kiss her and didn't say almost anything that she may have as a hint that I liked her. All I said is that I liked the night. I didn't have her phone number on weekend, so I couldn't even contact her. This week I felt like I had no opportunity to talk to her. She is almost always surrounded by other guys she is talking to. I found her contact on a common whatsup group and I texted her a little but I don't feel a connection in text. When we see each other on breaks she gives me an akward smile but doesn't start a conversation as she is usually with her friends. What do I do now? I got used to her being so initiative that I am afraid to ask her something. I feel like she got sad that I didn't do anything that Friday and thinks I am uninterested but I am just used to take things slow. Help.",05Dec2019,1
620,"I'm 22, and my cousin who is 16 is getting married (legally of her own choice and with her parents consent) to a man in his 40s (he's 45 actually). This is a train wreck. She's pregnant and they dont know if it's his baby or his sons baby (his son is 19) but regardless they dont care and ""are so in love"" (according to their facebook). I think it's sick and weird and I'm shocked that there are no laws against them getting married either (that I know of, I'm in the US) because again, she has her parents consent. 

My cousin really likes me and she said she wants me to be her maid of honor, but I want no part in this weird shit. She also asked if I could help raise ""funds"" for her wedding. She said she needs 15k for the wedding night, 2k for her dress, and then $700 for the cake. I wish I was making this up. I asked her how she would pay for this if she didnt get the money and she said her parents will pay half, and that she would just pay the rest in payday loans... I asked if her husband would help her and she said that he said ""planning and paying for a wedding is womens work"".... umm WUT?? 

I'm in good terms with most my family, but at this point with all their support for my cousin I'm thinking about just changing my name and never talking to these people again. What do I do? 

Vent: 

She's still just a child IMO. She's not mature, doesnt even have a driver's liscense or car. She's dropped out of highschool, she doesn't work, doesnt clean her room, etc. He's just as bad.. he wants to be a rapper, lives in a single wide trailer and works at Wendy's (has been since he was 17). He has 5 kids and 4 previous wives as well... it's just all so icky. I dont understand why everyone is giving her praise and how she gets treated like an ""adult"" now.

628,"On Monday night, my sisters, mom, niece and I were at the mall. Just before the mall was about to close, we stopped to get some dip n dots. While we were at the counter a man approached us who seemed to be drunk, he asked us what he should buy his girlfriend for Christmas, then walked away before we could even respond. It was weird but, after he walked away I turned back around to finish paying, and within about 20 seconds noticed that my iPhone X that was sitting on the counter was now gone. The lady who worked there had her back turned getting the icecream, and we were all looking at the drunk guy, so someone had to have come behind me while he distracted us and taken it. It was immediately shut off and any attempts to call it or use the ""Find my iphone"" were useless. I filed a police report and used the ""mark as lost"" as well as the ""erase my phone"" feature on the find my iphone app, I did have a passcode on my phone as well, so I just chalked it up to a loss.

However, yesterday I got my replacement phone. Today I logged into find my iphone on the new phone, and I see that the erase on my old phone is only ""pending"" and I am suddenly sharing my location with a number that I do not know, and no one in my family knows either. I wasn't sharing my location with this phone number the night I lost my phone, and I definitely didn't set it up to share with it since I got my new phone yesterday. I immediately stopped the location sharing with this number but I am feeling uneasy.

So, my question is, why would the erase only be pending and how to I get it to complete? Is there any way the thieves could have gotten into my phone even after I disabled it with the find my iphone app? I'm concerned at this point that maybe we were targeted for more than just an easy phone to steal, we were in a group of 6 women and one baby girl, I'm also 9 months pregnant. I read so many horror stories about new ways people are being trafficked and I'm just kind of freaked out. I am sure I am over reacting but at the same time the sharing of my location with a strange number just within the last few days since my phone was stolen does send up some red flags. 

What do you all think? Is there anyway they could have accessed my information? What can I do from here to try to ensure my information is off of the phone?",05Dec2019,1

I work at as an IT Technician in a city that is close to my home. I was very excited for it about 2 months ago when I started. New job, new people, new opportunities. But when I got further and further into it, I started hating it. Boss isn’t the best, and gets mad and yells at every little thing, coworker is sometimes nice but if you ask dumb questions for clarification or just don’t genuinely know what you’re doing sometimes, he gets pissy and mad too.

Mainly I dealt with customers computers and it was usually simple things. After about a month at my IT position, I’ve become tired of it and ready to go do something else. But we(girlfriend and I) just got evicted from our apartment and are living with her parents saving money for a house. So I don’t want to leave because it’s good pay and good hours.

I didn't call the police because it's become a weekly occurrence to hear gunshots and calling the cops everytime seems unreasonable. The 2 shots I heard a few weeks ago was a young man being shot in my alley a few houses down, with my bedroom being very close to the alley, he wasn't found for 4 hours and has now unfortunately passed from his injuries. I looked at a few articles on FB about it and read his family searching for help and expressing their grief. He has a toddler daughter and a loving family. How do I cope with this guilt of not having done anything as a man lay dying? Obviously had I known it was someone being shot I would have done something, but I guess I'm desensitized to hearing shots at this point and assumed it was nothing.

634,Hey guys so I came here since for the i don't know which time I screwed up in a competition (logic/science oriented). Whenever I practice past problems from these same competitions I usually have no issue and sometimes I even solve all of them correctly. I even time myself with the time that's used for the official competitions. But every time I need to perform with my 100% I just screw up and score way less than I could have. I know this because whenever I go and try to solve the problem back home I can almost always solve it pretty quickly even if it seemed impossible before. It probably has something to do with being nervous because these competitions are very important to me as winning them could mean a scholarship and also I would personally be very happy. And I have thought about this a lot. I tried calming myself down and focusing more but I always somehow lose all my abilities when push comes to shove.  Also while I have mentioned that I time myself I always still somehow always lose time in these competitions and quite commonly don't even solve some of the problems because I run out of time. All of this honestly makes me pretty depressed and most of all dissapointed in myself because I objectively think that if I approached these things the right way I could solve them without issue as I do at home but somehow I always end up dissapointing myself... So basically I want some advice on how to improve my situation. Id love to hear any advice especially if someone had an issue similar to mine and later fixed it. Also forgive my spelling,05Dec2019,1

643,"Hey all,

I have always had low self-confidence since I was a kid.  I had bad social anxiety (still do but I learned how to manage it a little bit) and always think that people are better than me.  I always am overthinking/over-analyzing things and it makes trying new things very difficult.  What is weird though is that it goes away when I am joking around or trying to make people laugh, which I have been told I am very good at.  People around me think I am really funny and tell me all the time that I need to try to do stand up or at least start a podcast.

Since I was a kid I loved comedy and stand up and I want to try to do stand up and podcasting very badly.  There are a few things that are preventing this from happening though.

1.  Any time I think of starting out in these things, thoughts of failure and embarrassment take over.  Not the embarrassment of bombing in front of a crowd, but the embarrassment of people I know thinking that I am a joke or a loser if I fail.
2. Negative self-talk tells me that I will never make it anywhere if I try those things and I shouldn't even bother trying.

This has been weighing on me a lot because I know if I don't at least give it a shot, I will regret it for the rest of my life because these things are a passion of mine.  

I truly don't know how to stop caring so much about what people think/will think of me.  People say ""just don't give a f\*\*\*"" but I honestly don't understand how that can be done.  Its almost like no matter what, I subconsciously think the way that I do.

I'm 26, living with my parents (UK) and suffer from severe depression.

I went to see a psychologist this week, who told me I need to take more time and do more things for myself.

As I've said, I live with my parents, who I support financially with around 70% of my paycheck. One of them works full time, and the other is too ill to work and has been for some time. The reality of it is, they'll likely never work again. 

The Psychologist advised that my situation at home was making my depression a lot worse, and they suggested that I move out. I REALLY want to move out, but where I live renting is so expensive I wouldn't be able to live elsewhere and support my parents financially.  They would really struggle without my support

I do have 5 siblings, but 2 of them have children to take care of, and another is in Prison. The one sibling that could help my parents financially only visits when he needs a favour, or if he's showing off (new car/phone etc). I can't even broach the subject with him, he'd likely come up with some excuse, or make me feel bad for suggesting it. I really don't get on with him anyway, the only words he had to say to me about a suicide attempt I'd made some years earlier is that I was a ""selfish c\*\*t"". Needless to say that made me feel a million times better (but that's another story).  

My partner wants us to get a place together, and has said that I can't support them forever, and we can't take the next steps in our relationship if we don't live together.  The psychologist said something similar, and told me to bear in mind that my parents will likely stop working in the next few years (they're of that age), and would then rely on me even more. 

  
I don't even know where to start with this. Can I do this? Wouldn't it be a dick move by me to leave them in that position? How do I bring this up with my parents? Am I the asshole for wanting to move out, regardless of where it would leave them?

651,"My fiance and I split my stepsons time every other week with her ex. About 3 months ago my stepson has been coming home with dr confirmed flea bites all over his body. They go away a few days after being with us so we know it's coming from ex's place. When we 1st saw the bites we banned my stepson from going over to his fathers place. His father wasnt happy about it because he said him and his wife and stepdaughter dont have any bites on them but I have a respectful relationship with my fiance's ex and I got him to agree to not having his son over until the fleas were gone. 

About a month after that I went over to check for fleas to confirm that the ex actually got rid of them bc my fiance rightfully does not trust him at all (they have very bad history with him being a liar). I found fleas on the 1st pet I inspected over there so another months ban.

After I checked a 2nd time I found no fleas on the dogs so I gave the ok for my stepson to go over. He came back with more flea bites than ever a couple days ago and we took him in to see the dr and he confirmed that it was flea bites. 

Idk legally what we can do about this without kicking up a metaphorical hornet's nest. We have child support coming from ex bc we pay all my stepsons bills but idt that they have established legal custody besides that. I would like to keep things civil but idk if that's possible anymore. Ex and his wife are very poor so I dont want to fuck them by demanding professional pest removal services with a receipt (I do not trust him to be truthful. He's lied to us before about inconsequential stuff before).

Thing is whenever I say something in the group chat it tends to be ignored or given sarcastic mean replies.

 I also never see them, like ever. I won't see them either unless I make plans with them. They often talk in the Discord chat and don't invite me to any games or chats.

**NUTSHELL Version down below**

I really don't know where to start.

You should know that my father died of cancer when I was 2 years old. This, as you can imagine, had great consequences for my future life especially in terms of fears of loss and my relationship to men. 

Today I am happily married to a very dear man and we have a wonderful little daughter and life is really good.

But there is a story in my past that casts a dark shadow over all my happiness and pulls me down again and again.

I was 24, had broken out of a bad relationship of 8 years a year before and finally started to enjoy my life again. Just before I met my husband, there was a guy, let's call him David, with whom I got along really well. He was 12 years older and Dj in my favorite club. When I saw him for the first time I immediately thought: Wow, he looks totally like my father. 

We got to know each other better through a mutual friend and soon we met alone and got closer. He was quite a freethinker and I was also glad that we didn't want to make a serious thing out of it although everything was right between us. The whole thing went on for some months and we had a really nice time and without noticing it I had fallen in love hard. I never told him. There were moments when he said I was perfect and that he was sorry he couldn't be my partner. He also said he didn't want to make my wounds worse. He knew that my father had died of cancer, his father had also died of cancer. We went on and it didn't bother me that we weren't officially together. 

But then a few weeks later everything stopped. He answered my messages only rarely and he avoided me. One evening in the club he almost yelled at me to stay away and continue my life. 

I did that with broken hearts, but I lived on and tried to forget everything. 

I got together with my husband, he knew about David and was always a little worried he could come between us. That's why I never told him the whole truth about this story and it bothers me that I can't be honest.

About a year later I was on vacation with my mother, it was a long bus trip and we had a good time. Suddenly she became very serious and said she had to tell me something. 

(Marginal note: When I was about 12 years old my mother told me that my father had a girlfriend before her who was pregnant after their separation and he was possibly the father. His ex, however, said that another one was the father of the boy and all went their separate ways.)

She reminded me that there might be this half brother and that she happened to know from a friend that his name is David and that he is Dj in my favourite club. She said she saw a photo of him and almost fell off the chair because he looked so much like my father. 

That was the first bang that totally confused my emotional life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw David from time to time and we were still friends. I tried to tell him once but he didn't listen to me so I gave it up.

Another year passed and I often thought about all this. 

I got pregnant and stopped going to the club. Once I was there and wanted to tell David that I was going to be a mother, but for some reason I didn't dare. I watched him through the room and thought, ""He looks really sick.""

 I got my daughter in February 2018 and was happy with my new little family. 

A month later my mother told me that David had died of cancer. Three days after his birthday.

I went to his funeral. I cried a lot. I think about him far too often. My heart gets heavy every time and I can hardly bear the emotional chaos. 

It's almost 2 years and it doesn't stop occupying me. I often dream of David.

I feel guilty towards my husband. I want to look ahead and leave this thing behind me.

I've never told anyone the whole story or how much it haunts me.

I have a therapist but I am not yet ready to discuss this with him. I thought maybe it would help me to open myself if I first look for resonance here. Writing down the story once helped me a little.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? 

Have you experienced something similar? Is there something in your life that you just can't process?

What helped you to let the past rest?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to everyone who has read the whole story. Thanks to everyone who takes part here.

&amp;#x200B;

**IN A NUTSHELL:**

\-My father died of cancer when I was 2 years old, he had a exgirlfriend who was pregnant but said the boy was not his, after that he met my mother

\-I'm 24 and meet a guy named David and we have an affair, I fall in love. He is 12 years older and reminds me of my father (im weird, yes)

\-David ends our affair and I get to know my future husband and my daughter's father

\-My mother tells me on vacation that David may be this half-brother

\-David dies of cancer

656,"So I didn’t get drumset for indoor percussion. Out tryouts lasted for like 3 weeks or 2 and we just switched instruments back and fourth. I kept going on drumset cuz I was good on it and I liked it. And so did this other kid. He’s my band teachers favorite kid she loves him so much so I kinda knew he’d get chosen. But he wasn’t there last practice his schedule is a lot so which means he has to leave mid practice and he then doesn’t learn the things we went over. And which leaders him having to catch up up. He tried out for set too and so did this other kid. I went on it the most!!! Showing them that I really want this part. And I practiced everyday for 2 hours. We got our parts but he wasn’t there that day. Everyone had a instrument except the drumset and he was the only one not there so you can guess that he got it. I didn’t get a drumset part. 
I think the teacher was hinting that I didn’t get it cuz he came over to me saying that he appreciates me doing all of this. I kinda guessed that he’s saying thank you but I didn’t get the part. He said “you really did practice didn’t you?” And I said yeah. He should take that into consideration but it’s too late now. He lost a good drummer. He should’ve let me do it cuz he already plays drumset in a band so he should give me a chance. But he did tell me that him and I can switch for warmups to build up my skill. That’s mad wack. It’s not worth it. IMO. So I want to quit. How can I bring this up with them?",05Dec2019,1

660,"a little back story, I am a 15-year-old and homeschooled, I started homeschooling after the tragedy of the Parkland shooting. I live in a small apartment and stay home most of the time because both of my parents work overtime and the only time we are all together is during weekends. However, I don't know what's wrong with me on a personal level. First, I don't sleep. There have been several days where I just stay up looking at the ceiling for hours on end. In perspective, I go to bed at 10 p.m but go to sleep at 5 a.m. Sometimes, I don't go to sleep at all. I don't look at my phone either, I try to not use my phone at night since it worsens my sleep. I go outside sometimes to find work for when I turn 16, but, I think I am lacking a form of empathy. I look at kids screaming on the line to get food and I can only imagine myself hitting the little bastard until he bleeds. And I just think about what I just told myself and begin to get worried. My spelling and grammar seem to get worse with time, so much so that my teachers have given me lower grades because of those types of issues. I can't type or write well unlike I used to, it's gotten to the point I'd have to buy Grammarly premium just to fix simple sentences. I find myself being less hungry every day, I weighed myself today and saw 102 pounds. I was always skinny, but just 6 months ago I was 115-ish. I try to do exercise to keep myself in shape but lately, I haven't because I am just not motivated enough. I feel weird, just half a year ago, I was an all A student, but now my highest grade is a B.

662,"There are quite a few factors pushing me in this direction.  


First, I've really come to hate driving, at least in heavy-traffic areas. I commute into a big city for work (downtown), so I have to deal with it all the time. It makes me so anxious and tense. Driving isn't bad in my town (a suburb of the big city), but the city is hell on earth for me.   


That and I'm sick of the costs of driving. Insurance, gas, maintenance. I'm sick of it eating my paycheck. I find myself asking, how much is driving worth to me? Right now I don't make a lot. I will be moving to a higher paying position at my company in March, at which time paying for these costs won't be as bad. My idea was to just public transit to work until I get that raise. I'm in a fair amount of debt right now and my stupid f\*\*\*ing car is just choking me.   


My employer offers free bus passes. I've utilized them before, and while the route to my job is long, I didn't find it that bad. It was nice to sit, zone out, listen to music, read, take some ""me"" time, rather than gripping my steering wheel so hard it may break because I just got cut off by a speeding maniac, surrounded by cars, and I need to find a way over in spite of the lane next to me being choked with traffic.  


The downside is, I won't be able to just up and go wherever I want whenever I want. But right now, I just don't know how much that's worth to me.",05Dec2019,1
663,"I will be spending this Christmas with my boyfriend this year for the first time. This will also be the first time I will have met his family, even though I've been with my BF for almost a year and a half. This is because they live several hours away and I'm usually busy with school while my BF is usually busy with work. I feel really bad for not meeting his family yet so I want to make a good impression.

In general I am really bad at getting gifts, especially for people I don't know. And there will be a decent number of people there besides my BF and I: his two parents, hist 3 siblings, and their significant others. I've never met any of these people so I have no clue what they would want for Christmas. 

My BF can make a list of people and what they like for me to help with shopping, but I'm kind of in the dark as to how ""intense"" I should get with the gifts. For example, do I get a small gift for everybody? Do I only get bigger/more expensive gifts for his parents? Do I get a few things everyone could share, like I could bake some pies or pumpkin bread? And if my BF gives me something general that someone likes, for example The Beatles, what the heck do I do with that information? What if the person already haves what I get them?

668,"Not sure if this is entirely the right place for this, but I’ve been feeling isolated about the topic for a while and getting input from others might help me further settle the feelings I have about this.

I’ll try to be short and sweet here;

I reached out to my friend (someone I saw as a friend) and admittedly probably unloaded more than I should have without warning. However, their response to me was very harsh and accusatory. I reached out because I had been asking to hang out with them (I will name them R) and was told that they were busy or we had issues aligning our schedules, which is totally understandable! I know that people are just busy sometimes. Then, I saw a picture on social media of R hanging out with my manipulative/toxic ex. The fact that they were hanging out did not bother me, I have no intention of policing who people are friends with. But it did strike up some old anxieties, since this ex of mine had been spreading a lot of hurtful lies/rumors about me. 

I messaged R about this, and used some strong language to describe my anxieties and my ex which upset R. I apologized immediately, and wrote back trying to better explain myself. The message R sent back to me said things like “you are being hostile” and “I know how you really feel” Which deeply upset me. Not only is it hard for me to be open about feelings due to social anxiety, but it just didn’t feel like the type of thing someone who knows me would say. I don’t try to “start shit” and my only intentions here were to make sure our friendship was alright and clear up some anxieties, and I explained how I didn’t intend to upset R. 

I sent a message trying to figure a way we could talk about it more. R didn’t respond to me for months. I didn’t reach out again, out of fear that I would be misunderstood once more, and was also struggling with how I felt about what R had said. It was that R thought I was calling them a bad friend that had upset them from what I was told, and yet here they were completely ignoring me for just trying to open up; which IMO, is not a very good friend thing to do. It led me to vent a bit online (without mentioning any names) because I do not have many friends and felt like I was being isolated/had no one to talk to. I regret doing this as it probably only made things worse, but anxiety gets messy sometimes and I’ve learned from it. 

Eventually I messaged R again and we met in person. It felt good to clear the air, but some of the language they used towards me was once again hurtful. They claimed I was self victimizing (because of the social media venting) when really I was just having an emotional reaction. They said they thought I was trying to manipulate their feelings, and paint my ex (the ex who had spent a year bad mouthing me) in a bad light. And the convo was littered with phrases from them like “If I can’t give you what you need a friendship that’s okay” Or “If we were to continue this friendship..” Which was jarring to hear, because I personally was there to mend things and I don’t believe having a miscommunication is valid reason to end a friendship. But I know everyone’s different *shrug* 

It just hurt to feel like my worst fears were coming true; I reached out, messed it up, and lost a friend. After the in person conversation, R unfollowed me on social media and I haven’t heard from them since. I don’t intend to reach out again, because truthfully, I have to move on for my own mental health and I have other shit to take care of in my life. 

The grief of losing this friend and feeling like it was my fault has been haunting me for a while. I wish I could truly move on from it, and have definitely gotten better and not let it get to me as much. I am aware I didn’t handle things perfectly, but have also done all I can to explain my true feelings and intentions which I feel have been ignored. 

Some input on how to move past this/if there was anything else I could have or should have done to resolve this, or just opinions would be greatly appreciated. I know I said this would be short but, oops.

669,"This happened to me like an hour ago so this is bugging me and is making me feel really uneasy. So like 80% in the world, I have Instagram. I checked it tonight and noticed I had more than usual messages. Some of these messages were calling me ""crazy"" and a ""stalker"". So I messaged one of them back and ask why they were sending me these messages. They said their friend (let's call her ""Karen"") did an Instastory about me calling me her stalker.

So background: she's friends with a guy (let's call him Dave) I hook up with every once and awhile. I know before we hooked up they hooked up. Now, I do look at her Instagram every once and a while a couple of months before. I would check out her stories and whatnot. But I do that with everyone that I follow and don't. I mean if you're not private I'm going to look. I've never contacted her, messaged her, or even posted anything about her. I just lurked like I do with everyone cuz I get bored. I messaged her and asked her politely to please take the story down because I'm getting unwanted messages. She tells me that I'm crazy and I'm stalking her.

672,"WARNING: LONG POST tldr at the bottom

(There are parts of this posts that might need context but I left out so my post isn't 20 pages long, I'll label them LC for left out context. I can make an extra post if needed but a lot of them has to do with my background and highschool)

I'm an 18 year old community college student, I live with my parents and commute. 

I've been really conflicted about going to college without an intended major since I was on high school but my family would let me take a gap year. There were personal and financial issues with me going to the university I wanted so I decided that to community college might help me find a major and get my generals out of the way.

Long story short it's not working. Community college in America is less expensive than university but it's still expensive. I didn't get much financial aid from the government because I applied late and other factors.(LC)
 I've visited the counciling office more than 15 times, they're not helpful and I'm getting nowhere.  I wanted to take a gap year just so I could have time to figure out things but my family won't let me. I can't do any after school activities or helpful seminars because I don't have my license yet and can't test for it until March 2020, parents won't let me take the bus and they don't have the time to drive me everywhere 24/7. (LC)

It's only been a semester so I feel like I'm being impatient but I don't want to be thousand of dollars in debt and not have a way to pay for it. So I'm planning to either move to a Canadian college or this well known party school college at some point. Their both cheaper options for the state that I live in (Even cheaper with financial aid possibly). But there are always a problem with my decisions.

1. My parents don't want me to go to the party college. They have a deep hatred for that school but I'm not a party type of person and they know that so I'm not sure why they're preventing me from saving thousands of dollars.
2. I still don't know what I want to do so going to university right away is pointless.
3. This has something to do with #2 also, I don't know what to do or expect from the Canadian college because never been there before. They were holding a seminar a couple months ago but my passport expired and my mom wouldn't help me get a new one before the seminar. I know where to apply but I don't know what to do. On their website they have different majors you have to apply for separately and idk what to do.

Another reason I wanted to go there was because I want to get away from my family. They put so much pressure on my but aren't really there when I need help. Right now we're having major issues that I can't deal with right now and I feel like they're holding me back. They tend to want control but it always ends up hurting me the most in the end (I don't hate them but it's frustrating when I need to do thing or go places in order to figure out things for myself out and being told no for no reason and not being able to compromise)(LC)

In the end I'm more confused than when I started college and I don't know what to do. I feel lost. I feel like I was just thrown into the adult world without a clear path and now I'm stuck. If there are any Canadians out there that know the college system that would help too.

Tl:Dr
I'm an 18 yo college student who wants to transfer but I don't know what I want to major in. Councilors aren't helping and it's hard to get help because I don't have a way of transportation at certain times of the day. Due to personal and financial issues I plan on transfering to uni and I have two reasonable options but my parents don't like one of my options because it's a party school and I don't know how to apply to Canadian colleges.

673,"So, every time I order through Amazon it comes through UPS Surepost. In the past year and a half every single order has been delayed, sometimes a week later than it says. 

The main issue is that I was paying for Prime so I should have gotten my packages in 2 days, not in 7-9... which is irritating because if it was just going to do that why pay extra for quicker?

I know when they send updates it always says, “package arrived at incorrect carrier facility.” So I figured after awhile they’d notice or something. They haven’t. Is there a way I can contact them about this issue? I love using Amazon but if I can’t get what I ordered when it says then I might as well not use it.

674,"So here’s the problem. My wife came to me and asked if we can start fostering cats. I thought she meant fostering adult cats but she wants to foster kittens, specifically orphaned young kittens. I asked her why not something a little older that doesn’t need constant care and supervision? We really don’t have the time to foster. She works 10 hours 4 days a week and it’s about to go up because of the holiday season. I’m a truck driver, I’m home daily but the nature of my work it’s not uncommon to work 12-14 hour days. 

When I told her this, she was aware that we didn’t have the time. So I was surprised when she asked if she could reduce her hours to just 20 hours (just work the weekend) or just quit all together so she could dedicate her time to taking care of kittens. We can’t afford that. I make good money and we lucked out on our apartment considering how much the average rent is around here but we’d be stretched thin on just my income alone. On top of that, our apartment is not that big. We live in a 2 bedroom but the lay out is weird. We had to use the master bedroom as the living room, the living room as the dining room, and the 2nd bedroom as our bedroom (the “master” is bigger than the “living room”). We don’t have the room to foster.

The cat she rescued before we met was a momma cat but all of her kittens died, and my wife was told she likes the company of kittens. My wife figured our cat could be a good “surrogate” of sorts. Though I think the real reason she wants to foster kittens is because of an incident that involved a litter of kittens she saved when she was a teen and her very abusive mother. This post is already getting long but if details are needed I can provide it. But the incident really fucked with my wife’s head and emotional state and she carries a lot of guilt and shame from it. She understood why I said no to her quitting all together but she still wants to reduce her hours. When I told her no to that she looked heartbroken. So I need advice.

675,"As stated in the title, my husband has depression. He’s able to go to work everyday and function relatively normally. However, he sometimes gets into depressive episodes where he thinks everything is terrible. I’m not sure what to do about these episodes or how to handle them. A lot of the things he gets upset about are kind of his own fault. None of these things are super important things either but whenever something small goes wrong he turns into a huge deal. 

He refuses to get on any meds, says he was on them when he was younger and hated them. Also as some background, his dad killed him self when he was little due to getting off his meds and having an episode. His dad was already not in his life though for a few years before this. He claims it didn’t effect him, which I think is just not true.

I think he’d be willing to do therapy if it was easy but it’s a big hassle to find someone to go to and then make time to actually go so he just doesn’t want to make the effort. 

I just don’t know how to respond to him when he gets into these moods. It seems like when he’s in them he thinks nothing makes him happy even though when he’s not in them I do think he enjoys the fun things we do but who knows. Any advice from someone with depression on how they would like their wife to act in these situations?",05Dec2019,1
676,"I’ve never witnessed a crime or submitted a crime tip, however I saw something today that makes me a little sick/disturbed my thinking about now. But I’m not sure if what happened is really a “crime” worth submitting as a tip. I don’t even know who to call.

Anyway, i work in sales for a Solar company. They set appointments for me, and I meet the homeowner in their home. 

This guy I met today, let’s call him John. John and his girlfriend with a different last name are nice, but just kinda creepy and weird. He told me his plan for this home is to turn it into a foster home, and move somewhere else while maintaining this foster home. I said that’s amazing and congratulated him, being as sales as I could.

I heard at least 3 or 4 kids talking, they seemed happy. I only saw 2 - a young girl and a young boy, at separate times. They’re both in the 8-10 yrs old range. The girl had freckles and light brown hair, looked nothing like either John or his girlfriend. The boy didn’t either. It was pretty obvious that they were both foster children John and his girlfriend were fostering.

Johns girlfriend was just leaving to go somewhere with the daughter. While the girlfriend was in the bathroom, the daughter comes to John and says bye while we’re still talking about solar. 

This is the weird part - she asks for a kiss and he starts being strange, seemed uncomfortable?. He is like “alright alright “ and kissed her on the lips. And then kept kissing her. They kissed on the lips, no exaggeration, about 10-15 times in a row, with the last few being longer and more uncomfortable. I had my iPad out, and I just was scrolling around the homepage pretending I didn’t notice what was happening, or that I thought it was strange.

Then the girl says “what about the secret kiss? Can I have a secret kiss?”

John seemed uncomfortable and just giggled, looked at me and laughed it off. He was like “hahaha, secrets?” And just kissed her on the lips again. He looked at me and I looked STRAIGHT down into my iPad and pretended to be urgently looking for something. She said again “secret kiss!” But whispered it, but I heard anyway. After he’s sure I’m not looking he have one more long uncomfortable 3-4 second long kiss and I don’t know if he used tongue but it wouldn’t surprise me. I didn’t actually see, but I heard. 

He then gave her a hug and said goodbye. She left, and he just looked at me and smiled, let out a tiny laugh. I couldn’t think to say anything, but I was like “I found it! Here’s the page I was looking for” and showed him some numbers from the proposal on my iPad to change the subject. He was pretty uncomfortable after this, and seemed like he couldn’t wait for me to leave.

Is this something worth reporting?  I don’t know if it’s a crime, just really really creepy, on top of the fact that he has other foster children, and always to turn his home into a foster home to house even more. Where do I even go about reporting it and keeping my identity hidden? I don’t want to affect my job or company.

TLDR: one of my clients uncomfortably kissed his 8 year old foster daughter on the lips MANY times in a row, for multiple seconds at a time. She referenced “the secret kiss”, and whispered “secret kiss” quietly another time. And the guy wants to convert his home into a foster home and bring in LOTS of more kids.",05Dec2019,1
677,"For starters, I took this course where 40% of the final grade is based on 4 assignments (10% each) that have to be submitted through an online portal. The assignment is to be started in class and we have a grace period of 2 weeks to submit the assignment after starting it. Usually, I finish the assignment in class and submit it through the portal before I leave for lunch with my friends. Well, I received a grade for the 4 assignments today, only to find that I had an assignment missing from my grade. I emailed the professor after finding out which assignment was missing from the system, with proof that I had completed the assignment on the day itself (using Google Drive revision history) and that I had accessed the submission website after completing the assignment (using web browsing history). However, he insists that he cannot change the grade without proof of an error in the system. How am I supposed to come up with a system error message I never received? I am adamant that this was not due to an error on my part. I have tried to reason with him, but it seems like a dead end. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

678,"So I'm a sophomore in HS currently, and I was looking back at my middle school yearbook. I then saw and remembered that one of my female friends (I wasn't dating her or anything, we were just friends) wrote ""Call me baby! xoxo -Maya"" with her phone number. (I didn't own a phone until the last few months of middle school.) After middle school she went to a different public school in our area and I naturally forgot about her until recently. I start missing her, and I know her phone number, but here are some things I am concerned with.

1. Since she doesn't know my phone number yet, what if she classifies my number as spam? Then she would end up blocking me without even knowing that was me.
2. I'm just worried. You know that nervous feeling you get when you text/call your old friend for the first time in years? (We've been 1 and a half years apart)

679,"I started a job as a diesel mechanic trainee recently. I have prior knowledge of working on vehicles and I've learned and worked on the semis at the shop some. Ive been asking if I can do more to work on the trucks because I wanna learn quick and be able to make more money and do more work. I love working on stuff. Yesterday I had 4 tasks clean a part to be returned. Did a great job, clean an extremely important part to the point you could eat off of it if it wasn't cleaned with gasoline. Did it correctly. Fix a fuel line. The mechanic showed me how to take it off and the reverse of how it worked and left because he was sick and I had to figure it out. I did it perfectly according to the other mechanic. And my 4th task. Replace something I didn't know how to replace with no supervision and no one to talk me through it. I got it bolted in correctly, correctly attached an air line to it and then I learned the fitting that I was supposed to attach the airline to needed to be tightened, when I pulled the airline out it broke the fitting. I told my boss and he yelled at me, punched the semi, and told me he was going to dock my pay and I don't get to work on anything again for months, so I basically don't get to learn anything because semis don't have a lot of lines of sight when someone is working on something. I feel like a useless screw up and I feel like I should give up mechanics, so the advice I'm looking for is, should I go to a different shop that will give me a chance or give up on mechanics. I can't look my boss in the face again after how he yelled at me. It brought back a lot of shit from my abusive dad and I'm just going to be scared of him.",05Dec2019,1

My main issue is I totally take things to heart that upset me and I can’t regulate my reactions to it. Issues I’ve gone through like racism, school bullying/exclusion, trauma etc. And although I no longer really “go through it” ANYTIME I see the issue brought up or reminded of it I get distressed, depressed and suicidal.

I guess I used to cope because I used to be highly confident in my abilities and I genuinely believed that by the time I died, I would have done something influential regarding social justice changes in the world. Once I graduated school, I had my dreams crushed. So I kinda lost my only coping method.

So now I’m stuck in a paradox where I: get reminded of a cruel reality I can’t change &gt; reminds me of my past, or things happening in the present &gt; I now know I can’t do anything to remedy or fix it and I’m stuck in a world full of shit essentially &gt; get into emotional distress &gt; see no solution or effective coping mechanism &gt; get suicidal &gt; eventually calm down (usually by sleeping/oversleeping) &gt; REPEAT

690,"I (14M) am considering removing a friend  (13m) from my life (Lets call him Adam). It's been years that we've known each other, and he's always been like this, but we're about to be in highschool and he hasn't grown up yet, while I feel I have to some extent. 

He's always been vulgar, ever since about 3rd grade, and while I don't watch my mouth too well, he's terrible about it. He takes small things too seriously and can't ever be wrong. 

This year has been the worst, so I'll talk about the events since August. In Gym class, he would always steal basketballs from guys playing games (the coach often gives us 4-5 balls then works on his paperwork). I was often playing and he would steal our balls, and Igor so tired of it I joined him so I could have fun without being interupted. I felt kinda guilty though, and when some other friends asked me to stop, I did. Adam never did. He continued to steal balls with like 2 or 3 others who basically just follow him around. This continued for a long time, until it bored him. 

Before he stopped, however, I had a medical complication (I have this rare genetic disorder called myontonia) and because of this, I sat out Gym for about 6 weeks (this actually wore me down, as people who have what I have need to exercise a lot, but I hadn't been diagnosed yet, so they didn't know). As my fatigue set in, I would talk less, always be tired, and really just not want to deal with anything, yet he continued to annoy me despite my state, and he got mad when I told him to go away. After I was released, I began to get active again and regained my energy, but he still was just as a problem.

As soccer started up, I began to get back in shape and I was starting to enjoy myself again. The first game, however, I slip on a mudslick, and kept my feet at the price of an extremely painful muscle pull in my lower back. This pull places stress over my sciatic nerve, which if anyone has ever had a pressured nerve, you know it puts you out until the pain is gone. This was two weeks ago, and for some reason I'm still in pain (I'm going to the doctor today because it was the only available spot). Yesterday in gym, he was being extremely stupid, and was walking around with his friend in a head lock for some reason, but they weren't fighting. I didn't pay much attention to it until he runs into me from behind and hits my back. I almost threw him to the ground, but all I was able to do was grab him before I felt the entirety of it. Now, if that was the first time, I would have let it slide, but he's run into me recklessly twice already that I've been hurt and I've told him to be careful. I tell him this is the third time, and that he needs to be more careful. He responds by saying that it's the first time and he doesn't care, while I'm standing there about to pass out from pain. Sitting would be worse so I have to stand. I later found out he thew the middle finger at me behind my back. I checked out later because of the pain and am now at home because I'm struggling. 

While also being a dick, he's incredibly stupid (his grades aren't bad, it's just him). He sniffs hand sanitizer and gets high, is extremely rude to teachers, and doesn't care if he pisses people off all because he thinks he's funny. At lunch one time, I went go sit down, and picked the seat that was closest to some of my good friends in our group. As I'm sitting down he flies in and takes the seat, almost spilling food on me. He also elbowed me in the side. I may be a strong guy, but he was going as fast as he could with that food and he pretty much slammed into me. After I tell him to stop being so stupid and petty, he tells me I'm in the wrong because I took his regular seat. The thing is, most of us sit in a different chair every day, and I hadn't realized it was his, not to mention he hadn't put his stuff there. 

My other friend also is considering cutting him out. What should I do, Reddit? Also please exuse grammar, this was typed on my phone.",05Dec2019,1

697,"Imagine you're taking a shower.  Door's unlocked, and your toddler strolls in to ask you a question.  But he's stopped short when he notices a dark figure blocking the light coming from the little bathroom window.  

""Who's that?""  My son says.

""Who's who?!""  I look up and see a man's face briefly.  He's doing whatever around the window.  

Now I've noticed that the apartment has been undergoing changes.  First, they upgraded all the windows including the sliding glass door to our balcony.  Cool.  They gave us a notice on my door the day prior.   All the buildings in my complex have been repainted too.  So I have been expecting some sort of notice.  But no.  

I rush out of the shower and go out to get my son something to drink from the kitchen and there's another man on my balcony, pressure washing it to prep for painting.  

I'm not unreasonable - I know they have a job to do, and it's not the workers' responsibility to give me a heads up. 

I get my son ready for our morning ritual: Gym.  On the way down the stairs I notice the walls are a different color.   Usually he taps the wall for balance every other step, so I warn him ""Hold onto the rail.""

THEY PAINTED THE RAIL BLACK.  My son had black paint - stubborn to get off too - on his hands.  I'm steaming at this point while I clean off his hand. 

Last straw is this morning.  Hubby worked late so we had a late evening - we make sure to spend ample time together.  He awoke to the sound of a stranger on our balcony.  Not the kind of morning either of us want.  Dude's out there right now.   My problem isn't with him... it's with the property manager. 

I'm close to waltzing down there to demand from her some notice as I think I'm legally entitled to.  But I'm not so sure.  Am I?  Do I have any foundation to stand on here?   I'm not looking to get in a legal battle.. I just don't want to demand notice if that's not something I can demand. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** Is there a law that states I need to be notified if any workers are around my apartment?   They've caught me in the shower, they've been on the balcony two days in a row now, and they painted the railing without notice.  I don't want any more surprises and I'm getting pissed.",05Dec2019,1
698,"I(20f) am an incredibly happy relationahip of 2 years now. I couldn't wish for a better one, honestly. 
My first relationship lasted for a year and it was very messy due to me not being ready for one at all and an undiagnosed anxiety disorder. I put great stress on my ex, but he put up with me for a year before calling it quits. i had very distressing and negative feelings towards him after rekindling a couple of times and him pretty much winning me back those couple of times before back paddling eventually. it has left me incredibly heart broken and dependent each time. 
Our last contact was per email before I had even met my new partner. he told me he's sad about how we couldn't make it work and can no longer be friends. I agreed and we left on good terms in general. 
this was 2 years ago and now looking back, I know that he is the person that has shaped me the most in life next to my mother. he is the reason I am in a stable relationship now and i am very thankful for that. I don't carry any harsh feelings towards him, more the opposite. I have had an episode in which I thought about how I would feel if he passed away and I had not told him any of this. it made me feel distressed and regretful.
I have previously talked to my partner about wanting to write him a message and just ask him how he has been etc. which my partner wasn't against, he just made it clear he didn't understand why I still care about an ex. I believe that is due to his previous relationships not being as serious as mine (which I am very sure of) and it would be very hard for me to explain to him why without making him feel as if my ex or more so our relationship could actually still compete with ours. 
I also feel like bringing this topic up again would make my partner believe i still have romantic feelings or a longing for my ex, which isn't the case at all, I just feel like this part of my life was never resolved as I have been running away from it. 
My psychiatrist has told me that I should protect myself from contact to my ex as i naturally do still have love for him and should not take our past lightly.

It was only for a single question where there was a lot of simple multiplication, the rest of the exam I never looked at it again. I noticed a couple times that the prof was giving me a weird look, and when I turned in the exam and scantron in their piles, I noticed him move my exam from the top to the bottom of the pile as i walked away.

**Here's some backstory:** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Chinese linguist (MA), graduated from a university in China, currently unemployed (besides doing freelance hustles) in the 3rd world country that we live in.

My wife is in export, she's doing okay, supporting us for the last year since I stopped working.

&amp;#x200B;

Our worries are getting by in the US and finding good jobs, a little more about me is that I worked various jobs since I'm a teenager, I've worked as a Chinese-English translator, ESL Teacher, Personal Trainer, DJ/Producer, TV Host, Photomodel, Professional Cook and HR Specialist in a corporate company, been designing board games for a couple of years now and 2 of them will be published in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's also fluent in Chinese and she's been importing/exporting stuff for about 4 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

Another big worry that I have is, I get sick pretty often and even though I don't like the country that I live in, medical expenses are cheap and we can afford it, I can't really say the same about the US from the things I've heard and that scares me.

I currently work at a pizza parlor as their delivery driver, lately management has been falling apart and we’ve been very understaffed so I’ve been working more than I want to and covering shifts just to keep up. We have only 3 drivers splitting the 7 day workweek and one of those drivers is going to leave for the month leaving only me and another driver to fend for ourselves during the busy Christmas season. We haven’t had any applicants so it’s been really rough on delivery drivers.

A few days ago my friend offered me a position at her job where she’s a manager, the pay is better (I only get $14 at pizza, this one is near $19 with possible raises). It’s retail at the mall, id be a shift leader, hours are stable and what I think is most important, I wouldn’t be delivering and thus  wearing out my car isn’t a concern. My car is an old hand me down and I fear it’ll break on me since I don’t have knowledge or financial capability to properly maintain it. (It’s about 11 years old) and with delivering, although I make tips, a lot of it goes straight to gas.

I would definitely leave in a heartbeat for a better opportunity, management doesn’t care about me but I care about my fellow coworkers. They were already scheduling me double for the month when the other driver leaves, and if I leave they would definitely fall apart. 

How do I leave without burning the bridge or being the bad guy?",05Dec2019,1
710,"Hey all, 

First time posting here.. So my sister(11) is a sweet girl. She's very compassionate and kind, since starting the school year at a different school, which is a private middle school(grades 6-8). She has had difficulties with this other girl (bully) in her class. Things like the bully following her around the playground at recess and bothering her, pulling her seat belt on the bus causing my sister to choke, and just being plain nasty. As I've said my sister is a sweet kind girl so whenever the bully tries to approach her she just asks her to leave her alone then walks away.  On the bus when her seat belt would be pulled and locked around her body and neck she would tell the bully to stop then she would tug back at her belt. When it would lock she would have to unbuckle in order to loosen it. She told the bus driver multiple times but the driver A) hasn't disciplined the child B) separated them or C) told the school or her parents that this was happening. Instead he gave my little sister sh1t for taking her seat belt off. Mind you this is a mini van so there's no real excuse that he didn't see or hear what was happening.

One day when the bully would not leave her alone she got fed up and said "" Leave me alone, I hate you!"" After school she cried so hard because she felt mean and didn't really mean it. My parents contacted the school and they had a meeting with Principle, the child and their parents. We thought this would get sorted by them. But about a week ago my sisters school went on a school trip. She was put in a 3 person group with the bully. When she heard that the teacher placed her in a group with her bully she no longer felt excited to go on the trip and just wanted to go home. 

Its been a few months of this, I dont know what to tell my sister on how to handle/cope with this. She shouldn't have to handle this on her own, that's why we pay for this private schooling. I want to tell her to kick that girls ass but she would never even think of doing that. She is non-confrontational so she just tells the teacher but nothing happens.  I dont even know what I'm asking for advice with, but my sister shouldn't have to feel dread and fear going to school. How can I help her?",05Dec2019,1
711,"For context I live with both my parents, a brother and a sister. My father was born in Ecuador and I have family there (Step sister and her husband, nephew, grandmother and two cousins with an uncle and a bunch of other people), I’ve gone on trips to this country 4 times of which 2 I found to be excruciatingly long and repetitive.
Back home, for the past year (2019) my father and brothers have been planning over time on going to Ecuador again to visit family and spend Christmas there, my mother won’t be going because on April this year my grandfather (moms dad) had a stroke, and we’ve been taking care of him and all and she doesn’t feel comfortable going to another country and leaving my grandparents back home alone on Christmas, so she wouldn’t go.

My father and brothers have been telling me to go on this trip all year, something I would’ve enjoyed but preferred to decline, since I didn’t think I could pass this year’s class without having to take an exam which would take place during our stay at Ecuador.
Thing is I actually managed to pass, and have the possibility to choose to go to Ecuador right now (there are only 3 seats left on the plane).

But, I don’t actually feel like I want to go, this year I got my first girlfriend and I’ve been spending some of the happiest 5 months of my life so far and these two weeks my family would go on a trip our house would be empty and I could enjoy some time with her.
There is also the feeling I don’t want to leave my mother alone nor my grandparents.

I don’t know what to do, they’re still trying to convince on going to this trip because they’ll be doing “different stuff” as what we’ve been doing all the times we went to Ecuador. I also think it’s be nice to see my family, though my connection to them isn’t that strong.
My grandmother on Ecuador also fell a bit ill lately which my father really wants to go check on, but it also means that some trips I was looking forward to will be canceled if I went.

I’m torn on what to do, on one side I could go to Ecuador once more on what might be the last chance we have on going together with my brothers since all three of us will be busy with our studies (although my father will continue to travel on his own) but I also would like to spend Christmas here in my country and also enjoy the two weeks my usually crowded and life filled house will be practically empty, and free to enjoy with my girlfriend and friends.

I also have another exam in 5 days which I think might be making me more cranky than usual, but still, I want to think about this and make up my mind.

713,"I am 25...yes the age Gap is fairly big but I don't mind, and I love my weird little sister.

She absolutely LOVES plastic animals. Dinosaurs, farm animals, safari animals....you name it she's got it....but that's the thing....she already HAS a ton of plastic animals, and at some point I know she will tire of them, and I want to get her something more fun.

I tried asking my mom but she was rather vague in answer, so I'm trying to come up with ideas. One idea that popped into my head was hot wheels. Specifically hot wheels and a hot wheels track. You know...the kind they advertise on TV where the cars race each other and which car will survive the infinity shaped Mobius strip that's sure to make them crash, and it's motorized and blah blah. I think she might really like this and it's a toy she could grow into over the next year/year and a half. She's really curious about things and I think it would be neat to her, but I also feel this toy might be too ""big kid"" for her?

I want to get her something she'd really like to play with. I know kids are pretty flitty about toys jumping from one to the next. But like I mentioned above she's absolutely obsessed with her little plastic ""dudes""(that what she calls them haha)

My budget is 50$ or under, but ide really like to keep it around 30$

714,"We have a child together, and have been living together for over the past 4 years. He’s always drinking beer. It seems like he cannot go a few days without a case of beer in the house. He drinks a beer as a morning beverage. He drinks a beer through out the days when he’s off. He drinks a beer before work, and then 3 - 4 beers after work. 
I’ve never seen him completely wasted or anything. Only a few times actually like on occasions with friends and what not, never here at the house. I can’t even tell if he’s buzzed or anything. It just seems like he’s drinking a normal beverage. 
He also smokes a lot of weed, and he never seems stoned.
The only difference I can tell from him when he’s not consuming these substances is that maybe he’s more grumpy or easily triggered/angry when he’s  not drinking or smoking. But then he also seems like that when he is drinking, especially if he’s had quiet a few.
It’s hard to distinguish. Sometimes idk if he’s sober or not. 

I personally could never consume that stuff like he can. I don’t smoke weed, as it just never settles well with me. I barely drink now because i am a lightweight and I did use to have a problem with it in my teens, to the point I may have been an alcoholic. This was before really knowing my spouse.

I went down and asked the workers when they thought they paint might dry and they told me to turn off any fan or A/C and it would be gone in 20 minutes.

 I turned everything off like so and kept the window open. The smell stayed in my apartment all night long. It has been two days and there is still a faint smell of paint/paint peeler.

Currently, I have a weekend job (Fri - Sun) and for the rest of the week, I basically just sit at home, practice my music, go out to get food, play games with my friends, occasionally go to my friend's house, and then go to work on the weekends. And that's basically my life right now and that's where it seems like it's heading, and I desperately want to get off of that course.

What I'd really love to do is to go out and see and explore the world. I want to be someone in the world around me, as right now I feel as if I'm just a spectator, watching life happen before me, with no influence on the world around me. I want to go out and make lasting and interesting relationships with a bunch of different people from around the world. I want to go out and help people in my day-to-day life, and I want to pursue my hobbies and passions in the world around me.

 And yet when I say all of this, I have absolutely no idea where to even begin.  

I mean I don't even know what ""explore"" the world really even means. I definitely don't want to just get a plane ticket to somewhere interesting, stay there for a couple of days, and then head back home. I guess something like a nomadic lifestyle, drifting from place to place, and really living and experiencing the places I go to is what I want, which sounds great in theory, but when I try to think about how to actually make something like that work, it all just falls apart, and I feel trapped and depressed(not clinically) in my current state.

Really any and all advice would be extremely appreciated, and even if you're in the same situation as I am, I'd love to talk to you about it if even just for the knowledge that there is someone else out there who feels the same way that I do.

735,"As the title says I am being threatened by a minor. I do not personally know him and I never spoke to him.


It all began some days ago on a discord group my boyfriend is in. He was speaking with another guy (also under 18)(let's call him A) and telling A that he doesn't care about whatever A was speaking. 

Then another guy (M) began sending insulting text to my bf (""what the fuck is your problem"" and some insults). My bf was already quite angry so he continued the insults (which I found really imature of him). 


Then M started saying that my bf has a problem with him because of a incident where M tried to gain pity from bf by telling him to not anger him cause he is already mad cause he had a fight with his gf (G). 


My bf answered that he has no problem with M and he doesn't care about his  gf which is so stupid she couldn't even get in a highschool. And so hell begins.


M got really angry and began threatening my bf. M tried to manipulate a common friend (CF) to tell him my bf's address and then began telling CF that he'll beat me too (even tho I have no business in all of this).

Initially I didn't care that much. M is a lot  younger than us and from what my bf told me he is short and slim but CF said M has some big foreign friend that sometimes visits M and he might ask him to hurt me and bf. I didn't really cared about this either, who is stupid enough to beat 2 random people just cause a high schooler told him so. 

My plan was that if he actually finds us and wants a fight I'll just self protect. When outside I always keep my keys in my hand ready to strike if it's necessary ( I life in a country where is common for a certain kind of people to try to steal from you).


But realisation hit me that M is a minor. Being over 18 will make me responsible if I actually hurt this guy even if it was to protect myself/boyfriend. 

I initially wanted to go to the police with the screenshots of him threatening us, but bf doesn't really want that cause his parents might be disappointed in him that he caused such a childish situation. 

After that I decided to make a fake Facebook account to pretend to be my own father and speak with M's parents. But surprise they don't have one. 

However I found M's gf's parents on Facebook. I planned to speak with them and show what their daughter's bf does but then I decided that it's better to ask other people's opinion about this.

Normally I wouldn't care, but M is from a very bad neighborhood and at a very bad highschool known for it's uneducated and violent students. 

Now I don't really know what to do. M has been told that tomorrow I'm gonna go to the police with the screenshots and had no reaction yet.

I'm currently in collage full time and work about 30-ish hours a week. My current scheduled is something like this.

Monday - work 6 am to 9 am. class 10 am to 3 pm. Work at 1 pm to 6 pm (skipping my class that goes to 3)

 Wednesday / Friday  - work 6 am to 9 am. Class 10 am to 3 pm. Work again 3 pm to 6 pm. Get home and be in bed by 10.

Tuesday / Thursday - work 6 am to 9 am. class 10 am to 1 pm work again 3 pm to 6 pm Get home and be in bed by 10.

The point is I feel like I am really stressed. Its work, school, work, study, bed. I feel like I never have enough time to study (due to a bit of falling grades). I can switch to working mornings only but then I might lose my job.

I feel like I should switch to morning work only, and instead of afternoon work, replace it with studying and tutoring. I feel like that would give me more time and help me be better in class. 

Also because of my limited time there are times where I stay up to late doing homework and get up for work, and go home and back to bed and end up skipping class because I'm so tired. 

For me collage needs to be first (i have a scholarship), my personal life second because my mental health is really bad, and third work. But I have this guilty feeling for thinking about going to morning only or not having a job.

Because of the high rent prices,  I've thought strongly about moving to San Diego where its slightly cheaper, about $200-$400 less for a one bedroom. I am able to do this because my work has another office down there.

My boyfriend said he is down to move, but if he went to San Diego he would go back to school. This is fine, but the only problem is he is already in debt, and can only pay $700 now. He would only be working part time in San Diego, and I would have to pay the majority of our rent, food expenses, etc.

I have no idea where to go

I’m in a bit of a weird spot right now, and I’m not sure what to do. Literally any help is appreciated here.

I’m currently a senior. Throughout HS, I thought I wanted to go into 3D Modeling/Animation and Game Design, I practiced a bit of modeling stuff, all of that. A few months ago, I came to realize that I thought I’d be more interested in Physics/Computer Engineering. I blindly went with that and applied to colleges, and got accepted to all of them (non-binding, not a problem). 

I’m starting to think more about it, and the main reason why I think I changed my mind: I never had a portfolio. All of the colleges for animation I was looking at wanted one, and I had no clue about it until late last year. I had pieces for modeling scenes and things, but they all wanted hand-drawn images, something I had no experience with. I think that I just gave up on it because I knew that it would be far too weak for a proper portfolio, but now I’m thinking about more of it again. 

I’m looking around again, and every college I’ve seen wants a portfolio. The only one I’ve seen without one is SCAD, but I keep reading that they have a lot of issues, or that any school that doesn’t want a portfolio is a bad idea. I’m not sure what to do at all here. I know that I’d love going 3D art based around game design, but I don’t know how to get there under my conditions. Someone recommended me taking a break year to get better with art, but I don’t know how viable that is, and I’m afraid that if I change my mind, I’d be wasting my time and money for a year.",05Dec2019,1

760,"It's been 2.5 years since that time. I still hold so much anger and sadness based on the fact my parents did that... I can't get over it and I think about it everyday.

The story goes... We had a cat around the 15 year mark. Everything was going fine until we brought a new kitten home (found her in the bush outside in -30C weather, was only a few weeks old, way too young to be by herself). The old cat hated the new cat and got territorial, hissed, and was just being a bitch. Fast forward a month or 2, and eventually they tolerated each other enough to be in each others presence and things were mostly fine. Occasionally my old cat would pee in random spots around the house (could be marked to some kidney issues, but the cat was on a good diet and had some supplements from the vet) so it wasn't a huge issue according to the vet. She didn't really exhibit any other distressing signs, was still cuddly, friendly, walked around fine.

My mom hated the fact that she would pee in those spots and was getting tired of it and cleaning up the mess, which is understandable. I started helping out and doing my best to clean up, but apparently it didn't seem like it was enough.  This probably went on for \~6 months.

I left for a vacation with my dad, just a week, and when I came back, I went looking around my house to see my cat again. After calling for a bit, my mom came down and informed me that she had her put down while I was gone. I was extremely sad and distraught, but I asked what happened. She said something along the lines of ""She had cancer and it progressed to the point where I had to put her down""; which I now realise never hearing the vet mention cancer at all. I was too distraught so I didn't bother continuing the conversation, but over the next few weeks it got me thinking about the plausibility of her story and it just seems like utter bullshit to me. My dad hasn't even said a word about this in the entire 2.5 years. I've never confronted them about the story and haven't talked to them about my feelings either.

My mom and I held a small funeral a year later by burying her favorite toy in the backyard; and that was that. Haven't really talked about it, life just kinda went on but I'm still holding back. I feel immensely betrayed that I couldn't even get to say goodbye on my terms, for my cat. That those last moments with her were taken away. I'm still so angry and tear up everytime I think about it. I'm an only child, and this cat was the one that was there for me all those years and I deserved those last moments.

I know it's just a pet to some people, but to me it feels like a hell of a lot more. How do I move on from this? Do I bother confronting them about it after all this time?

TLDR; Had 15 year old cat with minor health issues. Went on vacation for a week with dad, mom put down my cat while I was gone. Blamed it on ""cancer"". Still angry 2.5 years later after BS story, never confronted them. What do?",05Dec2019,1

We all go to the same school but E is in another class than me and M are. We still talk in recess obviously. Us 3 have made a students company together and had each others backs for many things. **Recently** in high school though, I have been feeling weird about them both but for different reasons. I'll start with M, I don't want to get into too much detail but like his whole personality just seems weird. It is extremely hard to explain, but even looking at him just annoys me, which is a harsh thing to say about someone so close to me, it is very sad for me as well that I have been feeling like this. I myself am also pretty annoying but it's a different kind of annoying. It is almost like he is trying to seem cooler? Also he recently very blatantly hit on a girl that I liked but he didn't know that so I guess that's my fault for not telling him. E is thankfully not that bad. He is a really nice guy but hes humor feels weird. I know him for 10 years and never has it stuck out to me like that, it is just, plainly put, bad. Of course he makes good jokes as well but the overall feel of it. Also he gets salty very quickly and he has done some things recently that I didn't like either. I should mention that people who have smoked weed should know the feeling of how other people around you just feel weird. It's like that but without weed. Maybe it's just me who feels like that when I smoke, who knows. In conclusion I just want to know other peoples thoughts on this. What should I maybe do? I like them and I don't want to feel this way.

763,"Hey, I’ll keep it short.

My mom has anger issues and has had temper flare recently as I’m going to be going away to college soon (I’m a senior). She lets me get away with whatever I want, but constantly yells and berates my little brother and dad over nothing to the point where my dad and mom argue every other day about nothing, because my mom gets mad over something very small. For example, the only person she has ever apologized to in the house is me (because she secretly read my college essays I explicitly told her not to read and I caught her). 

She constantly yells at my brother, and attempted to seriously injure my dad this summer by pushing him down a flight of stairs, which sent him to the hospital.

My dad talked to me today, because he has constantly told my mother she needs to go to therapy for her anger issues, but she instead gets super defensive. He told me that I need to step up and tell her something needs to change, because I’m the only one she’ll listen to.

He used to have a drug habit when he was younger, 40ish which is probably the root of his issues but he was free in the last 3-4 years and takes his medicines. A few weeks ago he came up with an idea he is going to report all the shady people he used to spend time with to the police. He visited the police multiple times.

I think this is pretty scary but I am more concerned about his mental health. He is imagining things that are 100% unreal. Combining things that are totally irrelevant like different people from his social group planning something against him, people who have never seen eachother but he is connecting them and beleives that they are planning something. He even asked me multiple times if I'm not bribed by those shady guys from his past to trap him so they can get him. He takes all this non-sense he is talking 100% serious, this is fucking unbelievable.

My dad married her mom when I was 15, and I’m 19 now, and this step sister in particular I’ve never even met that many times in the past 4 years. So there is no emotional bond between us at all.


I should also clarify that my step sister is 29 close to 30. Anyways, this step sister of mine has been through some things... especially some issues with her mom.

I enjoy learning at school however my personality tends to clash with my classmates a lot. I’m a little more optimistic than most, not as in with the times and quite dorky too, which leads me to get teased a lot and sometimes outright bullied. I don’t fit in at all and I can completely understand why I’m disliked so much, but it kinda upsets me haha, so I’m trying to think of ways to combat it and lesser the hurt.

So, I’m thinking of becoming a lot more serious, and as embarrassing and cringe as it sounds, wanting to act like an emo/loner type. If talking with people is only hurting me then becoming this type of person will not only help me focus more on studying but also make me happier. If I can’t change myself to not be so weird then I can try and make do with what I’ve got.

The problem is though... I’m really bad at trying to be that kind of person lol.

I’m easily cheered up and if people start talking to me then I find it hard to ignore them and just start talking back, even if they’re teasing me so it’s been a hard couple of weeks trying to ease myself into that personality type.

781,"FYI This is a long post, sorry :(


Lately I've been feeling majorly discouraged and it's been a battle to get myself out of the habit of affirming the most self deprecating things. As a very nurturing person to others, I'm starting to find the things I say to myself very worrying.


I'm [F28] and when I look at my life objectively I feel like there's always something standing in the way of completing my dearest and major goals. I'll explain.


I've started a lot of things and stopped pursuing those things, here are a few reasons I wrote down during self-reflection:


Allowed people I valued to discourage me from pursuing goals

Previously relied heavily on people believing in me or said goal to pursue goals

I've prioritised other people and other things with no or little return 

I've allowed myself to be 'used' by people who gave very little in return

I struggled a lot with asking for help in the past

Living in a very toxic environment where I am constantly put down or nitpicked at. I have to hear about all my failings/weaknesses/disappointments daily.

I have multiple passions and skills and am more defined by the impact I want to make in the world than I am about identifying as one thing alone career wise.

Previous depression and current anxiety

Not having the right resources in place to achieve said goal

Having minimal resources and investing financially in things/people (with aim to achieve goal) but they've fallen short of standards and left with little to invest

Being broke 

Not being afraid to ""try"", I have given great ideas a shot, so I guess the frequency of ""failing"" would always be higher. But they always seem to fall through/be a real struggle even when so obviously great. 

Discouraged when I see something I attempted to achieve be executed elsewhere with much more ease. Although, I also feel affirmed in the capacity of my mind to think up great things.

People or things I have relied on and felt were necessary to facilitate those goals being met have fallen through/failed to meet requirements at a cost to my goal. I get disheartened as a result, might attempt to try and find someone else, then they disappoint again and I abandon

A creative brought up in an environment that has never nurtured my creativity 

I've been too much of a perfectionist 

Given up too quickly and or not given things that should be prioritised priority.

Big ideas without the right team, baby steps needed to take to realise them

I place unrealistic time frames and pressure on myself to complete tasks but I justify it because I see others are capable of achieving similar things with ease in even less time

When people I'm relying on to complete projects disappoint me I try to be resourceful and do everything myself instead of finding a more reliable person because I'm so fearful of wasting more time or resources. 


With all the above, I do believe in EVERY single one of my ideas and as for the goals I once had that I no longer believe in, I've always been okay with letting go of them. I feel further affirmed in the strength of my ideas when I see things that I thought of years prior come to life via someone else.


I'm just having a hard time knowing what to do with how I feel and how to effectively plan my 2020 to increase my productivity. Everyone who knows me says I'm a hard-worker, even those who haven't known me for long. So what does it mean when you're percieved as a hard worker but you always seem to fall short on achieving the standards you have set for yourself?


Examples of things planned and why they haven't been executed yet


Content I planned to execute with a brand - had to pause due to noticing the development of a dangerous and unsafe working environment in said brand and no longer felt working with them was a safe and reliable situation. Their workstyle was also not conducive to productivity and high quality work. The brand I worked with previously didn't have budget to execute these same ideas hence the move, still no content. Disappointed twice.

Coding course - Started off in a bootcamp that was meant to last 3 months, found it very intense so was advised to go online, process of going online took a few months. Now doing the course online and feel like I'm going at a snail's pace and will have to restart full time work in January to sustain myself and also invest in my wellbeing which has been significantly neglected.

A clothing brand that was doing well last year, I had significant printing issues (printer ruined most of what I paid for, refused to refund) delayed the process. I paid two different designers significant money who didn't execute the work to a high standard (hardly any cash to restart) as I was also freelancing at the time. Ended up with poor designs, then fell ill and was hospitalized, tried to design myself (one of my skills but not my most honed as it takes ages for me to get past my perfectionism and still rough around the edges) I gave up after a third disappointment and it has since been on pause for a year. I still believe in it, a lot of people do and I want to bring it back.

My music, I'll keep this short and sweet - crippling anxiety, since surgery and an incident with smoke inhalation I don't feel like my voice is what it once was. Also too much of a perfectionist, kept writing this year but I don't feel like I want to continue singing. I think I want to give my work to established artists instead. 

A developer on a major project completely halted development of work and went AWOL when close to completion. We were left with nothing and forced to go back to basics.


These are just a few things over the past year. To add further context, one of my strong points is ironically in consulting others. Countless people who have come to me regarding their plans and still do have gone on to achieve significant success. I'm adding this because maybe it can help give more insight. This is why I think the issue isn't necessarily the ideas, something keeps happening during the journey from idea to reality that I need to fix and I'd appreciate any advice I can get no matter how direct. What am I failing to see here?

Jane has been with the company for a long time and is known to be an “HR case.” She doesn’t get along with 90% of the staff and is extremely dramatic. Since day 1, she has no spoken a word to me, hasn’t acknowledged me, and has done things here and there that I feel like are in an attempt to antagonize me (I only say this because she’s known to do this to many of the other girls). Until this point, I have been able to ignore her behavior. Lastnight, I had to make a call to try to get ahold of another coworker, in which Jane answers. I asked her to please let the coworker know I was calling for her and to have her call me back, said thank you and hung up. Jane then continued to call me back and tell me that I hung up on her which was unprofessional and when I speak to her to say goodbye. Jane and I are equals in the company, we do the same job and have the same job title. At this point, I was tired of being antagonized and it’s ridiculous to me that she picks on the girls that don’t assert themselves to her. So, I walked over to where she was and told her she is not to dictate what I am or am not going to say to her and if I didn’t want to say goodbye, I wasn’t going to. All of the whole time she has her hand in my face saying “girl bye, be professional, get out of here” you get it. I should have stopped there but said a few more uncharacteristic things and well, that was that. I don’t generally ever fight with other people but I felt I needed to stand up for myself and frankly I don’t want to deal with a situation like this any longer.

790,"Long post, sorry. 

I’m part of a group of 6 girlfriends, early 20s, been very close for nearly a decade. 4 of us are in long term relationships, myself for 4 years, another friend 2.5, another 3 years and the subject of this post, “Lea” has been with her boyfriend “Brad” for nearly 2 years.  Basically, as a group we are all very familiar with falling into the *dicksand* and getting that early relationship honeymoon tunnel vision, and all quickly came out the other side and got our lives together.

However, Lea has been absolutely neck deep in the dicksand for the entirety of these two years and it’s really affecting the group. What’s most striking is that if you had asked me 2 years ago who was LEAST likely to become totally dick-whipped, it would have been her. My friends and I were always in awe of her independence; while the rest of us went to uni, she took a year out first, moved to another country and learned a new language and earned money au-pairing for a year, came back and moved 3 hours away from home to go to university.  Out of all of us she seemed to be the most together; self-assured, confident, independent - but it all changed when she got a boyfriend. Now, all she does is talk about him. She still lives 4 hours away as she moved in with him (she met him down there while at uni) and only comes back home literally about twice a year to visit her family (all of whom live here) and only friends (again, all of whom live here). 

So basically, we never see her. On the rare occasion she comes to visit, she either BRINGS HIM WITH HER (he’s perfectly nice but SERIOUSLY can’t we just have some girl time when you’re with him 24/7?????!!!), spends the entire time talking about him, spends the entire time texting him, and/or leaves early and is barely around for more than a few nights so she can go back down there for him. She works 3 days a week, Mon-Wed. She could very easily come for long weekends allllll the time if she wanted to. It isn’t a case of money, because getting a coach rather than a train would be pretty cheap, and besides I’m pretty sure her mum (of whom she is her only child) would gladly drive to get her tbh. Plus her bf Brad has a good job and I’m sure would give her some money to go see friends and family.  We’ve all come to the conclusion she just simply doesn’t care, or at least when weighing up friends&amp;fam vs. Brad, he will ALWAYS win regardless. 

It’s got the the point where we all actually just can’t bear her. Practically our only source of communication these days is on the group chat, which she mostly ignores and only chimes in to talk about something to do with herself, never to reply to other people or join in discussions. She never asks how anyone’s doing, what’s going on in our lives, even though we would have loads to talk about because she never sees us in person. She doesn’t even do birthday cards anymore even though we make the effort for her.  She came up around a week ago for one of our friends birthday nights out; I hadn’t seen her in nearly a year and when she arrived she didn’t even look at me for around 10 minutes. I am not an awkward person. I am very chatty. But in this situation I felt SO awkward. I broke the ice by asking what drink she ordered and then she barely spoke to some of us for the rest of the night. She was always closest to 2 members of the group in particular and so she didn’t seem to give a crap about anybody else. The next day we wondered why she’d even bothered coming, because she spent the whole night barely speaking to anyone, didn’t get involved, didn’t seem to have fun, was on her phone loooaaddss and left after 3 hours. She was back down south less than 24 hours after she’d come up to see us. 


Anyway. Basically, the entire group is absolutely sick to death of her basically just acting like she doesn’t give a flying frick about anybody other than Brad. She’s not even coming home for Xmas to see her family; she’s spending 9 days with his family instead. Oh and when she IS finally coming back for about 12 days in January when everyone’s back at work/ uni and is only free on the weekend, Brad is coming up that weekend. We don’t know how to approach this subject with her because A) we barely see her in person B) none of us like confrontation and C) being her only friends, don’t want to ostracise and upset her. But we’re at our wits end. Engaging with her is just not fun anymore. There’s barely anything about her we like these days. She has become totally self involved (2 friends took a trip to a major city with her and she essentially monopolised the entire weekend and prevented them doing a single thing THEY wanted to do, from activities to food).  We have nothing against Brad because he’s lovely, but she’s become a person we simply don’t like anymore and we want her to realise how she’s coming across, because clearly she’s lost all self awareness. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.  I don’t want to make this point ridiculously long so there’s plenty of details I haven’t included, but trust me when I say she barely acknowledges us unless it’s to talk about herself and has ample opportunity to see her f&amp;f but simply doesn’t seem to want to. Which I guess is fine for a while but damn, 2 years in and if anything it only seems to be getting worse.",05Dec2019,1

I declined for monetary reasons and requested they only move the heavy furniture, they re-quote me 3 hours verbally, but on the paperwork they put 6.5-7.5 and I signed it since I was distracted with my 3 kids. I kept asking during the move when they'd be done and they kept reassuring me soon. I paid over 1k and it depleted all my savings, which are scarce as a single parent. Not only that, but they were rude when I asked for updates and cause breaks/cracks/tears in 5 pieces of my furniture.

But the other day I called my stepmom  and immediately, without asking about how I was, she goes on this discussion about how my dad needs his mouth redone since his teeth are rotting and how much pain it is causing him.

It's been a while, but I do go to a therapist for anxiety. Last time I was there, they said that they suspected I might have depression and should see a doctor for medication. My parents think that medicine for depression is dangerous, so any kind of medicine for depression is off the table. I don't know if this is related, but I think it might be and hope it's not.

I have vague memories of being able to laugh, act annoyed, etc as a kid. I try to suppress a lot of memories from that time so I don't know how accurate these memories are.

I definitely know when I'm feeling happy, empathetic, annoyed, etc. However, my face rests in a permanent frown. When I hear a funny joke, I find it funny, I want to laugh, but I just don't. I try to laugh to show that I think a joke's funny, but it sounds incredibly fake.

I think the only emotion I don't think I experience is any sense of shock/excitement, at least in a crowd. My voice always sounds dull and I always seem bored. Honestly, I often am feeling dull, but I just don't know how to not feel dull.

Christmas is coming soon, and when I spend time with my family, I want them to know I'm grateful. What if, one day, I'm walking down the isle, I see my husband/wife waiting for me, and I'm frowning on what I hope is the happiest day of my life?

Okay guys, I’m having a quarter life crisis, same as every other recent graduate, I’m sure. I have a B.S. in psychology and I LOVE psych. I don’t like counseling psychology or any time of psych that involves me helping others (I respect everyone who does enjoy that - just too draining for me). My favorite thing ever was research. I also really enjoy cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and social psychology. 

Anyway, obviously if you don’t go to graduate schools options can be pretty limited for this degree, but I KNOW there’s more out there that I just haven’t heard of. I’m not in a place where I can attend grad school, even though I’d love to. Also I don’t know exactly what I’d specialize in anyway.

2. A guy whom I know online and his sister, he developed feelings for me and we mutually agreed to cut contact as I am married.

I thought it was great that he was getting more involved and feeling more confident to understand her needs.

The other day when he was looking after her and couldn’t get her to nap. He sent me a funny photo and video of them having a nap together in his bed. He said she was falling asleep when she was with him but cried when he tried to put her in the cot.

I accepted that and thought nothing more of it.

Until I went round recently and he offered to look after her while I went to an appointment.
I said to him please do not nap in your bed together and keep her awake until I come back.

When I returned 20 mins later my dad said my mum had come back and woken them both up from a nap.

My problem is that I'm a 23 y/o female living in a college town, with an ivy league school a stone's throw away from me, and I cant help but feel so lost and inferior.
I feel like mostly everyone my age is getting all done with college and I'm just working another entry level job. I graduated high school 2nd in class and everything seemed really promising..until college. Last time I went to school was a community college for nursing, (my parents were adamant about nursing school I really wanted the arts) and I just couldnt deal, left halfway through getting my associate's so I went to an accredited career school for medical assisting to please the fam. 

Problem with that is that medical assisting doesnt pay great, I ended up with a huge student loan and now I dont even like the field anymore.

817,"Sometimes when you have a crush on someone you have to open up to someone else sich as your best friend and might always be the best choice. That's what happened to me a few days ago and it got me very sad and lost in my thoughts all the time.

So it was evening, the time was about 9pm. Me and my best friends were in an gaming centre playing Apex Legends(we've recently liked it a lot). He knew that i liked this girl and also the day before i told him that i liked her more than he thought. I had noticed that he was so close to her because we stay together in a group of averagely 6 friends. He hugged her a lot and was close, but so was I. It's my first time i take a crush that seriously so i started getting a little jealous about the situation and i always think if only i was in his place, but the thing is he doesn't like her however i think that she will develop a crush on him.

Back to when we were playing in the gaming center i told him this but i didn't really want to upset him and i thought he wouldn't take it too personal. Although i was going through my busy mind with these thoughts, he got upset a lot, i mean a lot more than i thought and as a result he told me he would get kind of ""isolated"" and not talk to her in the same way or act in the same way but he rather acted uninterested with her.

That also got me really upset because all in all it's my best friend i wouldn't like to be that kind of guy yo get off her it's mine, no. I realised i had made a huge mistake in which neither of us would be happy. I also told him many times please dont get isolated because it's not gonna change anything and the most important thing we wouldn't be happy with each other.

In despair i told him that if he wouldn't get back to normal, i would open up to her. This way she would reject me(we only know each other for four months at school and the same is for my best friend) and things between us would be weird and i would in some way get isolated too. I know it's a dumb idea, but all for my friendship with my best friend. He disagreed of course.

Now i'm indeed sad about what's happened and i also wish i never told him i was jealous. It feels like we are losing friendship gradually and don't know what to do with all this. I really don't like my friends isolation and i wish this never happened.

823,"A few months ago, a few members of our friend group were caught doing drugs at a football game. They were quickly suspended. However, they were only caught because one friend (dont really like this guy but whatever) greened out in the stands. He then proceeded to give up the names of two people who were involved, but not everyone. Person C and Person P were the ones whose names were given up. On the day they were caught. Person P was absent, but Person C was called in to the school administration, and proceeded to give the names of the majority of the people involved, including my very close friends. Person C has said since then that the administration tricked him into revealing the names, but we told them that if they were caught, they should deny. As a result of Person C telling on them, two people were expelled for a semester, one of my close friends received a 5 day suspension and was almost expelled ( they got  this after they refused to give the office any information, and when he refused, they brought person C's partner into the room, where they had admitted to him being a part of this). As a result, They (the person who resisted) was punished harsher than the rest. Now, since the incident, person C has remained in the group, and has received very little shit for what he did. But recently, he was told to do something by the vice principal, and in a panic, told their mom, and their mom proceeded to text our moms detailing our recent activities. The mom also accused us of being bad kids, despite us not even being involved in the suspensions. Im tired of hearing this from her. She needs to take responsibility for what her kid did, and not involve us. 

&amp;#x200B;

The advice im asking for today is what to do with person C, as they have obviously not learned their lesson by continuing to try to spread the blame out on us. Should we stop being friends with Person C. This is the second time this has happended, and although  none of us were punished, the next time this happens we might be.  Is it time we end the friendship?

824,"My friend of 8 years suddenly started acting absolutely entitled. She felt like I was using her. I was genuinely broke, not being able to pay for bus to college. She gave me a ride everyday for which I'm thankful for. She suddenly started passing very demeaning comments about me. Example:

1. When we were checking out the guys in our class, a friend nudged me to date one of the guys. My 'friend' just says 'No, he only dates classy girls. She's too..you know?'
I was shocked at that comment but never spoke against it at any point. 

2. I studied with a 100% scholarship in the college, a classmate asked me for change and when I was looking for some in my bag my 'friend' chimes in and says 'She begged her way into college dude, wym?' . I was too shocked at the behaviour to make a comeback.

 She wanted to 'upgrade'. I accepted her growth. I went through a terrible abusive relationship all this time and she went around telling people how I abandoned her while she needed me even though she knew about the abuse I was facing. 

She always mentioned how I was from a different 'class' and how abuse was okay with me. I didn't expect things like these from her. 
I'm genuinely confused if this was a toxic friendship that I need to run from or should I try to make things work again with her?",05Dec2019,1

828,"So I'm (25 M) having trouble determining if a long-time friendship (25 M) has turned toxic and how to go about setting boundaries. To make this short, we met freshman year of college and really bonded. He could be erratic at times, and there were bad times, but overall it was a good friendship. He was there for me (for the most part) after I dropped out of college and had a bunch of personal problems. This past year, though he's just seemed to have changed, he was finishing up his Master's so we didn't hang as much, and seemed stressed out. He got into the habit of snapping at me, and being completely passive aggressive, like telling me I should just know when he's free to hang out instead of asking him. There were a few times he's acted like a complete child, once accusing me of asking his girlfriend out when I was trying to help them patch their relationship up, screaming at me because he drove to the wrong restaurant us and a group of friends were going to (even though I wasn't the one planning it and drove to it with someone else, but I ""should've told him"", even though he didn't even ask me), asking me to take off from a day of work to drive him to a test (because he didn't want to pay for a cab, even though he makes more money than I do and has a degree and all that) and being completely nasty when I politely refused and suggested he take a cab.

Besides all that, half the time he seems like his normal self that I like hanging out with and then half the time he'll be passive aggressive or just rude. When I gently tried to tell him in the days after he told me to take off from work to give him a ride, that me and a few friends noticed he seemed ""stressed out recently"", he lost it at me in a restaurant, just insulting me and being nasty and passive aggressive. I would've walked out, but wanted to pay for my meal and there was no server around. He didn't apologize, but shortly after blowing up, kinda laughed it off and said he didn't really mean it. His latest offense to me was not shaking my hand in front of our group of friends because I didn't respond to his text after he missed a call from me. I happened to be driving. We're hanging out briefly tonight and I almost don't want to. There are so many more little and big things I'm not mentioning, because there's been so much. He's mostly been there for me in the past, when few were, but writing out all this makes me really question the friendship and I've been trying to hang out less, which works, because we both work and are busy.

How would /r/advice recommend I set boundaries with a close friend who gets angry and passive aggressive out of nowhere? This has been so hard for me, because this is a 7-year, really close friendship that has been mostly great. I don't know how to feel or where to go and seriously need advice.

Since then there has been a few screaming matches but I cant really make out what they're saying and usually try not to for the sake of their privacy. Today, I was woken up by them fighting right above my bedroom. There was a lot more banging than usual and the guy kept banging his fist on a table or something. I heard what sounded like the girl shouting ""why are you always so violent"" and ""get out of my face"" and it peaked my interest so I listened more. They fought for like 30 minutes and although I can't tell if it ever got physically violent it sounded like the girl was really scared.

834,"In spring, I started using Discord heavily, as I found a rly nice online community. I became the most active user on the server I was on, as I started spending most of my time there. I also spent a lot of time voicechatting.

One male user, let's call him Rabbit, always seemed to be there when I was around, which I didn't start noticing until much later. After a while, he always said ""Ily"" before going to bed and I didn't want to leave him hanging, so I responded with ""Ily2"". One day, I decided to share a picture of myself to the most active users on the server, as we had a secret channel for that. Not much later, Rabbit revealed himself as being female. This was a big surprise, as nobody knew about it. She has previously been called a boy and went with it, as she didn't want any attention for being female, even though there were many females on that server. She was also pretty active in the vc but her voice easily passed as being the one of a boy without puberty vocal change and nobody noticed, since ""he"" seemed to be pretty weird considering that ""his"" behaviour was pretty female. She was 15 and from the US, while I'm 18 and currently living in Germany.

A couple of days later, Rabbit made a big plan with her female friend, who was also on the server, to send me some screenshots of Rabbit where she admitted to realy liking me. I at one point confronted the one sending me the screenshots about the screenshots being fake, which she conbfirmed, as I had a feeling that they were. I actually liked how much effort Rabbit put into it, so we started e-dating. (I know, that this sounds very childish, but we were both serious abt it)

A bit later, Rabbit asked me for a nude, which I didn't want to send her, but this was a month before my finals for graduation, so I was in a weird mood and also didn't care about loosing everything online if she leaked the nude. So I sent it. We started voicechatting very often, about 3hrs every day. During my summer holidays, we spent even more time talking to each other and soon started videochatting. We realy wanted to meet each other in real life, but it never worked out. As unbelievable as it may sound, we've been \*together\* for over 6 months now and we share a lot of interests as well as liking each other very much. We probably spent much more time in videochat, as many other \*couples\* this old have in general.

She told me that she has a lot of mental problems, doesn't go to school very often because of it, takes many meds and went to a mental hospital for 4 months, as she was in danger of suicide about a year ago. She has these problems because of her parents. I do also have minor mental issues, but not nearly as serious as hers. Both of our moms were the main contributors to our mental issues. Her family would've already gotten a divorce, if they could afford it and my parents haven't been living together for 9 years now.

Her mental problems have sort of shown already, as it felt like she was forcing me to spend our future together. Rabbit has many phobias, hating to be in public transport or anywhere with many people, hating heights and also having many physical issues. She was talking about marriage and gettings kids, even though I haven't even met her in real life and she wants to study in Germany, which she could do in 2.5 years. the ""Ily"" transformed into her thinking that it initially was me declaring my love to her and it felt like I had no freedom anymore about a month ago. All of this was very manipulative, as manipulative as our moms and this was a shock to me. \[I am fine with loving her but not seeing it as love until we've actually met each other irl, even though she actually gives me those feelings when we see each other online\] She also gets very depressed, if I don't respond to her within 12hrs. My mom seemed to be like this when she was young and my father is very similar to me. I'm concerned about Rabbit becoming like her&amp;my mom as time goes on. I would've also liked to be realy active in the future, travelling a lot, doing sports, which her body may not support, despite her claiming that she'd love to do that.

I've planned to visit her in the US in april. I've been thinking about breaking up with her 2 months after she revealed herself as female, which was 4 months ago. My reasoning is that I can't deal with her mental issues and don't want to end up marrying someone like my mother, who almost made me end up in a mental hospital by dumping all her problems on me for years, even if I can thank her for giving birth to me. My mom also hated my grandmother, but couldn't stop herself from becoming like her after many years. I just want to have a nice future and don't know if Rabbit can be a part of it despite our similar interests and what feels like love for each other",05Dec2019,1

Her and I were put into the upper level class in sophomore year, and everyone else joined in junior or senior year. The teacher did not hold elections for class president and vice president this year, because she knew that the class always votes for the most popular person and, while that has worked out in previous years, my friend and I are not the most popular people. Because of this, we are the unofficial president and vice president, but we are the people she tells everybody to listen to.

She has been putting us more frequently in charge lately as she has been busier, and today she put us in charge unexpectedly. The class was extremely rambunctious today an would not be quiet, so we did our best to get though the class. We did alright, but it was, and always is, very stressful.

838,"Last Saturday I (23M) ran an errand for my boss and met a cool girl (early 20's) and her dad at their business (a small vacuum store).

I want to ask her if she wants to grab coffee sometime and get to know her, then just go from there (simple, right?) But the problem isn't having the courage to ask her (as would normally be the case) but rather that the store is so small her father will be standing right next to her as I do this.

842,"In college I was hooking up with a girl who I will refer to as May. We were never a couple, but things did get sexual on a few occasions. Each time was her calling me to go to her place and ""have fun"". This went on for a little over a month. We made it clear that this was NOT a relationship, it was just fun. The reason it stopped is because I switched to a different school in a different city. 

For about a month after leaving we would occasionally chat on messenger. Nothing serious, just the standard ""how's it going"" type of conversations that lasted 15 minutes max. 

We eventually lost touch with each other after a total of 4-5 months after meeting. That's where the story should end. However, I wouldn't be here for advice if that were the case.

Here we are nearly 10 years later and she reached out to me. She told me that she is in counseling and part of her treatment is reaching out to those who have hurt her. I was a little shocked but really more curious what this was about.

She began telling me that I was mentally and emotionally abusive to her. She said I used her and then just dumped her. I tried asking her what she was talking about, but she would only respond with ""stop trying to gaslight me"". 

I told her that I had no idea what she was talking about and if she was willing to talk about this, I would be happy to clarify whatever misunderstanding she had about what happened between us. She refused, so I ended the call and went about my life.

A few days later I went out with some old friends from college who also know her. I start telling them about the call, and they immediately cut me off and told me that she just wrote a huge post on her facebook about this, but didn't mention any names. They thought it was odd when they read it so it was memorable to them. They pulled it up and let me read through it.

In her post, she explained that we were in an official relationship for a year. During that year I had forced myself on her multiple times. That whenever I didn't get my way I would call her names and even go as far as violently pushing her to a point that she thought her arm was broken. 

WTF? None of this was even slightly true. I figured it had to be someone else, but right there in the info it explains that we met during orientation and that I moved away and we continued to date long distance for that year. 

I don't even know what to say here. I have spoken to a lawyer friend of mine who says that he believes that there's nothing to worry about legally. However, what do I do here? Do I just let her throw me under the bus? A lot of people who responded to her post claim to know who she's talking about and are talking about doxxing me. I work in a very liberal company where I just don't trust them to be above knee jerk reactions to these type of things.

Even though I don’t believe it, I have been told that I am very funny so I can’t really tell if she laughs because I am funny, or she likes me. The next point that may be a sign, is how her friends act around me. It almost seems like they are trying to interrogate me ( it’s kinda creepy). They stare at me, always ask me questions, and never leave me alone. The final thing I want to address is the several incidents that may show if she has her romantic interest in me or not. The first (of this year and that I could remember) was Homecoming. I live in Houston, and in Houston they don’t mess around with Homecoming. It is always extravagant with the signs, outfits, and over the top mums. I was kinda forced to ask her out, so I did as “friends”. When the night arrived, a bunch of her friends decided to go to a place for dinner with their dates (me being one of the dates). When we done eating, she suggested that she inform my friend who moved to Austin, Texas a while ago that her and I were going to homecoming with each other. I didn’t see the significance of the question so I kinda shrugged it off. But apparently, it may of been a key factor of proof that she likes me. I’m just  gonna keep this short and sweet; during the dance, there was a slow song and she made me dance with her, which I don’t think I did too bad, and then the night ended with me being forced to write an invitation to her to my house to hang out. When the event came, she arrived with a guest. I wasn’t expecting this so my night quickly changed from good to very awkward, the friend happened to be a grade below us, and we didn’t really “have the same vibes” which resulted in them two hanging out and me calling my Xbox friends about what games we were gonna play. Apparently she kinda got upset at me “not wanting to hang out with her” which resulted in another “date as friends” or so I thought. When the time came to this event, I was actually excited to finally hang out with her alone. We were at the Galleria, or a really huge mall in Houston. I figured if things got awkward then we could just shop (something we both enjoy doing). We ended up talking and walking around the entire mall before stopping at some Macies with a sit-down Starbucks in it. The conversation was going pretty good so far before the topic subconsciously became “common misconceptions where it is just easier to lie then to actually say what’s really going on”. This is where I came in with the greatest statement that could get any girls panties wet just by me saying it (sarcasm); “sometimes when two people of the opposite sex are hanging out alone, it is better to just says it’s a date, even though it’s not”. At the time I didn’t realize that I just unwillingly “friend-zoned” her, because I was referring to a different time where I hanged out alone with a girl. I guess I should of told her that I wasn’t referring to she and I. Right after I said that, she said, “we should go”and we went into my car and only spoke about small talk for the car ride home. I pondered about it, and thought about the mistake I made, the possibility of her liking me, and what if we did go out? I have concluded that we should go out but I don’t know how to ask her without being awkward.

850,"Hey everyone! First time poster and really scared to. 
Anyway, so I’ve been through a lot. And I mean a lot. When I was 12 (21 now) I got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Long story short, what I learned that contributed to why I felt the way I did was because of childhood trauma and the constant negative energy I surrounded myself in. So naturally my mum took me to see some therapists and I never felt comfortable with any of the ones I saw. And I saw Atleast 5. 

When I was about 15 I gave up and kinda just..ignored it. I’ve been through some tough shit since then and I’ve always just been ignoring my deep feelings to the point if I even just merely think about how I really feel, I start crying because of all the built up emotion I have accumulated over the years. I cringe whenever I think about deep personal feelings and I just..hate it. I think I’m okay mentally but I really do desire to get all this pent up feelings out. 

A couple weeks ago I reached out to an organisation that doesn’t cost anything for me to go see them, I since ghosted them after they’ve tried multiple times reaching out. I’m terrified of talking about my issues and seeking help. I’m terrified of what I might come to realise if I do go and I can’t bear to open up old wounds that I’ve since buried really deep. I’ve always struggled with opening up to anyone and being able to communicate properly due to the fact that I just start crying. I have a fiancé that’s incredibly supporting but he knows little to nothing due to how close i keep my issues to myself. I fear it will affect my relationship if I open up the flood gates bursting to open. 

I’m just so scared and I really could use some advice or encouragement on what to do. I’m really persistent that I don’t want to go see someone but I really need to at some point.",05Dec2019,1
851,"I am in college and had a class with a girl my age. She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her 
. I can tell she's the shy conservative type of girl


I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively. we had to go to a lecture in the biggest lecture hall on my campus. I was sitting in a spot in the front and in the middle and she came in saw me and she came in and sat 2 empty seats away from me. 2 days ago I approached her, told her I miss seeing her in English and would like to stay in touch and asked for her number she said yeah sure and gave it to me no hesitation. I got an awkward vibe from her though I could tell she was nervous when confronted. 

I texted her last night at 7 and said hi and introduced myself she hasn't responded yet. I asked if it was her and haven't heard anything yet. She appears to be one of those people who doesn't use social media or her phone like most people.",05Dec2019,1
852,"So this semester my FAFSA came in late because of my fault. So thinking I would be unable to afford University I enrolled in community college for 6 units and got a engineering internship. I thought all was fine at school because it is department policy to drop students who do not show their transcript, additionally the school claims enrollment cancellation for those who don't pay, so I thought I was good. I was wrong and now I am getting an F in class and I have to pay for it.
I guess it will be a lesson to not rely on the system.

861,"# The Incident
My roommate was driving down our residential street, getting ready to turn into our driveway. Another vehicle turned onto the street and was speeding up behind him, going way too fast. My roommate signalled his left turn and began to enter the driveway, and the other vehicle, going too fast to stop, tried to pass him on the left--the same side to which he was turning. The car slammed on its brakes, skidded a good 25 feet, slammed into my roommate's vehicle, and sent his car skidding sideways a good six feet. Significant structural damage to both vehicles. My roommate's vehicle is inoperable.

The driver, aged 18, had his permit (but not his license) and was driving with his two 16-year-old sisters (who quickly left the scene on foot). The driver was uninsured, and not covered by his parents' insurance policy.

At the time of the incident, we believed he was covered, and when the police came to the scene, they declared him at-fault for the collision and had everyone exchange information. It was only later that night, when the kid's mother came to our door begging us to let her son off the hook, that it was revealed that the kid was uninsured.

# The Problem

Their insurance won't pay for any of it. My friend's insurance has a heavy deductible for repairing damages caused by uninsured motorists. He can't afford the deductible, as he's recently unemployed. He wishes to pursue whatever legal methods are available to him, in order to force the at-fault family to pay for his repairs.

# The Inquiry

What can we do? The police were contacted and informed that the motorist was uninsured, and we have badge numbers, an incident number, lots of photographs of the scene post-collision, and three witnesses. The police declared the kid at-fault.

Is this something for small-claims? How can we pursue this without harassing the family of the kid? Should we lawyer up, or is that overkill?",05Dec2019,1
862,"Title says most. My roommate (Mark)  wanted to start giving us his money in two parts instead of one big lump sum. Currently Mark holds onto it and then gives us both halves in one.

My boyfriend and I don't want it because we don't like ""halving"" for bills and such and instead pay it all at once. I don't want to babysit Mark's dollars for him. 

Their solution: They proposed a joint bank account with all four of us on there to put all bill money into. I like the \*idea\* of having my bill money 100% separate from my spending money, but I do not at all feel comfortable with them having access to group money since Mark has made it clear that he can't even trust himself with his bill money. I would be open to pooling money to pay all bills but not in a way that ties us legally. I'm not sure what to do here.",05Dec2019,1
864,"Hello!

I \[23F\] am a recent college grad and began working in my career in July of this year. This summer I interviewed with three companies and chose one job over the rest because of the speed of the offer and more learning opportunity to grow in my field (STEM). The pays were all very similar, and I would have had to relocate no matter which job I chose. This job that is trying to get me to work for them had to table their hire because the company that owned the business was changing, therefore I went with another job, they would have been higher pay all along. 

I currently love my job, I have my own lab, it's very laid back and is a very small company. I make an average salary with two weeks of PTO (sick and vacation). I don't have health insurance through my company because of cost and the ability to stay on my parent's insurance for 3 more years. The company I work for is always so accommodating and looks out for my best interest. They trust my judgement and push me to grow. I even have opportunity to make whatever I want, when I want (cosmetic chemist). In my city that I have been at for five months now I have a zoo membership through 2020, an amusement park pass through 2020, became the chair elect for a national professional group for my profession for my region for 2020, and then will become the chair in 2021 for the year, it's based in this city. I have a ""SO"" in this area, things are a little rocky right now, we are technically split, but I do not see us staying apart (nothing toxic, just a fixable issue that needs time), and that is a factor of not wanting to leave him. 

The other job is across the state. Currently, I am 3.5 hours from home, that city I will be 2.5 hours from home. I told them a large concern is my apartment lease and moving costs. They said they are able to meet the salary no problem, they just need to check on moving and my apartment lease, but sounded like it wouldn't be an issue. The company is larger, so I'm sure the benefits would be better and at this point I will be asking to do a proper comparison of what I currently have. The people there were wonderful and I would have loved to work with them. This company asked when I first started this job if I would leave and come work for them and are calling now again asking me to leave and work for them. They said now that the hire is not tabled I was their first thought and they would love for me to consider leaving my current job. They even blatantly asked, if they met all of those things (even me traveling back to this city for my organization) would I do it, would I take the job? Obviously I need time to process this. 

I am asking your advice, what would be helpful in assessing the best move for myself? How would you approach this? What factors am I not considering?",05Dec2019,1

866,"This is my first time ever posting on reddit! I’m extremely stressed out and I really don’t know what to do.

Around 4 months ago I started studying abroad overseas. My family wasn’t happy about me going, but I’m an adult and pay for my own school, so there wasn’t much they could do. My entire life I’ve always wanted to travel and study in a different country and now I’m achieving my dream. I’m so happy for what feels like the first time in my life. Before I was doing a lot to try to make my parents love me and feel proud of me. I can honestly say the choice to study abroad is the only choice I’ve ever made that was for ME.

I decided that I wanted to stay abroad longer. My family did not take this well and instead of talking to me about it, they’ve been basically ignoring me. Recently the health of two of my family members has taken a turn for the worse. They are both going to pass soon. I really want to see them before they go, but I also want to continue my study abroad.

My mom is demanding that I come back to my home state till August. This isn’t her decision I’m 22, I haven’t lived at home for 2 years, and I pay for my own school. I want to visit home, but I’m terrified (and feeling incredibly guilty) of putting more of my life on hold. I feel like the scum of the earth. I want to do what’s best for my family and what’s best for me too but it always seem that those two can’t be the same.

I don’t know if I should just come home, a state i’ve never wanted to be in and to be honest have never been happy in. But I also want to see my family members who are very old and sick before they pass. Would I be a bad person if I chose myself and what I wanted?",05Dec2019,1

870,"Hey my girlfriend and I were discussing this recently and weren't able to come to a satisfying answer, so I guess I just wanted to see what an outside perspective without a stake in the matter would suggest. Essentially, last February my girlfriend started an Instagram page for food  pictures with one of her friends (this was before I met her), and they have been growing pretty well ever since. Recently when my girlfriend told me about the page I was shocked at the amount of progress (# of followers) that she her friend made in so little time; it's basically still a hobby project right now but one day if the work on it is kept up I'm sure she could make a career out of it. I've seen a lot of my girlfriend's photos myself and they legitimately look professional quality. Unfortunately, her friend who also intermittently posts on there has photos do not look anywhere near as good (I realize I might be very biased, but also I have literally zero photography experience and even I can tell the difference between her and her friend's photos). The difference in skill is also reflected in the average ""like"" disparity between her and her friend's posts. My girlfriend has tried to even ask her friend if she could send her the photos she takes before they're posted so that she can touch them up, and offered to give advice as to how to take better photos in general, but according to my girlfriend her friend adamantly refuses every time. And to make matters worse, the friend's posts very often include cringy descriptions and an excessive number of nonsensical hashtags. The hardest part about it is that my girlfriend still wants to preserve the friendship outside of the Instagram page, so discussions about this topic are especially difficult. What do you think my girlfriend should do to hopefully preserve her friendship while making the page the best it can be? Thank you so much for your time/perspective.

I was told by the psychiatrist to breathe in and out 5 times to calm me down when i'm getting angry and to think before i act, but i can't do that at all, i don't have the time and patience to do this, i can't think before i act no matter how hard i try.

I found a funeral home and they're willing to work with me, but I'm worried about signing papers. The risk that someone else might become upset in the future concerns me. I'm going to try to get my father to sign off on all the paperwork, but even so I am inevitably going to be involved somehow. I am trying to communicate with everyone in the family as much as possible and it seems there isn't a lot of push back, but I just wanted to reach out and to see if my concerns are exaggerated or maybe something I'm overlooking as I've never had to participate in handling these things before.",05Dec2019,1
884,So I had a friend who used to live in the next street to me who became close due to us having sons the same age. We did everything together with our babies until I became pregnant and had my daughter at which point she abruptly cut off contact except for social media. I tried to stay friends but she either never replied to my messages or replied in a weird standoffish way. Anyway I started to notice that whatever I posted on social media my friend would copy . For example if I dressed my son in a blue striped T-shirt and black trousers and posted a pic of him eating cake then the next day I would log on and see a pic of her son in the almost same exact outfit also eating cake. If I posted on my stories that we had gone to a farm then two days later she and her family would be at the same farm. At first I tried to ignore it but now it’s just strange . After a year of this me and my family moved away to a new town . Two months later my ex friend is posting pics of her kids and I happen to see one and it’s in our old house. She’s moved from one street away into our old house. She’s decorated everything the same. Her sofas are the same ones we had. She’s recently messaged me saying that she’s moved (didn’t mention anything about it being our old house) and wonders how we’re doing. Do I reply? How do I respond to this?!,05Dec2019,1

I was afraid that they weren’t going to like how I looked (being a very insecure preteen at the time) and so I ended up cat fishing. After almost 2 years of friendship, they still don’t know I’m a catfish and I am very afraid to tell them. I’ve tried leaving my account however it’s hard for me because of all the people I love and enjoy talking to are on there and I don’t want to lose them.

They both do this every time we hang out and I can’t stand it anymore. Sometimes I actually want to end it all because of them. If they just run away and laugh at me I can’t cry because they will say I’m being dramatic and stop being a cry baby. I can’t talk to anyone because I don’t have any close friends beside them and if I tell them then I will lose all my friends because everyone really likes my friend.

893,"I'll try to make it as short as possible to not waste your time.

I'm currently in 9th grade and this one person that i will call ""M"" (first letter of the name) was a person i used to hang out with alot, so much so that i started becoming him more and more, making the same jokes and doing the same things he would do, this pissed of my friend group and i argued months with my friend group because of this one guy, so basically M would only hang out with me and ditch everyone else, and because of that i would ditch everyone to and i didn't understand that. Anyways in April this year my friends pressured me to stop being friends with him, and it wasn't Stockholm Syndrome or anything i started hating the kid and he kinda pissed me off with his repetitive ass jokes, anyways i decided to grow some balls and tell him i wanted to stop being mates, he got pissed of an' all that shit and it was honestly funny because nothing he said made sense and he tried to make me feel ""small"" saying how the whole of his part of town knows him... ok idgaf lol, so i stopped being friends with him and maybe like 2 months ago my other friends ""A"", ""Ma"", ""D"" all talked to ""M"" a like from time-to-time and it kinda pissed me off so one day whilst walking home from school i started asking them questions like ""what is a the difference between a friend and a acquaintance?"" and they all gave valid arguments and it made sense i never mentioned ""M"" but i noticed that ""A"" mentioned him as a acquaintance from time to time in the argument, okay sure but we hated this kid like 6 months ago and now you talk to him like TF? Yall pressured me into not talking to him and now you take the first step forward to improve relations with a guy i have PTSD with? ok... So, yesterday all is peng as usual and i hear from ""D"" that ""M"" wants to talk with us for like 5 minutes after school, ""well shit i know where this is going"" i muttered... before i say what i have to say i want to mention that ""M"" seriously changed for the better, he was kind of a c\*\*t before but now he helped us from time to time and actually wasn't so annyoing, but he stinks bruh, like he doesn't know how to shower and he fucked me over with my girl friends so many times because of him, i spent fucking 40$ for a perfume for this guy to ruin my social interactions with girls lol, anyways BACK TO STORY, he approaches us and with the utmost respect tells us how he knew what mistake he made and that he sincerely regrets it and i felt the guilt trip and he didn't even want to look me in my eyes when he was talking. But anyways we proposed to be acquaintances but not friends, he was fine with it and we shook hands and left to our cribs, next day, the guy kept following us around at school an it pissed us all off and he wouldn't stop yapping about these old ass jokes from January that me and my friend ""A"" despised because that's the reason we stopped hanging out with him, he became ""better"" but he was still as dull as my kitchen knife, and ""A"" and ""D"" argued how it was mine and ""D""s fault for telling him to be an acquaintance but i don't want to tell them it was their retarded decision to start speaking to him again because i was the only one who wasn't.... my mind tells me to grow my balls again and to tell him to f off but what for? existing? to be a bigger c\*\*t? He manipulated us like Israeli bargainers and said we would be  an acquaintances but now he literally hangs out with us like we're gang shit... i remember specifically one part where ""Ma"" said to ""M"" AND I QOUTE ""we could be acquaintances you know.... maybe friends in the future but no way know"" and ""M"" replied ""i like the sound of that , we could be friends"", but only i heard him say that because he muttered.

894,"I live in FL and have long considered getting solar panels to power my home.  Finally, a few months ago, I went ahead and pulled the trigger to order a Tesla solar system including two Powerwall backup batteries. The install was scheduled for Tuesday. The crew called me on Monday to ask if they could hop on the roof to check it out, and I said sure - I also have a smart home and could generate a guest code to let them into the garage, so they accessed the garage as well and began work.

Tuesday morning, I greeted the crew and went with one of the crew members inside to install a few pieces of equipment.  I then asked - twice - if they needed further access to the interior of the home because if not, I'd just head into work.  They told me that they did not, so I locked everything up and set the alarm.  I reminded them that I had the ability to grant access, generate guest codes, and disable the alarm remotely - so if they needed to get inside for any reason, just call or text me.

You can probably guess where this is going.

Approximately an hour later, the alarm monitoring station calls me to inform me that the alarm is going off.  I tell them I have workers on site and to stand down.  I check the status app and am surprised to see that it is the back sliding glass doors that have triggered the alarm and not the front or garage doors (like a false alarm of someone trying to get in).  I have a security camera pointed at the back sliders and review the footage.  The doors jiggle then open, then rapidly shut, finally then opening a second time as a man in a Tesla crew sweatshirt walks into my home and through the living room. The doors had definitely been locked that morning, but (tested later) the lock is flimsy and can be disengaged through the jiggling.  

I immediately call the foreman and tell him someone is in my house to which he says - ""No, they're not.""  So I tell him that I have someone on video entering and not exiting who is *still in my house* and then he says he'll call me back. I sit there kind of paralyzed and not sure what else to do while I wait. Approximately 10 minutes after the man first entered, the alarm triggers again as he exits the house.  I turn off the alarm and check the cameras and confirm that he has actually exited.  The foreman calls back to say it was an accident - the crew member had to use the bathroom and just didn't think about it because people will usually let the workers in for that.  Shortly after this conversation, my power was cut for approximately 2 hours to continue the install, so I lost my alarm and cameras.

I didn't want to get someone in trouble for a mistake and going to the bathroom of all things, but the longer I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I became.  I waited until power was back on, re-armed the alarm, and then waited until the crew was gone and the install was complete to come home.

After walking through the house, it seemed to me like access had been made more than once (it looked like two bathrooms had been used and some stuff in my bedroom looked slightly out of place, especially around my floor safe).  I called the police and filed and incident report and also reported it to Tesla.

The police said that since nothing was stolen (that I could tell), there was no crime since I'd provided access to the home (garage is part of home).

Tesla said it was an honest mistake and the guys only entered once.  They offer sincere apologies, say they will use this as a teaching moment, repeat that this should not have happened, yadda yadda corporate speak.

And that's where the request for advice comes in... I'm not really sure about this whole thing, or what's even reasonable to expect, but I did expect a little... more?  Someone broke into my house and was alone inside for \~10 minutes -- that I know of.  I feel violated and I'm feeling far less secure in my own home now.  I've bought more cameras and some bracing bars for the back sliders to make myself less of a target in the future, but I am still very unsettled.  

What do you guys think?  Should I press the cops or Tesla more or just let it go?  Just shore up my security and consider the DB Pooper home invasion a teaching moment of my own?",05Dec2019,1

898,"Hi all. I'll try to keep it brief. 

So pretty much, I work for a big company in the city I live in. I love my job, and have been here for 3 months (I'm a contractor). 

An intern was hired 1.5 months ago.
We have barely talked, but work together loosely here and there. All past interactions have been great. She's only here til next January. 

Fast forward to this week, and she and I were working at a company event together. She was eating late, and I needed a breather, so I suggested we hangout near my desk at the back. 

We talked about relationships, and eventually it moved onto my past experience with an open relationship. I learn about her openness to having sex with anyone. I stop the conversation and state that this seems inappropriate, and I feel weird talking about things. My heart is racing, and I would be lying if I didn't find her attractive. 

I mentioned I have stories, and that I was a ""hot commodity"" where I was from due to some appendage advantages I have. She asks for me to share a story, but I again say I feel wrong about it. She says she'll take it to the grave, and she'll share something about her sexually. I then share a story of one of my hookups. She then tells me her sexual secrets and kinks. We agree on a lot of things. I ask for her number. She gives it. I shoot her a hello text. She asks to see a picture of my girlfriend. Says we look cute together.

I say I'd love to talk more about this, as I am done with the event, but she needs to go back and check on things. I jokingly say ""make sure you take this to the grave, or I'll kill ya"" with a laugh. 

She gets up and goes to the event. Texts me saying there's booze in the office fridge if I want some. I already have left, but text her thanks politely, nothing flirty. 

The next day she's not at work. Odd. I text her around noon asking: ""want to grab a coffee or beer after work today or tomorrow?"" 
No reply. Didn't send anything else. 

Next day, I come into the office, and she doesn't acknowledge me. At lunch, I join a table that she's at with my other colleagues, but she promptly gets up, and a female colleague follows her. 

They are currently in a meeting room talking about things. I am so nervous I'm going to lose my job over a conversation. I hold no position of authority over her and I don't want to pursue something with her. I'm happy in my life, and love my now monogamous relationship; just felt nice being able to talk openly about sex &amp; kink to a person face to face.

900,"About a year and a half ago I rented a car from Hertz to drive down to a friends graduation. Had a good time or whatever. Going back home on the way back my friend wanted to drive the car and said that he was good to drive. At the time he went to the car to get his water bottle out of the trunk so he already had the keys in hand. I figured that he’s a good driver, (been driving way longer then me) so I let him. On the way going back home he fell asleep at the wheel and we hit a semi truck and bounced off and fell in a ditch. We had some minor cuts and bruises and were taken to the emergency room. Told the cops what happened and who was driving and we got a copy of the police report. I did have the car insurance on the vehicle as well. I followed up with Hertz almost every single day after the accident, they told me that they have their car back and everything is good I don’t have to pay anything because the car was insured (I’m thinking it’s over)

Fast forward a year later. I get a call from a recovery specialist saying that they reviewed the claim and turns out that I wasn’t driving my friend was so they are going to try to go through his insurance and if his insurance does not pay out then it falls on me. All that was in the police report so I don’t see how they would’ve missed that I wasn’t driving. Due to my friend driving it voids the insurance that I originally had on the vehicle. If my friends insurance doesn’t want to pay for it then I have to pay 10k in damages. I realized that it’s a stupid decision that I deeply regret and should’ve never made. I have to deal with it and face the consequences. The stubborn and selfish part of me is saying it’s not my fault all he had to say that he was tired and we could’ve pulled over and switched. But the rationale mature part is saying no this is on you and you should’ve had better decision making, now you have to somehow pay the debt if it comes to that. Still waiting to hear back from his insurance. I most likely feel like they won’t payout.",05Dec2019,1

So, I work in an advertising agency - and like every advertising agency, it’s a stressful, competitive, and self-esteem crushing environment. Close to 6 years in it - I’ve more or less learnt how to deal with the high pressure demands the industry brings. I’ve always had fruitful relationships with all my Creative Directors. However, my current manager is a nightmare. Since he’s joined the place, he’s had a massive issue with me working on a campaign that has been going on before he came in, while he refuses to work on it - he doesn’t like it if I give my time to it. The account is one of the agency’s most important accounts but he dislikes any time I spend on it. Also, thanks to that anything else that I work on with him - is turning out to be a challenge. He has been rejecting every idea or thought I come up with, he refuses to give constructive feedback, he’s even gone ahead and constantly rejected my copy for very simple BAU ads, completely going against directions given by clients. If I don’t get any ideas right, I’m lectured where he tells me how I’m not capable of coming up with a decent idea and he has even blamed me for the entire team not having any concrete ideas for a campaign we are pitching. (Apart from me there were 5 other creatives on the account, but he blamed me for the overall lack of ideas). I used to be a lot more vocal of my thoughts and POVs. Now I’m scared to open my mouth. I’ve never had to apologise for getting something wrong unintentionally. I used to always take feedback into account and improve my work. Now I don’t get that feedback, and i literally panic doing the simplest of jobs because I don’t want to be yelled at. 

Clearly he doesn’t enjoy working with me, with him once telling me that I should be grateful that I get to learn from him, because if he wants he can get any writer he wants from the HQ of the agency. I thought that was rather distasteful. 

I’ve been interviewing, and i should be seeing 2-3 offers being made in the next two days. While the “right” thing to do is just put in my papers, and serve my notice period quietly - I’m really uncomfortable with his attitude, and feel he needs to be called out for the unfair treatment.

The school is in a nicer area, and has 2 janitors. They ask for things from paper towels for the office or to help the office staff sort papers, materials to build benches, even construction equipment and volunteers to build. All of this wouldn't be so weird to me if they didn't have a huge school supply list which includes the usual  along with paper towels, tissues, Clorox wipes, and a chromebook (reccomended) that the teachers keep the bulk of and distribute as the year goes. Is this a thing? What happened to letting the kids keep their own school supplies?

Back to my problem, my son's class was supposed to be participating in p.e. and instead were voluntold to pick up the wet leaves with gloves that didn't fit and fill the bins then move them.

919,I want to be with this girl so bad but she doesn’t like me like that. She still wants to hangout with me as friends this weekend but she not attracted to me. I really can’t see her as just a friend but I need practice with talking to girls. Should I hangout with her and try suppress my feelings? How can I do that?? Or should I just avoid her all together? I really don’t need the emotional distraction right now. I’m so focused on self improvement and making good progress.,05Dec2019,1
921,"So I’m very good friends with this girl i’ve known since my Freshman year of high school (we’re Juniors now) and there have been points in our school careers that I would be jealous of the attention she got compared to me in the same skills and subjects. I’ve recently learned to accept myself and find my own passions despite my mental health struggles and past experiences in my life.

For context, I have been in band, jazz, vocal team and other programs for a few years now (vocal team, about one year) and she’s involved with vocal team and colorguard. It’s fine to be in a program with friends, it’s quite nice, actually. But that’s not really the big issue here.

This school year, I’ve gotten involved in a club where I’ve enjoyed the activity that the club provides for years, and I feel really welcome in that group. She’s recently joined it and signed up for the performance we have. That’s fine, just a bit weird having more people in the group.

Then, I started calling places for jobs after i would apply. When I finally got a job interview and eventually the job, she looked visibly upset when i told her. She immediately started calling everywhere and got a job soon after. Okay, Weird, but still not that bad.

Lastly, there’s a contest where a skill i’ve acquired over the years is the main focus, and I started to work on it... when she found out she started to write too. This actually kind of set me off, she doesn’t really do what the contest requires regularly.

I feel like an ass for even thinking like this, but It’s just weirding me out a bit. Should I confront her about it? And I know this is the wrong subreddit for this question, but am I being an ass?",05Dec2019,1

924,"Hello,

I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now, about 8 sessions. I have just recently googled her name, and it came up with some disturbing stuff. Apparently this person in her younger days ran a... i guess life-improvement programs where it is said that she took thousands of dollars from people. Made them work for her without compensation. Building structure on her property.

The lawsuit is public, and she attempted a counter-sue for defamation, but eventually settled. There is some other disturbing stuff on her. Apparently she was a guru during a camp for adults. At this camp, nicknamed camp hell, people had their phones, credit cards and the lot taken from them, and where made to be sleep deprived. then subjected to pornography. this sounds like an unethical study. reports say that of the 80 people in the room half looked like zombies from sleep deprivation, and the other half where just crying. They where also made to strip naked and scrutinize each-other images.

This is the confusing part. The reports clearly use my therapist name, but the girl that accused her of cult-like behavior, had lead a lawsuit. Mentions that she was called a 'Human Fuck Up' by this woman, however in one of my early therapy sessions. She said that someone vilified her, and called her a 'Human fuck-up'. I believe this was an attempt to be the victim, because at first glance of articles without reading you can confuse her as the victim. There is a whole webpage dedicated to her past cult activities.

I get the vibe that she is really manipulative now, and do not want her as a therapist, she has a phd in clinical psychology. The last session i had with her yesterday was very strange. She had me listening to meditation videos to end it off with a quick 10 meditation, usually it is 5 mins. Half way through the meditation the audio added in irregular beats that sounded like footsteps for some reason. BTW her entire therapy session is centered around mindfulness.

My brother senses a vibe that given her early days, and the camp hell she has been implicated in. The is a very subtle theme of mind-control in her actions. according to other reports, people have said she has likened herself to Jesus. believes youthfulness comes with intelligence, etc. very idiosyncratic beliefs. She currently is working with two other professors on a project about academic stress and it's affects on DNA repair and destruction, telomeres etc. I'm not quite adept in that field, but I did study some human biology. 

I studied for a bit at a university where i left due to finances, however my records may indicate that i left because of academic stress. I by no means was stressed by study, but by finances. I was referred to a mental health practice for a 'interview'. After the interview process you then get assigned a psychologist. However she selected me to interview, even mentioned it. then after the interview said, I would like to work with you. I feel selected by her. After analyzing this, could it be possible that, I'm part of a study conducted by her.

If I have been selected for an study that is unethical in nature, it would make sense as to why it seems secret. I do also believe my government would pull off stuff like this, unless it is systematic, and just appears that way. Either way my brother mentioned she has my reports, write them. It is scary to know that given the type of person she is. She has a private practice in every state. I don't know what I'm asking here. I know that the best thing to do with leave her, but I'm just curious if anyone else has an opinion on this situation.",05Dec2019,1
925,"This is something I really struggle with.

I work as a therapist in a counseling service. The last few days I’ve been feeling unwell - I had a chest infection a few weeks ago and it feels like it never really cleared up or it’s come back.

926,"I have a passion for digital art I've decided to start an Instagram account (I already had one but it's crap so I'll make a new one) and I really want to focus on the overall aesthetic look of it all, like a portfolio sort of.

In my old account the main issue was that my style of coloring and sometimes even drawing itself changed a lot based on mood, or at least my color schemes did and sometimes I would go all out with super bright lighting, sometimes there would be barely any light but the colors would be super saturated - etc.

Does anybody know a way I could make this work aesthetically to have a profile with some sort of continuity (for lack of a better word)?

927,"Alright so I recently crashed the car because I hydroplaned, ngl it was kind of my fault I was going a little too fast. It was $1700 in damages I paid for the whole thing and now they do not trust that I will drive safely in the future. I am a faster driver but I’ve learned my lesson it’s just I don’t know how to get that message across to them I know what I’ve done wrong and I understand how I have to drive in the future if I want to keep driving, the problem is that they don’t trust me. They’ve explained to me that I have to prove to them that I can drive safely in good and bad weather conditions but it’s so easy to fake that with ur parents so what is going to really convince them? The reason this is a real problem is because I need the car to get to work, I work 36 hour weeks and I can’t afford to UBER to and from work. My parents are unenthusiastic about driving me as well. For example if I were to Uber everyday to and from work I would spend 70% of my monthly earnings on transportation alone. Even if I only UBERed half of the days I would spend 35% of my monthly earnings which is ridiculous considering I’m taking a gap year trying to save for college. I’ve tried approaching this from every angle I proposed putting a tracker in the car that could track every single movement I do (how fast I’m going, where and when I am speeding, how fast I accelerate, decelerate,  basically any and all statistics you could think of) but they said that it’s not that same as being in the car ensuring I’m driving safe. I mean if I’m following all the traffic laws which they can check I fail to see how that is not driving safe and in bad weather conditions I do the same thing just slower. I’m trying to handle this like an adult as I am one now but I’m at a point where I feel like the only way to get across to them is to do something highly irrational to grab their attention because I don’t feel like they understand how important it is for me to save money.",05Dec2019,1
928,"So I've had a rough past but I've realized that could make me a really good police officer in ways. I'm street smart, I know how to identify sketchy stuff, I'd be a good judge of character in handling situations, I'm rough around the edges, and I'd actually care about the betterment of people in jail and prison. I'm a women but I'm 5""9 1/2 and jacked. I have a low voice. I feel like I could be taken more seriously in that sense too and could protect myself better.

I got three misdemeanors for trespassing which all got dismissed or maybe I spent one day in jail for one. Then once I got caught for a misdemeanor larceny of a pair of sunglasses at Walmart and I spent a month in jail and then it got dismissed but I was banned from all Walmarts forever.

930," So my prof just yelled at me for going to him during his office hours, his door was a bit open, as it usually is for all professors when they have office hours. I knocked and he wasn’t answering so I figured he must’ve gone somewhere quickly and will come back soon. Now, I waited for 10 minutes and it was 1:40 ish now but his office and my lab at 2pm are completely on opposite sides of the campus so I didn’t have that much time left. I knock again, nothing. I slightly opened his door and realized he was with noise cancelling headphones working on some document. So I say Dr. \_\_\_, loudly nothing. I knock again louder, nothing. Knowing how noise canceling headphones work and having them myself I figure it’s better if he sees me since I don’t wanna yell in this quiet hallway where other profs are working. So I start walking in and he sees me from his peripheral vision and he yells “OH MY GOD YOU SCARED ME” and he’s a funny prof, in class he’s sarcastic, so I figured he was joking a bit so I try not to laugh and say “Sorry I’m so sorry I knocked-“ then he says “NO NO ITS NOT FUNNY THIS IS NOT OKAY HOW DARE YOU YOU NEVER DO THAT” etc. At this point I’m confused then by the end of his rant I’m angry because he didn’t need to keep yelling for so long. When he finally stops I say “sorry I saw online your office hours were till 2 and I saw you were with noise canceling headphones so I knew you woudn’t hear-“ “WELL YOU SHOULD USED YOUR **VOICE** YOU SHOULDA **YELLED”** now I’m questioning everything because, why would you ever yell at a prof? it’s a lose lose situation if I yelled, he woulda yelled at me for yelling at him, if I didn’t yell he still woulda yelled at me. Then he says what do you want, I ask my question about this assignment due tomorrow he looks at me like I’m dumb explains it and sarcastically, still annoyed, says “ well it’s in the email why didn’t you read it, you should check it” Then as I’m leaving, this time in a normal voice tells me to never do that again. Now I’m worried because I’ve been to his office quite a few times before, and we were on good terms, I thought we had a pretty good relationship, he knows who I am and because of this, for the assignment, I’m scared he might lower my grade, or for the final exam too because I know now I’m definitely on his bad side.",05Dec2019,1

936,"Hello, I'm a 20-year-old college student that has been looking to go into therapy for many years. All of my siblings were diagnosed with ADHD, or ADD, two of which have BPD. Depression runs on my father's side of the family eventually leading my uncle to suicide. Ever since I was young my parents kept it quiet. I've always felt like there was an emotional disconnect or something didn't feel right inside, I have a generally good life so when I'm trying to do work and I feel sick to my stomach trying to continue, never sticking to one thing, and having periods of feeling complete numbness and guilt for no reason made me start to question my parents.

I was a smart kid in school but was never organized and as I got older I became more forgetful and often just didn't do my work. I could never finish cleaning my room. I try coping mechanisms to stay clean and on task but sometimes it just feels nice to talk to someone about it without them calling you lazy and sheltered. I'm not self-diagnosing but I've tried to talk to my religious mother about going to therapy when I was 18 and she broke into angry tears and started yelling about how ""They'll put you in a crazy house, you'll never become a doctor, all they'll do is drug you up and label you"" So in order to get her to talk to me again I didn't go.  Also, I've become so mindless when I'm stressed to the point of me not noticing I was shaking an open bottle of juice forgetting that I just opened it. Im constantly losing everything and my mind goes blank mid-sentence. My sex life, social, and school life is under so much stress.

I'm very fortunate for my Dad's insurance bringing the copay down to $15, not everyone can afford something like that. Why let it go to waste?

I made an appointment today for next week. I'm excited for it, but I'm afraid it will cost my father more, is that possible even if I'm paying the copays? I wonder if he'll see it on a bill.

Hey r/advice!

So, I (F16) am the daughter of an alcoholic. My mum has been drinking for as long as I can remember and only ""stopped"" recently. In 2016 she was hospitalized due to the years of alcohol abuse and was in critical condition, she only just survived - I was 12 years old. My family and I are always suspicious of her when she acts odd (e.g. walking strange, acting sillier than usual, slurring speech etc.) but she is on antidepressants which has made us wary of confronting her about it. 

About 3 years ago, my dad did confront her on it and it turned out he was right. My mum promptly threatened divorce, said she would take my brother and I away from him and even falsely accused him of assaulting her during an argument. She can be so so manipulative and selfish, she is borderline narcissistic. 

Tonight was my brother's 20th birthday and she was acting drunk (ish) once again and I really don't know what to do. It could be a number of things like antidepressants, the menopause or her type 2 diabetes. My brother and dad both agreed that she seemed off but my dad doesn't want to be made homeless if another argument breaks out and my brother doesn't want to instigate anything.

953,"Hi. Sorry for this post but I'm stuck at the moment.

I'm currently doing a course in social sciences at college in Scotland, and I'm miserable doing it. I never wanted to do it in the first place, and only chose to because I knew I had to do something after reaching the age of 18 and leaving school. I want to drop the course, but I'm afraid of what happens if I do. I've never been academically skilled and I find it hard to really care enough to do the work I'm provided, so failure of the course is pretty likely.

If I drop this course, I'll have to get a job. I know I sound like a piece of shit when I say this, but I don't want to get a job. I know for a fact that, after you reach 18, life gets kinda shitty for the most part, and any job that I can see looks shitty. I can't understand why anybody my age *wants* to get a job. Whenever I tell anybody about my sort of pessimistic view of the future, I'm hit back with ""well we all have to do things we hate"". I just don't see the point in any of it. Why bother living if you're constantly doing things you hate out of necessity? Why not just kill yourself if that's the case?

Sorry, I'm rambling. The thing is, I don't know if I *should* drop the course I'm doing. I'm very much a lazy person - if it were up to me I would just sit around on my computer and sleep all day. That's what my mother tells me, and she warns that she'll be ""very disappointed"" in me if I quit the college course.

I'm sorry I sound like a whiny little bitch who just needs to ""get on with it."" I just find it hard to *want* to get on with it.

954,"I need some help. I (now 24F) met a man online when I was around 16 years old. I was in a chat room with my friends where we were video and random strangers could come into the chat. 

 We got messages from random people and just did stupid things. It was not of sexual nature. We kind of just did whatever we wanted bc our parents were all really busy. So this guy takes an interest in me but I know literally nothing about him. It just felt so good to have someone think I was special. He was not on video, just through chat. He wouldn’t even tell me his name but I really enjoyed talking to him. I gave him my tumblr because he made me feel special and I wanted to keep talking to him. 

Fast forward and we have been talking. He knows my identity from Tumblr but I don’t know his. He refuses to tell me and I ask him to stop messaging me since he won’t tell. He agrees and we stop talking for a few months. 

Then he pops up out of nowhere every once in a while saying he is worried about me and hopes I’m doing well. I honestly had no one else expressing concern about me in my life so I loved it. We ended up talking a lot and getting a lot closer. Some of it was sexual but mostly it was just talking. At this point I know his full name and where he lives/works. He’s 37 so he was obviously an adult while we were talking. He is married with children. Obviously his wife doesn’t know. 

We then started getting really close when I was between the ages of 20-22ish.  We eventually had a “relationship” of sorts online and through phone/text/facetime. We became incredibly close and codependent. We talked every second of everyday. At this point I had stopped talking to my family for unrelated reasons bc of a rough childhood. He became my family honestly. He was there and provided emotional support when no one else did. So I had incredibly strong feelings for him but resented him for having a wife and kids. 

We stopped talking when I was 22. It’s been 2 years and he has kept reaching out every once in a while to tell me how much he cares. I normally ignore him but this week I answered and we talked today. It made me feel so weird. And I care about him but I feel so angry when I talk to him because he met me in some random chat room when I was 16 and that feels so predatory. And he is married with kids. 

Can someone help me find a way to address this situation? Or has anyone been in a similar situation? 

TLDR: met a man online when I was 16 and he was ~30. He provided emotional support no one else in my life was giving me. He told me he was married after I was already attached. Now years later I need help.",05Dec2019,1
955,"My gf previously worked at a place where she liked the job but HATED her manager. This was compounded by the nearly hour long commute. She stuck it out for about a year then got a similar job at a different location. Place is closer to the house AND she seems to get along with everyone there (boss included.) I was overjoyed when she got the new job and got the fuck outta the dogshit work situation she had been in.

Then I found out that one of my GF’s coworkers at new job is a dude that sexually assaulted a girl (let’s call her T) that I’ve known for about a decade. T is married to one of my best friends. GF and I went to their wedding, it was beautiful and we love them. 

T was sexually assaulted by GF’s coworker(C) maybe 7 years ago or so after high school. C gave T chlamydia and blamed her for the assault. The classic “It’s your fault that I raped you and gave you chlamydia!” defense. T told C’s gf at the time to get tested bc her bf IS A GODDAMN RAPIST WITH CHLAMYDIA. C’s gf went straight into denial mode and C told his gf that T gave him chlamydia and it’s “her fault.” C’s gf wised up and left not too long after all that. That was the last I heard about C until I was visiting my GF at her new job and I saw him. 

I went to middle school and high school with C. I was friendly with him for most of that time. We never really hung out but we got along just fine at school. He always seemed like a pretty cool dude. He was/is a very smooth and charismatic person. Which in hindsight, probably worked to his advantage.

What proof do I have if the assault? Other than the testimony of a good friend I had known for years that genuinely had no reason to lie about that? T showed me convos of C threatening her with things like
“Don’t tell anybody about this.” 
“You wanted it.”
“I know cops, they won’t believe you, don’t bother.”
This was years ago so those may not have been the exact words but that was the gist of it. 
I think C actually does have some family connections in local law enforcement and that may be part of why T never reported the assault.

My GF is an abuse/sexual assault survivor. So I feel like it’s something she should know but at the same time, I don’t want her to begin to fear/hate the new job. Especially since she seems to really like working there and gets along with everyone, including C. It’s a public place with a lot of people around constantly and GF doesn’t work alone with C. So I don’t think there’s any chance he could assault my GF. Additionally, C thinks that he and I are friends so maybe that would be a deterrent for him?? I’m really not sure what to do. GF has been at new job for a few months and I love hearing her talk about loving her new job/coworkers. Advice?",05Dec2019,1
956,"I work night shift in a very hard job and walk to work. My employers sent representatives to enroll us in healthcare coverage for the year 2020, yet only during the hours that I'm sleeping. Going to see these representatives would add three entire trips back and forth to work (totaling three hours) and the enrollment itself takes quite a bit of time as it is. Additionally, we are to wait for our turn, so who knows how long I'd be screwing myself for.  


I've just received an email stating that the open enrollment period for the years 2019/2020 has ended and I must now sign a form stating that I hereby waive all coverage from my employers.   


I've looked everywhere online, yet anywhere I look it states that the open enrollment period ends on December 15th, 2019. What the hell? Is there anything I can do?

957,"I’m writing this one hour before my shift so I apologize if it sounds weird. 

I’ve been working at this place for almost 4 years, they basically took me in at 18, fresh out of foster care, no job experience, no food or wine knowledge..  at a popular fine dining restaurant in a busy city.. I was so shocked to get this job and I have grown and learned so much and they tell me this all the time...

I have gotten very drunk once before work (20) and came in awfully intoxicated... they told me to take a long walk and come back and said they *should* be firing me, but instead, they want to give me one chance to show them I’ll change and never do this again. I was extremely grateful and I have an amazing position now, great hours and great pay. 

Fast forward to Monday evening.. (22yrs old) 
I come in, it’s painfully slow. The slowest I have ever worked and I was extremely bored. 
One of the bartenders offered me a shot in which turned to three... on an empty stomach... and then a small black out, then I come back to life an hour or two later. I don’t think I was *that* bad but it was obvious I was intoxicated. A manager and a couple of coworkers knew what was up.. I finished my
shift and clocked out and I’ve had my two days off since. 
I’m going into work today and I have a feeling I’m going to get fired (I don’t deserve to stay and I know this.) 
But I’m so scared to not have this job anymore and I’m sick to my stomach thinking about having “the talk”. I want to walk in to work today and tell my general manager that my grandpa is passing away... he has already passed but I’m hoping that will open the door to a better outcome... maybe they won’t fire me because they pity me... maybe they will fire me  no matter what... I think it’s worth the try but my conscience is also telling me this is a horrible idea and I should just own up to it. I’m so comfortable here and this job and have many people who have cared for me and helped me become the adult I somewhat am, today. I don’t want to start new... I want to be forgiven again but I  don’t think it’s going to happen this time..",05Dec2019,1
958,"  Dear redditors - be it female, male or whatever you identify as,

 I am a 29 years old male. As the title already says, my wife's perineum had to be cut during birth of our first child due to complications. It has been 15 months since birth and she is still very insecure about / frightened about having sex, because she will have pain in the area of the cut shortly after penetration starts. It's an internal pain inside the vagina that - as she explains it - kind of feels like a bruise that you get after you bump into something with your arm or leg. The pain gets worse the longer sex lasts.  She fears that this pain will never go away and she won't be able to enjoy sex anymore. 

Her sex drive was very dormant after birth, like it is for many women. By now it is almost back to normal though. She tells me she is actually craving intimate moments with me pretty regularly but is afraid of the pain that comes with the sex. I supported her all the way through pregnancy and the 15 months since birth + continuing to do so. I already told her it's absolutely fine if we stop having 'real' sex for the time being and enjoy the rest of the package. She says that she doesn't want that either, as she also wants more, like I said.  

Her gynecologist had a look at the scar some months ago and told her the wound healing went as expected and there is nothing unusual to see. Since that day there hasn't been any significant changes for my wife, regarding that matter. She is somewhat desperate and doesn't really know what to do or who to talk to about it so I decided to do what the modern man does nowadays - create a post in /Advice to get some diverse opinions and testimonies about a rather sensitive topic. 

So do you guys have any experience with this kind of issue after birth? Do you know anyone who had or still has problems like that? Was there a solution? Is there any ways to further train/heal the muscles down there by herself? etc.  Thank you all very much in advance, I am really looking forward to your replies! :)  

  
TL;DR: My wife was cut at the perineum during childbirth. Now 15 monts after birth she still has internal pressure pain in her vagina during intercourse, which gets stronger the longer the penetration lasts. Gynecologist says everything healed appropriately. Wife doesn't know what to do - any advice?",05Dec2019,1

So basically my period is late (2 days) , and I’ve had some dizziness and nausea, did a pregnancy test today  and it was negative, but it’s very strange as I don’t feel like I’m going to get my period, none of the usual symptoms, my period is usually very regular and prompt, no unusual stress this month either, so it’s not stress.

But the first time we hung out he took his time, he constantly asked if I was okay with what he was doing, as he should, and sometimes still does.. But..

So I recently made the decision to move to a different school from my four year college. I have two options for living since I cannot afford an apartment at the moment. I am currently trying to find a job so that I can get my own place and not have to worry.

Option #1: My grandmother at her duplex. Live is really rough with my family right now so I am worried about what might go down. She also smokes in the house which I hate and theres not even a shower head there. (Landlords wont let them install one) But my brothers and granmother live there and I'd get my own room.

Option #2: With my boyfriend and best friend. They have a lovely home and their family has accepted me fully. I just wont have enough room for all of my things and I would share a room with my best friend and their sister (which I'm okay with, I just wish I could have my things) I dont have a lot of things as it is, and my boyfriend is really excited and wants me to move in I'm just scared that I'll lose my things.

 I know I can always leave some at my grandmothers but I will never know what they do with my things.  I've had to let go of a lot in my life and I'm tired of it, but I know its going to be like this until I get my own place. Any advice or thoughts are greatly appreciated!",05Dec2019,1

When it's busy and there are a lot of people, I get nervous.

As I am cleaning the dining area and customers are looking at me, it makes me uncomfortable. I worry that they can tell that I am nervous and judge me for it or that I look unapproachable.

I was at the laundromat recently doing some laundry, and as I was folding my clothes, a few people were just sitting down watching me fold my clothes. It made me uncomfortable.

Even when I am at home cooking. I don't like people watching me cook, because it makes me nervous and it affects my cooking.

I’ll give y’all some backstory to this. Me and my ex were in 9th grade when she told me that a friend of mine had sent her a random dick pic. So of course I get upset go to school the next day and try to fight him. He doesn’t wanna fight but this other guy he was with was talking smack so me and him fought instead. I lost and the whole school dragged my name in the mud for a couple weeks. Keep in mind I had a super small school at the time, like less than 800 kids, so the video of me fighting him was being passed around and talked about. Only guy teased me about the fight to my face which I didn’t even care. I do care what people think but I just acted like it ain’t affect me but it did on the inside. While everyone was still talking crap on me, my girl at the time dumped me too (in the beginning of the school day) and started dating this guy in the next couple days so I knew she left me for him and I knew her and him talked before we broke up because we had an argument about it while we were together still. So fast forward to a few minutes ago and I checked her profile on Instagram for the first time in months (big mistake). I look in her bio and she has the initials of the dude, she said sent her a random dick pic, with a heart. This crushed me and I just thought maybe I should message and ask for an explanation but I feel like if I do that it’s just gonna be like a second heart break.

970,"Hi, I used to know this guy by the name of Keegan.

How do we go about the situation, I was hoping to rid of him from the platform, I’d got his other account removed before but he just made a different one. I know you have to have proof and such and either way nothing really happens regardless unless child pornography is found and or an attempt to visit the underage girls, but last I talked to him he was grooming a girl who was 13 and he’s about 20 maybe 21 now.

994,Hey I’m m(19) and I have been more depressed lately thinking about past friendships. 2 people specifically well I’ll call one Sammy and one Amanda well we were best friends we did everything together and well I had a crush on Sammy back when we were friends and she knew but nothing could come from it because she was leaving for a long time and also she didn’t feel the same way. But despite that I drove her all the way to where she needed to be and that was the last time I had seen her for like 1 year and a half and Amanda had to go back to school and we just didn’t see each other or really talk anymore. But about 20 min ago they called me and asked to hang out tonight. I want to but I’m nervous they won’t like me anymore. What do I do?

998,"Okay so this is most likely going to sound sound a bit, if not very, selfish. And also bit of a long story.

I met this guy online in spring. We immediately hit it off, we talked daily for a few weeks. Literally everything was great. We also talked in voice chat, played some games togeher. He has the most adorable voice ever, no joke. At one point he decided to come over to meet me. I lived an hour drive avay back then. We spent the whole evening together, talking, drove an hour just to get cocoa. In my opinion it went alright. Not great, but alright. He was nervous, I was nervous. Oh and I definitely would have slept with him, if it hadn't been that time of the month.. but yeah, sent him home, even though I really wanted him te spend the night, even for just cuddles.. So after that he almost ghosted me. Took hours to answer, when at first he got worried when I was away from my phone for over 20minutes. At some point he straight up disappeared for days at a time. And when I asked him what's going on, he just said he was busy at work or something like that. Huh.. had time to talk to me at work before, but not then. Soooo eventually he told me he met someone else who he felt comfortable with (said he has difficulties to open up to people). But before telling that to me, I basically poured my heart out, told him he is pretty much the ideal person for me, even though I have set my standards unreasonably high. Sent him a truckload of long messages that I have already forgotten about. One thing I do remember though, is the fact that I told him I wish I was the one who made him happy. But deep down I actually was a bit happy (jealous too, of course) that he found someone who suited him. So few months go by, I start to get over him. Can't remember how, but we started talking again. This time it was mostly just dirty jokes, memes and me asking about when can I see him again. (Because gosh darn it he looks like the most perfect human being ever and I could stare at his face forever and not get tired of his face).. But i think it took like two months or something until he finally came over. Oh and he was a bit tipsy so could have been that. So, he came over, went straight to bed (it was like 2 at night), I took a quick shower and cuddled up next to him. Ugh if only I could describe what I felt at that moment. Just the sheer joy and happiness of him laying next to me, hugging me. And well, both had been drinking so I think I dont have to say what happened next. So in the morning we woke up, talked like 2-3 sentences and them he said he had to go home, so I hugged and kissed him goodbye. That was over a month ago. After that he slowly disappeared again.
Now.. I know a lot of you think ""fuckboy!!"".. but I feel in my heart that he is actually a good human being. I mean he has a dirty mind, but hey, so do I and I'm pretty sure that I am not a slut because of that.

Also note that I have been told by many people that I should get over him, find someone new, forget him, block him, or whatever. No. I'd rather live alone for the rest of my life than forget him. He is just perfect, okay. And what I want most in the world right now is to be there for him, because for some reason I feel like he needs support. Don't we all though.. But like he said, he has difficulties opening up to people, so I think that there might be something weighing him down, and I just want to lighten the load for him. Or is that too much to ask?

So my question for advice is the following: how do I get someone to open up to me, if he ignores me 99% of the time?

And yes, I know this is a pretty shitty situation, and that most likely he has zero interest in me, but I am not going to give up so easily. I don't care how long or what it takes, right now he is the person I care about the absolute most, and I just wish he would acknowlage that.

Took me a while to write this, so there might be some missing parts to the story. Also if anything is confusing, I can of course explain further.",05Dec2019,1
999,"A tale about betrayal, crushes, suicide, and the biggest mental breakdown of my life. This was originally posted on r/teenagers on another alt acc of mine I forgot the password too i need advice.

Ok hi. I made this on a throwaway account because people usually like to stalk my reddit account and this story contains details I don’t want them to know. I thought this was an interesting story to share and Yeah here u go. So this all starts in 2017 I was a happy child oblivious to the real world. A girl named... what should we call her... fuck it Ayana. Ayana was the cutest girl in the grade and me with no standards and no crush was lookin around the room when my brain said “you like Ayana now” I was like “ no” but I kept fighting the urge all day to start liking her.  Then I had a dream we went on a date and the building set on fire. Which now in hindsight seems like foreshadowing... but anyways that convinced me for some reason to like her. I spent the whole year crushing on her and it was OBVIOUS because I would stare at her constantly but not like creepily. She seemed to never notice but I guess that was me being blinded by “love”. The awkward I child was didn’t talk to her until around March 2018 when I just started talking by accident she laughed and we kept talking. Eventually we became really good friends. We had so many inside jokes it was insane. Since I liked her I stupidly wanted to tell her. One of my friends said write that you loved her since u were three! Which was the worst idea and I did it like the fucking autistic gorilla I was. This aquatance of mine pointed the letter out to her that I slid into her locker. Apparently one of my friends said she needs a break from me for two weeks. I was devastated not only did she not like me but I lost a friend a funny nice friend. The two weeks turned into two months and two months turned into 5. At this time we had to ride the bus now to school as the location changed for different reasons that are not important. She was at the bus stop first day new year. Not a single word spoken to me not on the bus or anything.  This was a little weird and added to my sense of worthlessness. At the same time I was uh questioning my sexuality and I didn’t want to be pansexual. I thought people would hate me for it. So I opressed that by trying to reconnect with her I thought that would straighten me out. I dmed her “ I want to date you” I know so far I have been the one at fault here obviously she doesn’t want to speak I get it. She never responds but she has seen it. I delete it and forget about. Later on I accept my sexuality and go to my schools GSA to embrace it. Guess who’s there good old Ayana. Ayana heard me say “I am the most gay thing on earth” I was joking and ended it with “but on earth I mean PANgea because I’m pan”. I guess she didn’t hear that and she got pissed. Later on I forgot about this and then found out that she was outing me to people. Telling people I stare at her ass and I’m gay. First off no. For both of those things. But it’s not even her place to tell people. So people start looking at me weird. It has now been 1 year since Ayana has talked to me. The whole world seemed against me I didn’t want to continue fighting back. One day in April of 2019 I attempted suicide turns out the belt I was using was not very hefty and it snapped I survived and I’m glad I did. At this point this whole situation has gone to far I need to get clarity so my friend helps me write a dm to her. Here it is “Ok Ayana I have moved on. I have moved on from this whole letter thing. I didn’t want to send a letter I was pressured into it. And the second time I was trying to deny myself the fact I am-never mind you know. Which I have put so much mental energy and time into this. It has given me genuine anxiety thinking any day you can say one sentence and destroy my life. Which you have already done. One of my friends heard you talk about how I was a creep and I sent you a letter to a group of kids. Which isn’t cool. I have huge issues with my mental image. Which is affected by rumors spread about me. I don’t want this to seem like a threat. I just want you to know that you give me anxiety. I don’t want you to tell anyone about this. I won’t do anything. I just want a reply.” I came off as a dick in this in retrospect but I mean she made me try to kill myself. The response shows how much of a cunt a human can be Ayana said this “ What’s not cool is causing me anxiety, stress and panic attacks because of you fake feelings. You can have your issues but you can’t get random people involved, and you can’t say that you want to date someone one day and the next day that you’re “the gayest thing in the world”. You’re not the only one with mental health issues; some days I feel worthless and want to kill myself but I can’t do that to the people in my life. You trying to dm me and when I see you looking at me doesn’t help with my stress or depression. Saying that you’ve liked me since we were three is creepy and how do I know that you haven’t done creepy stuff just to help with your mental health. Also your friends haven’t exactly kept the whole thing a secret, I’ve heard them talking about it with others and around lots of people. I’ll stop talking about this with anyone but I’m not going to respond to any more of your shit so please stay away and don’t try to talk to me.” TLDR she’s saying that I’m causing her panic attacks, depression, anxiety, and stress. From fucking “faking feelings”. Why would she care if she didn’t like me? What affect mentally would it have? You get it I’m not really going to dive. Into what this all means and rant on about it. So this took a huge toll on my mentally thinking I caused someone this much pain. I mean I did look at her sometimes which I have no verification for doing I am just a teenage boy what the fuck am I supposed to do? Sorry anyways I have ADHD so I space out a lot causing me to stare at people when I’m thinking about something else.  She has me blocked on everything. I can’t contact her to have a “final standoff” of sorts finishing this whole thing. She still tells people about it. I know. But after this I still find her cute and I want to befriend her again. Even though she’s a huge cunt. Why?!!! I hate her so much yet I want to talk to her.  I don’t know why. Should I finally contact her what are your thoughts?",05Dec2019,1
1000,"So this christmas I was planning on getting a promise ring for my girlfriend of a bit over 14 months now. The only issue is that we both agreed that we would not spend over $50 dollars on gifts for one another since we're both broke college students, and I've already bought a few gifts, leaving me with only 20 bucks to get the promise ring. My question is if it's worth getting the promise ring if it's only worth $20. I know that she really wouldn't care about the price tag but I just feel that for something like that I'd want to give her something really nice and not cheaply made. I could just just go over our budget for the ring but truthfully I'm just barely making the cut to be able to get these gifts. Is it also too soon to be getting her a promise ring? I'm 19 and she's 18, but I can definitely see a future with her for the rest of my life and she's told me the same. Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated!",05Dec2019,1
1001,"So as a little background I (25f) work at a bar and there’s a guy who comes in every so often (24m) and was always really flirty. A few months ago we met up for a drink and ended up hooking up. He kept saying he wanted to hang out with me but then would never set a day or time  so I just kinda figured he wasn’t serious and didn’t really care because I wasn’t that into him anyway. But then last week he sent me a long message about how he was sorry for being so flakey and really did want to meet up and I thought I’d give him a chance. I was a little hesitant to do so because he had given off some major player vibes to me but I kinda thought that I had fun with him last time and he seemed like a nice dude so I should. We met up for a drink and everything was fine, and he drove me home, and asked to come in for a second and I agreed. But then he started getting really handsy, ignored me when I said I was tired and just wanted to go to bed and asked me why I wasn’t down to have sex. I told him that I just wasn’t feeling it right now and he went ballistic. Told me I had lied to him somehow because since I had hooked up with him before it’s what he expected and that I had “put myself into the category of being just someone to fuck” and it was unfair of me to expect to be treated as anything else. He then said that I was probably single still because I was a slut and he’d never date anyone who hooked up on the first date and a liar for pretending to be tired and stormed out. I’m just really shook up still because I’ve never been treated like that, I guess I’m asking if anyone has had anything similar happen to them and what they did to stop being so upset over it, because right now I’m still pretty hurt.

We are all adults.

I usually played video games with him and his gf every night for the past year(when he introduced her to our friend group) His gf lives in a different state so she hasn't met us irl.

Her and i have become pretty good friends since we met.

After i stopped talking to him, his gf messaged me saying to ask her if i ever want to play some games. I did that the next day and we played for a little bit.

Her bf got mad and started sending her a bunch of messages telling her off.

A couple days later i asked her again if she wanted to play, unless he would be mad again. She said she would but then a bit later she said nevermind because i guess it made him upset.

I apologized if I caused an argument between them and just said message me if she ever wanted to play some games and he won't get mad. She told me it was fine and that she doesn't blame me.

She has also messaged me a lot since i stopped talking to him just making conversation about stuff, but now she has stopped.


A couple days after, her bf messaged me apologizing to me saying that i shouldn't have to apologize to her and that he is sorry for how he acts, so I'm assuming she told him that i apologized and feels bad. I've heard this type of stuff from him before though in all of the years i have known him and he never actually seemed to learn from it.

Why do i feel so bad about everything though? I feel like i crossed a line and caused an argument between them, and just made things weird.",05Dec2019,1

I'm very introverted, I have really bad social anxiety, I'm really awkward, not very easy to talk to and I appear very insecure. I'm applying for colleges and with that comes interviews. Because of my social anxiety which is multiplied HEAVELY in that sort of situation, my doctor prescribed me xanax. 0.25 mg, that I take once before the interview/audition. I love how it makes me behave. It doesn't change me, it's just that the person I am when I'm alone, the person that I am inside my head, finally comes out. When I take a xanax I'm confident, know how to hold a conversation, I make jokes,... I really like the person that I am when I take it. The same goes for alcohol. The thing is that I AM that person. I know I have it in me. I feel like that's the real me but I can't express it for some reason. I know the dangers of these kind of prescription drugs and alcohol, and I very rarely use them.

The only thing that makes the dry heaves stop is breathing through my mouth and I don't wanna have to do that all the time.

Anyway, what should I do?",05Dec2019,1
1028,"so, my wife walks around the house and lets them rip all day long and sometimes she does it in my face. when I get grossed out or start coughing due to the smell she produced, she thinks its hilarious. I can't get it up anymore because she has ruined everything sexual about her. Is she trying to tell me she doesn't want the sex?",05Dec2019,1
1029,"Sorry, it's a long setup. (TLDR at bottom) 

I [26F] have been with my current company for four years in various capacities. For 2020 I am moving into a new position in that I haven't held this job before and they're sort of altering it to better suit my interests. They've added a couple of responsibilities for me that the other people in the same position don't have. While these responsibilities have been taken away from other people, they are things that no one else wants or has time to do. Sounds like a win-win situation. 

When I spoke with my supervisor [F] about this position, she told me that my current hourly rate would stay the same. They said that my rate is higher than my coworkers' because I will have more responsibilities than they do. Made sense, I verbally agreed to accept the position at this rate. 

Unfortunately, I discovered through casual conversation with my coworkers that I have actually been offered $1/hr less than what they are all making. I will add that I will be the only female in the entire department and $1/hr is a big deal where I work. So obviously I feel betrayed and disrespected. 

After speaking with a higher manager[F], she suggested I speak with the supervisor about the issue directly then follow up with her.  Perhaps it's a misunderstanding or something has changed? I did not mention anything about this possibly being gender discrimination. 

I spoke with the supervisor and it did not go well. She passive aggressively fed me a bunch of information about how I am making more than them and she can't confirm other people's rates to me (which I understand is true) and how she defended my higher rate to the board for approval. Again, I didn't mention gender but this time because I was seeing so much red I barely made it out of there. 

Tomorrow I go back to speak to the higher manager and I'm afraid I'm going to get backed into a corner. How do I approach this from here? Dare I mention that this feels like sexism? 

TLDR: My[26F] supervisor[F] might have offered me less money to do more work because I'm a woman. I haven't had the nerve to mention that I think it's sexism but when I spoke to them about the wage discrepancy they passive aggressively fed me more lies.",05Dec2019,1
1030,"As my title indicates, there are raccoons in my attic. I don’t own the home of the apartment which my family (and now raccoon den) rents. My landlord is a total scumbag all around. Runs to Vegas routinely to gamble the rent money he collects from his tenants. Meanwhile he does no maintenance or repairs. We’ve had parts of our ceiling outright collapse in the past and he does not blink an eye. Well. One day, our ceiling did collapse and a small hole appeared looking straight up into our attic. One day, before repairs, we were all sitting quietly when KABLAM! A baby raccoon comes barreling down into the room, clinging to a lamp. We called the NYPD after it charged toward my dad who had to kind of beat it back with a Swiffer (it was totally fine). They caged the raccoon but warned us it was a baby, which means there’s probably a mother and other babies remaining.


They were not wrong. We now hear a lot of noise upstairs which indicates that the babies are um, not really babies anymore.

They are not shy, they are clearly trying to escape from the attic and into the mainstay of the home. I am terrified of sleeping and waking up to a fucking raccoon watching me or basically pillaging through my things for foodstuffs.

Here’s the thing. I don’t have money to hire a professional to remove them. My landlord is out of touch. He is useless. We can’t really call the NYPD unless the raccoons have already entered the apartment. I am trying to avoid that at all costs, literally and figuratively.

Does anyone have advice on who I can contact for this kind of situation? I already have terrible anxiety and trouble sleeping as it is, but seeing UNO cards being slid between the crack is of the attic door in my bedroom is not really something I’d like to see before drifting off. Which is literally something they do, because they must have found an old deck of UNO playing cards and decided to play yet another fucking game with me.

tldr; raccoons in my apartment attic. My landlord is useless and won’t help. I want them removed but don’t have the money to hire anyone for the job. What do I do?",05Dec2019,1
1031,"so, i have been with my gf for about 6 months now. today, after school, me and my gf decided we wanted to have some quiet, private time, and watch movies in her basement for the evening. she lives with her aunt and grandmother, who are very very strict about letting us do things together, especially in private. so, we had the stupid idea to sneak into her basement through the back door without alerting anyone so we could spend time together privately. we were able to sneak in successfully, and watch about half of the movie, until her dog began to bark and sniff near the basement door. her grandma opened the door to come downstairs, and we hid. i ended up knocking over a cardboard box while hiding, and obviously alerted her grandma, who found both of us. she took us upstairs, and told us how we can’t be trusted (understandably), and kicked me out of the house, and told me that i’m not allowed to come back. my gf and i decided that we would talk about the issue when i got home, and that things would be settled. her grandma ended up taking her phone, and she is not responding to my calls or texts. i’m trying not to worry too much, and trying to remain calm and reasonable, but i’m getting anxious, not only because we got caught, but for her safety at home, because her family has a history of being abusive. what do i do?",05Dec2019,1

1034,"So I am supposed to graduate college Dec. 15th. Just needed to pass all my classes and I would be able to walk across the stage.

1036,"I have three older half-siblings (F28) (F26) (M23) on my bio-dad's side, he left their mother in the 90's and got with my mom and had my younger brother(19) and I, he cheated and left my mom when I was 5. I'm now 21(f) and I had limited contact with him until I was in middle school. He was big into martial arts and I wanted to connect with him so badly I got into martial arts and competed in tournaments for two years hoping to impress him. He only came to one. I used to call him on my birthday after waiting most of the day to hear from him. My brother never had that problem. 

He's cheated on every woman he's been with, he convinced my brother and I to help cover up a lie he was caught in when we were kids. My mom found out and we weren't allowed to see him or my grandparents on his side for about a year. 

In my later teen years he got married to the woman he's with now, she has two children (f18) (f15). I got to see him every other weekend if I wanted to, most times I agreed. Each time I'd find out he had spent an incredible amount of money on my new step siblings for makeup or jewelry. When I turned 16 he said he'd get me a car, he got me a beanie instead. He said the same to my younger brother, he didn't get one. When (f18) turned 16 she got a brand new car. His Facebook profile photo has never been of me or my brother, it's only been him with either (F28), or the step siblings. 

His favorite child has always been his oldest. He's paid for her living expenses, serval cars, etc; I think he feels most guilty for leaving her than any other children.

He recently started a family business selling CBD products. He hired my younger brother but during the building process used him for 2 months free labor after saying he'd pay him. 

The day that his business opened (11/29/19) was also the day I got engaged. His wife congratulated us, my grandmother, basically all my family on his side, except him. I knew he was told about it by my brother, he told him to say something and he claimed he would. I figured that day he was just extremely busy, I gave him a pass a few days following. But it's been a week.

He messaged me on Facebook a meme he created for his business today. I didn't respond. I'm beyond hurt. I almost want to cut him off completely. 

I've explained how I feel to him in the past but he only has defended himself and nothing changes. I don't think he takes me seriously. He's very conservative and makes degrading sexist jokes towards his wife and women in general. I think he believes I'm being overdramatic when I talk about anything emotional.

TL;DR: My biodad has been an asshole my entire life, he started a business on the day I got engaged and never congratulated me.",05Dec2019,1

Using an elimination technique we determined they weren't indian meal moths(thank God) but in fact housefly maggots. Apparently houseflys lay in or around food as a source for their ilk but what I don't get is that theres a stinky rubbish bin in the kitchen, plenty of dirty dishes ect (all quite a few meters away from source) but there's absolutely none where they'd be expected. Instead they laid underneath our beanbag which is clean, carpet underneath is also clean and they've managed to enter pupae stage.

1038,"Hey guys. Was going to make this short but fuck it. I'll tell my story for the sake of it since I never do.

I'm 28 yo Male located at a small ass island, good job with shit pay, no qualifications and nothing past 26years out of my 28years was worth anything. I was raised bullied into submission at home and at school as a kid. Iv been thrown into bins, held of ledges, slapped around and shit. Most memorable is how everyday when I'd get lunch I'd have to run away during lunch hour just to get away from other kids who would always catch me and devour my food infront of me (lol). Shit was hectic at home Too as my abusive mother made us sign a letter to social welfare during her divorce stating that our father was abusive, which gave her custody and she would never let us speak to anyone, hit me around since I was apparantly a black sheep and reminded her of my father, and all the rest of your classic ""my upbringing sucked"" shit. I lived like a min walk from school. So after school since mother wasn't home I would go to our uncles, another minute walk and wait for her.. which is where my older cousin used to umm pretty much rape me everyday for a while (dont remember how long and thank god this is anonymous lol). I was raised a hindu then baptisted as christian after parents divorced and then pretty much attended most religious gatherings (even korean churches and what not). 

My personality formed to the type where I barely spoke or socialized (didnt know how to, tbh). I had a bunch of friends when I grew up we were friends for about 13 years or so I'm assuming here. But I never realized till a few years ago that I was just being a shadow with everyone. Followed people and saying anything just to fit in. And the place I am in still has the good ol' rape society, patriarchy, animal abuse, alot of rape and other things backward societies have. I remember being taught how women are and what their role should be, along with men's roles. I thought I was cool cause I spoke same way I heard things and by the time I hit 18 I developed a bad temper and embarrassingly turned abit goth after people kept calling me that (loser shadow). I'd harm myself or others, didnt care about anything, didnt focus in education cause all the bullies were good at sports and I was always the one blamed even the first time I stood up for myself I was punished and hit by our vice principal lol. So I just didnt like anything (but animals and video games). I regret 99% of my life choices.

Spent pretty much my entire early adulthood smoking (since 18), drinking (since 13) and playing WoW and other games and totally focusing everything I had on gaming. Only place i felt like myself and i met alot of cool people back in those days imo. 

So that's my early life.. abused, hated, hateful and just unfocused on reality. Till my age of 26 I went through 3 hrs (3years each) and then my fourth who was total opposite of me but she managed to break me out of my shell (no longer together) and first time in that one year I managed to do alot of things I never did. In this past 2 years I managed to form my own personality which is when I realized most my life was wasted. I was dealt difficult cards and I didnt make use of the multiple pathways i could have taken, I know society really stopped my progress and i know as a kid i wouldn't have known how to do things but yeah.. it was either be like the people around you or be a shadow. Anyways First time I went clubs, first time I went to the beach, first time i went on a boat, first time i saw a plane up close lol, first time i drove, first time i left my home town and got my first job too (as a administrator), all was done at 26.

Since I started working and still had my gaming rig I decided to spend most of my time trying to understand whatever and everything. I became hungry for knowledge I missed out on. It's when I really read into science (place I'm located is not that fascinated by science). This is when my eyes opened on how the world is and human fallibility. I started reading and watching anything on evolution of planets to evolution of beings, human brain, I even search the process of how we sweat.. how food gets digested.. how goosebumps work.. i dont know..  I want to know everything.. I'm so curious. I like how everything that exists now is the way it is. How creations made our life easier and how we take science and technology for granted.

Anyways I grew confidence and my own personality, I dont really have friends now but I never found similarities with people anyways. I found out how complex life really is, from plants to humans. Doesn't matter.. everything is complex. In one year my personality swapped in a way that I cant even recognize the old me. Even remembering how I was.. it's weird.. everything I look at now I try to picture how complex they are. Million years of evolution lead us to this point and i keep thinking of how all species survived to this point, and everyone takes it for granted. I also cant even look at a switch nowadays without wondering how it works or how it was invented (I never studied science btw) I struggled to save and got myself a telescope to see things people usually dont, especially where I am. I became nicer, respectful and just a nice person, like Neil Degrease Tyson and many other scientist say ""astrology is a humbling experience"". And I feel humbled Could be bragging since I'm a sarcastic douche at times (with the right crowd) but I'm always nice and try to make people's day even with little words. I'm broke af and i spend my whole day tipping people till I'm even more broke.. cant help it. I look at people stuck in this rotation of struggle, depending on authoritative figures for guidance and just not living their own life. Everyone should have the right to live happy. I learned what patriarchal life is, I noticed how animal rights aren't practiced, I watch people pollute, i watch people figh, make drama, women getting beaten up and when I speak out I get told by wife it's okay it's her husband.. and so on.. I cant even speak on environmental facts because iv met more people here who think global warming and nasa is full of shit. Is it just me or it's weird people are in this place where they are stuck and dont notice it?

Carl sagan has to be one of the most iconic people that ever existed. He explains so well how humankind works and how certain events in history has lead us to this point atm. So I feel stuck now. I wanna learn science (all from physics to astrology and what not). But I'm broke as shit.. I wanna help everyone and everything around me... but I'm broke as shit.. I want to start over but again.. I'm broke as shit.. I currently live together with brother and friends but I have no similarities with anyone here. Iv tried talking about how I see the world but people think I'm just being weird. Or a hippy..

Iv been contemplating on leaving the island and starting again somewhere. Educate myself and do shit I enjoy like helping people or the environment. But again all this takes money.. or some sort of qualification.. I've tried NGOs but my qualifications are shit. But I know I'm smart and I amaze myself how I invest time till I understand something and question it till I'm confident I know, then i smile about it and that's it.. it ends there.. I dont advance I just jump to next thing I'm curious about.. I'm seeking a purpose I suppose.. Currently I found the site Khan academy and studying math (from first grade, I dont care cause I'm thirsty for knowledge, and I didnt study at all in school since half my time went on hiding in trees from other students) but honestly i would prefer to work for nasa as a janitor for no $ but shelter, education and food. 

To Make it worst things are intimidating, I just left my city for first time 2 years ago. So I'm clueless on how to plan/leave/start again.. how do I get a job if I cant even get a job here? How do I apply for educational programmes when I cant apply for it here? If I can barely survive here.. I cant see myself surviving elsewhere. 

But I would love to leave everything behind, fill my brain with all the knowledge I can using scientific method and just be good and help everything and everyone till I pass away, think that is the best way to live ones life. I'm pretty smart.. iv taught myself alot of things just through internet. A Jack of all trades but master of none..  

To help everyone and just absorb knowledge is what I like. It's the way I would like to live.. but it seems so impossible and I try to be optimistic but I got no one to advice me on which path to take or how to pull it off. Honestly if any science insitutes reads this. I'm down for no cash and I work my ass off for a good cause in return I only need shelter and food to survive, and I want to learn and understand everything that's possible to understand. That's it. Iv read alot of people have left things behind and start anew in a field they like. So it shouldn't be impossible for me right? Or did my choices in the past have left me in a spot where I got no choice but to work till retirement and then I can act on my wants?

I dont post anywhere or share my thoughts but I decided to post here since iv been a lurker on the internet for a long time. I figured what's the harm... anyways to anyone reading this. Thanks for your time and sorry for the bad grammar. I'm better at almost everything but english lol. Y'all have a great day/night and take care :)

Also.. I talk to all my mother, father and my cousin. I have sat with them and explained my personality now and how I understand that society and their situations during life can make one do wrong things, no ones in truly control of ones self. Lead by emotion and errors. I also dont hold any grudges and most of the people I disliked are no longer disliked lol iv already spoken to most people and I just do my best not to hate or get angry at anyone. For any reason. I am not perfect in all aspects of what I want to be like.. but I am working on it and will do so till I am happy with what I am and what I accomplish.",05Dec2019,1
1039,"(14y m) just had block braces put in last Friday, the treatment is planned to last 6 months, after which i have train tracks put in for a year.

We haven’t really talked much but we have mutual friends, so coming out and saying it in person would feel so out of place. I think we both have some mild shy tension when we see each other, but we’ve never said or done anything about it because of our partners. 

I think I just want the closure since he’s leaving. I have no intentions of ruining either of our relationships from this regardless of how he takes it, I just think it’d be flattering for both of us to know if it’s been mutual (or horrifying and awkward for me if he’s had no clue). Just like, “hey, this might be weird, but I’ve had a little crush on you. Just wanted to let you know before you left” or something. I dunno, it might make him feel good.

1045,"Quick intro - I am (m)26. I live in Toronto with my fiance and our dog Stanley. I have been depressed since I was about 15 but have dealt with it and been able to enjoy life pretty well up until about 2 years ago. This post will probably be long so I apologize in advance.

So I am looking for any advice on how I can get back to my normal self and start enjoying life again.

I used to be extremely outgoing, and hate sitting at home not doing anything. I was a big FOMO guy. Lots of friends. Would go to many concerts and sporting events, even alone if nobody was around (which I actually preferred)

It all seems to have started when me and my now fiance moved to Toronto. We used to live about 40min outside the city. I used to do more things in the city before I moved here If you can believe it. 

Currently I barley ever leave my apartment apart from work or errands. I mostly credit that to budgeting since cost of living and entertainment are very expensive in Toronto. This also leads me to stress daily about money. I have worked
for a major television broadcaster for the past 5 years and as you all know it is a dying industry. I'm not even full time as attaining full-time where I am can be near impossible. So I never know what my next pay will look like as I can work anywhere from 1 to 4 days a week. Again this adds to my stress of not knowing how much I'll make in a month, plus with layoffs every year my job security shrinks constantly. I have ZERO friends here which also doesn't help. My old college buddy used to live in my building he has since moved, and my cousin used to be downtown but just moved to Australia. Mind you my friends are only 40min away but as we have gotten older our interests have all changed and it's tough to get together. Making new friends at 26 is challenging at least for me. My fiance and I do not share many of the same interests which is totally fine, we love eachother and support eachother no matter what. We have no problem with the other person doing other things without the other which is great. She also works midnight to 9am and I work shift work at random so we rarely even sleep together or have time to do things together as it is. A big issue is our little dog Stanley. He has sever seperation anxiety so it's tough leaving him alone for long periods of time but it is what it is.

Basically I have become dull, boring, and am not interested in anything. I have no FOMO for anything. It's hard for me to even come up with something to do besides sit and play video games. In such a massive city you would think I'd have no problem discovering new things to do but here I sit. 2 years ago if you told someone who knew me that I would be this Inactive they would have laughed in your face as I am usually the super hyper talkiatve outgoing guy. Is this just what happens as you get older? Am I simply just maturing out of my adolescence? It's at the point where I go stir crazy at home but don't do anything about it. It's hard to explain im just so overly stresses out over everything and I worry constantly, which is out of my nature as I used to never worry about money or the little things. I feel like the old me has been beaten down and sent away. I used to embody confidence, and now I have almost none left. I even refer to myself as an idiot at work and my performance has gone down. I feel like I need to turn things around right now because this is not how I want to live my life.

I am sorry Reddit of my long rant has been vague but it is hard for me to explain everything. It may seem like a very minor issue after reading but I can assure you that this is destroying me physically and mentally.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - Used to be outgoing, adventurous ect... Past 2 years my confidence has crumbled. Stress has taken over me. I just want to turn things around and get back to being the old me again.",05Dec2019,1

1047,"Sorry in advance bec this is gonna get long.

I started this new job as a graphic designer last week and was initially really excited because all of the interviews I had with the company head talked about video production, animation, and social media campaigns - things that I find very interesting and challenging. He also mentioned that I would also be making technical drawings for client quotes but that they wouldn’t take super long and wouldn’t be my main focus.

So I took the job, really excitedly, and found that there are far less people than I expected working here, less than 20, and that those technical drawings are *all* I’m doing.

2 days in and I’m already bored and very unhappy because this is not what I was promised. I’m told that everything we spoke of won’t be a thing until March, when the creative director comes back from maternity. I sucked it up, of course, and found ways to make the job interesting for myself. I put Youtube in the background so that I have something engaging to listen to and play a game on my phone when I’ve finished all of my tasks. Something like a reward system for myself.

This new technique worked for me and I was super happy to work and get things done. I was very productive throughout the day and even ended up doing what are essentially secretarial tasks for the boss that are far beyond my job description. To be honest, he asked me to do so much that it actually felt like he was trying to see how much he can push.

I thought this new strategy would work for me, or at least I did until my new boss called me into the meeting area at the end of the day. He then basically told me in a very quiet, casual voice that he’s making a new policy against Youtube and phones and that if I don’t like it, I can “go find some other place to work”.

I’m flabbergasted at first. I understand, of course, why he wouldn’t want to see that even if it personally helps me focus, but I’d been here for less than a week at this point. I never received a proper orientation, was repeatedly told this was a casual environment, didn’t have a policy handbook to refer to, and repeatedly observed other employees doing the same.

While I understand *why* he’d make a new policy, and would have accepted it and moved on, I don’t understand why he had to say something like that to someone who’s so new and unfamiliar with the place - especially when he told me he was expecting mistakes because I’d just started.

I’ve been deeply uncomfortable with this place ever since. It feels like I have no job security here after being warned (read: threatened) with termination for something so minor. When I asked a coworker, she told me he fired a guy before because he did stocks and watched youtube videos *after* finishing all of his tasks and that this boss felt betrayed by it.

When I say it out loud, it sounds like I’m whining, but I really do feel uncomfortable around him now. I feel extremely jumpy and stressed when he comes near me and I can tell my coworkers feel the same.

It’s not like he shouts at us, or is inappropriate, etc., but he wanders around peeking over our shoulder a lot and there’s something about his presence that just feels wrong.

I don’t want to stay, that’s for sure, but am I just being overly sensitive here?",05Dec2019,1
1048,"My mom goes to the casino every Thursday because that's when they draw a lucky winner of a golden brick or something and after she stays and gambles for a bit, regardless of whether she wins or not. Now she's also started going on other days of the week. She says it's all tiny gambles like slot machines that run on dimes. She has borrowed money from me that she didn't return, but I didn't think much of it since she did that before she started gambling and she does have some trouble paying the bills, and I know that. And I really think she spent it on bills and stuff, but I don't know for sure.

But what I'm also realising is that she's financially irresponsible. We redid the kitchen and the living room and the hallway within these past 3-4 years. My dad's business hasn't been doing well either. She has trouble paying bills but she keeps spending on stuff like this. And I can't really complain since they agreed to send me on a year abroad and that cost them quite a bit as well.

Should I do something? How do I know if this is turning into a problem or if she has it under control?",05Dec2019,1
1049," I'm currently a senior in high school and ive always been interested in robots, and my interest for it grew after taking a electricity course in my physics class last year (Im in a higher level physics class because i enjoyed it a lot). However, I come from a low income family with a single mother and sister, so I decided to go to the military so my mom can pay for just my sister while Ill be going for the GI Bill. 

I decided to go for the small arms/artillery repairer job as i always loved big guns (too much gaming aka world of tanks) and i thought that the skills i learn could potentially help me in pursuing robotics. 

But how much will it help me pursue robotics? I'll probably be majoring in electrical engineering, so will any skills i learn in the army be transferable to any robotics related fields? 

I'm also aware that my job may be more closer related to a technician rather than an engineer, but I wont regret taking this job in the military even if there are no transferable skills as this is still something I really think I'll enjoy.",05Dec2019,1

1051,"I have a childhood friend that I get along really well. We have so many hilarious memories and I like being around them. We know everything about each other. We rarely fight but If we did, it would go big and we stop talking for a 2-3days and then we would apologise. However recently I keep getting a bad vibe from them. I dont know how to explain it. My mind is being paranoid and I find myself being cautious around them. Why is that?..I can't stop myself tho. Or they would say something and my mind would go on alert mode and I want to stop the whole conversation. I dont know why this is happening? I also dont want to talk to them anymore which is also weird. I feel like responding hours after they text. But the wierd thing is that I just cant seem to let them go? What should I do? I'm so stuck.",05Dec2019,1
1052,"I have lived in this apartment for about a year and a half so far. We are the main floor but there are people living below us since we’re at an incline. A majority of the time we keep pretty quiet since we’re gone for work/school a majority of the day.

To begin we had the neighbors above us that had kids running around midday. I wasn’t too bothered about it since it was around noon. A few minutes later neighbor the neighbor below us came up and asked us if we could keep quiet as they have a baby. I told her how it actually wasn’t us and the neighbors above us. She also heard them and left to talk to them. A few months go by and my roommates just get home while and I’m at work. My roommates called me and said they just got home when someone knocked on their door. They opened it and to their surprise two officers were at the door. The officers said there was A report of a party going on at our apartment. My roommate open the door wide and showed the officer’s they there was not a party. The officer left and nothing came of it. Over the course of the week I tried to contact the officers to get their information so I could let my apartment managers know just in case I get a complaint.

Over the course of living here we have noticed multiple times that the neighbors below us keep pounding our floor. Usually we are not being loud but if we catch ourselves being loud then we know right away to keep quiet. 

My lease ended after a year and so I was searching for a house to rent with my roommates. We were then declined and after asking that company why we were declined they said due to our noise complaints at our current apartment. I I called my apartment manager and they explained how any complaints cannot be taken off and are permanent. I explain to them on multiple occasions we were not being loud when the neighbor below us would complain. I even wrote a letter to my apartment managers explaining everything and how we feel we are being targeted.

I am not saying that we are perfect but I’ve had an occurrence when I had my siblings visit and they were stepping hard and I had quieted them down multiple times. The neighbor below me then came up again and said his floor was banging for the past hour. I apologized later wrote a note and put it on their door saying if there is ever an issue please call or text my number.

Months after that incident, last week I was getting ready to head out to class. I always keep my backpack on the chair and I accidentally dropped it. Then the floor below me had a large bang to the ceiling which is my floor. I think thought maybe that was just a coincidence so I dropped my backpack lightly on the floor again just to be sure. To no avail there was more pounding at my floor.

I’m not sure what to do as I have written letters to my apartment and talked to the neighbor below. But they seem to have an issue with us or something I am nk seeing here.


TLDR: on multiple occasions the neighbor below me at my apartment keep banging on my ceiling and complaining. A majority of the occurrences were not from me. These issues have caused me to be declined at another rental.",05Dec2019,1
