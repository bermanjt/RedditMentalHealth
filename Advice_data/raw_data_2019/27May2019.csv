0,"My stepdad has never made me feel uncomfortable in this way, and that is why I feel conflicted. I'm 19. I just came home from living in my dorm at college this year. My family is currently having a cookout and multiple of my parents' friend's comments have made me very uncomfortable. The most noticeable one was I was standing around my stepdad and some of his friends and he slapped my butt, really hard. I'm drunk, so I don't know if it was really him, but I remember immediately feeling uncomfortable and telling my sister that he just slapped my butt. Really hard. She told me that he probably didn't mean to, but this party is still going on. I'm in my bed, with a box against my door and my lights turned out, and I'm so scared about what to do next. I'm scared to tell my mom because I feel like she won't believe me. I've only dated my boyfriend for a month and I'm scared to tell him. I told my sister because she's the only one I could trust and she told me she thinks he didn't mean to. I don't know what to do, I don't know if I'm overreacting because I'm drunk, but I feel really scared and like I can't tell anyone",27May2019,3
1,"Harassment through phone calls and text? I as well as my other family have experienced calls being listened to for no reason. Calls forwarded to my phone. People would call my mother's number and it would be forwarded to my phone when I am on my own plan I pay for. Phone calls from all types of real numbers. Calls cut when I try to talk to someone about it. Things became worse when I received a text from my father that was not him at all. But came through as his number.

&amp;#x200B;

It first started happening to my mother. They got new phones, didn't help. They changed their numbers. Didn't help.  Then when I spoke to my mother about this situation over the phone it started happening to me. Almost as soon as I acknowledged that it was really happening since some odd things happened to me that I mentioned. Started being called from weird numbers I don't know. Answered the phone once and some guy was obviously trying to scare me and then hung up. I didn't believe my mother. Now I do of course. I started ignoring it and getting some security apps on my phone to make sure I am not being tapped into or whatever. It seems to stop, the calls and such become less when I ignore it all. But my mom and dad got to the point of not using their phones. My mother is hysterical over it. Maybe that is why it persists so much for her? Who ever this is is getting a thrill out of my mother losing it over this happening to her.. Perhaps?

2,"Me and my ex-girlfriend went through a toxic relationship and breakup, I was going through major depression, anxiety problems and self-harm because of how bad things were. I'm still incredibly hurt from the relationship and the things that she did, but I'm trying to forgive her and move on. Not even one month later after we broke up, she had intercourse with someone and told my bestfriend probably to bring me down and two months later she started dating someone, but now 3 months later, she sent me a friend request, unblocked me on social media and her best friend started following me on Twitter? I ended up leaving the friend request there because I honestly didn't know what to do, 2 days later she removed it. But honestly, what should I do? I kinda wanted to know what she wanted to tell me and this is honestly destroying my progress on moving on.",27May2019,1
3,"Let me preface by saying this is a throwaway account, for obvious reasons. M/26/nunya

My parents were married  together for 24 years under what I thought to be happy pretense, and I grew up in a loving household with strong family bonds. We would alternate holidays to visit each side of the family; my moms side is much closer to home while my dads has some around home but most live out of state. I thought everything was alright and good until about 3 years ago, when they hit me with their divorce out of the blue. After this happened, many events and truths were brought to my eyes about my families, and I realized that my dads side is not really as admirable as I thought they were. My moms side has fewer issues, but they  (still) treat my dad like their son; meanwhile my dad’s side never once reached out to my mom, and have treated her poorly in the past for being Hispanic. After the divorce they’ve given her and I the black sheep treatment, but every time they say “I’m so glad you could make it” at gatherings, I could see in their eyes that they were just fine without me present. I’m starting to feel the same way about them now.

 To expand, they’ve said things to my mom like “her eyes are brown like dirt and [my dads sister’s] are bright like gold/jewels” among other chides; they’ve lauded their entitled children’s accomplishments over mine, to this very day; they make jokes about “cutting me out of the will”, and like previous, they have already ghosted my mom, and my dad is always the one extending invitations to gatherings instead of anyone contacting me directly.

As you might’ve guessed my dads side is very much -like that-, and the will they joke about belongs to that sides eldest grandmother who’s husband was a rich banker. I couldn’t care less about the money at this point, even though it would help my life tremendously.

Is it best for me to simply cut these people out of my life? Some of them are wonderful and friendly, but a much larger portion are twice my age or older and very set in their ways. I can tell the ones who really care from the ones who don’t, and I’m sad to say the number could be counted on two hands. Is it worth it to make the effort for the good few in exchange for the treatment I get from everyone else?

On top of all this, they don’t seem to realize how hectic my life has become in trying to: work and live on my own, work on a pet project, make time for friends, relationships, and hobbies, and balancing seeing both sides. I feel like I’m being torn apart in 6 different directions, and now both sides think I’m ignoring them while I’m simply just trying to get my life together. I’ve been living paycheck to paycheck, sometimes going negative, ever since my parents split up and we had to go our separate ways. I really don’t know what to do, and i think if I were to selectively spend time with certain members and not the rest, the grapevine would hear and just completely shun me. I need some good guidance, or at least some words of encouragement :/

TLDR; after my parents sudden divorce 3 yrs ago, my dads side treats my mom and I like we’re insignificant, and don’t even bother trying to get in touch with me without my dad “mediating” between us. They’ve cut my mom out of their life entirely and the strain from trying to see both sides is tearing me apart. What the hell do I do?",27May2019,1

Apology in advance for bad English.

In my freshman year in undergrad course I(21M) met a girl(21F). I tried to talk with her several times just as a friend but she seemed closed and did not talk that much. What I did not know was that she had a relation with another guy(21M) in the classroom. After a week I figured out 'the couple'. I heard from my other classmates that they had been together for like 4-5 years. Also got to hear that both of their families know about their relationship absolutely. I was not that much worried cause I had just a slight crush on her for she posted awesome artworks. I tried chatting with her once or twice. But she did not responded like she should have.We had eye contacts many times in the class. But I used to ignore those actually or just smile away. I used to see them sitting together all the time in every class, every lab sessions, even outside the class also once I saw them walking together home ( they live in the same building ).

1.5 years have passed. A month back, one day i see the girl is sitting lonely. I was shocked at first, I wondered, wheres the guy? FYI, the guy eventually became a friend of mine as we attended classes on the same time. Anyway, I looked at the classroom very carefully and figured out he's in the last bench sitting all sad and angry.Something seems wrong between them. That night she messaged me . We had just a casual conversation . The next day she seemed upset a bit (Her bf got to know about our chatting). Next night she messaged me again and asked about me.

From the next night we chatted every night. The intense conversations went on the whole night until we both feel sleepy and tired. I asked her why suddenly she started knocking me at night. She replied that she had a huge crush on me but could not talk for a moment as her boyfriend was over-possessive and so she was forbidden by him to talk with other guys at all. For the first couple of days she seemed really worried and depressed about her relationship and her mental condition; Yes, she finally broke up with him. She shared about the physical and mental abuses and harassment she had to go through for his boyfriend's restrictions. I tried to support her mentally, tried to make her happy the best I could. She seemed happier every night as she talked with me. She thanked me saying if I would not have been there for her on the previous nights she would have committed suicide. I became weak for the first couple of days also ( not weak anymore now ). She tells me the way I treat her no guy ever did, also says 24/7 that she loves me , not to mention the hugs and kisses emojis, but here is the deal, she does not want to get into a relationship with me. Why? 

Cause previous relationships taught her a hard lesson and she is not ready for another pain ( relationship ) in the ass. OK, I never forced her on anything, although I asked her casually if she would go on a serious date. She said that she wants to recreate her first kiss with me and fantasizes it on chat. Also She is ready for the 'hookup and stuffs (Netflix n Chill)' she told me openly that a million times by now.

Currently I am TOTALLY confused about the things I should be doing. I am not serious about relationship right now. I need to get focused on my career and after I get a good enough job I will start thinking about relationship and stuff.  Should I just ignore her ? or just carry on ? ( I do not know where I am going to end up chatting with her like that :3  I do not want to lose her too ) ... I want to know the best play here I can ( and should ) play carefully considering my future. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS. We never talked that much in person, all these  happened in messages or voice clips for about a month. Also I do not talk with the guy anymore after we started chatting exclusively. Thank you for reading.",27May2019,2

8,"Ever since I was young I was always told by my mum “to never try draw attention to myself”. Which I guess I really took to heart because as a person I’ve always found it difficult to fully open up with people and never been able to really trust people with any of my more personal stories of what I’ve done or just the ability to fully be myself around people. Lately it’s made me feel a bit more insecure about myself and I’ve being feeling a lot worse because of it. I’ve had people in my life I’ve tried to open up to but it always seems as if I get shut out. For example, there was a girl I really liked and she made me feel much happier than I’ve ever been in a long time. So after about 6 months of being good friends I told her that I liked her a bit more than a friend and she said she wasn’t interested in me that way. I didn’t mind the rejection that much and we said we were chill still being friends but then I opened up to her about my insecurities about romance and how I find it difficult to build relationships. In response she said that she was sorry to hear that and that she can’t understand where I was coming from. Which I guess is better than nothing but to me it just seemed really uninterested in what I had to say. This then made me feel as if she really didn’t care about me that much at all and I just end up feeling even more lonely than I already did and made me think she was only interested in the surface, which is pretty jokey and relaxed. 

I know I’m still young and I’ve got a lot more life ahead of me but i just can’t stop the feeling that I can’t open up to any of my friends or family with my life which just makes me feel more distant and lonely. 

I know this probably isn’t the most coherent post you’ve ever read but any advice that can be given about how to improve my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",27May2019,1

10,"So I used to love this girl in 7th grade, and she did know (8th now) but she didn't so I gave up. Later, a rumor that I wanted to bang her got around the school (and apparently I started it. Not true) and she refused to believe that I didn't start it. We drifted apart but later reconciled a few months later. We became pretty good friends after that, but now there is a dance coming up. Now she is attractive ( in my eyes, at least) and I want to dance with her. But we were talking about it and she had brought up the topic about dating, and consequently kissing. She asked me who I'd dance and/or kiss at the dance and I had confessed that it would be her if I had to choose. She was surprised to hear that because she thought I didn't like her anymore. 

This is where it gets weird. So I did kind of a white-lie, but also told the truth. Because sometimes I think of her and I get intense (not sexual) thoughts about her and me as a couple, but at the same time, I know it wouldn't happen for many reasons. Thus I don't love her anymore, yet still do at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I asked her if I could dance with her on the day of the dance. She said yes but as friends. I said ""right, only friends, haha"". She replied ""lol"" but now we barely talk, and I think I've made it awkward. How do I get myself out of this zone?",27May2019,1
12,"The title sounds like so not a problem but here’s the thing:

My mother has always had her eye on these houses. She picked out a couple she loved over the last few days and so did her sisters and today I broke them. All of the ones she picked out. There are still some houses left for her to go back and get more, but I am so crushed. I feel so guilty. She says it’s okay, she isn’t upset and she’s more relieved I didn’t break my china than anything. It was a total accident, I didn’t mean to do it. But I know she’s upset.

13,"Title kind of says it all. His name is Gannon (not real name, but if it was his real name would i really tell y’all?) and we never dated or anything like that, so he’s not an ex. It’s a very complicated story, but to make a VERY long story somewhat short, his friends told me that Gannon had feelings for me. I was pretty dumbfounded since he’s pretty hot and i’m pretty not. I never really noticed him before (we were in an art class together, but he sat on the other side of the room so I didn’t really see him that often) , so when they told me about his crush, I developed feelings for him too. His friends kept telling me to talk to him for a week or two, but I couldn’t because I have really really bad social anxiety and self esteem issues. I never thought I was worthy for him. Then they told me they were just joking the whole time. But at that point my crush had already developed. I was so heavily invested in him. That was June 2018, and here I sit, May 2019 and I’m still trying to get over him.

Honestly, not to be dramatic or anything, But i really think I was in love with him. In my mind he was just so perfect and untouchable. He still kind of is now, I guess. I know that sounds weird but that’s just how I feel.

Recently I’ve been making some strides to try and get over him. Live my life. It was only a few weeks ago that I actually started to develop crushes on other boys. Minor ones, but I think i’m getting there. I’m proud of how far i’ve come 

But i see videos of him now and again, on snapchat or whatnot, and I just feel so... I don’t even know how to describe it. Shitty isn’t the word for it. I just feel like I’m falling back into the hole I’m trying so hard to get myself out of. I just see him and fall back on my thoughts of him. And how he seems so nice and funny and a likeable guy.

I hate his friends, but I know he’s different. Everyone i’ve asked about him has said he just acts different around his friends. i know he’s a nice guy, somewhere down there. We have a lot of things in common. I just wish things didn’t have to be like this.

I want to let him go, but at the same time, I don’t. I can’t muster up the courage to talk to him. I’ve tried messaging him on his social media’s, but he doesn’t see them, so i guess i kind of HAVE to talk to him in real life if I want to get it over with. I don’t even know what Id say. “Hey dude, you ruined my life a little bit and destroyed my self esteem and made me really fall back into depression, but I’m kind of in love with you. Want some tea?” It’s been a year. I can’t even talk about what happened, because in reality, it isn’t really a big deal what happened. I try to tell my friends about it and they assume i’m overreacting. Fuck that. Fuck them for thinking that.

16,"Hey, I hope this isn't too long, but thanks if you read.


So, I moved to the US with my family when I was a toddler (parents were doing post grad stuff and research). Fast forward to a few months after my 18th birthday and we leave and go back to where I was born since neither could find someone to sponsor them for work to get a green card. And for the xenophobes, nobody was deported for being illegal.



I ended up developing pretty bad social anxiety and didn't talk to a lot of people, except for friends from high school, who I've known since elementary school. I also couldn't get a job because of the country being in a bad economic situation. I dropped out the first time I went to college after the first semester because even though I'm fluent in spanish, I didn't grow up reading and writing it very often, and having to read things at a college level in spanish was far too difficult for me. I started school again majoring in something else around 8 months later in 2015. 



Later in 2016/2017 I got extremely depressed and almost anything would make me angry. I didn't go out or hang out with anyone nor did I really have any money to do so (other than what I saved up obviously, but you gotta start saving at some point). I could never really have a conversation with anyone that really went anywhere, so I didn't really make any friends. Sure I had acquaintances but they didn't mean that much to me personally. They were just people I knew.



I didn't do too great in school in 2017 but I decided to keep going. In 2018 I ended up doing worse and when the summer time came I started getting suicidal. I went to the subway station to jump in front of a train and just be done with everything. Obviously I couldn't do it and I just ended up going back home. I cried probably most nights.



After the summer was over I decided to take the money I had saved up and some money my grandpa left me (he died) and just leave. I'm also Italian by blood and have citizenship so the EU is open to me. I'm in Spain atm and it's been mixed. There are times where I feel almost exactly like I do back in my home country; out of place and not able to have authentic communication with anyone, loneliness at times as well. But other times it's been a lot of fun, but I sort of realized it's never with people I speak spanish with. People who I have to engage with speaking English. I think there's just a lot more culture/fun in the way I talk and it makes it far easier to have conversations with people. I at least got to hook up with an Australian chick from a bar haha.

   For example, most recently, I freaked about about dry humping and getting pregnant cause semen soaked through his pants and my mind though speed could soak through my fully clothed self (very very stupid I know). I’d examine myself daily thinking I was pregnant when it’s only PMS. 
     The thing that might have set it off was I was raped by first boyfriend when I was 14. I told him no and he didn’t listen. For months on end I thought I was pregnant. Even though I took a plan b as soon as I got away from him and I had multiple periods after it, I still thought I was gonna be a mom.

24,"Hi Everyone,

Long winded post coming up.

For the last 3-4 years i have struggled a lot with balancing my social life and study. I am 20years old currently and throughout my whole schooling I have been a pretty average student. All my teachers have said I have a lot of potential but tend to be easily distracted and uninterested in things i dislike. I also **was** pretty naughty and got in a good amount of trouble when i was younger.  

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a very addictive personality where if i enjoy or am interested in something, I will try extremely hard and most times become quite good at things  (athletics wise) as my family is pretty gifted athletically and me being the youngest of 2 brothers, i got a lot of tips and coaching and went really far in a few sports. This led to me getting a **free-pass** of sorts as my sport-tragic father always pushed me to enjoy myself and play sports. My mum didn't like it much but my parents are awesome and are really supportive of most things.

&amp;#x200B;

However, being as my parents are very traditional immigrants, study and stature are very important to them, my mother especially. So going to a big name university etc. is very important. I **luckily** turned it around for my finals and got pretty decent marks and got an offer to a pretty good Uni. But this coincided with me contracting severe crohn's disease which kind of halted my sport and social life as i spent huge amounts of time in hospitals and clinics. This led to me getting really down on myself as i have always struggled with making friends as i am a shy and introverted person with people i don't know too well and i tend to naturally look very angry/upset haha because I have big dark circles due to insomnia as a child and a pretty blank expression most times (idk why lol)

Over this period, i became quite suicidal and attempted once which no one knows about, My parents really dislike and don't understand the issues around mental health as being from very poor backgrounds in India these kind of things aren't well known. I would also like to state i don't have depression or anxiety, I personally don't think it's right to self-diagnose and I haven't seen a doctor or anything about this. I still have happy moments and enjoy myself with family and friends. I would think that the major cause of my anger was the fact that because western medicine wasn't really working for me, My family made the decision to send me to India alone for about 4 months to receive traditional medicine treatment in a remote village hospital. I think my isolation led to me getting very spiteful and angry towards my parents and the world even though every decision they made was to make my life better. This 4 month period was also incredibly painful physically and me not being able to speak the language (my family is from a different state and dialect) really sucked. I even lashed out at my mum at this stage.

&amp;#x200B;

This year, (2019) I did an Internship at an IT firm and through good feedback they offered me a full time job which i started at the beginning of April. I was really stoked about it and still am however with balancing work and Uni I feel so overwhelmed and stressed to the point where I just want to give up, and the feelings i had at one point are returning. At what is supposed to be a high point in my life (my health getting better, buying my dream car, getting into chosen field) I'm fairly close to my lowest. 

&amp;#x200B;

26,"Currently crying my eyes out while reading this, so apologies for any errors. 

So here I am (M19, almost 20) lying in my bed listening to a video on YouTube, and it mentioned something about valentine's day. Now normally this isnt a problem, but recently, my fiance broke up with me, about 2 weeks before our wedding. I've mostly moved on, but our anniversary was Valentine's Day. 

This video just mentioned the day, and it had some piano music in the background, and it brought back this whole slew of memories of us together, and I dont know how to move on. I haven't thought about her in a while, and I thought I was over it, but if just the mention of that day was enough to make me like this, what's going to happen whenever the day is mentioned after this, and what will happen on valentine's day from now on? 

Kinda a stupid post and I'm sorry for rambling, I just want to know what to do from here. I feel so lost and alone",27May2019,1

The thing is, they've kinda gotten smarter. Before the spiders would always freeze whenever I say them, and I trapped and killed a bunch of em because of this. But now, recently, they don't freeze as much and actually run away before I get too close.

Like I said, I don't hate spiders, I just don't want them in my bedroom. Especially because it's a pretty regular occurrence to find medium sized spiders in my bedroom.

30,"Hi 

Sorry but this is a long post!

I have been unemployed for the past 3 years ever since i left high school with no diploma. 
I don’t live in the United States 🇺🇸 but would love to in the next 7 years - just don’t know how yet. 

I’m 21 years old this year within 3 - 4 months. I failed high school then got heavily depressed and it took a mental toll on me but didn’t realize it so I eventually stayed home for the past year since I travels and moved around a bit. 

I don’t know wether I should ask for guidance on what to do next. I’m very quiet and get anxious about almost everything in life. I’m fixing my school situation since I can also get a GED in my country. I’m aiming to do something that will allow me to travel and see the world and earn money at the same time but I don’t know what occupation is that. 
 
1. I don’t like dressing formally but I’m presentable.
2. I have some body modification and I’m happy about it although when I’m in public people stare at my ears depending on the jewelry I’m wearing.
3. I enjoy music so much that I can listen to it the whole day or make music the whole day.
4. I don’t have a car or my own place (well I kinda do live in a house that will be mine in a way)
5. I really want to change and be the person I want to become. 
6. I want to do audio engineering and build a music career but I just don’t know where  to start. 

Sometimes my other thoughts are maybe I should go to college and study a 4 year degree in something else and do music on the side.

Or 

Work a job and invest the money into my music. Learn everything online and build my online presence and probably try to network online and offline for at least 2 years to see where it will go.

Or 

Leave music alone, be miserable and leave my dream to be safe following a career in something that leads somewhere, such as a Job in electrical engineering or something similar. I mentioned that I don’t like wearing formal clothes and prefer jobs or careers that allow me to dress freely  as long as I’m presentable.

At this moment I feel as if though I have the choice to do or choose one thing that I want to excel in to transform my life. I do want to make a lot of money eventually in 5 years as a long term plan leading to 10 years with other visions on the way. 

Only thing that’s causing me to be contentious about what I really want to do or overthinking everything I want to achieve is that I wasn’t very academic in school and my life is not very clear or should I say I let myself be cluttered. 

I would be really appreciative to hear all you have to say:",27May2019,1

32,I don’t know who to talk to. My daddy’s been out of my life since I was born and my mother and step daddy won’t let me come home. I don’t have anything in my possession. I do have a few friends but I can’t stay around forever.,27May2019,1
33,"Well I have never really posted anything like this online before but I am reaching a breaking point of my sanity. My Mother all of my life has been completely overbearing never letting me do anything on my own always telling me how great she was and terrible my father was and that he was never there for me etc. And I had believed it for I was a child and your parents are infallible. Well after I turned 13 she got much worse screaming at me outside the door to my room (that I have kept locked since to seek shelter from her outbursts since that age.) threatening me with Police when I yell back at her asking her why she treats me like this. Which later on turned into false police charges, where the Police coming there hearing reports on my behaviour, threaten to take my mom if she doesn't calm down when she was telling them to arrest me, tell me that I only have ""a few more years"". Fast forward again the courts decide that me and my mother should go to counseling to be evaluated. I don't think I mentioned that my mother is very religious and has a holier than thou attitude. She decided that the therapist that the court had told her to go to wasn't good enough and we went to a Christian Church's therapy. Wherein the therapist had about a 5 minute session where he asked relevant questions before we started talking about video games etc.. and he had said that there was no need for me to be at therapy. However, my mother had gotten into a large fight with her therapist when he disagreed with her on her behavior and said she needed to come back. Long story short, in my mothers eyes, they didn't know what they were talking about. Anyways, I know I ramble on, I've just been having a really hard time as my mother becomes older she becomes more and more psychotic and selfish. She had a huge fit in the restaurant as we were being seated cussing me out around about 15 people eating their food with my Sister, her husband and his mother. His mother decides to leave and so does my sister and her husband. My furious mother follows them out and as they were getting in there car blocks their car in with hers and continues to scream and berate all of us for 15 minutes before she decides to move her car. My life has almost entirely consisted of working/schooling the usual but when I get home my mother will not leave me alone for over 15 minutes at a time. She will pound on my door startling me and start screaming for I am not lying 20+ minutes depending on her mood to herself around the house or outside my door even if I don't respond. Over years and years of this I am not sure how to respond to it and make the situation better. I have tried countless countless times to reach a resolution with her as has my sister about the situation and how it can be made better. She follows along until you critique her in any way then she completely loses it. I am not sure what to really think of anything in this world",27May2019,1

Currently, the only goals I have are are just to break 2 bad habits, but other than that, nothing.

I would ask the /r/advice mod to please not remove this so i can discuss this issue with the people here, if people think my behaviour is not reasonable i will take it onboard but i need to discuss this.

I am a 24 year old male and I have been trying to go out with a girl that I met at college 3 years ago. I havent been able to find out where she lives so i have to settle for the next best thing and wait outside her job to approach her.she has blocked me on social media without so much as a response and i feel like i am entitled to some answers.

some of her friends contacted me and told me that she wanted me to leave her alone but i want to hear that from her because i think they could be making it up.i met her at college a few years ago. it was before a class test and we had a conversation about the test contents and i thought we hit it off so i found her facebook and looked through her photos and figured out where her dorm was and waited for her there after classes and tried to strike up a conversation again but she wasnt as nice as the first time we met and i wanted to know why so i kept doing that for a while until i was contacted by the college and asked to stop waiting for her (I was banned from even being near her building).

after that i had to resort to waiting for her between the classes and our student dorms but i think she started taking cabs and buses home. I managed to find her on a bus once but she had a male friend shout at me which i think was really innapropriate.so basically ive had to go to great lenghts just to get an answer from this girl about why she stopped being nice to me ands why she wont talk to me anymore. i dont think what im doing is illegal or even unmoral.she works at an insurance company now and i managed to follow her home the first day i waited outside her job but unfortunately i lost her car but i roughly know where she lives so i was confident that id be able to track her house down.

but i was impatient because i decided to go into her work posing as a customer so maybe i could get a chance to speak with her and i was removed from the building but i left before the police were called but i dont think what i was doing is illegali should also say that i have sent her letters at her work address and her parents address which i found online but i havent recieved a reply.

i would appreciate any advice and maybe some advice about how i can legally force her to speak to me. thanks.i should also say that i am not interested in hearing anyone that calls me odd or any other names please stick to the topic at hand",27May2019,0

45,"Starts out normal...gets a weird

Co-worker casually reaches out to me for career advice and mentorship. He gives me some personal life details that help me frame where he is at in life. His personal wants/dreams/insecurities also help me to give him advice going forward with what he should do career wise(maybe mistake 1). He is early twenties working a security gig and I am early thirties and ""successful"" six figures blah blah.

I dont mind the casual personal details but without asking too many questions I get some hints he may be in a dark place a bit...nothing major but yea. I tell him we could get lunch sometime and hammer out the details of his career plan(school, udemy, certifications etc) and he agrees. We set a 2pm lunch date and all is good. 

Fast forward to the week of lunch and he calls me  saying he is going to bring his hookah....I'm like ummmm okay....if you want to smoke maybe just come to my place instead as its kinda weird for a restaurant(mistake 2 for sure). Day of he texts at 2pm and says ""Had to make a stop, be there shortly"" and I say ""Just show up whenever""(mistake 3)....fast forward and its about 5pm and he texts "" What is the price of gas where you are?"".... internally im like wtf.... I say ""Honestly no idea man.

He shows up about 5:15....my wife gets home in thirty minutes and I'm wondering how I can get him in and out before then. I text my wife and she understands the situation(wife is awesome). So he gets to the house and tells me its Ramadan, so he can't eat drink or smoke the giant hookah he brought in my house until 8pm.....Im thinking what in the actual fuck is this guy doing!?! Well I ask him about certs and he starts opening up...like a lot....like I'm a therapist or something...don't get me wrong... I can handle his story and maybe even give him perspective but he just doesnt stop opening up about how his home life is a nightmare(it is) and how he has no one(he doesn't) and by this time its 7pm and my wife and I are on the couch just listening to him... we kick him out before Ramadan is over for the day(forgive my lack accuracy when referencing the faith...Im cool with it all but know nothing really).

It gets weird here...

I walk him out the car after a UBER AWKWARD visit and say ""See you later brother be good to yourself""....he is about to get in his car and then I hear my name. He says ""Hey on the downlow Im a massage guy though"". I didn't understand what he said and replied ""what?"" He gets behind me really quick and starts massaging me....Im squirming bad....he gets in front of me and tries to kiss me....I dodge....I don't even know how to respond. He leaves and I'm like.....what...the....fuck...

I tell my wife and we both agree.... no more of this guy. I cut it off at work telling him there won't be any workplace or legal action and its all good there but its workplace professional from here on out between us. He starts quietly crying and I say ""Hey man...I dont judge you and I have empathy, but you could use some help and that is totally okay....you are a good person but your help cant come from me"". I left him in tears and I know he is in a dark place. From his cues and life details he is surely depressed if not suicidal. I cant help him personally, but dont want to be his ""last straw"". He needs help and I need help handling it. Please  help!!

TLDR Tried to be perfessionally helpful to a coworker. He tried to open up to me about evvvverything. Tried to kiss me. I shut that shit down. He needs professional help and may be suicidal. What do I do?",27May2019,1
47,"I usually give advice and rarely ask for it, but I am looking for advice on putting myself into social situations that don't necessarily involve my close friends. I'm a college student and live off-campus, with several of my friends. Unfortunately, when it comes around to the weekend, nobody wants to do anything: they sit indoors all weekend long and consider bringing home food as being an outing. Every single weekend, I find myself bored out of my mind—to the point where I feel depressed. They do seemingly-endless homework all day long, chill all night long, and then sleep until noon or later. I usually only like doing my work once the weekend is over, so I'm essentially free the Friday and Saturday.  


I like biking, so I do try and get outside at least once a weekend and go for a ride; however, while I'm still happily outdoors and not hunched in front of my desk, I'm still all by myself. And, upon returning home, I'm back to being bored.   


I almost want to go find a new group of friends with whom to go out with, but I'm feeling as though it's too late for that: I'm in my third year of college, so people who are currently friends with one another have had since freshman year to solidify their friendships. Is it still worth trying, though? Would it make sense to join a club or maybe go to a bar? I'm at a loss. I loathe staying indoors all day, and I also get rather annoyed at some of my friends' antics. The lack of privacy and focus I have here contributes to my unwillingness to stay indoors all weekend.

Him: Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation.

Her: So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

Him: I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth

His dad especially has always made remarks over the years, like for example, he would say something was “nWord-rigged.” This word makes me so uncomfortable I can’t even spell it out with asterisks, but sometimes old people in the south have their sayings, right? Squabbling with the in-laws is petty business and not worth the headache in my experience. We’ve never agreed politically and so we agree to disagree for the sake of everyone. 

Over the years the comments have gotten worse, not only more frequent, but now it’s not just expressions... the things he says are downright racist to the point of saying black people are gorilla-like, or that if a Mexican can do something, it can’t be that hard. Usually, I’m left with my jaw gaping on the floor, stunned into silence. It’s gotten to the point where we can’t have a single conversation without one of these comments jammed in. He says them “jokingly” like it’s supposed to be funny, but no one laughs. My husband and I are both so uncomfortable that we just say nothing and then talk about how awful it was later. I keep thinking I’ll be prepared for it next time, but every time it happens, I feel taken off guard. It sucks because I can’t relax around him. I definitely think it’s wrong and mean-spirited. I 100% disagree with him, but at the same time, this is home where we are living, and I don’t want to disrespect him (although he’s not showing me or other individuals the respect that is due). 

This puts my husband in an awkward spot because he really looks up to his dad (with the exception of his penchant for racism) and he’s very non-confrontational. In his ideal world, I would just ignore it. But I’ve been raised to not let that sort of thing be tolerated... I feel like letting it slide is giving it a pass.

59,"Hello, I’ve never made a post on one of these forums before, so please bear with me.

I was attending college outside of my hometown and living in a dorm for two years, but moved home last summer and transferred schools due to financial issues. I work a full time job whilst attending university and pay for almost everyone (gas, since I commute a 2 hours a day each semester, my own tuition, and anything else that I might want). The only things my parents actually pay for is my phone bill (which recently changed and I started paying), my insurance, and they stock the house with food. I’ve been dating a boy for five months now and am very serious with him. My parents are very religious and don’t really like when I spend the night with him (he lives an hour away), but when I do we stay at his parent’s house with plenty of supervision. Skip to tonight, my boyfriend came down to my hometown to spend the day with me and my family and we make plans to spend the day with his family Memorial Day. I ask my parents if it’s alright if I spend the night with him and they object, okay whatever, but then go on to say I can’t even drive to meet him in the morning. It’s currently flooding about 50 miles west from my home, and my boyfriend lives about 50 miles northeast from where I live. They claimed the water was too dangerous for me to drive in, then interjected it was fine if he wanted to come back down here. 
They pull stunts like this all the time where they treat me much younger than I actually am. Maybe I’m in the wrong and I understand the “my house, my rules” argument, but I feel like they’re being ridiculous in this situation. 
Advice would greatly be appreciated, thank you.",27May2019,1

I ended up not going to school the following day because I was so sad which I’ve never done before. So far this has been the worst trimester I’ve ever had in school and I have zero motivation to do my homework. I don’t have terrible grades right now (mainly Bs) but it’s a lot different from all As. I just feel worthless and I feel separated from my friends and feel like they don’t want to be by me. It also doesn’t help that most of my friends are in the same friend group as my Ex so I see her everyday in the morning. I still care about her but I don’t think she feels the same and it hurts because I really cared about her. It’s not like we hate each other or anything it just is a constant reminder that I wasn’t good enough. I just need advice on what I can do to feel better.",27May2019,1

63,"Firstly, the reason we're using a donor is because, I have a genetic mutation in my sperm (Y chromosome deletion) that leads to infertility. 

Either way, I was fine and I assumed she'd want to pick a donor similar ethnicity to me.

However, my ethnicity has always been a problem for her. She doesn't like India (can't say that I blame her), hates the caste system, the Indian culture of pushing people into education, arranged marriages etc.

She loves me, but sometimes resents the fact how people view her as she's married to an Indian. Now I'm not bad looking, I'm a bodybuilder, did modeling before, DJ, I'm a great Latin dancer (kinda how we met). But my main career is a being a data scientist and many times she says people see her as the woman who married some Indian geek. That's until they get to know me. 

An example she brings up a lot is her friend, she married a black soccer player. She says whenever her friend tells people about her husband people assume she's this cool girl who bagged the athlete, while my wife is the one who married the geek.

Of course I have a huge fucking issue and complex over this now. But I do understand, I just hate that she doesn't feel proud on her own of me. To me it sounds very immature and highschool like. 

That said, my wife is brilliant and extremely attractive. She's got an amazing body, has a high powered career, often makes more than me due to her bonus. She's very wise and mature and genuinely loves me. Hell she just spent months trying to hunt down the best breeders for a dog I've always wanted. She even made trips to see the dogs parents exercise etc. Very very sweet.

She has legit told me that she hates that I'm Indian, she loves me, is very attracted to me, but doesn't like being associated with Indians. Yes it's kinda racist, but the reasons she laid out explain her prejudice is more against the culture rather than the people. She thinks Priyanka chopra is one of the most gorgeous women alive.

So naturally, she says if it wasn't me fathering her children she wouldn't want to have half Indian kids. I get that.

So the sperm donor hunt settled on a Latino men, dark skinned ones mainly.

So my question is, if I could have impregnated her, our kids wouldn't have looked Indian, but there's a high chance they would have done resemblance to me. Using a donor, the only thing they may have similar to me it's their skin complexion.

I'm worried they come out looking nothing like me and I'll have people thinking she cheated on me. Obviously to close friends and family I can just say we used a sperm donor, but again this isn't something I want everyone to know too.

And do we tell the kids when they're older? I'd hate if they realized I want their biological dad and they start resenting me.",27May2019,893

73,"I had friends in high school and college and graduate school. But since then, my social life has declined dramatically. Between advancing in my career and moving several times, and existing friends starting families, it’s been difficult to maintain friendships. On top of that, I don’t date women all that much. I was never provided, as a child, with a model of a healthy male/female relationship (I expect most people’s model is their parents). So, all of my relationships with girls have either not lasted particularly long (more than a couple months), or never even launched.

So, how does one start from zero? My life is basically my career and my interests. Sure, I’m friendly with my coworkers and on rare occasions we have an office get together... but other than that my social life is very empty.

I’ve adapted quite well. It doesn’t bother me all that much, and gives me quite a bit of freedom. But, I still desire romantic/sexual female relationships, and it seems like that is very difficult to get when you are at zero.

Is that a flaw in my own perception? I don’t think it is. I think most women want to date / fuck men who have a large social circle. Sure, there are certainly exceptions... but what kind of women make such exceptions?

I’ve considered living this way until I can retire, or at least until I can take a long break from work. Like, a loooooooong break. But I don’t want to wait until I’m 35. That’s over 5 years. For these next five years, how can I break the cook-work-cook-gym-tv-sleep pattern? People don’t just go to bars and become friends with somebody in one inebriated night.

74,"So sophomore in high school. So my dad owns his own business as an accountant. I’m going to take my GED in a few months and then start working full time as the office manager. I’ll be answering phones, dealing with clients, cleaning, doing postal runs, and doing some paperwork. I’ll start in a few months and then probably stop working when I’m 35 or so. I’m not looking for advice on weather or not I should take the job because I already decided that I would. My dilemma is that I’ll make 400 a week, which for a teenager is a lot of money. I also won’t have any expenses because my parents will pay for my insurance and I will just get my sisters car when she goes to college.  I’ll be working hard and for full work days, so I will be earning that money, I just don’t know if I should spend the money how I want while I don’t have any dependents, or if I should save it for when I’m an adult. I’ll definitely save some of it, I just don’t know if I want to save, say one hundred a week, or if I want to save like three hundred a week. I’m not planning on going to college so I won’t really have anything specific to save for. I know that I most definitely seem spoiled and that I probably am, but I just want to make sure I am not establishing bad habits while I’m young, but at the same time I don’t want to not take advantage of the only time in my life where I’ll have a lot of money that I will be able to spend as I please. I’ll definitely use the money to help others, and I wont hoard it. Also the way I make money now is by babysitting about once every couple of weeks, and I usually make 20-60 dollars from that.

77,"Background:
I just moved to Arizona for a few months and a friend was able to set me up with a job hostessing at the bar she serves at. Smaller establishment, and the owners own other bars and restaurants in the area. The manager kind of sucks. He’s a nice guy, and pretty encouraging, but he openly admits he’s shit at training people and everyone there knows that whenever a difficult or unideal situation comes up not only does he give terrible advice, but he will criticize anyone for how they handle shitty situations no matter how well it actually was handled. My friend has worked there for three years and this is her third manager, and maintains that he’s by far the least competent. The biggest thing, in my opinion, is that he drinks pretty heavily on shift. When he’s sober he acts so concerned for the wellbeing and dignity of his staff, saying things like “if anyone cusses you out or touches you in a way you don’t like, throw them out”. Then he gets drunk, and he just turns into an asshole. 

Actual Story:
I was working Saturday when my manager sat at the hostess stand and asked me to go refill paper towels or something. I went back into the kitchen to grab them and was chatting with one of our waitresses in passing about work by the kitchen door. Then suddenly this HUGE dude comes up behind me(I’m talking like over 6’5, and broad, I’m about 5’4), grabs me by the torso, and drags me out of the kitchen to the hostess stand and says “Look! I caught this guy with his hand in the tip jar! HAHAHA”, talking about my manager counting tips. My manager laughed like it was no big deal(and as though that joke’s actually funny), but that was completely inappropriate behavior and made that waitress and me really uncomfortable. I want to somehow bring it up to the owners that he gets so drunk on the clock that he lets shit like this happen, because it puts his staff at risk. Problem is that I’m not sure how to go about it or how worth it it is, especially while I’m still working there. I’ll be leaving at the end of July anyway, but I don’t feel super safe knowing how lenient my manager is with the drunk and disorderly, given that they’re our primary demographic.",27May2019,1

84,"Here is what seems to be the story. A boy, then 17, raped a girl, then 15, last summer on more than one occasion when they were at the girl's house after they finished working as junior counselors at a local summer day camp. As the boy's parents live far away and he didn't have a car, the idea is that they would bike or walk back to the girl's house, then get picked up two hours later. The two families were quite close and went on vacation together. Both have younger girls who were friends at the time as well. 

Both families are fairly rich, but the victim's family quite a bit more so. I have know both families for 14 years through kids and local connections, playdates, carpooling, events, etc. I am a neighbor and my wife is friends with the victim's mother. My daughter and the younger sister of the victim are going on a trip together this summer. 

The victim only told her parents much later, a few months ago, so maybe eight months after the event. She did tell at least one friend at the time, however, but he did not divulge the secret, and still is unaware that it is less of a secret by the day. For the past year, the girl has been depressed, on anti-depressants, doing worse in school and generally in the dumps. The mother, also the victim of abuse as a teen, was determined that it should never happen to her daughter and feels like a failure. She said, ""It's been the worst year of our lives.""

When the mother got the story, she called her friend, the boy's mother. The mother then talked to the boy, who admitted he had molested but not raped her. He also told his mother he had done something similiar with more than one other girl. The boy's mother reported this to her friend, the victim's mother, thinking they would stay friends. The vicitm's mother does not know who the other girls might be. 

Now, I wanted to say to the parents, ""If this is the worst year of your life, you should not let this happen to someone else next year."" I know the girl does not want to go public, or call the police, or any of that. That's understandable. 15 is really young, she was relatively weak emotionally already (which may be why he chose her over her more robust sister) and she had no idea what was going on, or what to do. 

However, while there is no physical evidence, there does seem to be a case. It's not just his word against hers, as there is that conversation between the mothers. Certainly, his mother could lie about that as well, but if you were to contact the other girls, you could imagine some kind of case. 

The parents of the victim don't want to be vindicate or traumatize their daughter. But... I think even an interview with the police would sober him up. So far, there has been no consequences and he's off to college next year and his Instragram is full of over-sexed talk about sexy chicks, which I don't like. 

I can't honestly say the police would handle this well and that she would not be victimized again or traumatized again. But I also really do think this is likely to happen again, without some kind of intervention. He was 17 at the time of the crime, so he would not probably be charged as an adult and that might provide the everyone involved an extra layer of privacy. 

Plus, the high school and the college know nothing of this. I mean, I can't really do anything but appeal to the parents to either encourage their daughter to report this or not.

I went all out and even took the train to school and had a fun time. It was weird though, I felt confident and sexy in the “costume”. As I said before I suffer from anxiety but dressed like this I felt empowered and like I was being me.

He wears his “Fox News is Real News” shirt around my old high school (and is made fun of), keeps away from LGBT people, and often times makes insensitive jokes about minority groups. Honestly, I figured it was a phase, and that 13 year old him would mellow out, at worst being uninformed and ignorant. There’s a clear line between uninformed and ignorant and being a total piece of shit, however, and he’s crossed over from being conservative to flat out racist and homophobic. He’s almost 16 now, and told me tonight that he’d “shoot the illegals himself” if he was down at the border, and trashed on the LGBT community, referring to trans people as “it” and gay people as perverts. Having a trans roommate and many LGBT friends, I lost it on him (after a couple hours of debate), and told him he wouldn’t amount to anything if he kept believing the garbage spewing from his mouth. That being said, he’s my younger brother, and hasn’t experienced a diverse world living in New Hampshire (which is the whitest state in the country, I believe).

96,"This is not the best place to post this but I can’t find anywhere else to and I have been posting in this subreddit for a while. 

I’m not going to say my age (you can probably guess) but I will say that we never have PIV sex since we don’t have the proper birth control. So we settle with oral sex but today I ejaculated on her ass after oral sex. She said she felt some go on her vagina, we grabbed paper towels seconds after it happens and tried to start wiping. She then went into the bathroom with a spray bottle and said that she heard that water can kill sperm (not sure if that’s factual &amp; I’m assuming she sprayed down there in the bathroom) She said she’s not sure if any went in and she’s super scared of getting pregnant. 

She last ovulated 11 days ago and her next period should be in 4. I know anything is possible so you can’t be 100% sure but what are the chances of her getting pregnant?

I  need some advice on how to handle it from now on, if there’s any advice you can give I’ll listen .",27May2019,1

I've told mg mom and everything but she says to keep quiet because grandma is excited which i call i don’t understand since my grandma is allergic to cats cant get anywhere near one. 

They say its my responsibility to take care of it when we get it , and to keep it in my room since again allergies - grandma. we're getting the cat from my aunt.

98,"Okay, confusing title, but basically there is a chance my leg may need to be amputated as a result of complications from a crush injury I received in a car accident. I do NOT need medical advice, I just want to make that clear. 



My accident was in January, it’s now May and my bones in my leg are not healing at all. I have a very, very heavy and uncomfortable external fixator, it’s basically a halo and like 20 pounds of steel. I can’t walk, all I do is sit in bed all day, I’m totally miserable. My bones are as broken as they were they say I crashed. We are trying some things but my doctor recommended that if this does not work that I seriously consider amputation. I am getting a second opinion, but honestly I agree. I’m very tired of this and I feel like I would heal faster and not have to go through surgery after surgery to save something that may not be able to be saved. My mom and sister can’t understand this and to be fair, I get it. Most people would fight as hard as they could. My mom wants me to move 1000 miles back home temporarily to go to a bigger and better hospital, also so she and my sister can take me to all my appointments. My boyfriend would stay here. Mom says it would only be a month but she doesn’t know that. She won’t take no for an answer and is putting a lot of pressure on me to do this.



I don’t want to. I am now content with the doctors recommendation if these current treatments don’t work. I made a post on the amputee sub and received a lot of great information, and it really put me at ease. I have also done a lot of research online and have read horror stories about my type of injury resulting in dozens of surgeries over years. Some still lost the leg anyway. Some were successful and happy with the way things went but that is NOT what I want. I know amputation in itself will be painful and comes with its own complications. I will still not be able to work for a long time yet either way. I guess for me it’s a quality of life thing... Even my boyfriend doesn’t really agree with my views on it, he said if my mom is willing to do this I should. The treatments might work, it’s not a done deal, and I am still following all doctors orders. I wish I could make them understand. What can I do to help them at least accept my mind is made up and stop putting so much stress on me? I have always had such a great relationship with my mom and my sister and we are now fighting all the time over this.",27May2019,3

Her: Hey so is there like zero chance of whatever between us being like a thing? Like you’re very happy with your relationship and want something strictly platonic here?

Him: Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation.

Her: So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

Him: I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth

101,"Obligatory warnings, I'm on mobile and English is not my first language.
Backstory: I'm an anime nerd. I absolutely love My Hero Academia and I also cosplay as some of the characters. My favorite character in the show is Shouta Aizawa, the head teacher of the main character's classroom. I love him. I collect items related to him, and I cosplay him as well. I'm also awful at social skills. I had my first real friend at 16 (I'm 21 now) and I can come off as cringeworthy.
December 2018 I went to a con that was held at my college. I dressed up as female Aizawa based off a design on the internet that had shorts because it was too hot outside. That day I met the guy. Let's call him A because that's his real name's first letter.
He was cosplaying as Aizawa too, but his was way more on point than mine. He also was a teacher irl and had a personality that came off as very alike to Aizawa's. I was overjoyed. We talked for a while. He was cool but a bit too cold... That discouraged me even though I knew he would be like that.
He seemed annoyed by me even though his friends insisted that that was his normal face. And he was a bit uncomfortable around me. I just walked away, looked for some friends who were selling at the artist alley, buried myself into their arms and cried for two hours. How could I have done such a stupid thing?
After they reassured me, I redid my makeup and apologized to him. He said it was fine, he wasn't just used to my personality type and he wasn't upset at me. We had a couple pics together and then I went home.
Later on, in January this year, a library held a MHA event. I went cosplaying as Rei, Todoroki's mom. He was Aizawa as well. But when I saw him, he just said a very uncomfortable ""hi"" and dashed away. He ignored my presence. I was too scared to come up to him later.
I have mutual friends with him, all of them cosplayers. C is a tall guy and very strong, he's handsome and has a bright personality. B is a lovely single mom who has a boyfriend, P, who's also his friend. W is an artist, she's pretty chill too. R was a friend of mine prior to all of this.
One day, R and I met up and I talked to her about it. She said she knew A and that he was an awesome guy, even told me some stories from their mutual past. He seemed chill.
Time passes. A pops up in C's and W's Facebook posts every now and then. Whenever he does... I get anxiety just by reading his name. My heart begins pounding and I get uneasy and scared. Once A and I had a very cordial conversation in a comment thread about Aizawa, where I apologized again for my behavior and it all seemed fine. That left me shaking with fear for a good half an hour afterwards.
I found his cosplay Insta and began following him because his work is amazing. I sometimes like his pics or leave a comment (which he does give a like or reply sometimes) but I rarely approach him. I've called him Senpai (which is kinda like someone you look up to) and he doesn't seem mad by it but he doesn't seem thrilled as well.
Last night, I saw a pic where A and P were posing in cosplay with A's girlfriend (They were Aizawa, Present Mic and Ms Joke). They looked great. I then proposed to them to make a cosplay team with all the pro heroes from the series. I regretted the decision almost immediately. To think of having to be near him or talk to him made me anxious again and I got weak knees and a very strong need to cry.
I made a status about it, and B came commenting to tell me A was a lovely guy and that he was pretty chill, and that I needed to get over this fear because it's irrational and it's doing me a lot of emotional damage. She wanted me to approach him. I just said nothing.
After that, I made a long post about a law that's being discussed here (about making history an optional subject) and I got a good reception. Today while I was on my way home, I saw his post on the topic (it was public, I don't have him added, but C shared it) and he started off telling that my arguments were a bit... Not to his taste. (He didn't mention me but he mentioned arguments similar to my points of view from my post, just that)
 
That alone made me uneasy again and I arrived home and decided to write this because I don't know what to do anymore. I think he's such a great person, he's very clever, he's amazing. But I have a feeling that if he knows me, he'll hate me because our first encounter was awful and I don't want him to stick with the stupid fangirl he saw that day. I also have depression and anxiety issues and I don't want him to think I'm a nuisance when I vent or when I need help. I don't want him to be annoyed by me but I'll never know unless I know him but I don't want him to because he deserves better.

103,"About two years ago my brother was diagnosed with Psychosis and border line schizophrenia. He has been treated and hospitalised previously however it was under the mental health as he did not consent to treatment. Since then unfortunately he can not be forced into treatment and he refuses to seek medical advice as he does not believe he has any mental health illness and strongly believes that he has been misdiagnosed. My brother also is extremely drug dependant and will use any form of drugs he can get his hands on to escape reality I assume. It has gotten to a point where our belongings within our own home is no longer safe and we have needed to implement a safe in our rooms to make sure he does not steal anything. My mum and I also need to lock our room doors and need to carry our handbags everywhere we go even just to the toilet/shower or getting a glass of water as we have learned that at every opportunity he will try and steal our money/credit cards. My brothers condition is getting worse and worse apart from the substance abuse he has become obsessed with a conspiracy theory that his mind is being controlled by the government through the utilisation of electronic mind control weaponry to which he believe he is a victim of this experiment. He has made attempts to contact our countries governing bodies such as the ASIO, Attorney general, etc and has even attempted to make contact with our prime minister. The prime ministers office received his letter and referred him to mental health and my brother now believes they're conspiring against him and attempting to misdiagnose him so that the government can discredit his claims. My brother has also on multiple occasions at random told my mum and myself that our family is in danger and that some is coming to kill us with genuine fear in his eyes. My brothers condition has put a lot of strain on our family and unfortunately my dad could not hack all of this and has left our family. My brother believes that the reason my dad left us is because he is now also conspiring with the governments.  Though my dad is still supporting us financially it breaks my heart to see my mum getting emotionally strained needing to deal with her marriage separation and needing to care for my brother at the same time. My brother still continues to receive Centrelink (government payments) fortnightly and this is something my family cannot stop, this has allowed my brother to continue his drug dependency. Both my mum and I have tried very hard to convince him to seek help even if its not for his mental health but for his drug dependence however my brother denies that has neither a drug problem or a mental health issue. We really don't want my brother to be like this forever but we've exhausted everything we can think of. Has anyone experienced anything like this with a friend or a family or has any advice for my mum and I so we can best help my brother climb out of this hole he is in.

106,"I (M39) and my wife (F29) have been having issues with a number of my friends (mainly F38 to 40).

I posted about it here: [Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bopjfd/found_out_my_friends_have_been_lying_to_us_for_2/) &amp; [Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/bnx582/my_mother_has_been_contacting_my_friends_to_bitch/).

Anyway, last weekend we went to another one of my friends' 40th, my wife offered to print and do up the photo board, but we knew things were gonna be a bit frosty. We got there were thank for coming, thank for doing the photo thing and that was about it with the 3 main ones causing the issues.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of others we just had a few chats, kept the night about other things and not let what was going on get in the way. We're being the bigger ones here.

My best mate got there with his wife and kids, the wife is one of the ones we're having issues with. For the first 20 or so minutes we chatted about nothing, he was called inside to help with the baby and didn't say a word to us for the rest of the night. He almost came over a couple of times and you could tell his wife wasn't happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, its my 40th this weekend, it was planned long before last weekend. One of the girls this morning just changed for ""going"" to ""not going"" on the facebook event. I find out that my best mate is at least playing golf with me next weekend, but no idea if he's coming, his wife is not and hasn't said anything, another mate is playing golf, is coming to the party, but his girlfriend who I've been friends with for 30 years isn't.

I feel like saying something, I feel like telling them that if they don't come they're throwing away 30 years of friendship, I feel like saying that at least with my best mates wife that she's using any excuse to get out of doing something for us.

I'm already taking a break from them for a while, but I need help with what I should do about next weekend.

Right now I am 18, and in june, I'll 19 years old.
I am fit, and I just tried joining the Army to become a Military police. AIT didnt go too well, lets just say that. I am now sitting at home, trying to make something out of streaming. But I think I am getting too into it. I'm currently living at my uncles house in his basement with a decent set up for entertainment, but at the same time I am currently unemployed. I don't know what I want to do with my own life.

I wanted to do music, but right now I am not feeling the motivation for music. I dont know if I'm just burnt out, or if it is because of this streaming thing.

I do not have a girlfriend, and I have never had one. 
I saw a picture on r/motivation that was talking about how some people get addicted to being alone, and im starting to think that I have done that to myself. 

I wanted to go to college to study music and to have a degree or something in music theory, and aswell as some sort of degree in fixing music equipment, but im scared that I will just waste money. I dropped out of high school and I have my GED, which probably wasn't a smart choice at all, but at least I have my GED... 

I could rejoin the Army and try another MOS since the discharge I received wasn't harsh or serious, It was just a general discharge for failure to adapt. But I hear the Army is rolling out a new PT test and I'm scared I wouldn't be able to pass it.

117,"... and I think he likes me too.

If you asked me if I would ever feel this way 3 years ago, I would have scoffed but here I am.

So... here’s how it started (warning: long story):

I first met my cousin when we were very little. My aunt and him came to visit our country for holiday (so yes we didn’t grow up together). Back then, he would bully me even if I’m older by a few months. And I didn’t like him at all cause I thought he was just a meanie. And after that visit, we never kept in contact for several years.

And then my grandma (from my mom’s side 😔) passed away and we went to the funeral at my mother’s country of origin and the ‘cousin’ was there. By now, I’m already an adult and so is he, obviously, and I notice how different we were compared to when we were kids. He was nice now and not a trace of the meanie from when we were kids. We got to talking and at some point I told him how much I loved the country where he and his mom (my aunt) migrated to and that I want to visit soon. He was very enthusiastic about letting me (and the other cousins) stay over at their place. Just a normal conversation, nothing our of the ordinary.

And then it came time to sleep and we cousins had to share a room and of all the beds, mine was next to his. We sleep. The next morning as I wake I realize I’m sleeping on my side and as I slowly open my eyes, I see my cousin staring at me so intensely (as if I was the first girl he’s ever seen and he’s studying my face thoroughly). I briefly held his gaze thinking nothing of it (morning brain) and I went back to sleep. When I woke up again I felt weird. Something had shifted and I was suddenly uncomfortable around him but it wasn’t that I didn’t want to be either. He suddenly seemed, really attractive to me and I started having this internal struggle.

We stayed in my mom’s country a little longer and hung out in groups, talked more (albeit being slightly awkward), and we made plans to visit him soon in his own country the next year. All the while, I felt there was something between us that hung in the air. We said our goodbyes in due time and a year passed.

Flash forward to this year: Me and my sibling plus a couple of other cousins finally meet up ‘the cousin’ at his own country. By now, the weird feelings from before have somewhat fizzled and all is normal for a time being... but then I notice him staring at me again... when I’m not looking and also when I caught him doing it, we held our gazes for an ample of time. He wasn’t able to always join us during the trip but when he did I noticed that he teased me alot, made me laugh, and we just would touch each other (innocently, nothing sexual) alot in a way that he didn’t with my other cousins who are also female. Our body language was undeniable, basically. Whenever my female cousins talked about me having a boyfriend or possibly getting together with one of ‘the cousin’s’ roomates jokingly, he’d laugh abit but wouldn’t contribute to the conversation. I also noticed that he would help me all the time with my luggage and with whatever he could (although that could just be that he’s a gentlemen).

The last day we spent together before me and my sibling flew back was even more pronounced. We visited a museum and he took the liberty of being my personal camera man and constantly took pictures of me whenever I asked. As such, he always stood next to me and it would have seemed as if we were a couple as we waited in line for certain attractions. He’d placed his hand on the small of my back when the line moved and our arms just remain against each other. We laughed and had a great time and even though it wasn’t just the two of us, it felt like it was a date.

At this point, my feelings are strong and I sense it’s the same for him. But then we go back home after hugs of goodbye and now I feel empty and don’t know what to do. I know I have feelings for him and I know it’s wrong but why does it feel right when I’m with him? Maybe I’m just reading this whole situation wrong and he’s just a nice guy and I’m being stupid. Either way, I don’t know what to do with what I’m feeling. Help me.

Tldr: I have feelings for my cousin and I think he has feelings for me too and Idk what to do.",27May2019,2

121,"As the title suggests, my girlfriend and I are looking for a new place and we found one on Craigslist we really liked. Now, to preface why we have trust issues, a few weeks prior we found an apartment that we liked and we responded with my phone number. Lo and behold, we didn’t hear anything back and we soon found out that not only was the place not for rent but it was not even in our state. I kept getting scam calls a few days after so I deduced that that’s all that was; a scam. 

Now this time around, we found a place with the correct address and we were even able to see it from the outside and through the windows. It looked exactly as the pictures suggested. Problem is, the landlord says because of his “absence” he is unable to do a walk-through but is willing to sign anyone to a lease upon review of a rental application. Our communication thus far has only been email. My girlfriend voiced her concern about  not being able to see the apartment beforehand but that we’re willing to sign if everything is to be what we expect. She asked him to clarify what we would be paying for (utilities and such) as his description was somewhat contradicted. He only responded “sounds good” and attached a generic rental application form. What legal rights do we have and what recourse should we take to avoid any malicious intent, if any? We really like what we see but we fear we are putting ourselves in a risky situation.",27May2019,3

&amp;#x200B;

So I will be graduating high school this year. Sounds like yay, and I can't wait to get rid of the soul sucking experience that is high school.... but the thing is i have no damn idea what im gonna do next year.

\*Disclaimer\* I know what I want to do with my life, Ive luckily discovered my passion early on- which is that I want to be a singer/make music and preform and also to write novels (right now ya genre)... but i have absolutely no idea how im gonna make that work. My family all wanted me go to university- firstly for sciences, but they have tolerated me doing arts but idk what they will say because I don't really want to get a degree.

 There is no program that gives me what I want and I don't really thrive in school environments. My parents in particular get this more, but they still want me to go. I got in to one program but it was my last choice. It's really not a good option for me, but part of me is so reluctant about this because since high school started ive been told that its the only way to be successful or happy- but then why do I not feel like its gonna benefit me or make me happy? 

There is many times i wish that i had a different dream with a path that people understood more... I know there is many out there that are following my dream or ones in the arts like me but right now  I dont know anybody. This keeps me up and makes me so sad on top of my depression and its such a mindf\*ck for me.

So what was I going to do besides going to school? I was planning to take a gap year to work on my art, Ive been practicing singing alot and have been doing covers and soundcloud and i thought that would help me get noticed a bit but nothing has worked. I have no damn idea how to make this work... same with writing ive been working away on my book but ive researched and found ways to get published but i have to finish it first which is such a big commitment, especially because school is getting into stress season. Im lost and I dont even know if thats a good option either.

Ive been looking at alternatives and I found good courses in the con ed that are only part time actually from the school I got in too and im not sure about it because i dont really know what con ed is and it seems like its just for people who are older/in the workforce/already have a degree and im worried i wont fit in there, either then that it seems pretty good but...

I also found a program in a college near me that sounds like what I want for music, which is the main thing im interested in and in a location i like but the catch is that regular admissions are closed... they are still putting people on the waitlist- and it costs money to apply. I might have a bit more chance cause i have a low 80s average in university classes- but im not sure and I dont want to rely on this. 

I just really wish everything would work out because its messing me up. I have been told that i am young and have time to figure it out, and yes i do but I also really want to start because writing makes me really happy and has been my dream since i was little, but mainly music is one of the few things that makes me feel not empty. Idk how to explain but you know when something makes you feel so alive? 

Okay so Im gonna wrap this up because this post is so long. Thank you for reading I appreciate it so much! I know this is confusing and im trashy but i really didnt know what else to do. So, this comes to does anyone have any advice? About music, wirting, con ed, colleges or literally just anything? Im just really stuck right now...",27May2019,1
126,"I found these texts between them. They literally talk every so often and he texts her way more info than she texts him. They’ve met up a few times in real life. Is he stringing her along? 

Her: Hey so is there like zero chance of whatever between us being like a thing? Like you’re very happy with your relationship and want something strictly platonic here?

Him: Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation.

Her: So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

Him: I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth

Her: that’s fine. I won’t pressure you to talk anymore. Have a good night 

Him: have a good night! When I get on vacation we can talk! 

* a month later 

Her: Ok well this number will expire soon so when you want to you’ll have to reach out using my actual number.

Him: Okay I understand. I will reach out on your number then. Graduation is next week and after that I'm much more available to talk. Probably the last week of May will be a good time for me or anytime after then too if that doesn't work with your schedule! 

Her: You literally have all summer so no rush at all. Just wanted to let you know that info cause I can’t reach out besides on this.

Him: Okay well I appreciate you giving me such flexibility and very chill about it in general! 
I also appreciate you letting me know that was going to happen with this number! Thank you! 
I hope you're doing well and we'll talk soon!",27May2019,0

So, title gets a lot out of the way. Couple of things to note though. 
1. I don't want to go into specifics, just know that it is a quickly progressing mental illness. I won't be able to handle most any job in this time, but physically I can do some stuff. 
2. I have pretty much nothing to my name. $600 and a laptop is all I've got.
3. I don't have really any friends or family. My parents are basically gone, and I've always struggled to keep friendships going.
4. I'm transgender and I don't think I pass personally. I think I'm too tall, my shoulders too broad, my brow too prominent, and a whole bunch of other bad stuff. I just wanted to through this out there for safety reasons. Make sure you don't ask me to go some place or do something that doesn't take kindly to trans people.

Instead of wearing my work clothes, I wore something a little bit more revealing. I walk into the bar see him and his friends so I say hey!

132,"Hi everyone.  I’d like to first say that this is going to be a bit long winded and for anyone that decides to read, I really appreciate you.   I’m going to have to split this up into categories for this to be cohesive.  I’ll be going in this order: 

-Background information
-Incident 
-Problems stemming from the incident

The Backstory

Starting with some basic background information.  I am a 24 year old male living with my mom, two step sisters and five cats (relevant later.)  There is a stepfather in the picture, but he and my mother live separately.  Ordinarily I have a decent to great relationship with all of my family members, but recently (2 years) my mom is going through what I’ll call a mid-life crisis.  She and my step dad have never gotten along and are as separated as they can be without actually getting a divorce.   My step sisters and mother also do not get along at all.  They’re teenagers in high school and act exactly how they’re supposed to act, but my mom cannot take this coupled with her marital troubles.  She turns to the bottle because of this.  She’s always drank wine with her dinner, but as of the past two years she has been drinking heavily nearly every single night.  She sees absolutely nothing wrong with her drinking and will even flat out deny she’s drunk when she is clearly heavily intoxicated.  She acts incredibly offended when I even SUGGEST she is drunk.  I think it’s also important to note that she does not have a job and hasn’t for almost 17 years now.  Possibly more.  My step father and I are the entirety of the income for my family.  However, he covers all the expenses and has let me save money.  I am so grateful for him allowing me to do that, but he can’t keep it up.  My mom eats through money with her addiction like nothing in this world.  My step dad lives off ravioli and water while she parties every night.  I’ve even had to step in and lend my family money because of a DUI she received.  My step dad just can’t keep up with all of the fees.  My mother’s spiral with alcohol has deteriorated her relationship with my sisters (previously great), landed her a DUI and a night in jail,  checked her into a metal hospital twice for suicidal threats (I called the cops), and gotten her involved with some less than stellar influences in the form of “friends.”  She doesn’t even show up to take my sisters to school some mornings because she’s MIA from one of her nights out.  She doesn’t even take care of the cats as well as they should be taken care of.  I’ve always helped out, but I’ve basically taken over the cat care because I’m afraid she’ll forget about them.  She hasn’t yet, but still.  I could go on, but you get the picture.  She’s in bad shape and I have been her biggest cheerleader her entire life.  She owes me 1500 dollars from the DUI incident alone.  It cost my step dad thousands of dollars in legal fees.  I’ve always been willing to step in for her sake and try to get her on the right track.  Months and months in therapy on separate occasions thrown down the drain because she always refuses to go eventually.  The bottom line is I’ve been at my wits end with all of this on my plate.  I feel like a caretaker and I’m tired of it.  I can’t help somebody who doesn’t want help.  Two nights ago was the straw that broke the camels back.  

The Incident 

My mom must have just finished one of her nights out at a bar with one of her alcoholic friends, because I heard her come home at 2:30 AM.  I walked out of my room and expect to see my mother in a drunken stupor, so I was going to help her get in bed and turn out all of the lights because I have work at 7 AM the next morning.  Instead of my mom I’m greeted by two VERY drunk guys rummaging around in my kitchen and opening our patio door.  I have five cats.  One of which is almost all black.  I can’t afford to have drunk people opening and closing my doors at almost 3 AM.  My mom rounds the corner and I immediately look at her and tell her I’m not comfortable with what’s happening here.  I have literally never seen these people before in my life and I should have been asleep hours ago.  There’s no way I can sleep worrying about my cats getting out or my mom passing out and then these two creeps finding their ways to my sisters rooms.  I just can’t have it.  I hold my ground and tell her all of the reasons that this isn’t okay and she deflects every single one of them getting ANGRY AT ME.  She says I’m ruining her life.  Meanwhile these two guys are acting soooo sketchy and stand off-ish.  They keep trying to touch me and tell me to respect my mom.  One of them even says “he’s not an idiot he knows why we’re here, dude.”  So disgusting, but whatever.  She’s a grown woman she can do whatever she wants in her house.  Her name and my step dads are on the lease.  HOWEVER.  I was NOT comfortable in this situation.  I begged her to get these people out of the house.  I offered to call them an Uber.  Anything I could think of without threatening anything.  I finally get them outside and I lock every door in the house and make sure they can’t get back inside.  But that doesn’t end things.  They stick around and one of them goes around and starts banging on my sliding glass doors while flicking me off.  My poor girlfriend who struggles with anxiety is having a meltdown at this point and is begging me to call the cops.  So i do.  I call the police because I’m not willing to risk anything in this day and age and things weren’t dissipating.  My mom hears me on the phone with the police through the garage door, tells the two guys and they all peel off (STILL VERY DRUNK) in two cars.  The police come and I tell them everything that happened.  They say they’ll look around the property and ask if we feel okay here.  I tell them yeah we’re just shaken up but we’ll be good.  I made sure everything was locked up and we didn’t sleep at all that night.  I called out of work and got yelled at by them (amazing, right?) and that was that.  

The Problems Stemming from the Incident 

In one night my mom completely shredded away any respect or faith that I still had in her.  I’ve spent years fighting and rooting for this person.  She was my rock at one point in my life.  But she ignored me completely when I told her I was uncomfortable with having these people in our house.  I never ask anything from her and I never have anyone over at my place, but she refused my one request when I was scared to death.  Now I can’t even feel safe in my own home.  There will always be a possibility that she’ll bring some random asshole with questionable intentions into our home.  But it wasn’t about me.  I had two high school aged sisters in the house.  My girlfriend was here.  What could have happened if I wasn’t around at that particular  moment in time?  Sometimes I go to the gym at 2 AM because I like having the place to myself.  I may have been in a situation where I was able to do nothing about this and that TERRIFIES me.  All it takes is my mom passing out and those two guys have the entire house to themselves.  Ever since then I don’t feel safe in my own home knowing she could let people I know nothing about back in here at any time.  It’s not okay with me.  I know I have zero authority here, but at this point I am 100x more responsible than she is.  But I can’t control what she does.  I don’t want to.  I want out, everyone.  My girlfriend and I are looking for places now, but I’m going to have to separate my cats because of this.  She’s really attached to two of them in particular and I intend to let her keep them, but three of them favor me and more importantly they favor each other.  I can’t split them up.  The idea of splitting any of them up in general is tearing my heart up, guys.  I feel like I’ve chosen the right pairings of cats to stay and go, but I have no way of knowing what they want or if I’m right or wrong.  Many will say they’re just animals, but I’m such an empathetic person.  It’s hard to separate myself from asking how it would affect their lives as well.  I would love to take all five, but I don’t think any apartment will allow any more than 3 cats and that number is a stretch even still.  My girlfriend and I make around 1000 to 1300 a month each, so money might be tight.  The places we’re looking at are around 700-800 for one bedroom.  I don’t know anything about apartment searching so she’s trying to help.  I think it’s also important to note that if I leave, my sisters will go to their dads.  The only reason they’re still with my mom is because I’m here if anything happens.  If that happens I’ll also make sure my sisters get the other two cats.  It sounds stupid, but the cats are almost my number one priority here.  Tied with my and my sisters safety.  

I guess at the end of the day I’m just asking if I’m doing the right thing here?  Am I right to separate these animals and uproot their lives?  Am I right to have reacted the way that I did?  I just need to take a step back and hear another perspective before I make more decisions.  

Thanks for your time.  

TL;DR
Mother has betrayed my trust and patience for the final time.  Completely disregards my feelings.  I no longer feel safe in my own home.  But moving out means separating my animals.  Am I justified in feeling the way that I do?  Am I doing the right thing?",27May2019,1

134,"I met this guy on reddit, around January. We’ve been talking on discord and he’s very clingy, and also I’m noticing some red flags for guilt tripping and manipulation. He has a personality disorder. He only ever talks about himself and complains all the time. As someone who isn’t very good with emotions, it stresses me out. He texts me everyday and I think he thinks we’re best friends. 

How do I leave this friendship? Should I just block him? It’s the point where every time he texts me I’m irritated and ignore him anyways, because I can’t handle the emotional stress and manipulation/guilt tripping. It’s like I’m sort of scared of him.",27May2019,1
135,"My mom and grandmother suddenly told me I can get a cat the thing is, I don’t want one anymore I asked for a cat 1-2 years ago now that i’m fifteen I don’t want one because of the responsibility. Plus i have asthma and learned i’m affraid of cats after holding one. 

I've told my mom and everything but she says to keep quiet because grandma is excited which i don’t understand since my grandma is allergic to cats cant get anywhere near one. 

They say its my responsibility to take care of it when we get it , and to keep it in my room since again allergies - grandma. we're getting the cat from my aunt. They got cat stuff already i told my mom before they bought them but she shut me down. I really don’t want a cat i even cried about it a bit dramatic honestly. We already have a dog i don’t understand why they want another animal in the house when they don’t even pay attention to a living human being (me) ive had a cold for 6 months , stomachache for 3 months and light headedness everytime i stand up after sitting for more than 10 minutes.

136,"I moved to a major city in a different state for uni; I'm in my third year now and it's been two years since I last saw most people from my high school. 

Yesterday, an acquaintance from high school messaged me saying he was in town and wanted to meet up - a guy I've had ok conversations with, but I still wouldn't classify him as a friend, we didn't keep in touch at all after HS. I was bored at home last night and there was a ball game in the city so I said yes, sure. We met at around 9pm and I thought it was going to be silent and awkward, since we didn't have much in common/to talk about. 

But BOY was i wrong! He said stuff like:

\- what's your favourite sex position?

\- how many men did you fck since we last saw each other?

\- how was sex with x?? and y?? and z?? oh z told me about all the stuff you guys did

\- you have the most beautiful eyes. they're like the window to your soul

\- (pushed my hair back) you have the silkiest smooth hair

\- which guy wouldn't want to have sex with you? you're hot as fuck!

\- (incessantly tries to force me to go to a dispensary and smoke a joint with him)

\- he kept forcing me to sit very close to him by moving towards me every time i moved away

\- he forced me to stay out until about 2am, and then insisted on walking me home, after which he tried to convince me to let him come into my house for about HALF AN HOUR! it was just so difficult to get away from him and i've never felt preyed on like that in my own city!

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind my body language was showing that i was extremely uncomfortable, to the point that two girls from a group nearby came and asked whether i was okay.

FYI i'm not attracted to this guy at ALL! I would say that I'm used to getting male attention, but not from people this forward! (I hope this isn't politically incorrect but idgaf at this point: chubby sweaty guys are FAR from my type)

Now, he's forcing me to meet again and he's saying that he'll show up and my building/work if I don't go out with him.

Should I message him and tell him that I'm uncomfortable? Should I just block him everywhere? (He's doing an internship in my city so he's gonna be here a couple months)

I'm scared that if i message him he might get violent or physically try to harm me",27May2019,1
137,"I am 17. I have had very little experience with girlfriends in my years, and I usually focus on one female every year or so. This girl and I have been flirting and talking romantically for 3+ months, and things have been going great. We have both confessed strong feelings for each other, and we decided mutually a month ago to not put a label on anything and not to rush into anything. I have never felt so strongly about a girl as I do with her. Recently we had a talk about the state of our ""relationship"" and where we plan to go. I am ready to date her, and she says she wants to but needs to focus on self love first before she can dedicate herself to another person. I said I understood that but I don't plan to wait forever and I am ready whenever she is. Since then she has texted me less and less, been much less interactive in person, and never seems to want to carry on long conversations like we used to daily. I feel extremely strong about her, and I want the best for her, but I worry that she will never really be ready, at least not with me. She texts other guys and claims it isn't romantic, but after seeing some messages she sends them, I can't help but feel that it's flirty. I guess I just need advice on what to do from here. I don't want to leave this girl in the dust when she needs it, but I feel like she doesn't need me as much as she thinks she does, and she doesn't want me like she used to. I also feel like I could be much happier than I am now if I moved on, but part of me can't even fathom life without her. Any advice is appreciated.",27May2019,1
138,"So this morning my aunt (who has harassed me for almost 4 years and has been to jail multiple times for possession, dui's, and theft) came into my room in my grandpas house and woke me up. She told me I needed to call my grand father who is currently 74 years old and in the hospital. I said ""okay, hand me the phone"". She threw it to me and I began to call him. I was only in my underwear and felt uncomfortable because she was just standing in my door way staring at me. I told her to shut my door, she refused. I told her once more to get out, she refused again. Then my grandpa (the homeowner) answered and I asked him to tell her to get out of my room, I put the phone on speaker and he told her to get out. She claimed, ""I'm not standing in your room"". So I said fuck it, I stood up (only in my underwear) and shut the door, when I did it seemed like she leaned into it. She then opened my door up and I slammed it shut, once again she leaned into. She then proceeded to leave the house, I talked to my grandpa and then hung up. Then when I was about to walk out the door her 6'4'' 350 pound husband came walking over from her house which is next door all pissed off like. He yelled, ""what the hell do you think you're doing"". I said, ""leaving to go to the hospital"". He then got in my face and looked like he was ready to fight, I then decided to give up all my fucks I had left and squared up, I put my hands behind my back and said swing multiple times. I was ready to fight. My aunt was standing on her porch recording the whole thing on her phone. He then said he wasn't going ot hit me and that he would go to jail and then told me to hit him, I said ""you're the one walking over here all bad and shit like you're going to do something, so do it pussy"". He then asked me why I laid my hands on his wife. I got confused and said ""I don't know what you're talking about"". He told me she had a mark running up and down her fore arm from where I grabbed her. I tried multiple times explaining to him what happened and he refused to listen. I finally said fuck it, believe what you want to believe. He then went on to say they are thinking about calling the police on me. I told him I don't give a shit, do what you gotta do but don't come over here acting like you're gonna do something and then puss out. He finally calmed down and we went out separate ways. I'm just curious on what my chances of actually going to jail are?

139,"This is kind of long, and I didn't know where else to ask, so I apologize if I'm in the wrong place.

&amp;#x200B;

Between 2001-2003 (I can't remember exactly, those years are a blur to me), I was pretty heavily into drugs and ended up having sex with a girl I knew (We'll call her ""Jenny""). It wasn't rape, and I didn't try to stop it, but I certainly wasn't in any condition to consent. Roughly 8 months later, she called me and said she had my baby. The situation was very shady...at first she wouldn't identify a gender, it seemed too early to have given birth (I'm aware it was possible, just seemed off), then she said it was a son, switched it to a daughter, back to a son...and refused to agree to a paternity test. We basically called bullshit, and I didn't hear from her again for a few more months. Then one day she calls again, says she didn't want anything from me, but wanted me to be able to know our baby. She still wouldn't say what gender, and acted very weird about it. She said she would send me pics of the baby, and got my address from me. Nothing ever came, and she never contacted me again. My family and I determined that she was lying, trying to get money out of me. (She too was a junkie, and a known manipulator.)

&amp;#x200B;

Today, one of her cousin's that I knew for many years (but hadn't had any contact with since around that time) showed up in my suggested friends feed on Facebook. Feeling nostalgic, I clicked on his profile, and immediately in \*his\* friends was ""Jenny"". I don't know what compelled me to click on her profile, but I did, and found out that she has a daughter that is nearing 18 years old. The girl \*does\* share some resemblance to me, and though I'm unsure of her exact age, I know that she's between 16-18 years old. She had her own profile, and searching both ""Jenny's"" and her profile showed no evidence of a father.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads me to question if \*I'm\* the father, and ""Jenny"" had been telling me the truth, despite her shady antics. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm having is, neither ""Jenny"" nor this girl have contacted me, or anyone associated with me (we share various friends via Facebook), and this girl honestly seems like she has a pretty happy and stable life. She's working, she finished school, and is prepping for college. She has a steady boyfriend...she seems content.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should get involved. What if I'm not the dad? What if I am, and she's already dealt with that pain and I would be re-opening old wounds? What kind of chaos could I be starting in her life if I were to announce my presence? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some way to anonymously find out if she already has a dad? Am I reading \*wayyy\* too into this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me wants to know...for my own peace of mind, perhaps for her peace of mind. Another part of me can see that I'm just flat out \*not\* a part of her existence, and I don't want to upend her life just to find out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've very lost on this subject, and don't know what the right course of action is. I don't know how to say it without sounding like an asshole, but I don't know her, and don't need to...not if she's happy and doesn't need to know me. But if there's any chance that she's always wondered, or needs me, I \*do\* want to provide that...but I just don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated it.

\*Note. While I was a drug addict back then, over the years I straightened my life out, got married, have three beautiful kids and a good job.

140,"Should I be worried about these texts between my bf and his ex? 
I found these texts between them. They literally talk every so often and he texts her way more info than she texts him. They’ve met up a few times in real life. Is he stringing her along? 

Her: Hey so is there like zero chance of whatever between us being like a thing? Like you’re very happy with your relationship and want something strictly platonic here?

Him: Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation.

Her: So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

Him: I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth

Her: that’s fine. I won’t pressure you to talk anymore. Have a good night 

Him: have a good night! When I get on vacation we can talk!

Her: Ok well this number will expire soon so when you want to you’ll have to reach out using my actual number.

Him: Okay I understand. I will reach out on your number then. Graduation is next week and after that I'm much more available to talk. Probably the last week of May will be a good time for me or anytime after then too if that doesn't work with your schedule! 

Her: You literally have all summer so no rush at all. Just wanted to let you know that info cause I can’t reach out besides on this.

Him: Okay well I appreciate you giving me such flexibility and very chill about it in general! 
I also appreciate you letting me know that was going to happen with this number! Thank you!

146,"Sorry for the formatting in advance.

So I am currently on a vacation trip and it’s all around uncomfortable. The guy we are on the trip with is a family friend and he’s here to explore caves with us with his mom. I’ve never met him before so this is my first impressions.

He’s been extremely just, out there? At dinner he asked me strange questions like: Is there anyone you’re flirting with, Do you have a boyfriend, Any crushes? Etc. This was multiple questions. I just shrugged it off as he’s very awkward and I guess he just didn’t know boundaries. This was in front of my parents btw, an important detail.

The next day, he kept on touching me on the shoulders. I pulled away every-time uncomfortably. He even swatted for flies and “accidentally swatted my ass”. When I looked at him expecting an apology he laughed and I tried to look like it wasn’t funny. The touching continues, and once we’re out of the cave he makes it a huge deal to ask for my number IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS.  Of course I have to give it to him. 

Another important note to add, whenever he sat by me (which was every-time) he had to squeeze uncomfortably close to me, and this is uncomfortable as in I wouldn’t even squeeze this close to my favorite person in the worlds 

Later that evening, at dinner again, he asks me for all my social media. Yet again, my parents are there. I told him that I wasn’t active on any and my parents did not get the memo. They even encouraged him.

I’m pretty fed up with this and I’m not interested in being friends with a 27 year old. Yeah, maybe I could be nicer about it but most of these interactions are the only interactions I’ve had with him all trip. I’ve been trying to give him the cold shoulder but it’s not working and I’m overly uncomfortable. Telling my parents wouldn’t work because they literally would not believe it, they think he’s a saint.",27May2019,2
147,"Hey everyone, never thought reddit would be the only place I could turn to but I'm honestly glad it's here, I need a little help. As a child/teenager, I always bounced around from being extremely extroverted and trying to be friends with everyone and being extremely introverted and independent, ok with spending long amounts of time on my own. Once I got to high school, I was in one of those more introverted phases and my sophomore year, some guys I ran cross country with just decided that they wanted me to hang out with them. So they got me to put down the controller and actually get out of the house and start trying new things, and it worked, for a time. They got me to overcome some of that shyness and fear and even got me to talk to a few girls. Only problem was every time I became interested in any of the girls they all just lost feelings immediately pretty much. I've only been in one serious relationship before, during my senior year. The girl was great and we had some good times or whatever but she never was all that interested in me, and had on several occasions led me on to try to get to my best friend before we started dating. She ended the relationship right after I graduated because I had decided to go hang out with some girls that had been friends of mine for nearly 5 years while she was at work. It always just seemed like an excuse to get out of the relationship, and she begun having sex with my best friend shortly after. This spiraled me into a pretty heavy depression that I have been on and off (currently off) medication for since, and after a few more incidents of girls choosing other new friends over me at the beginning of college, I pretty much stopped talking to women altogether. I started smoking waaaay too much weed and that was pretty much all I did besides drink and study for the next year. I moved in to my fraternity's house at the beginning of my sophomore year of college, hoping it could help me become more social and outgoing again, but I've completely lost my ability to approach new people of either gender without crippling anxiety or distrust. This has led to most of the 50 guys I live with not wanting to hang out with me ever, and me just chilling in my single room by myself because my roommate moved out to get away from me. I'm extremely lonely and depressed most days, to the point where I cannot focus my thoughts at all and will just lay there for hours instead of doing what I need to do for the day. Most of the conversations I have are just a ""what's up"" in passing, and it seems like no one I live with cares if I am alive or not. I don't smoke weed anymore and I try to have fun at our social events and be outgoing but no matter what I just get ignored. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I reverse this downward spiral? I honestly just feel like giving up every day but I don't because I know it would hurt my mother. I go to therapy for the social anxiety and depression but it's just not helping...

148,"To preface this, I have been friends with this girl for about two to three months before the incident i’m about to explain happened. While time is relative and in some cases doesn’t matter, I just wanted to put that in the back of everyone’s mines before they read what happened. Also, I know this is so minuscule and not the biggest problem in the world but I am unsure what to do... hence me seeking advice. i’ll give backstory and then comes the advice seeking...

So I’ve been talking to this guy for a while, I really like him, so I tell my friend how much I like him (this is a big thing for me as she knows i never open up to liking guys or show feeling towards people often).

 I went home from school for the summer with plans to continue to talk to this guy (who stayed at school for the summer) and she (who also stayed at school) knew of these plans for me to continue to talk to him.  

So, her and this guy are friends and they hang out every now and then, normally in a group setting, but the last two times she’s managed ways to hang with him alone. The first time she strips naked in front of him and he immediately left and told me how odd it was. I thought it was weird too but didn’t want to make a big deal about it so i dropped it. 

The next night she gets him drunk and high and they have sex. Obviously shout out to her for showing me how much of a jerk her is but also.... she just had sex with the guy i like. I stop talking to her...tell her to go f*ck herself and block her on everything. (slightly dramatic but that’s my personality lol). I only found out because when he sobered up in the AM he called me and told me about it right away and even mentioned how she asked him not to tell me. 

SO, she emails me this week (a week after she slept with the dude i ~was~ talking to) a whole long apology about how she’s getting counseling and realizing how much our friendship means to her and how she took it for granted and wants me to give her a second chance. honestly a super sincere apology. 

HERE COMES ME ASKING FOR ADVICE.... I am a person with a very very forgiving heart and one to just be like f*ck it, and be friends with people again. Yet, sometimes that screws me over and honestly did she show me her true colors? should I not care? should i care? is this big enough to end a friendship? i’m honestly as a loss for what to do. I have not even responded to her apology yet and don’t even know how i would begin to respond.

151,"So back story

I’m 20, go to college and work part time at a grocery store. Big chain store and all. I work in a department that’s away from the others, and especially far from the front of the store. 

Now, I’m not a very shy person. I’m very outgoing and confident. Almost to a fault honestly. I’m friends with everyone at work, joke with all of them and no one has had a problem with me.

A couple weeks ago this new girl started working at the front and she is the cutest girl I’ve ever seen. She’s got a really cute smile and I make every excuse possible to go the front of the store to walk past her and work up the courage to talk to her.


I’ve dated plenty of people. That’s an odd thing to say but it’s what I’ve been thinking about.

I should have no problem walking up and talking to her. I’ve talked to so many women in my life, and have never been intimidated before.

But I can’t for the life of me begin to speak to her. She walked in front of me a couple times and looked at me a lot today and I swear I must have heard my heart in my ears.

I can’t even think to speak to her. I get near her and I loose every shred of confidence I have and can’t speak to her.

She’s so damn cute just perfect looking.

But when I attempt to even have a normal conversation, I feel like I’m about to pass out and I have to go away.

I’ve never ever felt like this towards a woman before. It’s really weird because again, I shouldn’t have a problem talking to her.

How do I overcome this and talk to her. I’m also really scared because I’m afraid if it doesn’t go well she’s gonna tell people that I’m wierd and asked her out. 

Or that I’m gonna try to talk to her and she’s gonna pretend to be nice and tell my friend (who works near her) that I tired talking to her and that I was an idiot and gross or something.",27May2019,1
152,"For starters, this happened when I was around four. I noticed that my dad would hurt my mom a lot and they would yell all the time. I walked in on my dad pulling out my mom’s hair once. I’ve watched my dad get held back by police. 

    They got divorced when I was seven and my dad locked my mom out of the house. My dad became very angry around this time. He would take it out on me and my oldest brother and scream at us. He refused to let me see my mom and lied to the court so she wouldn’t be allowed to see me. She didn’t have the money for a good lawyer so there was nothing she could do but try to text me. Of course, my dad blocked her on everything. 

   When I was 12 my dad kicked out my brother. Around this time I started getting very depressed. My dad beat me that year and I called the police on him and he got very angry. He lied to the police of course and they didn’t believe me even though I had marks on my face to prove it. My dad told them it was “self-inflicted” 

   My dad told his side of the family that I was a maniac and made up so many things about me and now they refuse to see me. My grandma told my dad to give me up for adoption and that hurt so badly. 

   When I was finally able to see my mom she told me how she was scared my dad would kill her. She told me one time he pinned her to the ground and started banging her head repeatedly. I had nightmares about my dad killing her when I was younger.

    I was in the hospital for a while for some suicide attempts at age 12 and 13 and my dad didn’t care. He was just mad about his insurance. 

    Everytime I see a therapist with him he twists my words and denies everything I say. He says I have delusions and he accused me of having autism once. I’m a very smart kid with a great memory and I know for sure I don’t have delusions.

     He managed to convince me that I was wrong for a while. I thought i was a shitty person for a long time until I watched an episode of a show where the same situation was happening and I realized that he really is a toxic person..

153,"So this is a symptom that I struggle from. I love makeup and it’s a beautiful way for me to practice self love. It’s one of the things I’m able to do for myself, free from self loathing. Most of the time when I take my makeup off, I feel even more beautiful. It’s amazing. I just wanted to say that because I’m so thankful for that. 

But there’s also this thing I do, that I did well before I even received my diagnosis: staring at makeup palettes. I just turn on a YouTube video in the background and stare at my makeup palettes, sometimes for more than an hour. It’s just so satisfying for me to see that some shadows are more used up than others. I’m just there alone, hunched over in my room in the dark, feeling nothing but dread and terror, unable to stop staring at makeup. And then ofc it’s time to binge to numb the pain. 

All of my most troubling OCD symptoms that I have are ones that I’ve almost never seen anyone ever talk about, and it’s so fucking isolating. I don’t even even believe that I have OCD in my heart of hearts, even though I have received a diagnosis. It just hasn’t gotten into my head. I don’t wash my hands over and over or count, but I am very careful where I step and I try to even put things a lot, but those symptoms are honestly nothing compared to the dread I feel from the ones that I’ve never come across anyone else having. 

I feel so low about this, and I’m frustrated, because one of the few things that I was able to have in my life that wasn’t polluted by mental illness, makeup, has become a stumbling block, just like everything else. 

Most of the things that I love to do involve some sort of OCD triggers. Sometimes the entire thing that I love is a trigger. I really truly don’t know how to enjoy things anymore. 

My therapist also told me straight up that being attracted to someone is a trigger for me. I can’t stop seeing boys in my dreams and the thoughts of boys distract everything I do. I don’t want to think of them a lot of the time, but then the thoughts persist and I become addicted to the high of fantasizing about them. Before I know it, all I can think about is the cute boy who works at CVS who is clearly interested in me too. This definitely also has to do with my sexual abuse-related PTSD. I can’t even enjoy being attracted to a boy because my PTSD kicks in and the PTSD thoughts persist with the repetition of OCD and before you know it I am looking at some random dude like he’s a monster. The guy at CVS is tall and big and strong and I don’t care if he wants to be nice to me. In my head all he wants to do is fuck me and hurt me and I often see images of these boys in my head hurting me. 

Poor guy doesn’t even have a shot. Even if he tried to reach out gently, I’d be too afraid to hold his hand. I’m so frustrated, because I am so traumatized that I can’t even hold a boy’s hand. I’m 19 years old and I’ve never kissed a boy, largely because my trauma has held me back from even getting to know a boy who I have feelings for. If I had a dime for every time I sabotaged a situation where I had chemistry with someone out of fear, I’d be able to pay my fucking student loan debt off. And all of this shit could’ve been stopped if my parents had just decided to stand up for me when I was 12 years old and told them that this boy wouldn’t stop touching me, even when I told him to stop. 

I love watching people my age being so comfortable with themselves in relationships, unafraid to let someone in. I’m so jealous, because they have no reason to have their guard up like mine. 

How the fuck is “being attracted to someone” triggering???? Like what the fuck even is that?!?! 

I have no idea how I’ll ever be able to get close to someone. To be honest, I don’t think my therapist knows either, and I’m so scared.

Doesn’t anyone have any advice on what to do in this situation, whether it be regarding, treatment, coping mechanisms, or anything else you can think of? I’m just looking to get better.",27May2019,3

I am 19 years old and in a sticky situation. Last night around 12 AM  i decided to step out of my apartment to quickly smoke some weed in my stairs. Which did not last more than 3-4 minutes because I had used a pipe. Once I was done, i proceeded to go to a lower floor and take the elevator up. One of my neighbors has a camera on her door which does not see anything besides who enters and exists the staircase. She might have seen me on her camera going into the stairs but i came out of the elevator. However, today she came to my house and told me she needed to discuss something with parents, and im guessing this has to do with me going into the stairs. I am having a anxiety attack because my parents have never suspected me of doing anything drug related and they would be very upset if they found out. My friends are telling me to just say I went to meet one of my friends downstairs and give them something like keys. She has no concrete evidence that it was me who smoked in the stairs.

Especially  because he knew I was hurting. but now looking back at it all I think I gave him the wrong impression I don’t know how to tell him that I was never ready for a relationship and I only agreed to go out with him because I felt comfortable around him and I thought that he asked me out because he was being a friend and not because he was trying to be next in line.   

And above it all I still think about my ex and frankly I’d get back with him if given the opportunity. And that also saddens me because I wouldn’t want my friend to take it wrong. But I never saw him more than a friend and I didn’t need anything more than that at this time. I only need friends. I need a support system not a new bf :( 

So how can I protect his feelings and my own too?",27May2019,0
164,"Hi, my names Lexie and I’m a female and I’m eleven years old (yes I know I’m young whatever) anyways sorry if there any grammatical errors or the spacing looks funny. (This is my first reddit post + this is on my tiny phone)

So, I feel like the title is pretty self explanatory but for context, I want to come out of the closet to my parents, I’ve already came out to my female friends (3 others have come out I think 2 came out to their parents but uhh their parents aren’t homophobic sooo) anyways, I’m lesbian and I need advice on how to come out to my family since well... it’s a little broken, but that’s off topic so, anyways, I need to know how to come out to my: homophobic dad, my crazy mom, my younger sister who I’m very uncomfortable with and my younger brother who uses the gay joke and I say I get offended but he still does it just to piss me off,  now this is going to be all over the place so get ready. 

So about my family: my mom and dad are divorced my grandma recently died and everyone is just rude and stuff, my mom is not open to talking about stuff and usually just try’s to block me out of her life entirely oh and we can’t forget that both my parents are really bad at not fighting (they live somewhat close to each other don’t ask me why).

About my dad: my dad has very big dreams to own a clothing brand and has tried many other things to do for a living (building houses, accounting, welding and CEO of a big company that makes electronics and more) he’s in a bit of debt (a very tiny amount don’t worry he can afford quite a bit of stuff). He also has a girlfriend who I’ll name chocolate, because she’s like a box of chocolates, you can get dark chocolate or milk chocolate, one bitter one sweet, and well shes also divorced and has a child who we’ll call sugar, since she’s very bubbly and kind, anyways chocolate is living with my dad and yeah that’s about it, wait also if you didn’t read remember that one part up there he’s a huge homophobe.

My mom: She’s the owner of a small clothing store, and is a pretty good mom supporting her three children (two literally are demons, oh and I’m the devil in my dads eyes he just doesn’t know it yet) but she’s a hopeless romantic, the last relationship she was in she was cheated on 2 times.

My sister: Ok if I’m being 100% transparent she think she owns the world, no freaking joke sometimes I’ll tell her she doesn’t own the world, and then she tries to hit me (I dodge of course). Now you may be thinking that this is all sibling rivalry but your WRONG  ALL OF MY FRIENDS, nicknamed her Satan, because she liked to kick them at recess.

My brother: this is your basic gamer guy who has no respect for anyone and plays Fortnite for when he gets home to when he goes to bed (12:30) oh and he has anger issues, and has threatened to kill me on multiple occasions.

Me (Lexie): I’m a lesbian, I love anime drawing, reading, writing, singing, basketball, tennis and volleyball. I have a group of friends called the bleach gang on the small chance one of you guys read this... why do you do this to me I told you guys I don’t matter stop reading, thanks. Oh um I have a dog ( it’s very irrelevant but who cares ) oh and I have a “small” eating disorder... I occasionally cut myself... I also live in Canada where were apparently perfect and we don’t have blood in our veins but instead maple syrup.

Ok sorry guys to leave but I’m getting tired ( it’s 10:40pm) so I should sleep I’ll pick this up tomorrow after school bye!",27May2019,1
165,"(Before) I posted about getting a girl’s snap and got some good advice. But now I’m in a situation where there’s two girls:
1. The first girl, who tbh I don’t know if she’s even that into me or just wanted “more views.” Because she opened my last message but didn’t respond and I don’t really wanna message again and come off as too attached over nothing. But also can’t deny that based off the little I learned about her I’m attracted to her.
2. The second girl, my friend introduced me to and she’s cool too. I’m not AS attracted to her as the first girl but I still think she’s really cool. And I making plans to hang out with her. But I feel like it’s not fair to her if I’m kinda iffy on another girl too.

Logically I should probably just drop everything with the first girl and just keep it platonically friendly but emotions can’t ever be that simple. Also, I’ve noticed that I have an issue where I can’t manage intense emotions/attraction towards someone very well and I’m trying very hard not to do something stupid. Maybe I’m just emotionally immature. I usually end up overthinking things I think.

TL;DR - can’t manage my feelings very well",27May2019,1

168,"August 2017, I move to a city to study Bachelors Degree in Law and Administration. Next month, I meet this girl at a gym center and I start to train there regularly. No contact were made. I look at her and she is the sex-bomb in the gym, the only hottest girl there, short and petite. She looks the same age as me (20 y.o. back then) but I do not interact any conversation with her, just focused on my training. In addition to that I had low self esteem and was addicted to PMO (still fighting it). I do not notice her correctly until I came back after Christmas holidays. I begin to take my training seriously with various training techniques and programs I try. And I was slowly making new friends from my class, in order to live a healthy student life than being a loner for 3-4 years of study. I felt I have gained better self esteem every day, but the issue in my life was my addiction on porn and masturbation. Every time I feel stress or pressure, I would turn to porn and use a fleshlight to relieve stress and anxiety but the latter kept coming back anyways.

Back to crush-on-a-girl-I-don't-know situation, I take my training more seriously and this gym-girl is still training there with a tank top and yoga pants, only to revealing how tanned and hot she is with her petite shaped body. I find out randomly where she works at as I stumble on to her manager by asking for a product, so I look at the girl for a second and she recognizes me. The more I meet this girl at the gym center and throw several glances, the more I get interested to start a conversation with her but did not ever happen. I kept thinking on what I should have said to her? How to start pick her up? I have even watched seduction advice videos on Youtube and read articles such as ""How to pick up a gym bunny?"", but I have wasted my time on those because the more I kept giving myself stupid excuses like ""another time"", the more it just kept going on like this every day and start to sexually fantasize about her due to the addiction and her shaped body and tanned skin. All the chances I've to interact a conversation with her got blown away and I did not see her again before I moved back to my hometown for summertime.

Three months of vacation, I fantasized a few times about her that I began to feel some sort of crush on her. Crush on a girl i don't know at all... August 2018, new study year starts and I move to a new dorm near the college university. I am so happy and energetic, have high self esteem, abstained from the addiction for a month and participate in a two-week welcoming party as a host member who arranged it for new students. As I knew where the gym-girl work at, I also have a friend who works there too. At a nightclub a talk with my friend about the gym-girl and she gave me her name + some information. The week later I need neon-light for en event, so I travel to a shopping mall and went to the retail store where my crush works at and almost found what I wanted, so I bought it. She gives me a good customer service that I was highly motivated to get to know her but I blew that like a shy idiot. I ask where she's from and that's it. I wasn't going to call her by name, such as:

""How do you know my name?"" 

""An acquaintance gave me your name"".

The conversation did not go like that as I thought it would be weird and she would feel uncomfortable. But since I blew it and I was a shy idiot, I could look the disappointment on her face after I told her ""have a good day!"" and asked what the clock is so I could grab the last bus. Sadly there were no buses at that time and next bus arrives for a half hour. I had the time to fix my mistake but even more sadder, the shy idiot me walked away from the shopping mall and I almost never saw her again... 

I visited the shopping several times. I knew she worked there almost every day when she took an online study type college education (learned that from my friend). I had so many chances back and threw them away, again. I lost focus on her when I noticed another girl I met at the welcoming party. However that did not last long. February this year I fantasize about the gym-girl again and no approach whatsoever. However by March I feel some kind of abnormal vibe, an unknown feeling where I feel and find out that my crush had left town and moved back to her hometown for her dream job, some 1.5 hours away. This was before spring break. Ever since September 2018 I've kept trying to improve myself not to mention the addiction I have where I broke my Nofap-streak several times, had a crush on someone I personally never knew, having sexual thought about her, and the empty feeling when I find out she moved... That is when I was so naive and figured out that porn has figuratively damaged my brain into tricking me to believe it was just ""another girl"" as there were no interaction, fantasizing a fantasy world where it's about me and her, both virgins and how we would live happy together, that I would have intercourse with her so many times as a consequence of her petite hot shaped body. There were no rules, only me and her. A pretty psychological abnormal fantasy if you ask me. I know nobody but me who has that kind of mindset. 

When I relapsed several days, I kept thinking about that gym-girl again and again, until I felt this rush of emotional rollercoaster which led me to research her Instagram account and found tons of pictures about her, pictures that exposed everything I thought wrong about her, etc. Despite that I hate Instagram from before, I scrolled down to look at more picture to see what kind of girl she is. I felt angry, desperate, frustrated at what sort of naive guy I am that I went out and started to exercise for an hour. I thought about comparing myself to her but then remembered that everyone is different. When I came home I made a rock music playlist with relaxed songs and some alternative rock music so that I would relax my emotions, block the anger and try to forget someone I never knew. I will never again fall into that same trap again. I am so tired of this mistake and cannot wait to spend this summer with people I am closest to so that I could focus more on abstaining from PMO and exercise seriously again, in addition, find a summer job.

What is your opinion on my awkward story? I take all the criticism to help me improve myself in the long term.",27May2019,2
169,"I (15/F) just want to feel comfortable enough around someone to cry about my feelings; not just like getting hit with a softball and breaking a bone. 

My mom died when I was young and I don’t talk to my dad ever about anything more than where I am going. 

I have an aunt who I’m kinda close with but she is only in my life for the fun stuff (nails, hair and prom ) she doesn’t care about anything more

I have a cousin (29F) who lives across the US that I visit twice a year for a month and talk to everyday. But she and I don’t really have emotions together. We love each other a lot.  But we more do things together and have fun. She’s like my big sister, but she isn’t like the touchy feely person.

I have another cousin that I go to if I have a big problem and need advice. Like I text her the big stuff, but she is also a mom and the oldest cousin and in her 40s. But I see her once a year maybe twice for dinner because she doesn’t live here.

Therapy isn’t on the table Bc my dad and Im under 18.

So I have no clue who to just talk to. I just want someone sooo bad. Like everything is bottled up in me. I know I can handle everything and i won’t pop. But I just need someone to talk and cry to; but I need to open up. It’s two issues, 1. Not opening up to anyone 
2. Not having anyone to open up to

So could anyone give me advice as to who to talk to or how to open up to people about feelings. Feel free to PM me.

171,"Am I just a permanent ass licker? I love giving gifts. To family, to friends, for birthdays, for no reason, etc. 

Someone I used to babysit is graduating in a few weeks. I have her on social media but we haven't seen each other in almost 6 months at a mutual friend's birthday. I've tried making plans with her but she's busy with work, and school. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough, or maybe she just doesn't want to see me, I can't tell.

And yet, here I am on Etsy trying to find something to personalize to get her for graduation. She hasn't even invited me to any grad celebration of hers or anything, not sure if there even is anything planned. I just wanted to drop it off at her house.

172,"So about 5 years ago my high school best friend and I started drifting apart, and then she told me she had cancer. Of course I believed her (who would lie about that??) but as time passed I became skeptical. She wouldn’t tell me any details of her condition, wouldn’t let me come to the hospital with her, and told me I couldn’t bring it up to her family as they were too upset about it still. She also never lost her hair or any weight and a few months later she “miraculously” went into remission from what she told me was terminal cancer. I kind of assumed she had faked it (she was a compulsive liar and did some pretty selfish/horrible things), but didn’t want to ask and sound like a complete asshole if she didn’t. Anyways we ended up growing apart after I went to college. 

I just recently graduated college and she reached out to me, and we met up for coffee today. She seems like a completely different person: much more mature and selfless. Things were going well until she told me that she did indeed fake having cancer because we were growing apart and she didn’t want to lose me. She spent 10 minutes apologizing, telling me what a horrible thing that was to do, and saying she doesn’t blame me if I never want to see her again, but that she has changed. It seems to me like she has changed, but that all might just be a lie too. I’m really conflicted as she was my absolute best friend and while she was a shitty person in the past, she seems to have grown up. Is it completely stupid to forgive someone for faking cancer for attention/friendship? I feel like karma did end up coming back to her as she lost pretty much all of her friends. Am I crazy for thinking she maybe has changed for the better and could be a good friend?",27May2019,2
173,"Hi reddit! I’d like to start off by saying that I’m only in high school but I love the community a lot.

Anyway, there’s this really cute girl I met about a year ago. She’s beautiful, kind, and sweet, and she’s in the grade above me. I was really fascinated about how interested in fine arts she was, and I have always wanted to meet someone with that interest (My school is small and has always leaned its budget over to sports). She’s in choir and drama, and I’d say she’s really talented in both. When we met in April, I decided I’d go to the upcoming play and watch her performance. It wasn’t long after that we became good friends, and started texting each other over snapchat. I also figured out she’s in golf, likes memes, and was never into doing bad stuff. Eventually that summer, I started hanging out with her and her friends and we formed a friend group. Throughout the fall is when we got even closer, doing fun stuff such as going to birthday parties, having bonfires, or just hanging out for the fun of it. I even decided i’d join drama club just for her and to cover up my free time, which went better than I expected. By then, I could comfortably say that she was one of my most loyal friends, and also my crush.

In February at some point, I ended up telling her how I had feelings and she friend-zoned me (feelsbadman), but I thought I’d let it slide and enjoy our friendship anyway, since she made me really happy. Everything was pretty good until around this month, when one of her friends told me I shouldn’t ask her to prom even as a friend. A week later however, someone else asked her and said yes. I was pretty upset, but a big field trip to Myrtle Beach with the choir and band was coming up (I know what I said about our budget but at least they care a little bit) so I wasn’t going to miss out on the opportunity of having fun with her. Despite what was going to happen, I had a great trip. We hung out just about every day down there. When prom rolled around on May 4th, I didn’t have a great time after being so full of envy by not having a date to prom (since i’m a sophomore one of the friendgroup friends bought me a ticket, and even after asking to go as friends she rejected it). Up until today, I had figured that she was never interested in her prom date. Last night however, when we were at a grad party, i felt like things were starting to seem suspicious, which put me in a bad mood. This morning, I went for a walk at my local park by myself in hopes of cheering myself up.  When I came back to my car, I grew the urge to tell her everything, and when I did, I got good and bad news:

Good news: she wasn’t interested in her prom date

Bad news: she was talking to the valedictorian of her grade, who I’m also good friends with. They apparently went on 2 or 3 dates already and I guess he’s planning to ask her out too.

I told her and the guy she’s talking to how I felt about everything. I was just told to take time to calm down and that they’re sorry I felt that way.

I’ve been extremely jealous and depressed all day about this. Like I said, she is cute, smart, sweet, enjoys music, and stays out of trouble. I know people will be saying that theres plenty of other girls to go after, but no one will ever be like this girl, because she just stands out among everyone else. I’ve liked so many other girls in my entire life and this one to me just feels completely amazing, which is why I know for a fact she’s the one for me. She’s everything I could ever ask for, but she’s also the kind of person that never fails to bring out all of my emotions, and I can’t see myself ever getting over such a perfect person. Everything I’ve done for her and with her over the year has never felt so worthless until today. I know she has Reddit and I don’t know if she’ll ever find this, but if ur reading this, I’m glad you took the time to listen to my story twice.

For anyone still reading this, I’d like to apologize for rambling on for such an extensive amount of time. I know I’m only some scrawny high-school teenager and i could be asking for wiser and more mature advice but please help me out guys. What should I do?",27May2019,3

My issue stems from my current situation. I lost my job. At this job I did fuck all and was bored and outside of work I did fuck all, other than sleep. Even though I had monetary freedom to do whatever, I just saved it for the most part. I never did anything fun.

I then lost my job and while hunting for a new one, I found myself not doing anything beyond looking for a job. I had no enjoyment or fun hobbies to do, I just looked for work. This was a prime time to do something fun but I did nothing. No hobbies interest me. 

I now have a new job lined up and will have to move out and live alone for this. The reminder that 70% of my paycheck will be spent on paying to exist depressed me. Then I realised I'll do nothing outside of this job for fun, other than sleep. 

I guess I should live in the moment but the moments are all boring for me.

177,"I grew up christian and don't know how I Feel about it Thats not really what I want to talk about though. I grewup being taught that sex is bad outside of marriage, don't watch porn, and don't masturbate.

Ive watched porn since I was younger (could never seem to kick it) and at times Ive voice chatted with women online sexually. I always have this profound guilt afterwords though. I'm 26 at this point though. I want to not feel guilty about it. I want to be able to talk with people, actually lets be honest. I want to be able to talk with a woman about sexual stuff comfortably. What I like, what I don't , porn, thoughts, whatever. I just want to be able to go ""off the leash"" for lack of a better word. I don't know where to go to do that, I don't know how to deal with the guilt even if I did.


Thee back and forth nature of my current feelings is draining. I'll put off being sexual cause I know the guilt is coming, then the top will blow and I'll want to be super sexual and watch all the porn , edging cause I don't want it to end, only to be extremely drained, guilty, and embarrassed. Its frustrating and the cycle just keeps on going.

I think one of my biggest frustrations is that, I feel like a creep by seeking out sexual stuff online. Whatever form that may take (interactive or not). I'm not sure how to seek it out without feeling a little slimy, even if I'm not actually doing anything wrong. I'm respectful, upfront, careful to understand and not cross boundaries. but despite all that there is a little bit of a feeling i get on sites like reddit or whatever when I'm seeking out anything, especially if it involves another person. I don't know how to shake that and thats actually what bothers me quite a bit. I know its not wrong to want to interact sexually, I know its normal, and I am very respectful in the way I approach it. But I always feel like I will be judged for it, or that I will be put in a box like ""oh he is just another guy who only wants in my pants"" even if I also want to know them as a person.

it doesn't help that half the people I actually end up talking to (in the rare ocassion THAT happens) just make fun of me cause I'm not kinky, or mock me for seeking stuff out. I'm so fucking emotionally tired with all of this.",27May2019,3
178,"Mobile, sorry.

About a month ago at my school, we had a blood drive which I worked. My friends all donated blood; I didn't. Every year we've had a blood drive, I refuse to do it because I have really awful periods. I experience serious fatigue, pain, and I lose a lot of blood. These symptoms are so severe that the only three days I missed in high school were due to me getting my period in the middle of the day and having to drag myself or be wheeled to the school office. This makes sense to me, but I guess a lot of people don't see it that way. Am I wrong for thinking that it might not be in my best interest? My friends even gave me a lot of crap about it and made fun of me.

Anyway, about two weeks after the blood drive, I started a period that lasted for three and a half weeks. All I could do was go to school and come home and sleep. I was in pain, I was stressed, I was always tired. I felt so weak all the time. I don't know if I could keep up with all the strain on my body had I donated.

Am I just overthinking the effect donating would have on me? If not, what can I do to stop people from shaming me and giving me a hard time? I'm a pretty anxious person so it really hurt to have my friends disregard my health concerns and laugh at me. Any insight would be appreciated.",27May2019,6

My boss finished the day by telling me I'm taking too much sick time in like a suggestive way, Like he thinks I'm faking or I can magically stop being sick or something?

See theres way more then I can go into thst I cant put in this post, but basically I went through hard times and go by 2 names, each with a different personality, my irl persona is a young teen who's overly hyper and makes stuiped decisions, my other side is my online persona and its much more, mature to say. I say more appropriate jokes and needless to say get extremely emotional when taking part of it. 

The things is both have liked different people for different reasons but for the first time in years we both want to be with this girl. I wanna take my shot but, is it worth it if shes basically with someone else (they go on friend dates but obviously both Like one another).

188,"Hi
Long story short, I had the plan to study medicine, but my dream was always to study something related to space.
I have an exam for the university in a short time and I realized that I am studying for something that I really don't love.
I tried talking to my parents about this, but I feel that they didn't listened to me, they told me not to choose such a weird career (aeroespace engineering) and if I did, I wouldn't be a succesful person, I understand why they say this and that they have put a lot of effort into me studying medicine, but I just don't know what to do anymore. Right now I feel like I need to do what I love, but if I do, my parents are not going to support me, and I feel like I'm going to dissapoint them. 
When I told them  that I was scared about not passing the exam (for medicine) they told me that I was being a coward, and I was wasting my opportunities thinking on a useless carrer 
The exam is really close and it's giving me a lot of anxiety, what should I do? 
My plan is to study for this exam to make my parents happy, and then search for scholarships in a foreign country (were I live space related fields are practically useless)  but after what my parents told me I'm very confused.
I feel like I just wasted my parents time and money. But I feel like that they should be more comprehensive with me. I feel very lonely right now. Am I being selfish?

I bought a TV about a year ago.    f it cost me 250$ and I was very happy with it.    
I am not sure when but some time in the last  seven days my TV died. ( the  front LED  that  indicates  it has power is out and when you press the power button nothing happens.   )  
The Warranty expired a year after purchase  which was may 18th.    I have ever had electronics fail on me that quickly after the warranty expires.   


 I have options. 1) repair it ( myself or at a repair shop)  
 2) buy a new TV ( I feell cheated that I would have to do this   so soon)  
3) buy the same model tv ( its on sale still at the same price, from the same store) and then replace the new one with the old one and return it.

192,"Hello! I'm new to this subreddit and decided to turn to it for advice. I'm terrible at wording things, so feel free to ask for more information or better clarification!

My name is Spencer. I'm a 19-year-old male who lives with his parents. I stay home pretty much every day, going out every once in a while with my family. I spend most of my time playing video games, listening to music, watching videos, etc.. I currently don't have a job, but I want to get one and save up some money before going to college. However, I am unable to get one as I live in a suburban area and only have access to a working car on the weekends. So, I'm stuck biding my time until an opportunity presents itself.

I have no friends in person or online and have a hard time making friends as I'm an introvert. Over the years, I've had several groups of online friends I hung out with everyday. Each group lasted about two years before everyone ultimately moved on with their lives and I merged into a new group. However, I had no one to turn to when my last group of friends broke apart. So, I spend every day feeling lonely and wondering how to make new friends as I always met new people through other friends.

Relationship-wise, I've dated a few girls online in the past. However, I have absolutely no experience with girls outside of the online world. I'm pretty much a virgin when it comes to any physical activity with a girl. I haven't even kissed anyone. Now online, I've been able to build relationships with female friends. However, things always ended before we had the chance to meet up in person. So, I have the knowledge of dating a girl online, but no experience in person.

Now that you have some backstory, I want advice on how to move forward. My goal in life is to have a career I enjoy, friends to hang out with, and a wife to love and take care of. What is the first step I can take to make my ambitions come to fruition?",27May2019,1
193,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

So bit of a long one. To cut it short, I got laid off from my job and had to find a new one. So far I have one offer, one pending response, one pending interview. But I am unsure which to take, what to do and whether I should accept any. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live at home with my parents. My current career has become semi mundane and I want to change one day, but won't be able to do so for several years I fear. I have ideas for a new career path in my current field (programming) but I am yet unsure if I love it enough to pursue it as a career full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, Job offer one: 

\- based 100 miles away so I'll have to relocate 

\- a lot of hassle around relocating and logistics

\- less money than I previously made 

\- no relocation benefits 

\- job seems okay, would have good job security and prospects for my current field 

\- good chance to relearn current field in a new position and work my way back up in my current career path 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Prospective Job two (yet to interview): 

\- Based locally 

\- related to what I currently do 

\- could be more money 

\- not as creatively rewarding work as Job one 

&amp;#x200B;

Prospective Job Three (yet to hear back): 

\- still semi local

\- fairly creatively rewarding

\- bridges the gaps between the two career paths I want so would be the best pick

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Out of these, I'm not sure which job is the best fit. Meanwhile Job one needs to know if I accept it or not this week. I feel I should just accept the first one that wants to hire me and make it work, over being picky and finding what I want, when I don't really know what I want 100%

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to say no to a job I need (so I can make money) and then have no other companies offer me a role, causing me to still be stuck with no job. At the same time, I don't want to relocate for a job I may not want to do forever or might not enjoy. The other problem is that Job one takes me away from all comforts and has me paying my way, it could be liberating, or it could be stressful and terrifying. The other jobs let me keep my current location, social connections and is less stressful overall.

195,"Little back story, met this girl back in 2011 on a business trip for a highschool class. We got along really well during the trip and kept in contact for years and talked about dating when we were older. Fast forward 2 years ago and she moved to a city near me for work and we decided this would be a good time to date and see where things can go. Dated for 2 years and we fell in love. We talked about the future and what we each wanted. Long term relationship and marriage was it for both of us. Fast forward to June 2018. She got into a film school in her city and I was in between jobs. So we talked and decided I would move with her to her home town and work and start school that same year in September so I could support us both down the line. During the time she was in school i found us an apartment downtown like she wanted. Rent wasn’t bad. Close to her favorite places. Seemed too good to be true. September  comes around and I start school and she’s not working. Just living off of EI. I was living off of a living allowance and didn’t have much spending money after bills and food. I was swamped with school and was exhausted every day from it. Come March she breaks up with me. Says “the relationship got too boring” 
Told her she couldn’t stay in the apartment with me and she can move in with her mother and older sister. Was heartbroken and felt stringed along. A week after we broke up. I found out she moved in with another guy who’s seperated from his wife. And that really made me feel like shit. 20 hours away from and real friends or family. I’m completely alone out here now. Feeling unmotivated to finish school because I did this for “us”. Now going to school is just a constant reminder. Coming home after class every day to this empty apartment hurts. Most days I just want to leave everything here and go home. 
I really don’t know how much more I have in me to get through this. Feeling mentally drained every day.

197,"Hello everyone, I made this account just for this question please be aware that I'm on mobile so sorry for formating.
Anyway, let's get right to it!

So I'm still at school (15 years old) and my friendgroup exists of mostly weird but really nice people and me (just a weird one) .

So one of my friends (14 years, soon 15) told me that he had a  MPD (multiple person disorder) wich is now actually called DID (disociative identity disorder) but I don't trust him, I'll give you some points on why that is so that you guys can tell me if I'm wrong (I really hope so) or if I'm right.

1. He thought it was called an MPD instead of a DID (Wich to be fair probably doesn't mean anything).

2. With a DID there should be 2 or more clear personalities wich he doesn't really have.

3. There should be 2 personalities who take control regulary, wich doesn't happen only when he told me about his DID once.

4. This is mostly caused by trauma, wich he didn't have if I'm correct (I could be wrong on this one).

5. We walked in a park and saw a sign that said Henry and later that day he got a French personality that's called Henry (personality splitting is mostly caused by traumas so this seems strange)






I could give one or two more points but these where the most important ones.

Am I right or am I wrong and what should I do?

199,"Hello you can call me Jhon (not my real name) at the moment I'm 20 yrs old ,my life has been ,just a big mess... 

Well i guess everything started as a lot of falls and things hitting me on the head,the first fall that I took was when my grandma was carrying me and some cheese (we make cheese ) and some of the cheese was going to fall so when my grandma tried to catch it ,she dropped me to the ground they told me I was around 1 to 2 yrs old when it happened, then I was pushed from some stairs cause I was in the way of the door when my aunt opened it, then I fell from the bed and I had a pretty bad injury, needed some stitches for it ,but everything was good and fun I guess,all of that happened at my family's barn or Ranch ,I don't know how to call it 

Everything was good all of my family lived there ,my 2 aunts 1 uncle,my dad ,my mom,Grandpa and Grandma,and 2cousins (my sister and I) and well my lil brother was on its way,after he was born my mom wanted us to move to the city (it was the small town that was 15 minutes away from the ranch ) I was okay with it and so did my sister and my dad ,so he rented a house.
.

Then all came crushing down....by that point I was 8 my big sis was 10 and my brother was 1 and a half,I never had this types of problems (well at least at that age) but my mom started to hit us,Everytime I had some something bad she hit me ,if my sister was struggling with homework she got hit,we had to take care of my brother let's call him David ,she practically kicked out my dad from the house and he only got to see us on Friday until Sunday ,I had vitamin problems so I used to wet my bed almost everyday ,and that meant,getting hit every day ,there were some weeks when my mom had to go to ""meetings"" and she left her sister in charge her sister didn't give us a thing to eat for 3 days straight we lived of from water and a bag of popcorn,but this it's not the problem

My mom hit me on the leg because I was in the middle of the door and that left me badly injured ,I was not able to walk for a month or so,and every time I ran I felt a sharp pain,then the divorce happened ,the 2 most stressful years of my early life ,changed schools for a year then went back,got bullied a lot because all of a sudden I was the ""weird kid"" because I was very quiet and depressed all of the time,but I tried to brush it off and act as normal ,I was just in school for God's sake...

I thought it couldn't be worse...how wrong I was... At age 10 

I got up started to get dress for school (I was at 6th grade) but my sister was acting weird ,she got up pretty fast and that wasn't normal,then she started to scream ""LOOK AT THE MONSTER, IT'S ON THE WALL"" As she said that she started to convulse ,I was scared to shit,my grandma saw this and called for the doctor,I still went to school tho,she started to get mood changes and more and more problems,this took me by surprise but I could do anything about it,I was just a kid

The day a doctor finally told us what she had was not so far ,she had a brain tumor,of the size of a small/medium avocado,she was diagnosed to get a brain surgery that supposed to cure her,and time flies ,in a couple of months se was getting the operation.

 months went by and she got operated ,they had to cut her long hair,she came back to the barn looking pale and pretty weak ,almost bald because of the chemotherapy and laser stuff they did,I thought she was cured and everything was going to be back to normal.

It was not ...

She still had the convulsions and attacks we went to the doctor again and I don't know why but the doctors told my grandma that she had a 2 year expectation of life ...and she did the right thing... TO FUCKING TELL ME,A FUCKING 10 YR OLD KID THAT HIS SISTER WAS GOING TO DIE IN 2 FUCKING YEARS...Of course I was going to be fucking okay with it ...the person that I spent most of my life with ,playing having fun and talking to ,was just going to disappear in two years,that shit least to a lot of problems now in the present day 

Then it began ,my sister got used to ,if I ever had a problem with her that I couldn't do anything I could not retaliate cause if she had an atatack or epilepsy,was going to be my fault this went on for a couple of years, 8 years to be precise.in those 8 years my life has been fucking hell ,I couldn't make any friends because my sister always talked trash about me at my back and she always got away with it,my dad was nowhere to be seen since I was 13 because he found a new gurl had a kid and moved on, I went trough a couple of time trough suicidal attempts and failed at every single one of them,since 4th grade started to do poorly in school,got the same excuse from all the teachers ,""very smart but too lazy"" I was not lazy,I was fucking depressed because my life at home was worse than my life at school 

Then highschool went by,tried to make new friends. Achieved actually making not only best friends also has some girl friends like actual friends ,had fun ,remembered the joy of drawing...and then I lost everything again... Then went to phase 2 ""medium superior level of school"" where I actually got 1 year suspended cause if a bad grade 

That made me fall into a bigger pit of despair and depression cause all I did my whole life was study and go to school and I was not even good at it anymore,so....what was my purpose just die...

I came back passed highschool and now I was into University/college ,finally decided to get some help ,got diagnosed with depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts so I got meds that helped me ""feel good"" it didn't do shit and I tried to kill myself by overdosing with them, it didn't work,so I'm still alive ,I though,and yeah I fucking was ,so I decided to never try something like that again,got prescribed stronger more expensive medication and it worked ,kept going to my appointments and now I'm at a level where I can express something like ,being mad 


My life just sucks but I don't see the good ,maybe is good expressing something but being unable to live a happy life,makes me want to idk... End it for good",27May2019,1

Him: Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation.

203,"August 2017, I move to a city to study Bachelors Degree in Law and Administration. Next month, I meet this girl at a gym center and I start to train there regularly. No contact were made. I look at her and she is the sex-bomb in the gym, the only hottest girl there, short and petite. She looks the same age as me (20 y.o. back then) but I do not interact any conversation with her, just focused on my training. In addition to that I had low self esteem and was addicted to PMO (still fighting it). I do not notice her correctly until I came back after Christmas holidays. I begin to take my training seriously with various training techniques and programs I try. And I was slowly making new friends from my class, in order to live a healthy student life than being a loner for 3-4 years of study. I felt I have gained better self esteem every day, but the issue in my life was my addiction on porn and masturbation. Every time I feel stress or pressure, I would turn to porn and use a fleshlight to relieve stress and anxiety but the latter kept coming back anyways.

Back to crush-on-a-girl-I-don't-know situation, I take my training more seriously and this gym-girl is still training there with a tank top and yoga pants, only to revealing how tanned and hot she is with her petite shaped body. I find out randomly where she works at as I stumble on to her manager by asking for a product, so I look at the girl for a second and she recognizes me. The more I meet this girl at the gym center and throw several glances, the more I get interested to start a conversation with her but did not ever happen. I kept thinking on what I should have said to her? How to start pick her up? I have even watched seduction advice videos on Youtube and read articles such as ""How to pick up a gym bunny?"", but I have wasted my time on those because the more I kept giving myself stupid excuses like ""another time"", the more it just kept going on like this every day and start to sexually fantasize about her due to the addiction and her shaped body and tanned skin. All the chances I've to interact a conversation with her got blown away and I did not see her again before I moved back to my hometown for summertime.

Three months of vacation, I fantasized a few times about her that I began to feel some sort of crush on her. Crush on a girl i don't know at all... August 2018, new study year starts and I move to a new dorm near the college university. I am so happy and energetic, have high self esteem, abstained from the addiction for a month and participate in a two-week welcoming party as a host member who arranged it for new students. As I knew where the gym-girl work at, I also have a friend who works there too. At a nightclub a talk with my friend about the gym-girl and she gave me her name + some information. The week later I need neon-light for en event, so I travel to a shopping mall and went to the retail store where my crush works at and almost found what I wanted, so I bought it. She gives me a good customer service that I was highly motivated to get to know her but I blew that like a shy idiot. I ask where she's from and that's it. I wasn't going to call her by name, such as:

""How do you know my name?""

""An acquaintance gave me your name"".

The conversation did not go like that as I thought it would be weird and she would feel uncomfortable. But since I blew it and I was a shy idiot, I could look the disappointment on her face after I told her ""have a good day!"" and asked what the clock is so I could grab the last bus. Sadly there were no buses at that time and next bus arrives for a half hour. I had the time to fix my mistake but even more sadder, the shy idiot me walked away from the shopping mall and I almost never saw her again...

I visited the shopping several times. I knew she worked there almost every day when she took an online study type college education (learned that from my friend). I had so many chances back and threw them away, again. I lost focus on her when I noticed another girl I met at the welcoming party. However that did not last long. February this year I fantasize about the gym-girl again and no approach whatsoever. However by March I feel some kind of abnormal vibe, an unknown feeling where I feel and find out that my crush had left town and moved back to her hometown for her dream job, some 1.5 hours away. This was before spring break. Ever since September 2018 I've kept trying to improve myself not to mention the addiction I have where I broke my Nofap-streak several times, had a crush on someone I personally never knew, having sexual thought about her, and the empty feeling when I find out she moved... That is when I was so naive and figured out that porn has figuratively damaged my brain into tricking me to believe it was just ""another girl"" as there were no interaction, fantasizing a fantasy world where it's about me and her, both virgins and how we would live happy together, that I would have intercourse with her so many times as a consequence of her petite hot shaped body. There were no rules, only me and her. A pretty psychological abnormal fantasy if you ask me. I know nobody but me who has that kind of mindset.

When I relapsed several days, I kept thinking about that gym-girl again and again, until I felt this rush of emotional rollercoaster which led me to research her Instagram account and found tons of pictures about her, pictures that exposed everything I thought wrong about her, etc. Despite that I hate Instagram from before, I scrolled down to look at more picture to see what kind of girl she is. I felt angry, desperate, frustrated at what sort of naive guy I am that I went out and started to exercise for an hour. I thought about comparing myself to her but then remembered that everyone is different. When I came home I made a rock music playlist with relaxed songs and some alternative rock music so that I would relax my emotions, block the anger and try to forget someone I never knew. I will never again fall into that same trap again. I am so tired of this mistake and cannot wait to spend this summer with people I am closest to so that I could focus more on abstaining from PMO and exercise seriously again, in addition, find a summer job.

204,"3 months ago, my friend and i were messing around and it ended up in him dropping my phone and breaking it completely. he offered to pay for it despite being an accident so i shrugged it off and nothing came from it.

&amp;#x200B;

last week i confronted him about it and he was saying all these things like ""you couldve asked nicely"", and ""surely your mum could pay for it"" and ""i only get 120 dollars a week how am i gonna pay for it"" (asked him for 200 cause repair is 250) he was an asshole about it and he was saying all these things about how my mum could just pay for it (yeah she could but its not the point) he said he has responsibilities and i clarified that this is one of these responsibilities.

&amp;#x200B;

it ended up becoming an argument and throughout the argument he was just using ad hominem after ad hominem and all these personal insults. i ended up blocking him on snapchat and ive had to remove him from my life. but hes been really aggressive towards me (pushing me in the locker area etc) and he's just been taking the piss about this whole thing so much. what do i do?

206,"Hey guys,

I had no idea where to come with this so I’ve ended up here, any advice is appreciated.

Earlier in the year I picked up my phone from down the side of my bed and noticed a *very* tiny, grain of salty tiny, bug crawling across it. I flicked it off and continued my day, a couple days ago I noticed a few more on it, after further inspection and some trial and errors, I’ve noticed these bugs, which I’m positive  are white dust mites, have infested the perimeter around my bed, especially the hard to clean places.

I want these gone, ASAP, but there’s one problem, I am currently unable to remove my carpet to deep clean it, but I need to get rid of them, can any of you please lend me some advice on this? I feel itchy just walking in there",27May2019,2

208,"So there's this girl I have crush on for 4 years. I didn't know that earlier. I thought we're just being friends and when she got in a relationship, I realized but later found out that nothing's gonna happen in between us. I also confessed those feelings to her and we kept being friends and we know a lot about each other. Friendzoned is what some call it. But I'm not miserable or anything because of it. She's in a relationship with her bf for 4 years now.

So recently, as I knew there's nothing gonna happen jn between us, I had zero expectations from her. She told she's gonna break up with her bf, bc he treats her badly. A day later we're chatting about some sexual stuff and things got heated. I taught her how to masturbate. I got a boner. She sent me some glimpse of her private parts, only to delete them a seconds later. She said she can't cheat on her bf. I agreed.

But just moments later she said she would love to have her pussy eaten from me, after she broke up. I agreed. There was no humor included.

So my I got hopeful. But then after two days she told me over chat that there's nothing gonna happen in between us. She sent me those nudes only because she was sexually desperate and the thing about eating pussy was a joke. Also she's masturbating and experiencing orgasms daily because I told her how to. I think that changed her mind.

So what should I do now?",27May2019,0

211,"This is going to be long. So be prepared. :3

I'm a 29 year old girl, had a good childhood, did sport, graduated, have a stable job, I have my own apartment and lots of friends/acquaintances.

I am starting to noticing a quite typical behaviour of mine and this is showing up now more than ever, as I am in a stable relationship.

I am living with my boyfriend. He left his ex for me and he moved in with me. Things are pretty good except a few things that I am confident we will overcome.

As things are becoming more and more stable, as the hype of the beginning is going down, I realize that I cannot truly enjoy spending my time on my own. 
I can't enjoy spending time with my friends, or reading, or watching a movie, if he is not around doing it with me.

When I am away from home for whatever reason, I just miss him and want to text and hear from him... just like everything revolves around him, in my mind. He, instead, does not feel that. I mean, he surely misses me, but it is clear that he is totally okay on his own.

Not sure why - I am just afraid that I need someone to give a sense to what I do or who I am because otherwise I can't find any...?

Also I am becoming a bit obsessed with the fact that my SO is close friend with his ex and in my mind (not quite far from reality, though) they text all day and stuff. And to me, it kinda feels like he is more into her company rather than mine. He says it is not true but well...
Also, to me this is starting to look like an excuse my brain needs, to justify my incapability of enjoying my relationship with him due to my personal difficulties. 

I believe that I should start finding a way to enjoy time on my own and focus on what I do and like.

And here comes another issue.

I have hard times finding something I truly enjoy and want to go deep into. I like doing many things, but get bored after some time and always need some ""feeling of new"" to make myself excited again. It's like everything excites me at first, but then get immediately bored.

It is a strange feeling because it sometimes feels like I can't enjoy anything, I can't be on my own and I can't let my personality grow old. I feel like I am not much worth, don't have big passions or skills...
But most of all, I always feel I am in the wrong place at the wrong time. So kinda not able to enjoy the present.

This is very frustrating, makes me have a heavy heart.
But I want to find a way to stop thinking, comparing, and just find myself and be it.

Any suggestions?",27May2019,1

So months ago I started to talk again with a girl that I like from highschool (5 years ago to which I'll refer to M), then 2 months ago invited her out to a dinner, we had fun and laugh alot, M was kinda touchy and I thought that I liked her, I didn't do anything because of the time that passed, managed to get more dates with her and on the third date I decided to do a move and kiss her (after I asked if she was single, to which she answered yes), she rejected me and I apologized for what happened (even though I felt that we had chemistry) we ended up as friends.

Days after that, I found out M was on a relationship but in the time that we were hanging out they had broken up, 1 week after this they came back  and I felt  dumb for receiving the wrong signals. Since we were just friends I tried to keep the friendship and talk to her but she started to ghost me, soon I forgot about her and went out with some friends and met this girl with which now I have sort of a relationship although is nothing serious, weeks passed and I started to upload pictures with this new girl to my social media.

After this I traveled for work and M started to chat with me, I decided to be more romantic and direct with my feelings, and she was responding well I invited her out again and she accepted, we went out to a dinner and started to talk, then I asked what happened with her boyfriend, she told me that they broke up again because of trust issues with her and that they are still seeing each other because he owns her money, I wanted to do a move but I decided not to because I felt like I was going to get trouble If I try something or even get my heart broken (because I really like her)
The night went well, I felt a connection with her, she was touchy again and we laughed alot, she was really into me telling her that I love her but I decided not to say anything, because I feel like she is just trying to be  with me because of his ex (trying to forget) I felt like the night went lovely and we just cuddle at the end of the date.
After this I kept talking to her and when I tried to set another hang out she ghosted me, I decided to go out with the girl that I have nothing serious and took more pictures and uploaded them, now M just send a ""hahahahaha"" to a meme that I uploaded and I decided not to answer her, I have no idea what to do, do I tell her what I feel?

221,"there's way too much context in this so im gonna be as brief as possible. im gonna start off by saying there's 2 guys - Guy A and Guy B, who are both kind of friends with each other, and Guy B knows Guy A wants to ask me, but not the other way around. ive never really crushed on a guy or been in a relationship, so it's all relatively new for me. note that my amazingly fking geniously retarded friends also managed to involve themselves in this stupid drama.

&amp;nbsp;

Guy A wants to ask me to prom AS FRIENDS (confirmed from his friends to my friends, who are both sworn to secrecy, but obviously my friend has told me), but im not interested in going with him - he's friendly and smart but i just don't see it being a fun experience together. my friends have been trying to subtly move him away from me, which has worked.

&amp;nbsp;

Guy B is the one i kinda like, and want to go to prom with, but he hasn't asked me yet. one of his friends messaged me 2 weeks ago telling me, but i was kinda unsure at that stage coz i wasn't into all this prom/going with someone situation. long story short, my friends have been communicating with his friends and him, and apparently he's gonna ask tomorrow (obviously he doesn't know that i know all this) . i was gonna originally say yes, as friends, but then something happened today and its kinda messing with my head. we were discussing prom in english class today (Guy A is in this class but not Guy B), how guys are starting to only ask girls coz they're desperate for a date to prom so not to look lonely or whatever. THEN i frigging found out that Guy B has already asked a girl, who rejected him bc she wasn't from our school and didn't really know anyone from the school. so putting my amazing deducing skills together, ive figured that im basically Guy B's second choice :) real boost to my self esteem, esp coz i thought someone finally liked me for me haha hahahaha.. . so my question is, am i overreacting, considering Guy B is only asking to go as friends (which im happy with, no relationships for me tyvm)? i really don't like the idea of being his last ditch escape plan or second option. id rather go with my friends than be someone's second option. 

&amp;nbsp;

im definitely over analysing, but Guy B knows Guy A wanted to ask me, maybe he didn't ask at the beginning because he thought Guy A was gonna ask me and i was gonna say yes? i don't want to find excuses but i can't help it. keeping in mind that both guys rarely text me or talk to me outside of school anyway. Guy B is still ""scheduled"" to ask me tomorrow, but i really don't know how to talk to him, and i haven't told my friends either bc of all this that's happening. is this as big of a deal as im making it?",27May2019,1

Then we had a 3rd shifter quit (we still have another one) then all of a sudden i’m the one put on second and third shift schedules, where I only get one day off between a 2nd and 3rd shift work week.

232,"Long wall of text incoming. Posting from a throwaway due to some details.

I don't know what to put here honestly. First of all I live in the US, to be specific Texas. My parents have acted very abusive towards me before, and have said/done some questionable things to me. While this has somewhat toned down over the past year,I'm still not sure if I'm in a safe environment. I also don't know if I should call something like CPS, since they might treat me worse and the nightmares of the foster care system are extremely worrying to me.
Some of the events that have happened, things they've said, and things they've done to me:

- I got into an argument with my parents while on a vacation because they had found out I was talking with friends online. They didn't like me talking with online people because of an incident involving my online friends that they didn't approve of. I've had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts before, and talking to people online had helped me calm those thoughts down. I told them that talking to online people helped me with depression and suicidal thoughts I've had before. My dad then goes to the knife drawer in our airbnb, pulls out a fucking knife, points it at me, and asks if""I want to know how it (referring to suicide) feels like."" At this point, I'm super scared. I almost call 911 because I feared for my safety, but for some reason I showed them the phone screen with 911on the screen. I don't remember what happened between that but I do remember my mother saying that ""they'll just arrest you instead.""(something along the lines of that, my memory is a bit fuzzy when it comes to these type of events)

- Back in middle school, I had gotten many detentions since my school had a system in place with demerits and I had acquired too many of them. One day when I had gotten a detention and she had picked me up from school (this wasn't on the day it was assigned),she asked me something along the lines of, ""So what happened today?""I instantly knew she knew and I was kinda scared so I said nothing.This completely backfired on me since my silence on the situation had made her angrier to the point of completely losing it. She threatened to drop me off on the side of the road and almost followed through with it when she went into a parking lot next to the highway we were taking to go to her workplace, and made me get out. Thankfully she didn't follow through with that completely. When I got back in the car, she was still furious. She works in a hospital work place so she was saying about how she could get a mental institution to take me away or something. Since I was really scared and I didn't know what to do, I pulled out my phone and texted some of my friends, basically pleading for their help. My mom saw me texting and took my phone, and looked through the messages when we got to her work. She saw the messages and told me to tell my friends that I was joking and send the message in front of her... so that's what I did. The next day I go to school, the friends I texted got mad at me and were like ""Why did you lie? I got worried!"" I tried to tell them that I wasn't joking, but they didn't believe me and even started making jokes about it during class. It was one of the worst experiences of my life.

 - Another thing that would happen as a result of these detentions would be my dad beating me with a wooden paddle, or my mom beating me with a belt. I remember being so afraid of it and not knowing what to do. I also remember seeing the evil smile on my mom's face when she was beating me one time.

 - Adding on to this situation, during one of the beatings I remember that I wanted it audio recorded for some reason. My dad audio recorded it on his phone, and while it's deleted now, I have a feeling it's probably still in a backup somewhere.

- I got caught staying up late and talking to friends (in real life and online). We got in an argument, and they ended up putting a camera in my room. It's one of those Arlo Pro cameras that you can access from your phone, speak through, and record. I've had some weird incidents involving these. One of the incidents that I can remember was when I decided to try out sleeping without clothes,because I was curious as to how it would feel like. My parents saw through the cameras, and my mom stormed up into my room. She very angrily told me that I shouldn't be doing that and called me perverted for wanting to do that. These cameras are still there, and they actively monitor it at times to see if I'm sleeping.

 - Adding to the theme of cameras, she's threatened to put a camera in my dorm room if I get low grades in college. I have no idea how this will work, and if it will even work at all. Probably not.

- My mom has gotten mad at me to the point of completely losing it sometimes. One time that I specifically remember was me and her arguing about something in her car, while we were driving back to her workplace. She absolutely lost it, and started erratically driving while saying ""DO YOU WANNA DIE? YOU WANNA DIE?"" It stopped shortly after, but it was an extremely scary moment.

- When I was maybe 7 or 6 (or younger, memory is fuzzy), my mom pretended to call the police on me because I was acting up. Don't know if this is common, just something I'd thought I'd add.

- My parents once tried to have a ""Bible study on Friday"" type of thing. My parents and I got into an argument since I didn't want to participate in it (I'm not religious, they're Christian). I had told them I didn't want to study the Bible at all, and that was when they figured out I was non religious. They proceeded to conclude that I was doing ""bad things"" on my devices and they made me charge my laptop and phone downstairs from that point on, and banned me from using my laptop in my room. It's been a couple of months since that and they've let me keep my stuff in my room now, but that was an interesting situation.

- My dad used to slap my ass as a ""joke."" He said it was just playing around. The more I look back upon it now, it was super fucking weird.

- My mom believes that you can get AIDS from touching someone's urine, and that you can get vaccines from autism (yet I've still gotten vaccinated. Weird, I know.) We've gotten into arguments into this many times and she's said stuff like ""the CDC lies, you've been brainwashed,"" etc.

- I'm bisexual, and my parents are vehemently against the LGBTQ+ community. I don't know if they're the type to put someone into conversion therapy, but I have gotten some red flags before. My dad once found gay porn on my phone, and confronted me about it in the car ride to school. He had told me that ""if u are gay, I will send you to gay city and the dogs will eat you"" or something along the lines/similar to that (again, my memory is a bit fuzzy on things like this.) I'm worried that if my parents find out about my sexuality then I will either be suppressed from communication or the Internet, or they'll take far more drastic measures that I honestly don't know.

Again, I honestly am just dumbfounded as to what to do. In terms of contacts, I've talked to my sister about the situation involving the cameras and some other stuff, and we generally agreed that the cameras were overboard. I don't know if I should approach her with this stuff and ask her for advice, considering that I don't know what her beliefs about certain stuff are, and me and her never really socialized much in the years we lived together, and outside of that. I also have a backup phone that I keep on me almost all the time, which has a SIM with a few megabytes of data I can use to send a few messages or call people if something threatening happens. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.",27May2019,22

234,"What started out as a couple of insects roaming on my desk turned out to be a full infestation of my room. 

I’ve found tiny bugs in all of my textbooks. I cleaned my desk. Later I found them in other areas of my room. I cleaned my entire room. I eventually found out that all my clothing had tiny bugs hiding in the seams. I think that was my last breaking point, knowing I was wearing insect strewn clothing this entire time. 

It’s been a month and my room is still infested. I’ve had to wash and dry every item in my closet, and wrap each in a plastic bag. I have to check my bedsheets meticulously before I sleep. I have to shake out bags and coats before I wear them. I have to wrap books in plastic after I’m done with them. I have to clean my room meticulously daily. These are tiny bugs that live in tiny seams and crevices. This fact alone makes me paranoid beyond belief. I’ve been doing this for almsot a damn month and I feel like I’m going insane. It makes me severely stressed to have to do this everyday. 

My room used to be my safe space but I feel so anxious sitting in here. Instead of doing my school work and studying as I should be I’ll sit at my desk for hours (3-5 a day) just staring at my room and feeling dreadful. I’ve even cried about this. I’m not sure what to do. I’ve tried to search up solutions to this problem but things keep doing wrong along the way. 

To add to the problem, no one in my family seems to care about my problem. I think they just see it as a couple of bugs and that there are “bugs everywhere” and to get over it. But given my phobia of insects already plus the sheer amount of them in every single one of my belongings drives me insane each day. Each personal item to me that I use on a daily basis has the possibility of being infested with my worst nightmare. I seriously can’t stand it and I don’t know what to do. 

I’m exhausted from cleaning and worrying. I don’t even want to return to my own room and try to stay occupied by hanging out with friends a lot so I don’t have to return home. I’m just not sure if I’m being dramatic or not.",27May2019,1
235,"So, I'm moving soon to a really great apartment. However, due to circumstances that can't be changed, my lease for my current apartment will end with a 3 day gap till the next lease starts. I have two cats, work full time and the 3 days will happen on a Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday. Family/friends not an option and I have about one uhaul truckload of furniture and stuff. I live in an expensive area and am not super rich, but have the means to blow a couple hundred. Thoughts? 

What would you guys do in that situation?",27May2019,1
236,"I have nothing packed, nothing ready. I’m not emotionally prepared to leave my husband (39M) as I thought I was. He doesn’t know I’m leaving so soon. I made myself promises and I have to do what’s right for me now, not just what’s right for him or anyone else. I’m going to move five hours away and no one knows. Not my family, my job I’ve had for almost 9 years. It’s zero hour and I wasted all my time. Either way I’m leaving- with or without a bunch of stuff that never really made me happy anyway.

But I’m still so scared. I do love him but our relationship is over, has been over and toxic for so long. Nothing in our life will change but I’m still scared. I have no friends, no one I can talk to. I want to be excited like I was before. I’m going to be all alone in a huge place and I... just want someone to tell me it will be okay. Please.",27May2019,1
237,So there is this girl i like and I'm not sure to tell if she likes me back. We always stay up late talking to each other and everytime i want to go to bed she doesn't let me and wants me to stay up with her. Anyone have any advice?,27May2019,1
239,"I’ve been dating my girlfriend for close to 5 months now, and usually when I’m over at her house the neighbors’ cat comes over and hangs out with us, including her 2 other roommates. They LOVE him. And I can admit he’s also a chiller. It’s basically over there so much that they treat it like their own cat—they buy it cat food, make sure he’s comfy to sleep there, have toys for him. Honestly, I’ve never owned a cat so I don’t know what they’re really like, but i can tell he loves all of them too. He snuggles and paws at the door to be let in, spends close to every night of the week there...and even leaves dead rats he hunts at their house (if this means anything).
 
This has been going on for more than a year, even before our relationship. We’re in college so moving to different houses is a common thing, and soon they will be relocating. I know what you’re thinking about what I could ask: do they really think they can convince the owners to take their cat with them? I mean it is pretty crazy, but it’s almost like their own pet at this point. And I know they’ll be very sad having to leave the feline homie behind. Anyways, they want me to come with them to talk to the neighbors and ask if they really want the cat and if the girls can “adopt” him.

So I’m asking for advice here for the first time. Should I tell them it’s tough love; it’s not your cat, sorry guys. Or should I see what the neighbors say? I mean for all I know he could be mistreated to be over at their house so much in the first place.",27May2019,1
240,"I recently wrote a letter to a penpal that was in prison, I might of said something in the body of the letter that they might of taken the wrong way. I did ask about the crime they had committed before being incarcerated. Looking back I don’t think I made a wise choice of saying that. 

It’s been three weeks since I mailed the letter. A friend of mine who’s best friend was in prison at one point said it could be delays, lockdown or just about anything down to maybe it never got there. I do overthink a lot and if I offended anyone I do want to explain myself. He said that I should write the person on a site that the prison uses for inmates to contact friends and family and it would be a lot quicker than using us mail and ask if they ever received my letter. My main question is, am I overreacting?",27May2019,1
241,"OK so apparently one of my friends was partying at my classmate's house and got a little out of hand. My classmate said my friend had broke their parent's bed, burned a hole through their sofa and poured motor oil on their driveway. My friend's parents have no idea my friend even drinks or smokes at all and would literally kill him if they found out.
My classmate obviously wants the money to repair the damage and hasn't even told about the bed to his parents. (Somehow keeps it together with weight lifting equipment.) And he is going to tell on my friend to his parents. 
I really want to help both of them so that my friends parents don't find out and my classmates gets the money. What advice should I give them?",27May2019,1
243,"So with school being out in much of the southwest US comes summer vacation. For *my* summer vacation, I am going to Virginia for about half of the break. The thing is, I don't want to go, but it's not my decision whether or not I can. That is not the main problem, though. The reason I don't want to leave is because I will be leaving someone I really love. (My SO)

I don't know how to cope with leaving my SO, and because I am leaving Thursday, I wont be able to make any further physical contact with them. Today was the last day I would see them for a month, and I'm bawling my eyes out over that fact. I am so sad that I'll be leaving SO, I need help accepting the fact that I have to leave, how to cope with leaving someone you love. I can't imagine life without them, so this month is going to feel like an eternal hell. Please, anything will help. Thank you..

244,"I’ve been married 7 years, together a total of 8. Our anniversary just came and looking back I came to the realization that I can’t do another 7 years of this.

She hasn’t been faithful, and I’ve chosen not to leave because of our son and mainly because I’m afraid to move out of this hole. I say our son because I’m terrified of the trash she’s going to bring around him. She’s hardcore on Suboxone and Xanax. It’s been addressed, she won’t change. It’s been 3 years and she still isn’t off of it.

The thing is, I’m not in love with her anymore. We have a home together, a family, so much to dismantle. I could list all the issues we’ve had, but the bottom line is that I’m tired of fighting.

247,"I don't know why, but I think I need to get this off my chest, and quickly. TLDR at the bottom, obviously.

 I'm a 20 yr old guy from India, currently studying engineering. I have always been good at math, so my parents decided that I should pursue this course. At first, I wanted to become one too, and I still feel like I can be a good engineer if I put my mind to it. I can code somewhat well too. 

The thing is, I don't want to. It's not the normal 'I don't want to because my parents forced me to'. It's that I want to do things on my own, maybe help out my father in his business, and later start my own business (he is a visa consultant). But my father is strictly against the idea. He wants me to get a job in my college placements and settle down. He has huge expectations from me. 

I have good communication and marketing skills from going on different ventures.

I can do either of the two. But I want to get out of my comfort zone and do something for myself, also making good money at the same time. We aren't particularly well-off so I get where my father's coming from. I can't decide what I should do?

What I have in mind: Complete the degree, join my father's business for experience and start my own business someday.

What my parents want: Complete the degree, get a high paying job, marry a girl of their choice (which, obviously, I'm not going to) and settle down. Produce a dozen grandkids probably. 

Also to note: I have ADHD so I can't work for long hours at a time. That's one of the reasons I want to go into business and not engineering.

TLDR:  20 yr old engineering student. Can't decide whether to continue engineering or get into business. Want to do business, but parents against it- want me to settle. Confused.",27May2019,1

(Not nude but me in a bra and shorts). To my surprise men actually wanted to hang out with me. People have told me the dangers about it, how every guy is obviously looking to hook up. I thought some guys just wanted to hang out and not do anything sexual with me. I was wrong because today proved it. I met up with a really cute SUPER sweet nice guy today. He was visiting from another city and is leaving tomorrow. I met up with him , and got back to his Airbnb and went into his room. He had already made attempts to me in his car prior. I lost my virginity to a 25 year old man and he knew my age. I won’t lie, I did enjoy it, I gave consent but. I realized I feel like I fucked up. Mainly because I feel desperate and alone, and I wanted to feel.. wanted. All my friends had lost their virginities, they’d always tease me for not losing mine and it made me feel horrible. I also think he didn’t really enjoy himself as much as I did. I felt like a burden, like he had to fuck me when I didn’t expect we were going to. Now, I feel like I fucked up, I hate my body and emotions for doing this. I don’t know how to heal or react to this. I’m trying to forget about it, try to make it positive.

258,"A teacher ( lets call him Jared)I know is a complete douche. 
(This high school is meant to help kids with anxiety ease back into public school).

 I think every school should have field trips, even if they're not educational. But it gets to a point where there is no more education, and just going out. That's what this school is. I know kids who possibly have their education ruined because of this school. 
Once you leave, you're left with so much unfinished stuff that you fail. But... the only reason there's so much work when you leave is because they're doing that on purpose. 

The school rarely hands out work, the kids do math every 2 weeks and it's below their current grade. The only reason the student who leaves has so much work, is because the school knows they'll get in shit if people found out they're not giving out work. 

I know a boy who's on the brink of suicide because of this school. And it's all because of Jared. Jared also likes to pretend he didn't know another school was bringing a kid who attempted to sexually assault a girl on a field trip, which said girl was on (causing her extreme emotional distress). There has been nearly 1 sexual assault and 1 groping by students in the past 5 months, which weren't reported. Instead they just expell the students cause they don't want to deal with it.

267,"•sorry this is on mobile and it’s 1;00 am here. 

I am a teachers assistant.
I have been working at this school for 2 years with students with learning disabilities and autism.

I am 23 and hope to become a teacher but first I need to finish my required courses and also finish my degree. Since starting my job at the school I have put my education on a bit of a hiatus so I am behind in my degree - I have been In 3rd year limbo for ages. 

I like my job ! But I dislike how management works - plus I have been called out at work a couple times by my manager  for no reason (I won’t get into why - that’s a rant that would take too long)
So this year has been weird...

There’s a lot of complicated politics and relationship that happened so I’m giving the cliff notes
But basically there’s this kid who’s I’ll call X, they are in 4th grade. 

X has potentially ODD.
X has 2 Teacher assistants who work with X but X injured one of his TA’s badly.
so work-safe has taken her off. 
Now there is only one - but she can’t handle X at all! And is very stressed. The stressed TA I’ll call Sandy.

Sandy has tried to find ways - anyway to get a break from X. So she insisted she go on an unnecessary field trip with her other student that could have been done another day. But since the injured TA can’t work with  X it caused complications.
Sandy recommended I (a person who has never worked this child before) to work with X. 
It ends up going amazingly! 

So - days later my manger says she has it in mind that I can work with X 3 days a week next year.
I tell her - I would prefer 2 days with X and if I’m needed maybe 2 days with another student. But I do not want to work 3 days with him. 

( the reason for this is if I work 4 days I get benefits, if I work 2 days only I don’t get benefits I’ll have lots of time to return to school, but 3 days I don’t get either.   

Additionally I do not think I’m qualified to be X’s “main” TA  and feel uncomfortable doing the majority work load) 

She kind of ignores me about my request about only wanting 2 days (or 4) and said she would make a plan and let me know if it’s 3 days or not . 

I also told her if I were to work with him I want to be introduced to him this year with another of his existing TA’s present. I DO NOT want to be left alone again - as I don’t know anything about X. 

She agrees but the same day I get a text from Sandy stating that my manger told her I would come to give her a break - then became a little aggressive when I said I would not go to X if she was planning on leaving .

. Once again miscommunication.

There’s a whole other can of drama in regards to X  and my current position and how management has handled it throughout the school year.

Point is I’m not sure that I want to work here again with all the management problems I experienced  and with a “difficult student” I would need people who actually listen to me. 

PLUS my partner TA would be sandy and I don’t think she can handle this position any better then I can - and that would make this position difficult.

The positive thing is that I genuinely believe I would have fun working with X ! And I am up for helping him .  Plus if I take the job it is stable money . 

If I don’t take it I might have to find another job (not that it would be hard since my field is in height demand - but it’s always a hassle) 

What would you do in this situation??",27May2019,2

271,"My best friend can be a-lot of things. He can be funny, sarcastic but most time i talk to him he can be negative, down putting, rude , and more. I have know my friend for about two years. Lets call him Dan(not his actual name)  when I first met him he was very quiet. I mean literally the first month that we knew each other our conversations was on a piece of paper. Eventually we became good friends and bow in eighth  grade we spend all our time together. During lunch, in the morning, during class. Before this march i thought that we would always be friends and that we stay together for ever. But something happened that made me change the way i see him and myself. 

In the middle of march this year we had our first high school orientation. Dan wasn’t with me because he had gotten accepted to a different fundamental school so he went to a different orientation. That day i saw that everyone was positive, fun to be around, nice, engaging, and overall the day was great and when i left the orientation i felt great about my self and about my decision of high school.  I had felt that i chose the wrong high school because dan was’t coming with me. And i believed that my life would be worse without him. But i think its the opposite, i think my life would be better without him. 

On my way to school the next day i felt the same as how i felt the orientation the day before. Happy and self confident. But after lunch i felt the different.  I felt emotionless, empty, cynical, overall i felt like a worse person. Eventually i found out why i felt this way. I had become similar but not the same as Dan was. I was emotionless to others that weren’t friends, i made fun of the kids who Dan made fun of overall more negative than i think i wanted to be. But as soon as dan wasn’t there i was more positive, happy and confident about myself. 

It has been weird in my head. Overall dan’s negativity has washed off on me when he is around. I fell bad after i have dine a bad deed to someone else. I think i’ll be a better person without Dan.  But the problem is that i like hanging out  with dan and he like hanging out with me. The school year is almost over(like literally less than 5 days) i don’t know wether to cut it off now or just ghost him on during the summer and never talk to him again. I need some advice or guidance.

272,"So as a quick background, I was in a pretty crummy relationship with a girl who had approached me regarding her feelings toward me. The best way to describe the relationship was friends with benefits, and then some. I wound up breaking up with her after she cheated on me while I was working.

While we never did have sex, there were several times we came close to it. On top of that, this was my first (and still only) relationship, which is why I feel like this is happening. I almost feel like I have an unfinished experience, and that I really need to complete it. Every time I start having intimate thoughts, I keep thinking of her, and I really don't want to.

I've been trying to find a hookup or relationship, mainly because I want one of them, but also because I feel like I'd be able to get my mind off the issue. In addition, self stimulation isn't cutting it for me, and I realized I'm really looking for a connection with somebody- looking them in the eye, feeling them in my arms, that stuff.

I'm not sure if this is because I don't have any other first hand experience to pull from, and I'm not sure how normal this is either. All I can say is that I keep thinking of her when my mind comes to this, and it's really bugging me that it keeps reminding me of her. What can I do about this to make it stop happening?",27May2019,1

274,"My sister, 12  (let's call her Kate) is a very sensitive person and she often has problems communicating. She wasn't diagnosed with anything, just doesn't get along with people, doesn't have many friends. 

She was (and is) always loved and didn't experience any childhood trauma.

Recently she was on a school trip and has been caught stealing from a local supermarket. It turned out alright, the management didn't call the police or press any charges. 

Now, the problem: she was locked in the security room with a friend of hers and a security guard. Naturally, our parents and me were furious as g
od knows what kind of a man was the security guy. We called the management and basically yelled and threatened them to immediately release my sister. 

When she came back home, the issue wasn't really the stealing but rather the consequences that could've happened if we didn't act as we did.

Because of that, my parents went a little too hard on Kate and now she's afraid of going to markets alone, doesn't talk to her friend (with whom she was caught with) and became even more closed in herself than before. 

I'm starting to think that we should've embraced what Kate did because, as strange as it sounds, that was a serious act that she did all by herself and it could've been a way for her to grow as a person. 

How can I fix the situation (do I need to?), what should I say to her to make her understand that she shouldn't blame herself for what happened and not to be afraid?

275,"My friend dropped out of university to go to military school (sorry idk how u call it) and i feel weird. My childhood friends and i went on a trip to the beach for three days as a last hurrah. And after that we all went back to uni. He visited us in the city where a few people from our group study in, and i didnt even go to meet him. They were going to a relatively expensive samgyup place and i didnt have money so i didnt go. And i also dont feel like i belong (weirdly enough as weve all known each other for a decade). And besides, we sorted goodbyes at the beach so i figured it’s not a big deal. But he invited me again and he said he felt annoyed that i didnt go so we went for dinner and he paid for everything. I feel guilty. But at the same time i feel kinda petty because i didnt go partly because whenever they go out on free days they forget to invite me (they reason that i dont go anyway).

And ive noticed that my relationships with people have been declining. Im extremely uncaring and selfish and dont go out of my way to meet with old (or new) friends. Im such a homebody and i dont like who im turning into. At the same time i mainly dont have a budget for going out so im frustrated.  A friend of mine gave me an advice, he said something like “you get the energy that you give”, and another like “socializing is a choice”. I feel like i intimidate people and my walls are so high that new people dont even want to be friends with me. It gets lonely to be honest. And tiring. Once i caught myself thinking that having friends can be such a chore. And then i think of that time when we had a retreat in senior high and i was that girl thats like in the corner while everybody takes group photos with their friends. Im getting too comfortable with being alone, thats whats bothering me.

279," Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

My  wife and I (Both 24) have been trying for a baby for around a year now. We have finally achieved our first positive test and will be getting blood tests done today. I am so relieved and happy about this I have no idea what to do with my emotions or my thoughts. My wife and I have a really awesome and close relationship and I could see that this  was  hurting her for quite some time (The fact that it was taking long in her books).

&amp;#x200B;

I am really nervous and have no idea what to expect. I am sure going to be doing a lot of learning in the next few months and a hell of a lot more when the baby is here. That being said I would like to know some tips from the men already in fatherhood. Tips that no book is going to teach me. I really want to be a good father and am already so scared of messing this up.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make my wife proud and keep her happy. That has been my goal for years and hope I can continue doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks",27May2019,6
280," 

(NSFW?) And to get any confusion out of the way, I'm bisexual and desire ONLY monogamy.

&amp;#x200B;

I acknowledge that what I'm feeling is something I shouldn't, and I know it's wrong and I really would like to know how I can handle it. Three weeks ago, my best friend, Alicia (who I've known for about a year and half), told me she wanted to be honest with me and knew I wouldn't reciprocate and confessed she had feelings for me. I told her I wanted to keep things friendly since I was already in a relationship, and our friendship continued as (I thought) normal. She didn't push the issue anymore and neither of us had brought that up till date.

&amp;#x200B;

I began realizing I hadn't felt totally platonic towards Alicia, either. But she's one of my closest friends and I would never cut contact with her or stop sharing things with her over something like this. I decided the best way to handle my feelings was to stick to my words about keeping things friendly with her and to throw myself into my relationship with my boyfriend instead, with whom I've been for a year. But it hasn't been working, at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to organize dates outside with him, which he's shown no interest in. I tried to organize stay-in-and-talk dates with him, which he also didn't want. His idea of spending time together is me watching him as he plays a video game, and that's pretty much all he wants to do. He rarely or never hugs me or says he loves me, and I've been trying to do it more and he's asked me to not do it so much. He's said that's not how he shows affection, but I find that he doesn't show it in any way, at all. I've been cooking the best I can for him and really, really trying, and I feel like I'm making excuses, but things just won't start looking up. We eat most of our meals together, in silence. That's a positive that I see.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided I wanted to work on our sex life, which has been pretty bad. In the history of our relationship, there have been times I gave him a blowjob or handjob nearly every day and until a month or two ago, I still did so regularly. He's pleasured me maybe five times in total, reluctantly, saying he was bored. Even while having penetrative sex, I do most of the work on top. There was nothing in our sex life for me and it fizzled out. I brought it up to him and he admitted it was bad but he didn't have the motivation to work towards my pleasure because it didn't feel good for him. I don't know how to work with that.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point maybe you'd ask why we're still together and it's because I know that when you really try to talk to him he can he great, he has a good sense of humor and he's only 20 so maybe he'd be more giving later on. But because of everything I've written out, I just feel myself falling out of love for him. More so, I don't feel like choosing to commit to him anymore but he has no idea how bad it's gotten.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that Alicia is a reliable source of emotional support. I haven't been able to rely on my boyfriend through pregnancy scares, issues with my parents, and other things. He'd often leave and go to his home saying he 'doesn't want to deal with this' and most of the time, it was my best friend who showed up for me instead. It's just really not good for my relationship with my boyfriend, and I feel so lost in this situation, the more time passes the more I worry over the fact that my crush on Alicia won't die or be drowned out. I feel so much more supported and understood by her.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to improve and maintain my relationship with my boyfriend, how do I do that starting from here? Thank you for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr: My relationship with my best friend is a lot warmer and more supportive than what I have with my boyfriend. I can't bring myself to cut/reduce contact with her, but still want to make things better with my boyfriend. How do I do it?",27May2019,1

So I'm in my 2nd to the last year in a prestigious med school in my country. I live in SE Asia, but the rest of my family lives in Canada. Having visited a couple times, I feel that Canada would provide a better quality of life, and even better career opportunities for me.

I have 2 more years of med school, and I don't want to burden my parents with the financial aspect of that.

288,"This is a very, very long story.

I'm a thirteen year old girl who lives someplace in England. Ever since I was little, my family have been reluctant to tell me anything about what was going on. When I was young and didn't understand. I remember these little memories when I remember my mums brother pushed my dad out of the house. And when sometimes my mum would just drag me to my dad's house and leave me there for a little while. But when I questioned any of my family about it, they just classed me as irrelevant.

I didn't even know my parents split up, I asked my dad ""are you married to mummy!"" because I saw a ring on his ring finger, and he was like ""No I'm engaged to Tanna (fake name)!"" And I was really confused.

I'm the youngest out of 3. My older sister is 5 years older than me, and my older brother is 2 years older than me,but he has non-verbal autism so I can't exactly talk to him. He doesn't like me anyway, whenever I try to hug him he pushes me away and he trys to jam me in the door sometimes, and Its hurts. One time, he barged into me and I fell, It hurt but my mum didn't care.

When I was little, my sister would always ignore me, she was always saying how I was annoying. She used to play with me but I didn't like the way she played bc she would scare me. She began to drift further and further away from me. I was always desperate for company when I was little so I would have a bunch of fake friends who would ditch me in the playground, but I was happy because I had ""friends"".

My mother always said I acted like a single child because I spoke so easily to adults. I preferred adults to kids anyway.

Anyway, they always held some sort of information away from me. When I was 11 I walked into my mum and sister having a conversation, and my mum casually mentions a miss carriage she had. I didn't know this. I stepped away from the conversation because I couldn't handle it. I would've had a brother, and they didn't tell me. I was so upset.

When I was 8,my mum stopped me from seeing my dad. I wasn't able to write a letter, see him at his house, go on trips, nothing. I was heartbroken because I needed my dad. He was my escape in some ways. He was always prepared to make me happy, get me anything I wanted and he was so relaxed and laid back. It let me escape from my too-serious mother and sister. And now it was gone.

He came to visit me at my schools Christmas service, and we both cried, I was so happy. He gave me my Christmas presents and thhis huge hug because I needed to go. I was still sobbing on my way home.

He also came to my sports day, and gave me my birthday presents. He came to my events and watched me when nobody else did.

But then my mum didn't like this - at all. I haven't seen my dad (or any of that side of the family) since July 2nd 2016.

I've started to realise how unfair and selfish my mother and my mothers family was being. Just because he hurt her she has to hurt me.

And the worst part is My older sister and brother can see him.

I've acquired this attitude and mindset that all of my family (except for my mums mum) are selfish f*ckers and don't deserve happiness. I've started to get anger problems as I'm struggling more and more to control it.

This has gotten to the point where, I just want to walk out the house and go to my dad's house. But I can't because of the massive trouble I'd get into. I've already talked to my mum about it, and she said I'm not going to be able to see him until I'm 16.

He gives me a brief explanation on having to intervene, confused I just play along as I trusted is position of power (he failed me obviously). I later realised he wrote on the sheet that 'handbrake was applied to avoid collision'. The handbrake was never used, I did not jolt to a stop, I did not hear the click of disengaging it after, and I didn't see him use it, not only that, but I was a solid 3m from any car, travelling at less than 5km/hr and have not entered the round-a-bout.

He rushed out the door afterwards and immediately left, I realised afterwards he didn't even finish the form. Is there anything other than a formal complaint that I can do, I have his examiner ID no. as well as the failure form, it cost me about $70 AUD and 4hrs of time, plus it will take a month or so to book another one.

302,"Sorry for the length of this post, I just wanted to make sure I was illustrating my issue properly.

I'm a 27 year old man turning 28 in a month. I kind of need to vent some feelings about my proximity and worries towards romance/relationships and what stops me from functioning properly in such context. I'm not sure if this is the exact place I should be looking to for perspective, as a lot of what I need to say could be taken as generalized psychological issues, but it's my thoughts about women and partnership that have directed me to the state of mind I've recently been occupying. I'd like to think I'm a stoic man most of the time. Consciously so. Please believe me when I say that if I feel the need to express myself, particularly in a digital space among strangers, that I do not do so idly. And no, my Reddit username is not my actual name.

So, fuck. Where to start... The last time I was even tangentially involved with someone was sometime around last fall. We spoke almost every day for about half a year. We eventually started to meet up in person and spent time together, and we were never intimate but would occasionally sext. It was okay, for a while, just having someone to talk to, but the truth of it was that I wasn't really attracted to her, I was just lonely. It never explicitly ended so much as it just dribbled away. I just stopped responding to her texts as diligently as I had been, and I think she understood what the issue was. I felt like I couldn't do better. I still feel like that. Her and I came from a similar background and that's what allowed me to reciprocate her initial advancements, however insincerely. And this is what's painful to explain.

There was a time, aged 18 or 19, when I was a pretty proud and willful guy. I was able to socially navigate to the extent which I cared to. I've never not been a quiet person, always an introvert, but I was satisfied with what I had. I entertained the occasional date, went to the occasional party, and was sexually active, but things slowly changed.

By the time I was 20 I was an alcoholic. Alcohol was for me a social lubricant so pleasant that my life and mind quickly centered around it. By the time I was 24 I was a devastating alcoholic. The kind who lived under a pine tree in a sleeping bag. I lost all my friends. My family wept for what I had become. I'm unable to put into words the weight of my shame and I doubt the every-man could even comprehend it. I can't bring myself to go into detail, but know that I have done things which would make your skin crawl. I wasn't a surly drunk, more cloying and sentimental. I had to drop out of school and obviously couldn't keep a job. Addiction is insidious and blinding. I weathered a number of failed attempts to quit, went to rehab, and even tried AA (Btw, fuck AA). In the end my life came to a point where I only had one choice: Quit drinking or commit suicide. And so I quit.

Something you don't always hear about addiction is the way in which it, over time, damages your personality. For some irreparably. Most never get sober, but I am confident that part of my life is over. I've been sober for 3 &amp; 1/2 years, but that first year man, that was hard. I became angry and lashed out at the few people who still cared for me. I assumed my wrath was the product of a feeble mind starved of its stupid grog; desperately resisting change. It often seemed like I couldn't control my thoughts and the anger simply assumed command. Close to Christmas 2016 I descended into a delirium and sent a number of threats to my sister for not inviting me to Christmas dinner. I stopped sleeping and became very confused. I had one of my housemates drive me to the hospital after a string of anxiety attacks and frightening intrusive thoughts. I was guided to a fortified room where I was to wait for the on call psychiatrist. I stayed over night and began to get listless waiting for them. When morning came I decided that I wanted to leave but was denied that want. My sister, my emergency contact, had been in touch with the hospital and evidently informed the staff of my recurring, violent outbursts, giving them grounds to keep me detained. After a brief visit with the psychiatrist I was transferred to an asylum outside the city. 

I spent 7 weeks there, and after the 2nd I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It was hard being there, and any horror stories you've ever heard about anti-psychotics, I promise you, are based in fact.

This is all just preamble though, my life isn't a waking nightmare or anything. Life has improved greatly in fact. I work as a freelance writer... is something I could say with a little dishonesty. I earn my own money from writing but I'm still assisted financially by disability because it's not exactly sustaining as a career if you're not established or working 80 hour weeks. I'm going back to school to pursue a bachelors degree in English. I'm very close with my family, particularly my mother and sister who were probably most effected by my drug and alcohol abuse. Overall, the people in my life were extremely happy that I ""made it back."" My mom would sob and say stuff like ""I missed you so much."" My mental state is stable, I haven't experienced any kind of psychosis since the initial incident, and I have my psychiatrist to thank for that. It's taken a while but we eventually found a nice mix of medications and lifestyle choices that suite me, and the negatives effects of my medication are very minimal. I feel more or less like my old self. I exercise regularly, am able to follow complex ideas, and I express myself fluently. But I have absolutely no self-esteem.

Like none, nil, zilch. Maybe with the exception of my outward appearance. In that regard, I might even be a little bit vain. Normally, I don't go out of my way looking for interaction, but romance has been on my mind. I'm not the kind of person who dislikes being alone. No, what bothers me is my age. The simple fact of the matter is that I'm almost 28 and I have no real relationship experience. Anything that I might consider a relationship was more of an enabling, co-dependent mess steeped in drinking and drug use. I guess it just worries me that, even if I do want companionship, I won't have the choice. I feel unable to even try and seek out a SO. 

There are two problems that endlessly nag at me. 

1. I'm frightened to let anyone know me for what should be obvious reasons. A little while ago my sister rented out a gym and party room, one meant for small children, for my nieces second birthday. There was a young woman working there who helped set up party decor and coordinated some activities for the kids. I followed my niece around and took pictures, and whenever I took my focus off her I would look around the room and notice the employee looking at me. At one point we crossed paths and had a moment of extended eye contact and she smiled at me. She was very pretty, but it didn't matter. I was paralyzed. I could do nothing. I struggled against the anxiety, but it swallowed me. ""You?"" my brain seemed to say, ""What do you have to offer? You're a poor, (relatively) jobless, recovering addict, outpatient with an intensive mental disorder, no car, and no prospects. Get real."" For the rest of my time there I had to avoid having her in my sight.

2. I have to question whether or not seeking/having a relationship is even ethical on my part. I don't know what could happen. The label ""high risk"" seems appropriate. I don't want to fuck up anybodies life. Although I feel normal most of the time, I still have habits that remind me that I've become a bit fucked in the head over the years. I have constant flashbacks to my time in the drink, particularly dark moments, and whenever I do I make my hand a mock gun, put it to my temple, and bend my thumb like I'm snapping the hammer. It's like a tick, I do it almost unconsciously. It doesn't really signify good mental health. In my more optimistic moments I try and convince myself that having someone around to care about would reduce my own undesirable habits and thoughts, but those hopes don't last and feel more like a pitfall in my thinking which I need to dodge.

I guess I'm just kind of lost. how do you overcome the darkest shit in your life? I've read a lot of grievances on this subreddit. Everyone's got their demons. How do you stop them from interfering in your life? When, if ever, do you feel like it's safe open yourself up or take on the weight of a partner? How do you stop having flashes of painful memories that haunt your life experience? I know self hatred is foolish, but it's so hard to stop. Nietzsche wrote: ""He who despises himself still respects himself as one who despises."" I've always liked that quote, and I want to change, but how can I even be aware if I do?

But yeah, these questions keep me up sometimes. I don't know what kind of feedback I'm looking for, but if you have any insight into these kinds of thoughts or questions I would appreciate hearing from you. Thank you for taking the time to read this formless, rambling harangue.",27May2019,1

305,"Hi do I need a psychologist? Let me explain.
A year ago I talked to a very sweet psychologist about my social anxiety and she really helped me. I already knew what to do, but when she explained how anxiety works on a biotechnological plan, it really clicked. 

Since then I have broken up with my ex, which was awesome. Just amazing. But now? I can’t let myself catch feelings for anyone. A guy caught my eye and when I found out he wasn’t single I was so RELIEVED. It shouldn’t be like this. But I feel like others need her time more than me, and that it would be selfish to take that time from them.

Also, I saw a very bad psychologist before her, so I always have this fear (I guess) that she’ll call me stupid for whatever issue I have. I’m gonna have this networking meeting with her tomorrow and other young people who has/is struggling, about what could be done to help other people like us. Should I ask her for a session?",27May2019,1
306,"
When I was 16(2010?) me, my mum, my sister and my dad(they hadn’t been together for 12 years) moves up too Great Yarmouth, whisky being up there I did leave the house for over a year and a half then we got evicted from our property and me and my dad went to live in a tent with the dogs whilst my mum and sister were in temporary accommodation. Not long after my mum got a new place and I went back there whilst my dad rented his own place during that time with my Mum I stayed in constantly and got my first every eating disorder from my addiction to gaming.

When I was 18 my mum came out as a lesbian and that’s never bothered me in the slightest, she ended up getting with a women called Kaye and a few months after she physically assaulted me whilst she was drunk and I always felt like my mum chose her over me. That was my first emotional breakdown.

The months after that I never left my room, I just spoke to girls online and that’s when I realised that I have a weird tick where if people don’t reply fast enough/don’t want to talk/stops talking after a while I’d feel really low and get very persistent. It always felt like I was obsessive or stalkerish even though I never wanted to do those things.

The older I got the more I noticed little triggers or impulses that I can’t stop, I always had an interest in my head I’ve always known I’m not wired like everyone else.

My mum always questioned why I’d always repeat the same things over and over again in an argument and not be able to stop, I always stated that if she thinks it’s bad listening to it she should try being in my head and I’ve always gone through life feeling content, never happy, never sad, just content and I’m very open about all this to my friends and family.

When I was 23 my ex misses was pregnant with my first child, a few months into the pregnancy I found out she was cheating on me from a month into our relationship and not long after that she aborted the baby. That’s when I had my second emotional breakdown.

I’m now with my current misses, she knows all my triggers and I’ve found workarounds for every habit I do that’s out of my control and the relationship is good bar the little breakdowns I do have.

I’ve got brandings all up my right forearm, I’ve suffered from eating disorders ever since I was 17 and I’m currently dealing with one now, I had a stage of sleeping with 31 women before my misses all within 3 years and none were with protection, I’ve always acted life my life isn’t a priority even though I know it is! I’ve thrown away relationships just because i could and I can have a breakdown that will last less than two minutes where I’ll hit myself several times in the head, burst into tears out of shame(because my misses witnesses it) and then snap out of it in a dazed like manner and I’ve always done stupid things on impulse(tattoos(you’d understand if you seen it) Saying/doing things that get me in trouble).

I feel happier in the darker side of my head but I know I’m a nicer person in the clear side of my head, I am currently going to the doctors for help to see what the hell is wrong and I’m hoping they can find the cause.

I’m a chill guy who doesn’t want to die, I don’t hate life and I want to experience everything I possibly can in my life but as my head gets worse I’m starting to believe that one day it might not be me who makes that choice and it’s starting to scare me.

There are things I’ve missed but this is kind of explains some key points of me and my life.",27May2019,1
307,"Just some classic high school friendships breaking 

Also cross posted with r/friendshipadvice
So for the past couple of days I've been really  busy. 
I've had multiple internals (exams/tests) throughout the now 5 week term. I live in New Zealand. While I've had maybe 5 internals due and continuously been doing, my other friend has only had two. One of which I am also doing at the moment. 

Now this exam that we are both currently doing is a long term exam/assessment. This means s we have had over 4 weeks in and out of class to do the research. Throughout the past 4 weeks, she has not done any work in class, always asking me what to do when she wasn't listening as she was texting her friends. So she basically hasn't done anything for the past 4 weeks.

Two weeks into this assessment, she was given another report to write for another subject. But she hadn't done anything on that either. Spending her class time play games and talking  to her friends while not doing the work.

Just so you know, her average grade for everything is excellence, the highest mark you can get. So she isn't bad at academics, she just didn't do any work.

Today, we were meant to hand in all of our research for our assessment that that will take place in a couple of days. Luckily, out teacher extended it by one day. I realised that I had done something wrong. At this point my friend had constantly been looking g at my work and copying it down because she didnt do the work beforehand. 

Now that I've known that I did something wrong, I took it out. She started asking me what I was doing and why I was deleting my work. I just told her how it was incorrect as I had done it wrong and was going to do it at home because it was end of school day. So I actually didnt nmiwnifni had done it wrong, but I asked my family members and they said I was wrong. That's fine, I have time to fix it up. Being a decent enough person, I told that friend that it was wrong and would have to do it again.

Her immediate response was of incould send it to her over our school email. Our teacher told us if we had sent our work to each other, if could be an automatic fail. I've never failed something before so I wasn't risking it as he had access to all of the emails sent. 

I told her no, and for her to do it herself. I spend my time and effort doing this correctly because I wanted a good grade so I wasn't about to send it to her so she could copy and be over with it within 2 minutes while I spent over an hour doing it. She told me how she had her internal due the next day and how it was more important so I should just send it to her. I reminded her that I have had a lot more work due and I also have another couple of assessments the next day.

She ended up blocking me on Instagram and is most likely talking bad about me to all of our friends. She is the favored friend so now I'm worried what will happen when I go back to school tomorrow. 

Does anyone have any idea on what I should do? Or if I was in the wrong or not?",27May2019,1
308,"**Backstory/info:** 

I work for a managed service provider in Melbourne, Australia. We pretty much do work any IT kind of work for any business that will pay. I've worked there for two years now first starting off on the service desk as a L1 tech. I then moved to field service and after some time ive just recently moved back to service desk as a L2. They still have me doing odd field service jobs but mostly service desk stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Now sometimes we have companys who will pay to have one of our techs go out to a site to sort of ""contract"" as if they were one of their internal IT. Now the tech who goes out to these jobs never signs a different contract, they are just sent out to this as if it was another job. This is where the issue starts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason I need advise:**

I was recently aproached by my manager telling me they have a new contracting roll coming up at a site for the next 8 weeks full time. I was told this will be an advanced L2 roll focusing on infastructure and projects. This was quite apealing as it meant I wont have to deal with customers and will hopefully be able to learn from a global companies infastructure team. I was even told I wouldnt have to spend all my time imaging laptops as I usually would on field service, sounds great!! I acepted instantly thinking it would be a great opertunity. Keep in mind this whole deal was setup on Tuesday and the onsite started Friday, so it was all very rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

So finally Friday comes around and im super excited to start my new roll. After a few minutes there I can tell this was going to be a nightmare. Turns out Im just doing basic L1 troubleshooting, just taking calls and responding to email tickets. Now after half a day there I asked if this was just an introduction before working on other things. They said no that I was hired as a L1 tech but there will be a new laptop roll with pleanty of laptops to image soon... At this point I let my manager know about this and the only responce I got was ""that sucks"".

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worse the team leader for the service desk, my new ""boss"" for 8 weeks is a condecending asshole. I saw multiple times where he was talking down to another tech or talking about users behind their backs. I thought maybe he's just in a bad mood. but then I soon find out that the reason im there is due to one tech quitting, another going part time and a lot of people having excesive sick leave... Surely this cant be a coincidence. Nope he spoke to me like shit most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've only spent two days their but I cant help but think theres no way I can spend 8 weeks there and I dont want to leave it too late. The night before the second day I couldnt sleep just thinking of it. I keep going back and forth between suck it up and you cant stay here. I have one of my team leads from my company I know I can talk to but I just dont know what to say.

&amp;#x200B;

So... what should I do? Should I speak with my team lead who I know has my back or the manager who sorted the contract? If I do what should I say to them? Honestly Ill do anything not to have to stay at this place.",27May2019,1

310,"So a bit of context. 

First off, I didn't have a good childhood, some might even say that I never got to be a child. I am extremely anxious and not so good with other people, introvert and all that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it is especially bad with women (I am a man myself) and though I am not completely clueless about how to be with them, I have a weird problem with them. Every time I get any sort of feelings for a woman, I have this unnatural fear that I'll fuck everything up. For example, just a week ago a certain young lady who I was interested in (and who I suppose also is interested in me) said to me casually that she was going to a coffee to meet people, and of course my fucking brain thought immediately that she is going on a date and that I've fucked up again. This, in turn, gave me a massive anxiety attack in a fucking crowded bus. 

What the fuck is happening to me, and can I do anything to stop these things to happen, these thoughts of fucking up I mean. 

I'm just so fucking tired to be like this, I want to be normal. Not that I know what the fuck that's supposed to mean",27May2019,3
311,"I (31M) have recently suffered from a 'mental breakdown' and was asked by my job to take up to 8 weeks of paid time off work due to my noticeable deteriorating mental/emotional health. Before I head into a slew of required therapy appointments, I was hoping for some direction because it's like to get this figured out before I become a father someday.

I grew up in a trailer park, raised by a single mom who made several bad relationship choices that included a husband that was nice to her, but mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically abusive to me. Regardless, I grew up with the mentality of putting others before myself. I have never thought of myself as anyone special or important. I was always the nerdy kid in school because my hobbies centered around technology, video games especially. I distanced myself away from my home life as much as possible and whatever friends I've been lucky to have, I've always called them my ""family"". 

Currently, with a Bachelors of Science in Management Information Systems, I now work in a call center for a large cell phone service provider, helping people with technical support (incredibly stressful) and taking escalations. It pays well, but the medical benefits are what I need most for my wife. I love being exposed to multiple religions/cultures/ways of life, but for many years all I see now is that I live in a 1st world country with privelaged people that don't appreciate what they have and look down on others and other countries (the news doesn't help). I work really hard to ensure I don't become a hypocrite. I feel so guilty all the time that regardless of the story so far, my daily life is so much better than other people in the world. I feel like I'm whining when I have a complaint and generally feel like scum for having any type of opinion. I am not religious, but I am incredibly accepting of everyone's beliefs, unless someone uses their religion to belittle others. 

I use to practice traditional &amp; non traditional martial arts for almost a decade and I wasn't too bad either, but I pretty much stopped going because the friends that started with me, no longer go and I missed the companionship. In trying to become a more spiritual and we'll rounded person, I've taken up yoga, but again, the lack of a friend makes it difficult to go to classes sometimes.

I am married to a very wonderful but troubled wife (29F), we've been together for over 8 years. She was diagnosed at an early age with clinical depression and general anxiety, but she also has advanced endometriosis (2-9 centimeter cysts will intermittently grow on her internal reproductive organs and cause a lot of pain). I have come a long way in understanding her mental disease, but apparently it's still not enough. My wife also worked in customer service for the same cell phone company for years until approx 2 years ago, she had a mental breakdown, wanted to take her own life, was sent to a facility for several weeks, came back home and has not been able to keep a job for more than a couple months due to her random pain episodes associated with her endometriosis (a new big cyst about every 6-8 months). She has tried to take her life again about a year ago (I found her on the bathroom floor and now I have PTSD whenever she cuts herself or tries commit suicide) because she says she was making my life too hard. She has also came out as bisexual, but because I despise cheating, I won't agree to an open relationship (further complicated by her increased sex drive, while I am highly anxious about sex). We have intermittently pursued couple's &amp; individual therapy to improve our communication skills and address our differences. We are currently waiting just 3 more weeks to have an ovary removed so she can try to have a good quality of life again, then she will spend a month in Los Angeles for a personal vacation.

For the last 2 years, I have become a caretaker and sole income provider. We live paycheck to paycheck and I hate it. My wife is essentially the center of our relationship, but because her depression/anxiety/Endo has gotten worse over the last 2 years, I do about 90-95% of the housework, chores, financial planning/budgeting, and errands. Unfortunately so much resentment has built up in our relationship, we consistently fight on an almost daily basis. Recently we had such a big argument (""I always do everything, why can't you help"", ""you're always sleeping in and leaving me to do everything"", ""no, I don't feel ready to have a kid and sometimes I just wouldn't want to have a kid with you. Let's adopt instead."") that I blamed myself for so many of our problems and I punched myself repeatedly in the face until I gave myself black eyes and swelling (hence the request from work to take time off and get myself back together).

313,"So, yeah, as the title suggests, I've got a LOT on my mind and been in this state for a while. I'll try to keep it brief, but do forgive me if this gets long. I will try to summarize at the end in a TLDR version and number each point if that'll make it easier.

Also, if there's a * followed by a number, there's an asside that doesn't fit in with the main topic of the wall of text, but still needs to be said regardless, and will be at the end.

For ease of typing, M = Mom, D = Dad, BS = Biological Sister, S = Adopted sister (she's more of a sister to me than my biological one).

1. So, I guess I'll start with the fact that the previous year has been quite insane. Exactly one year ago, I stayed with D (who currently lives in Saudi Arabia for work reasons). I did this because my self confidence was lacking. We are similar in a lot of ways, so he was able to help me build my confidence back up. This is a bit of preface for what I'm going to say next, being we differ in ideas. An example being that I'm more open to new ideas such as that trans people are actually the gender they identify as, whereas he still calls them by their biological sex. This is a bit of an issue, as when I was around 10 I began to question my gender. I suppressed those thoughts  somewhat successfully for a number of years due to religious upbringing, but after becoming atheist, I began to explore those thoughts again. I'm still not fully clear on how I feel yet, but watching atheist youtubers, especially Mr. Atheist, I've been more able to experiment with these thoughts. I guess I'll try to summarize this issue with the fact that I don't think it's doing me any good to work this out on my own, yet my former therapist (I moved recently) is the only one I've told this, and he didn't seem to help much. I also don't feel I can tell M or BS, as M has said offhandedly that all people who undergo gender correction surgery eventually commit suicide, and BS will most definitely use it against me. One final tidbit of info is that I'm closest with only 2 members of my family, being D and S. I bring this up because S actually questions what she's told, a trait that rubbed off on her from D and I. I also bring this up because I've actually been able to tell D about how I'm bisexual with no fear about him seeing me negatively. 

2. As vaguely hinted at in the previous wall of text, my relationship with M isn't the best. Hell, she's the reason why my self confidence was so low in the first place. Put simply, she had this weird mix of not caring about what I said and believing far too much in me. The second part is bad because sometimes M would believe so much in me, she would give me a task that I had no idea how to do, give me no instructions, and be mad at me when I didn't do exactly what she wanted. I like that she believed in me, but the pressure was too much at times. It even somewhat instilled a perfectionist mindset in me that I had to see a hypnotherapist to weaken. Another issue is that I can barely remember exact examples of anything before I was 17, so when I finally realized what was happening, all I had to go on were vague feelings, so I couldn't confront M on anything exact until recently when I started to keep a journal. M also has a victim complex. What I mean is that when she does something wrong, she always finds a way to make it as if she's the one you should give comfort and pity. One good example I can remember happening recently is that, after M and my sisters came back from a trip to New York, M needed a wall adapter for her charger. S was supposedly the last one to have it, so M went to her to ask where it was. After S said she didn't know, M told her to go to the car to look. When S refused, a loud crash rang through the house. I quickly exited my room to see what was going on, and found M grabbing S by her hair and grappling with her. I shouldn't need to say that that was no way to react over a simple charger adapter, and yet, an hour after the event had died down (incase you're wondering, I didn't call the cops. I don't know why exactly, but if it happens again, I won't hesitate to call.) M came into my room, crying. She was upset, and said she knew what she did was wrong, and just hoped that I wasn't mad with her. I simply kept my calm and told her that there was no excuse for what she did, and she left my room. I chose that as an extreme to show how far she can go, because I do remember her acting in similar ways when I was young, telling me that D had yelled at her the previous night about something we (her children) had done or said. At the time, I believed her, but now, I don't know. One thing I just want to say as an asside is that one event I remember distinctly is that I've heard many a story from S about how hard my mom is on her, while she's not nearly as strict with BS. Now, I study psychology in my free time as it's something I grasp easily and want to make a profession out of. This is important, as in some of my studies, I've learned about developmental psychology. When I was trying to help M by giving her some advice (her and D had divorced a while ago, leaving M solely in charge of raising the family), she remarked that I had no idea what it was like raising a child. I began to state back that while, no, I have not raised my own, I do like to theorize what it would be like, and she immediately snapped ""well how the fuck are you going to if you don't even have a girlfriend yet!?"" As you can imagine, I was taken aback, but I quickly regained my composure and continued with explaining that in preparation I have studied the psychology of it, and even spoken with S, who has shown signs of being sheltered and watched far too closely. 

3. BS is a simpler case. She may be two years younger than me, but with my self confidence crushed by M, BS found it easy to boss me around. Even when I would try to refuse, BS would go to M, who would then make me do it for her. Another part of the ""overconfidence in me"" I'm guessing. I mean, my gaming addiction did mean I was in the house most of the time, but just because I'm in the house doesn't mean you can shove your responsibilities of driving S around onto me last minute. BS also had terrible taste in men. She had 2 boyfriends that I knew of, one of which broke up with her for ""reasons I can't imagine"". Her (hopefully) recent X was by far the worst choice ever. He essentially started to make BS join his ""cult"". I would use another word, but his methods were literally what cults use to try and control their members. One thing to note is that BS has medication for depression, and this guy (who from now on I'll call SOB) got her to stop taking her medication, getting her to believe that he was all she needed. Also, around when BS started dating SOB, we started to lose a lot of valuables, usually when SOB came by our house. Not only that, BS also somehow convinced M to start giving SOB's family money for trucks, repairs, and other shit like that. In the end, M ended up paying more than 4k to them, and we never saw a single cent flowing the other way. Eventually, M took BS's driving privileges away, and I essentially took up all the driving when M was at work. I was fine with it, except for one day when I had to drive BS. This is not a day I remember fondly, but I still feel must be detailed. Basically, we were waiting around BS's school, as she had an event in about an hour (it's a half hour drive home and back, and the school doesn't like you loitering on the property), when SOB texted her, saying his friend kicked SOB out of his house. Now, BS was basically forbidden from seeing SOB due to all the money they owed us. Still BS blew up M's phone with texts claiming that if someone didn't pick up SOB, he might throw himself infront of traffic and kill himself (this was a common threat he would use), which BS would them blame on M. M relented, and texted me to do what BS said. However, this was about 3 months ago, so after I had gained back my self confidence. I stayed stoic and ignored everything BS was screaming at me. I tried to text D discreetly, asking what I should do, when she read it over my shoulder and began to scream even louder. She even called SOB on her phone, and screamed at me if I didn't do it, she'd get out of my car and walk into traffic herself. At first I didn't act because she herself didn't move (I only react to promises, not empty threats). Then, she got out of my car, and started walking. I did what anyone would do in that situation, being got out of my car, ran to BS, and somewhat tackled her. Not hard enough to knock us to the ground, but hard enough to ensure my arms were completely wrapped around her. Now, I'm the strongest member in our family, so there was no way she was going to break free. Still, she agreed to come back to NYC car with me, where she put SOB on speaker phone. He claimed I hit her, that if he saw me he'd slit my throat, and after all that, said that if I didn't pick him up, he report my pot to the police. Now, this was in North Carolina, one of the ""bible belt"" states, where weed is known as the devil's cabbage. It was not light if you were caught with it, so I ended up yielding and picked him up. It was a terrifying 45 minute drive with him in the car. After I dropped him off, I went home, and after waiting an hour in my room, hugging my cat sarah for comfort, I decided to go out to my car. I texted M that, when she got home, she should meet me in ny car instead of going inside, as I didn't want BS to get to her first. Now, despite how I described M earlier, she still cares greatly for her children, even if her ways are misguided. I was watching a video on my phone when I saw her pull in. She came to my car, and I at first told her that I simply couldn't stay around any longer. After pressing me a bit, I broke down and tokd her everything that had happened. I didn't even know how much it terrified me until I told M everything. I was shaking so much by the end, recounting the memory as it was still fresh, that when she suggested we go to the police station, she had to drive because my shaking was too intense. (I was so scared because SOB is the type of person you believe when he says he'll slit your throat) When we got there, I told them everything, even the bit about the weed*1. They confiscated the small amount of pot, and we showed up at the court house the next day to get a restraining order on SOB, and to see if we could get BS into a psyche ward for attempting to commit suicide. She was submitted and came back a few weeks later in a healthier state of mind, but I'm still seeing the old signs of who she once was every now and then.

4. If you thought all my issues were with my family, guess again! I've also got personal issues that I've still yet to tell anyone until now! First is one that I'm sure many of you can relate with, pretending to be excited about your self destructive tendencies, hence the first and second sentence of this wall of text. Just thought I'd get that out of the way, as I'm actually pretty concerned with most of them. Next up, I find it nearly impossible to motivate myself to do anything that I know I enjoy if it isn't related to gaming or videos. For example, drawing*2. I love it, I find I talk to myself a lot more when I do (which is a sign of a healthy, active mind), and yet I can't get myself to do it unless something super strong is motivating me to, such as when adventure time ended. I also love the process of writing essays for school and college applications and the like, seriously, the euphoria of a well written paper is like nothing else, but I still can't motivate myself to do it unless I'm already doing it. Next up, due to the years of crushed self esteem, I have issues making new friends, and the old ones are worse than D when it comes to LGBTQ+. I've said before that I've seen a hypnotherapist, and at one session, she helped identify two facets of me. One being the driving force that embodies my laziness in every way, which showed itself as a white void, and the other facet being my creative, curious, and explorative side, which showed itself as a kaleidoscope of different colors on a black background. The white void used by voice in a monotone setting, where as the kaleidoscope expressed as much emotion as possible using my voice. I bring this up, because I'm somewhat sure the White Void is part of another problem of mine, being that when I hear something, it usually takes an active role on my part to not immediately accept something tokd to me as fact. What's really annoying about it is that I don't believe anything without sufficient evidence, and yet since I was raised religious, it it makes whatever I hear about religion make some sense at first, even if giving it a nanosecond more of thought, it makes no sense whatsoever. Sorry for the little siderant. Finally, I'm almost positive I have a form of Cyclic disorder, which in itself is a minor form of Bipolar disorder. Exactly, I have days where Im generally happy and content. I find it easier to talk with people, and think I look good in the mirror. Other days, for no apparent reason, I start to feel more depressed and get really anxious for no reason. Normally, it's not a big issue, as I can still have happy moments on down days, and sad moments on good days, though there are rare days where I'm driving, and out of nowhere I get so anxious, I feel like I'm about to breakdown and cry. There is also a counterbalance of moments of pure euphoria over simple thought experiment. I guess I'm just worried about if my condition is getting worse. One thing I'm slightly worried about is if I wasn't originally predisposed to have this, but somehow, after subconsciously wanting more attention, I began to develop these types of mental issues just to get more attention. I'm also somewhat concerned with how for a few months I'll be really into something like minecraft, but then I start to lose drive I once had and just drop it and then proceed to avoid it like the plague for the next few months. Honestly, with how much is in this, I'm going to have subsets of stuff I want advice on in the TLDR version.

5. This is the last issue on my mind, being school. Specifically, after D read an essay I wrote back in 9th grade that was on a topic I enjoyed, he began to be incredibly hard on me in school because of how well the essay was written. Now, I was the type of kid who didn't try that hard in school and still got As and Bs, but the pressure and suddenly being put into honors and AP classes did change how things went. Coupled with what gave me those negative feelings about my mom and sister, you can guess how that turned out. M convinced me that D wanted me to immediately go from highschool to college, so I began applying to college as soon as I could. I got accepted to a few with my 3.01 GPA. One was a specialized school down in Florida. I applied there when I was interested in studying cyber security, but as the summer went on, I realized that I might be more interested in psychology, so I decided to go to a school called George Mason instead. Long story short, that school was SHIT. I know it was, because I visited some other schools the following spring, and the students there had nothing but praises to sing about their professors. George Mason's Professor's taught the same way they teach in gradeschool classrooms. I did okay in my psychology class, but every other class I floundered in. I will admit one of the classes, being geography, I had confused with geology when choosing classes. The problem is that I loved geology back in grade school, and could grasp the science rather easily, whereas geography was a nightmare. I've always had issues remembering names, so remembering all the names of different places on maps (yes, that's ALL the class was) was nightmarish to me. In the end, I ended up dropping out of that school by the end of the spring semester, and arranged to stay with D to help build up my self confidence. I'm applying to a school that I've researched heavily this time, but I'm worried about 1.0 gpa I earned in George Mason fucking me over. I'm going to let them know about a ton of shit that was going on that year, along with my writing skill to see if that'll help them notice that most of the issues were with the school, but I'm still worried sick.

6. I finally followed through with my plan to leave NC, though sadly had to leave S behind because of school. I drove across the USA, seeing some amazing sights along the way. Exactly two weeks later, I made it to my destination, being my aunt's house in Oregon. She agreed to let me stay with her months before I first head out, and so far it's been alright. I mainly left because the constant state of the family was so dysfunctional, and stressing me out so much, that I was already loosing hair at 19. I was also never really getting a chance to make friends with anyone I met in NC, as our mindsets varied too much. I'm trying to get a job out here, and also have joined a number of groups on Meetup.com. I've already gone to a few events, and have enjoyed myself. This request for advice is more neutral than the rest of this post. Have any advice on what kind of group I should join? Also, if you want to give your insight on if you think this journey was a good idea or not, I'm willing to hear it.

*1 My family and I believe I have have a minor form of Asperger's, which is a form of ASD (autism spectrum disorder), which leads to me needing visual cues to understand things like sarcasm, and it also leads to me not being easily able to lie, which in the case of the weed, lead to me telling the cops everything about it. I did get off with a warning due to the small amount I had, and never bought any for the remaining 2 months.

*2 For most of my life, I didn't care about how things looked, so I didn't care about art. Then, once I turned 15, I began to notice that I was interested in the arts, but was somewhat satisfied with what I was making in games like minecraft. However, after a wakeup call from my french teacher in 11th grade, I bought a sketch book that summer and began to practice on my own. I think a part of the reason why I can't get myself to draw as easily is that I'm still a novice, and my perfectionist side hates that I can't draw exactly what I want.

1. In short, what advice can you give me in relation to my relationship with my dad?

2. I've gotten to the point where a hug from my mom no longer feels warm and inviting due to all of this. I'm not sure what to ask, but would still like any advice.

3. My sister has been an overpowering presence in my life. Ever since the psyche ward, she's improved, but I still see signs of who she used to be.

4a. Any advice on how to motivate myself to actually draw so I can practice and improve? So far I've tried a 30 day drawing challenge, which I completed but left me feeling burnt out for a long while later. I also tried setting an alarm to remind me to, but every time that I ignored, later that night I would add another with a self hate message written on it. It got to the point to where, for one hour every day, my phone would buzz every 5 minutes with a message filled with how much I hate myself for not drawing.

4b. Any advice on how to make new friends?

4c. Should I be more concerned than I am with my cyclic disorder?

4d. Is it abnormal for me to constantly bounce between different things like minecraft, splatoon 2, smash ultimate, etc?

5. Anything you can give based on the school stuff in 5 would be greatly appreciated.

6. Was it a good idea for me to think about myself for once and leave my family to deal with its own issues while I try to grow my social circle into one that's more healthy? And any advice on what kind of meetup groups would be appreciated as well.

Thanks to anyone who read this. And sorry for the rant style of writing. This stuff has been boiling in my mind for a while now, and I also wrote this from 12am to 3:30 am, when I usually go to bed at 11pm. So again, sorry for the scatter brained way of writing.",27May2019,2

315,"Ive posted about my problem on this sub before i think, but a short recap (might not be that short):

My father sent me abroad to study and said he'll pay for everything and that i shouldnt worry about it at all. Infact he didnt want me to work, and that i just should focus on my studies. Sounds pretty good to me. Im not the type of guy to waste and let my dad's money go to waste. So the first 3 semesters of engineering school, i passed every single exam and im doing pretty well and on course to finish in 3 more semesters. That is until two months ago, when i knew something was wrong. Usually my dad sends me the full amount for the entire semester, but this time he sent me money for one month, i thought, no problem he must be short on cash atm. Just in case, i asked him if there was anything wrong he should tell, so that i could start working towards a solution (finding a job, figuring out expenses and stuff). He told me no dont worry, everything's fine. Well, my dad has a history of losing a shit ton of money that to this day he hasnt told us how or where that money is. So i started looking for a job just in case. Next month comes around he sends me half the amount i need for the month and he told me he'll send the rest after one week. Well, shit has hit the fan apparently but he didnt fucking tell me. Im furious, but i tell him alright no problem ill wait. Next week comes he doesnt send anything, so i tell him again, ""dad im starting to take money from my friends, i kinda need that money right now"" to which he replied, ill send it and talk to you tomorrow. 

Well, alas that was two weeks ago and i havent heard from him since. Father's day is coming up, so im starting to feel a bit guilty about it. I havent spoken to him either since two weeks (longest we havent spoken with each other was 2-3 days max). Im currently in a fucked situation that im desperately trying to fix, if you can see my previous posts. But am i being unfair or an asshole by not messaging him?",27May2019,4
316,"So this was a little while ago, but one of my friends was raped  

I wasn't actually told from her, one of her better friends told me about this. I fell really bad about knowing this without her consent  because it is such a personal thing that I don't know if I should speak up and tell her I know about what happened or if I should just continue like I don't know what happened. 

The problem is, this friend is kind of known for lying to get attention. I do not want to say that she is lying about this, but I can't be for sure. Does it make me a bad friend for thinking she is lying? An example of one of her previous lies is self harming herself because of her stress levels.

318,"Ill keep it short since I dont want to give too much info. I was good friends with this girl in highschool and had a big crush on her. She askes me once if I had a crush on her and my idiot ass just giggled for a second, to very shortly after be saved by the teacher asking for a response on a question. This was 6 years ago.

My friends and I went to get a few drinks, and to my surprise the girl is our waitress. She asks me how I’ve been etc, small talk. When the second round of drinks came, I asked her if she is new here/she has worked here a long time already? She mentions how long and asks if I would be working her during summer break. I said Maybe since I will be busy with school.

Now we are 2 days later and I cant stop thinking about her and her question about coming to work with her.

The thing is; I have a girlfriend and feel very guilty for just THINKING about the highschool crush.

319,"My (16F) boyfriend (16M) have been dating for almost half a year now. Amazing guy, met my parents a couple of times and both of my parents like him. They've allowed me to go on dates with him as our deal was always that once I was 16, I would be allowed to go on dates without being chaperoned in public settings (movies, walks, beach, etc). 

This week there's a no school day for most schools in my country. I'm going to be home alone and I want to have him over because I haven't seen him much recently and I want to take this opportunity to hang out with him outside of school, but I don't want to be in public because that gets difficult and boring quick because there isn't anything for us to do in the town he lives in or the town I live in (in my country towns are really close to each other, he's about a fifteen minute drive from my house). I don't know how to approach this with my parents (probably going to ask my mum because she's more lenient of the two) and I don't want to have him come over without them knowing because of the risks that poses, but at the same time I'm really worried that they'll say no without listening to me.

I get that their concerns are legitimate about having their sixteen year old daughter home alone with a boy they don't know that well. My argument is that at this point, this is a life skill I need to learn. I say life skill as I have never been in the situation where I've been with friends or partners without parental supervision and the thought makes me anxious, as I have anxiety, and to me, 16 feels like too old of an age to be feeling like this and to not have been in that situation. This would also be a good chance for me to prove to my parents that I'm able to be on my own with people without their supervision, I feel. I just don't know how to ask them to give me this chance.",27May2019,1
320,"I (22M) have got to know a girl (22) a few weeks ago. She joined our clique and started to hang out with us (knew one of my friends before). We had some bonding experiences such as smoking weed in the park, watching movies at my friends house, drinking beer and some amazing talks about all sorts of stuff, spoken out freely, sharing one mind confidently/with no hesitation. Part of it was in the group, part of it was alone with her. A date never happened tho. Pretty soon I realized that I have feelings towards that girl.

One night I dreamt I was with her. We were naked and she would jerk me off (sounds funny but wait for the symbolic meaning). I kept looking into her eyes and told her I don't just desire her body. I don't just want to fuck her, I want to love her.
Then I woke up and cried like I have not cried for a long time. All the intimacy simply smoke and mirrors and I was laying alone in my bed.

It hurts to be with her ever since. I'm always feeling like hugging and kissing her. Comforting her. Pleasuring her. Sometimes I can see she likes me too. Sometimes I find myself in the friendzone. Sometimes I don't know what she feels towards me at all. 

A lot of the times I put myself under pressure: Be attractive, be strong, be what she wants. Then I tend too loose authenticity. 

Background information: I moved to a new city 8 months ago to study psychology. Built up a new social circle that dramatically failed because I told a girl in that group that I liked her but in a bad typical-me way: Full self-disclosing, honest, strategically unsmart, not hiding my ugly sides. She said she never wants to talk to me again. I isolated myself, got depressed (which was just the climax of the dysthymia that I have since 16yo) and lost the whole circle because she told another guy about it who adviced me too keep distance - gosh I sound like a dangerous psychopath. Telling you this because it explains my strong fear of being rejected.

Simultaneously I made a real good friend who then grew together with me and a few other people to a new circle. 

Today me and my really good friend and the girl I know for approximately one month that I'm into watched a movie. Her bodylanguage and how she chatted with us told me my relationship with her has changed. She communicated more often with him than with me. Simply because he is easier to talk to. He has less feelings in the way of viewing her as a friend. He is not constantly thinking about his appearance and how to appeal to her. She must've noticed I like her and is now trying to avoid a path that involves hard feelings and therefore difficulties.

Then again as a psychology student I learned that depressed people interpretate ongoings so that they fit their negative expectations. Is she really cutting me off? Is it my fear taking over? Have I lost the symbiotic interaction with her that we had in some moments? Or isn't it even clear yet if she wants to with be?

Right now I just want to care for myself. Stop seeing her. To be less dependent. To stop wanting her. Till the light that is the love I have for her is out. 
At the same time my depression often gets stronger when I stop seeing my people, who she is part of. What do I do?

325,"So, I’m a sophomore and I live with my mom and my older sister. I’ve been dealing with depression for 4 years now but lately it’s been really bad, to the point when I couldn’t leave my house for 2 months alone. 

So I haven’t talked to my best friend for months and in a single week my mother and sister + two of my closest friends told me they’re tired of my constant shit. This led me into deciding that I need to get better for myself and I need to learn how to be health while being alone in order to be able to have normal relationships with people around me. 

I am ready to work my way out of this mess and become a girl who’s able to function properly on her own, but how can I do that when there’s always someone around me, hitching my progress. 

let’s take today, I got irritated by a simple thing and refused to eat lunch with my grandma - but it’s a normal occurrence for me - I know I just have to lie down, cry about it for a while and I’ll be ok in maybe 30 minutes. I want to be better but my grandma can’t take it and she came into my room crying, begging for me to stand up and come out, because my irritation hurt her. I would have done that on my own in a while but her actions made me fall back into the mess even more and in the end I couldn’t get out of my bed for hours. I ofter hyperventilate after simple conflicts with my mom and sis. When I was finally ready to get out and eat, I just couldn’t because I knew grandma was waiting in the kitchen and just the thought of discussing this with her was killing me.

That’s how I can’t get better because of people living with me. I know they want the best for me but they don’t understand how much they’re pulling me back.

I’ve never wanted to leave my house like this in my life. Even though I love my family to death I’m suffocated by my own house, because I just need some time without human interaction so I can get back up on my feet. 

But I will never be able to move out, my sister will go marry soon and since my mom is divorced and hates solitude I won’t be able to leave her alone. I don’t have money to rent a house while my sister still lives with us. I know my mom will be terribly hurt if I leave her alone and I hate that my older sisters can move out so easily just because they know I will still be with mom. She’s very dependent on my and babies me a lot. Even when she goes out of town, she sends her sister or grandma to stay with me so I’m not alone at night. 

I hate it, I hate that I don’t have the freedom to live, not like I want to, but like I need to live in order to function or at least get back on my feet.

330,"Hello redditors!

I'm an 18yo male and need some advice with my friendships.

&amp;#x200B;

First some history:

I always had good friends during my life who I had a lot of fun with and such. However, I was always unable to stay in contact with them after I changed schools. Since the last change (5 years ago, when I was 14, changed from high school to a higher form of education, I don't know the proper terms in englisch, sorry. It has multiple departments and I am in the IT-department) I was unable to develop meaningful friendships. During class I always enjoyed the contact to a few specific people and in general I got along with everybody. But there was next to no contact outside of school (except for school related stuff). Eventually I drifted into a depression during the third year in this school. Nobody knew about it (my family still doesn't).

But I managed to recover on my own during the fourth year. During this schoolyear I came a bit closer to a girl in my class because we organized a football-tournament for our schools department together. Over time we shifted from talking about school stuff to also exchanging about private stuff. She was the first person after a few years who I would call a friend. Fast-forward to last september, the beginning of this (the final) schoolyear. I was a bit overexited and eventually asked her out, if she wanted to be my girlfirend. She said no, which hurt for a bit, but I was expecting a no, so it wasn't too bad, I guess. She now is my best friend and she considers me as a close friend as well. She is the person who I trust most and who knows the most about me (also the depression). During this school year I also became friends with three more people from school. I also started going out again and meeting up with my new friends. I thought that everything was fine, but I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I need help:

The core problem is that my friends already have established friendgroups, people who they know since birth more or less. Of course these people are more important to my friends than I am, that makes sence. However, it is still hard to cope with this. One of my biggest fears is being alone again as this would bring me back to my depression-phase from a psychological standpoint. One factor adding to this is that school is ending soon and as this is the last year I won't be seeing all these people 5 times per week. Theese two things combined are the reason why I am oversensitive when somebody doesn't message me back or goes out with someone else and things like that. One particular thing that I can't cope with is when my friends do something together without telling/inviting me. I know that this is bad and unfair for me to be mad at and I don't like this behaviour about myself but I just don't know what to do about it.

The reason why I'm asking for advice now is that in the last few days things were a bit bad again and I don't know how to deal with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to comment and share similar stories. I am thankful for all the advice I can get, however the following things are the most important to me:

\- How can I get comfortable with being alone again from time to time

\- How can I cope with the fact, that I am (for the most part) not the most important person to my friends

\- How can I accept my own flaws and make the best of them

331,"Hey, so title really. 

Recent realisations about my behaviour and how I treat the people I care about have led me to reach out for help. But I'm pretty scared to be honest. I guess I just need some advice on what actually happens when you go to therapy? 

What happens if I don't feel like talking? I often want to talk but only in certain circumstances when I feel good about myself, but I'm not sure if that will coincide with a 60 minute window with essentially a stranger?",27May2019,1
332,There's s girl I've seen almost everday in school.She's so hot and gorgeous.Problem is that I dont know her nor does she knows me.I dont wanna develop a platonic relationship.I just wanna get to know her but I dont know how to do that.We both take different classes and most of the time I see her is when she's with her friends.,27May2019,0
333,"As title suggests. I have been in a relationship with my current bf for almost two years. We live together. He is the most genuine, loving, and trustworthy man. I’m so lucky to have found him, and I hope to marry him one day. 

However, I keep having bad dreams that involve my ex. We dated our senior year of hs and off/on into our sophomore year of college. We had a corrosive and emotionally abusive relationship. My dreams have been excruciatingly vivid, so i even reached out to him at the insistence of my friend to see if maybe something life threatening was happening with him that the universe was trying to warn me about. We had a short text message conversation (during which he asked if i was still with my current bf.) What can I do to stop dreaming about him? I don’t want to see his face in my dreams anymore.",27May2019,1
334,"Let’s start with I’m went out last night and it wasn’t supposed to be a heavy one. However I did end up getting battered and currently in the hospital awaiting treatment. 

So while I was out last night apparently I let slip that one of my mates had cheated on his girlfriend to one of her friends and now I am being bombarded with messages asking what I said. But I have no idea what I fucking said, I can remember the night, but nothing about that. 

I just need someone to tell me if I’m right or wrong or if it’s just a mad situation - the reality is he shouldn’t cheat on his girlfriend, but I’m not judge, jury and executioner when it comes to telling people.",27May2019,4
335,"Hey guys, first time posting on here. I'm currently 19 years old, work at a reptile store. I like my job, it's chill, but for some reason, I'm not really fulfilled. Yea I'm still young but I feel like something's missing. I always wanted to be a Paleontologist, but knowing how competitive the job field is like most science based jobs, it's gonna be really difficult for me to go to a University because I come from a low income family. There's other careers I want to do also, like Acting (silly I know), studying Space (I really love talking about the Universe and wanting to find new discovery's). What I'm trying to say is that I have all these ideas, but I just can't seem to know what to do with them because of my financial situation and the fear of going to college because of debt n stuff. People tell me to work for a trade, but I'll feel miserable working something I don't love. I'd hate to work a minimum wage job my whole life. I just want to work in a field I truly love, but I just don't know how to get there if that makes sense. No matter how old or young I am, I just don't want to feel lost in life.

340,"I came into my room after a merry trip to the bathroom to find my mother checking the drawer I keep my wallet in.   
She claimed it was to search for a backpack but the drawer is no where near big enough to fit a backpack, she has stolen upwards of £50 from me before, and although I didn't tell her my wallet was in the drawer (obviously) we share a wall and she could probably hear the drawer open and close when I'm preparing to go out. This all leads me to believe she is attempting to steal from me again. 

I have no idea where to hide my money and it's making me reluctant to leave my room in case she starts going through my stuff. Any advice would be really appreciated!",27May2019,1

346,"We met when we were 14 and for all the time I knew him he told me he was 100% gay. I believed him and as a result he was the person I felt most comfortable with as I knew nothing romantic would ever happen between us. I would frequently go over to his for sleepovers and he'd always make us some drinks and I'd get really drunk as I'm a light weight. I never felt like I was in danger because (I thought) he was gay. However the past few days he'd try to kiss me and make out with me. He said it was just a friend thing and to not worry about it so I didn't. I never thought he would do anything serious. Around this time he also got into drugs and would try to get me to take some but I refused as my family have had bad experiences with drugs. He never pressured me into it but last night I went over to his and I completely blacked out after a few drinks. Now I would get drunk BUT I NEVER blacked out. Never. I should say that I was/am a virgin. I woke up in the morning and my ""down there"" area was killing me. I never felt pain like it. He was sitting beside the bed where I woke up and was really quiet. He just said the time and that I could go home if I wanted as I ""was really drunk"". I got my things and got out of there ASAP. At home I found blood in my underwear. My period was mot due for another 2 weeks and the blood was different. I just wiped off and went to sleep. I woke up a few hours ago and I dont know who to ask for help.

348,"My sister is behaving quite weirdly. She has recently been very stressed as shes in her final year of highschool. I think that for some reason, she has got it into her head that sleeping is not required? She sets alarms on for various times throughout the night. 10:00pm, 1:00am, 1:34am, 3:00am, 3:12am etc. Very sporadic and without any pattern. I wake up to a lot of these alarms but she doesn’t. Its honestly so hard to not get infuriated when someone wakes you up at 3:00am for no reason. I tell her to stop but she responds by saying I’m the selfish one? I don’t know what to do. I asked her why she’s doing this and she responds with: “I find it hard to wake up”. uuhhhh, ok, cause setting an alarm at 3:00am is going to help with waking up at 8:00am. our house is small and it’s impossible for me to not hear her damn alarms.

350,"I attained a masters in archaeology a few years ago and have been considering going back to school lately. My career has gone nowhere and my circumstances changed to where I am financially independent, so I feel like I can cut my losses now.

The ocean has always been a passion of mine and I have been considering retraining into marine biology, but it's such a different field from what I have studied that I will probably have to take a bunch of undergraduate courses to even qualify. 

I know they always say ""it's never too late to go back to school"" but ageism is a thing no matter how much we want to pretend, I have personally seen it in my archaeology studies where older students were often passed over.

352,"I have Facebook messages which prove this. He even sent me a Facebook message saying that I could take him to small claims court if he couldn’t pay me back when he borrowed the money. I have two bad checks totaling $3,000 which bounced because he didn’t have sufficient funds. AFAIK it’s illegal to write bad checks, right?

Anyway, he’s also a weed dealer and we’re not talking an ounce a week. He has been involved with a gang and sells 30-40 POUNDS a week. He uses this money to pay for his failing small business and pays his employees under the table (also illegal). He’s told me that he bought a gun after being robbed of some weed but I haven’t seen the gun so I’m not sure if he’s lying. He has not ever threatened me or even suggested it. And I know for a fact that he is broke because he had all his weed stolen and owes literally everyone in his life more than me.

Here’s my situation: I want him to pay the consequences of using me and taking me for granted. Also, $3,000 is a considerable amount of money for me.

Do I:

(a) Go to the cops with the bad checks and ask them to look into it?

(b) Report his drug dealing and illegal business practices to the police/IRS? I do NOT want to have to testify and do NOT want my name in public.

(c) small claims court with the canceled checks? I’m 100% sure I’d get a judgement no problem but I would still have a very hard time collecting against a zero worth individual/business.

355,"Alright so, this may sound overdramatic but I feel like something needs to get done.

To set some context I’m a 14 y/o, only girl, youngest child. My dad is *very* old fashion and overprotective. My mother isn’t so bad, but she used to sit me down and force me to watch CSI to scare me, I was like 7 and she explained what rape was and told me ‘that’s what’s gonna happen to you if you do %!’  And my older but not oldest brother , 15 y/o middle child. 


Alright so, I just need some help to figure what I can do and how to change this.

My dad is a helicopter parent, it’s bad and I don’t have any freedom, it feels like. First off, I don’t have any social media’s, twitter, instagram, Facebook, and such. He won’t let me, he’s scared I’ll get lured out. My 15 y/o brother has had these since he was 12-13. My father has never even acknowledged that my brother could get lured.

Not only that but I have a Battlenet, Xbox, Origin, and Steam under *his* email so he can ‘monitor’ me. He constantly asks who I’m playing with, who I’m talking to, he goes through my friends list often to see who I’m playing with, he has to ‘confirm’ if I can play with my friends, oh yeah and he has to know these friends, talk to their parents and themselves. 

He controls who I’m friends with, if he doesn’t like them, I’m not allowed to be friends with them. If I’m caught talking or playing with them, I get in trouble, how does he know if I’m talking to them? He goes through all, all of my messages I send, my contacts and even my pictures. He’ll even question me about things that I’ve texted them about. 

Oh yeah, and he goes through the router history to see what I’ve searched and such. Just to make sure I’m not doing anything bad. 

I also go to online school, but I’m not allowed on any of the field trips because ‘we can’t trust them’.

I have no social interaction other than my few friends and family. He orders for me at restaurants, if I start to order he’ll cut me off and do it himself, he always gets me what I want but it doesn’t matter. He also doesn’t believe in my *diagnosed* anxiety and depression. He has stopped me from getting therapy and I feel like a wreck. 

My few friends? I’ve only hung out with 1 of them 3 times, because we “shouldn’t waste money, you’ll probably stop talking”. We’ll call my friend L, L lives an hour away, and get this, we’ve know eachother for 3 years, and I’ve only seen him 3 times. 

He doesn’t do any of this for my brother, why me? He doesn’t understand why I’m so shy, or why I can’t make any friends. What can I do?",27May2019,1
356,"Hi all,

So I’ve been with my partner for a little over a year. He is 11 years older than me (30F) and (41M). I never thought too much of these things until a friend of mine said “Is everything okay with you guys, it’s strange you react to him in those ways”. It was said In instigation that if I don’t feel safe I need to let someone know.

1) I am terrified to be in the car with him driving. He has never been in an accident and doesn’t yell or honk his horn. The driving is just quite quick and precise and he makes decisions quite fast, it obviously gives me a fright, and it has gotten to a point the anxiety is so bad he has to keep telling me everything is okay in the car and he has to drive extra cautiously to calm me down or I gasp, shield myself, and start covering my eyes. I don’t do this with anyone else nor have I ever done before.

2) At night if I stay at his house I get severe anxiety before bed. To the point now I usually choose to sleep on the floor on the side of the bed furthest away from him (I hope that makes sense). Sometimes I try to sleep next to him in bed and I get to sleep after a while but most times I take my blankets and get on the floor where I fall asleep straight away.

He never yells at me, is never abusive towards me, has never raised a hand, spoken in a raised tone, belittled me. In fact, he is the most sensible, rational, and supportive person I have ever been with. I’m not insecure in our relationship and I’m overall happy. 

I’ve been abused before but that is in the past, I’ve dealt with it, lived with other men (partners and not), and never had any issues. Do you think my subconscious mind can see something that I’m not surfacing or connecting yet? Like a pattern from the abuse before is in his personality maybe? 

It doesn’t make sense for me to be afraid for no reason and I don’t get anxiety at all actually except for these two situations. 

Any insight is appreciated - thanks a bunch",27May2019,3
357,"Hey,   
I've never graduated from university nor do I have an education to speak off.   
I just dropped into sales after high school. Started of with telemarketing, later freelanced with online content and have gained enough experience for a decent job in digital marketing and online content.  


The job is alright. But I am concerned as the segment I work in is very heavily affected by regulations. I enjoy writing sure. However I don't see myself writing online content or in general working with marketing for the rest of my professional life.   


What I've found myself enjoying the most about the jobs I've had is to analyze competitors. In the past I've also worked with market research which involved calling people up and getting them to answer questions about various topics. I enjoy the feeling of investigating something and drawing conclusions and so on.   


I've always been drawn to professions such as being a private investigator or a lawyer. However I don't see these professions as something I would invest a lot of time and money studying for. I would like to work with something legal related regarding analyzing risk and fraud and so on.   


Simply put. An ideal work day for me would be to investigate an individuals activities online/financially. Get really deep and look for suspicious behaviour. My real dream is to scope somebody out from a car and taking pictures and so on.   


I feel stuck and I need to get some direction. I will not quit working so the most reasonable thing for me is to take courses on the side and eventually building up enough credits for some sort of degree. Perhaps to get some sort of certification.   


This is all over the place. If anybody has any ideas about a suitable profession for somebody like me and what I should study. Feel free to tell me.   


Feel free to direct me somewhere else as well.   


Thanks.",27May2019,1
358,"I don't know why, but I think I need to get this off my chest, and quickly. TLDR at the bottom, obviously.

 I'm a 20 yr old guy from India, currently studying engineering. I have always been good at math, so my parents decided that I should pursue this course. At first, I wanted to become one too, and I still feel like I can be a good engineer if I put my mind to it. I can code somewhat well too. 

The thing is, I don't want to. It's not the normal 'I don't want to because my parents forced me to'. It's that I want to do things on my own, maybe help out my father in his business, and later start my own business (he is a visa consultant). But my father is strictly against the idea. He wants me to get a job in my college placements and settle down. He has huge expectations from me. 

I have good communication and marketing skills from going on different ventures.

I can do either of the two. But I want to get out of my comfort zone and do something for myself, also making good money at the same time. We aren't particularly well-off so I get where my father's coming from. I can't decide what I should do?

What I have in mind: Complete the degree, join my father's business for experience and start my own business someday.

What my parents want: Complete the degree, get a high paying job, marry a girl of their choice (which, obviously, I'm not going to) and settle down. Produce a dozen grandkids probably. 

Also to note: I have ADHD so I can't work for long hours at a time. That's one of the reasons I want to go into business and not engineering.

TLDR:  20 yr old engineering student. Can't decide whether to continue engineering or get into business. Want to do business, but parents against it- want me to settle. Confused.",27May2019,3

363,"Backstory: I have a 2.5 year old dog that I got as a puppy. I got her in a previous relationship where my SO at the time also had a dog. Both dogs always slept in the bed with us and slept with no problems. I am no longer in that relationship so now she’s the only dog of the house.
We’ve each had a lot to adjust to in the last few months and it’s been difficult for me to transition into single mom dog mode. I know it sounds silly but it’s a lot of pressure to try to feel like you’re doing everything that your pooch needs and also adjust to a whole new life yourself--new house, new schedule/routine, new people, etc. Sometimes I just think it’s me that’s having the hard time and my dog is just picking up on my stress. 

OK so to the part where I need advice: My new SO is allergic to dog fur (bummer) and doesn’t allow my dog to sleep in his bed. Whenever I sleep at his house, my dog sleeps either in her crate or loose in the living room. Without fail at about 3-4am she starts crying incessantly until I come out and sleep on the couch with her or we give up and go home. Same thing happens at my house if we keep her out of the bedroom. We sometimes try to let her sleep in the bed with us at my house  but she WILL NOT leave my SO alone--constantly trying to stand on his chest, lick his face, pry his arms up to burrow next to him ALL NIGHT. Once my SO leaves and I go back to bed, my dog curls up like a perfect little angel next to me and falls asleep. 
**An important part to mention is that my SO suffers from insomnia so I think that my dog might just get a little confused as to why he’s just laying down awake and not playing with or feeding her
**I sleep just fine through the night and often only wake up if things are getting crazy, so it’s straining our relationship because I wake up well-rested and he wakes up exhausted, cranky, and upset with my dog (for good reason). 

Possible solutions I’ve tried:
Get another dog (not feasible right now)
Thunder Shirt (she just cried outside the door looking foolish in a thunder shirt) 
Taking her to doggy day camp to wear her out 
Taking her on multiple walks or a run on days I know he’s staying over

368,"I have recently returned from the military after 7 years, 4 of which were overseas. While I was away a lot of my childhood friends never really called or sent letters to check in. I always tried to call when I could, especially if I had heard they were going through hard times. Now that I have returned home for a year, I am realizing that they lack motivation and have succumbed to their vices. Most of them just sit around and pretend that they are living this amazing life, but deep down I know they used to have goals and dreams. I have attempted to inspire them, not only by example but also by sitting down and trying to figure out the steps they need to take to achieve their goals, but the worst part is that they don't even want to think about trying to put the work in. 

While these friends and I have countless memories of a fun childhood, days with them now seem unproductive. If we are all hanging out they just wait for someone to make plans for them, it usually ends with them very drunk or high and I feel like I have to play protector to make sure they aren't getting into trouble with thw law or someone bigger than them. I'm always looked to as backup because I'm easily the biggest and most experienced in fighting. 

So now I sit here with a decision to make. Do I keep trying to pull them along with me while I become more successful around a more productive and professional work environment, or do I simply stop contacting them until it withers away all together? I'm sure there is more info needed by you all to make a more accurate response so I will try to provide answers to questions.

I have been considering retraining into marine biology, but it's such a different field from what I have studied that I will probably have to take a bunch of undergraduate courses to even qualify. The only training I have that crosses over is my CMAS diving certification since I participated in underwater excavations.

I know they always say ""it's never too late to go back to school"" but ageism is a thing no matter how much we want to pretend, I have personally seen it in my archaeology studies where older students were often passed over and had fewer opportunities than younger ""fresher"" students.

So, I want to study again, I love the ocean and the more I think of it the more I'm convinced I should have studied this field in the first place, but I also don't want to waste any more time in school if I'm not going to be able to apply what I have studied in the real world (again).",27May2019,1
371,"I am dead broke right now and sold my iphone to get back on my feet.

I found a prepaid phone listed on craigslist that goes with my service provider. The phone was only $15 bucks. It's the type of phone that's sold in cvs or walmart. Often, when they are sold at those places, there will be something on the box that says the phones can't be activated until scanned at the register.

Is there any chance that this phone will work if I purchase it?

374,"I graduated high school 2 years ago and fully finished 1 first year of a 3 year degree at an ‘okay’ university. I had extremely good grades because it was content that was easy to learn from great teachers so after the year was up I obviously took my chance at transferring to my top choice university (top employability in my country) and by the grace of god himself, got in; despite achieving subpar results in my final year of high school (they usually only choose the best of the best from that exam). 

I thought I could handle this new exciting environment but now I’m just feeling lost, alone and stupid compared to the people around me who seem to not have any life outside of university or work obligations (known for rich international students where their parents pay their fees etc.). I feel the criteria to pass is raised significantly and I can’t get used to these standards even if I answer the question properly I get asked “why didn’t you integrate such and such content” that wasn’t asked in the first place. I know the bar is raised and I have to compete to do well but I just don’t know how much I can take of not feeling good enough or alien like in what is meant to be one of the best experiences.

375,"So, I've been dating this guy for 2, going on 3 years now. He's amazing. He's sweet and kind and honest. My family loves him, and he loves me, cares for me and puts up with a lot of my BS. 

And he's very...endowed...but here's the thing; he cant make me come. Like, he can't. 

Granted, he's the first (and so far *only*) guy I've been with, and we've been having penetrative sex for about a year now, but still nothing. I used to fake it but then I decided against it. And when he asks if I *did* come, and I say I didn't...its a bit awkward. 

He honestly tries, and even the fact that he can't get me to come (while all it takes for me to get him off is...not much) bothers him. I usually try not to worry about it, considering he's an incredible human being and that there's more to our relationship than sex (which is true), but I cant help but wonder; *do I really want to spend the rest of my life with someone who cant make me come?*

Yes, we are young, but he's ~~kinda~~ a lot serious. And I love him, heaven knows I do, but... I care about him so much and I hate seeing his disappointment when he finds out he's the only one who enjoyed sex, but at the same time, if I at least want to *try* and spend the rest of my life with this person, shouldn't I be honest? 

Is the problem with me? Should I just accept how good I got it and how lucky I am to have him and call it a day? Or should I not sacrifice a lifetime worth of orgasms?

377,"I am a bad person.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 now and I've fucked every opportunity I've had. I ruined my studies, I lost my friends and most importantly I've hurt my family. After being a total wreck during my youth (beetween my fifteens and my eighteens, getting drunk and smoking weed and doing stupid shit) I went to study but I couldn't cope with university and I basically threw away two years of my life and a lot of money from family in to the garbage then after that I spent two years doing nothing more than being pitiful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Almost a year ago I got a job I started studying and I when I got the chance I moved on my own so I could release some of the guilt I felt for being such a burden to my mom over the last four years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to be better now but my past haunts me... I don't care about how I've hurt myself, I care about how I hurt other people and that makes me want to kill myself specially after I realised that when I was 16 or 17 while I was drunk I groped a girl sitting on top of me. I feel disgusted by the fact I didn't realised what I had done sooner this only came to my mind years after the fact.  A couple months later I realised this I added her on fb to see if she would add me back and she did. Several times I wanted to apologise but I couldn't because I'm a coward.

I need help. I don't know how to apologise to her and I don't know if I should she seems to be doing fine and it feels like regardless how I apologise it will feel disingenuous.

So just for a little background knowledge, my work has back up roles. If you're a back up, you cover people in that department if they are away or if it's super busy you help them. 

Ever since I got accepted for this role, the supervisor in the department has blamed me for A LOT. I will admit something are genuinely my fault and are incredibly minor but for the most part they aren't my fault. There is clear evidence that it was actually other people. I try to defend myself but she doesn't listen.

379,"When I was pregnant with my son, I never thought he would be my only one.  I was convinced we’d have at least one more.  But when he was 2, I got laid off and we decided that it would be better for me just to stay home with him and work from home as a freelancer.  When I was working outside of the home, my mom babysat and that was a complete nightmare. So I was happy to be out of that situation and home with my son.  Our income took a cut and we struggled, but we made it work.  Fast forward a couple of years to when I was about 36.  We were not ready for baby #2.  We were living in a small apartment in Los Angeles and I was wanting to move out of the city into a less expensive community with a good school district where we could eventually buy a home.  But our son was 4 going on 5, and I was getting pressure from all around to have #2.  So I went to my OBGYN to see if I was in shape to get pregnant.  I found out I wasn’t and had to deal with some medical issues that would have made getting pregnant with #2 25% harder.  To resolve this, all I had to do was get on birth control for a few months.  But I took this as a sign, went home and had a talk with my husband and we decided not to try.  

My husband grew up poor with horrible horrible parents.  He’s got a great job, a great kid, living in a nice community in Southern California, and we’re able to provide a good life for our son.  When we got married, my husband always told me he would only have kids as long as he can afford to give them a good life.  When we had that talk about not trying for our second, he told me that having a second would take away our first’s quality of life.  He said he was completely fine with just having our son.  And I thought I was too.  So we moved on.

We moved out of the city and into a great apartment in the foothills in a quiet community with great schools.  Our kid is active in sports, church, we see my extended family at least once a week and my kid has plenty of cousins his age that he gets to grow up with.  I still work from home and am able to volunteer at his school.  My husband and I make good money, but we live in Southern California and it’s super expensive.  Our 2 bedroom apartment is $1980.  My kid is in club soccer, which is $$$$.  We also have about $11,000 in credit card debt that we are working to pay off right now.  So we still struggle financially, just like everyone else we know here.  Our goal is to buy a house by next summer.  We are working to pay off our debt (have already paid off $8000 since last year) because next spring my husband will get his big LTI bonus and we will use that as a down payment.  So life is good.  Life is damn near perfect.  

I still have this gnawing at me for another baby.  And I know my husband does too.  I can see it.  I’m turning 39 this fall but I know I still have a little time left.  My kid is constantly asking for a sibling.  All our friends are having children.  I just...I dream of another baby.  I yearn for it.  But then I remember how hard it was, and how much sleep we lost, and how crazy my mom drove me.  Our life now is EASY, it’s comfy, we don’t have to worry about diaper blow-outs, and nap time.  We have goals, we want to travel. Having another baby might change all that at least for the time being.  And is that fair to our son?

Or is not giving him a sibling simply because we don’t want to struggle not fair? 

A family friend recently got pregnant and my husband and I were excited for them.  When we got home, the gnawing took over and I turned to my husband and said, ‘Do you want another one?’ And he smiled and said, ‘I don’t know’.  But the way he said it, I knew he wanted to say yes.

He loves babies.  So does my son.  

This time around, I could still work from home with the baby and wouldn’t have to deal with my crazy mother.  

I don’t know.

381,"So, my five year old LOVES video games. If given the choice he would play them all day. We aren't too sure what to do about it.  We've seen the research that says too much TV time and games can cause ADHD and we would hate for that too happen.

Our biggest complaints with him playing games: [1] He gets very upset when he can't figure something out. [2] He pitches a fit if we ask him to do a quick chore or anything else. [3] He wakes up early in the morning to start playing. He will play for HOURS if we let him.

Other than those complaints (which are big) it doesn't affect him. He is ahead of the kids in his class as far as his learning in school. He's very sociable with the kids in the neighborhood and loves to play outside with them when they can. The games he does play are problem-solving games that most kids his age wouldn't be able to play anyways. He is involved in basketball and soccer soon enough.

I grew up with a brother addicted to video games so I almost hate games in general besides the ones I play once in awhile.    

I've thought about getting him into computer coding, graphic design or something as he gets older so that he can merge it with his love for games.  I, myself, am a mechanical engineer so I want to push him in a stem related field but would ultimately be ok with him doing whatever he loves to do. I just want make sure it doesnt hurt him in other areas of his life. Should I embrace him in his love for games or should I try to limit as much as possible him playing?",27May2019,7

388,"Please read this before sacrificing me on the altar of horrible people. 

Some quick background: 

So I've been dating this guy for about eight months. 

I have depression, anxiety, and depersonalization. I was very upfront about that when we began dating. 

Anyway, I feel absolutely no connection with him. I don't want sex with him, and I avoid it at all costs. There is no mental connection. No emotional connection. We don't have similar interests. We don't do anything except food and movies. We don't even fucking talk. 

I tried to break up with him, in person, about six weeks ago. But, as I have mental issues, his responses changed my mind. He told me I was expecting too much. That common interests didn't make a good relationship. And when I said I was either asexual or demisexual (I told him this upfront as well) and that I didn't feel sexual at all he said it was just my mental health and something was wrong with me. Which could be true, but it also hugely discounts who I might be or what I am going through. 

I'm not sure he was doing it on purpose, but he made me doubt my own mind (gaslighting). On top of that, before I tried to break up with him, he often put down my dreams instead of being supportive. When I tried to explain that, he said I was being too idealistic and not realistic and he was just wanting to protect me because he cared. Which seems controlling and manipulative, possibly should I've if you ask me. 

But everything he says... maybe it is all true. I won't deny that. But instead of being helpful, it is causing more mental anguish and anxiety. I'm not happy. I feel nothing toward him except bad things. Doubt. Anxiety. And worse, since he has made me doubt my own mind (intentional or not) it has caused my depression to get worse, as well as the little bit of confidence and self esteem I'm fighting for. 

I'm not saying he is a bad guy. But my gut and mind says he is wrong for me. 

I know it needs to end. But I fear another face to face and he will draw on my doubts, my lack of stability to believe in myself, and convince me again not to break up with him. 

I can't go through that again. I have to trust myself. 

Because I am so worried that he will simply find a way to (knowingly or not knowingly) manipulate me into just staying with him again, I don't know what to do. Everyone says how horrible it is to be broken up with over text. And maybe he is right. Maybe he is doing nothing wrong. But MY perception and MY reality says it is toxic for me to stay. 

I don't want to be selfish... All I ever wanted in life was to help other people. But I can't help anyone else if I can't help myself. And having him as a constant presence, while I think he means well, is simply destroying me. 

Is it ever okay to break up with someone over text? Or do I have to do it in person knowing I may not be strong enough still and I chance getting myself stuck again in a relationship that is doing more harm than good for me? 

Thanks everyone for reading and giving advice. I'm so depressed and scared with what to do because I KNOW it is right to end it, but I'm not strong enough to fight any mental manipulation (real or perceived) right now. 

Thanks...",27May2019,10
389,"My husband and I just got married in October, but have been together for ten years. We are looking to buy our first house! He wants to buy his childhood home. It’s a nice enough house with about three acres of land. He is very attached to it. His dad grew up there as well. 

Cons: I don’t exactly love the house. It is sort of choppy, and I’m not sure it will be. If enough for our future family. I always imagined buying an older home with character. And with the price of the house, we won’t be able to afford hardly any improvements to it. It’s also a 35 minute drive to work, whereas now I only have an 8 minute drive. We rented it for five years before moving to our current apartment, and I never felt like it was ours. After moving out, my in-laws did add a second bathroom and updated some wiring, paint, etc. 

I would really like to make it work for my husband. But I’m concerned that it’s not going to feel like “our own.”  If we buy this house, it will more than likely be our forever home.

I do like her but it’s been a while for me when it comes to these kinds of things and it flew over my head. I believe the answer is to just tell her that I wasn’t noticing the signs that she may like me but looking at them now it’s so obvious that I feel like she won’t believe me. I’m going to just be forward and truthful but I’m wondering if there’s any advice that can help improve my chances of conveying this message that I might not see at first.,27May2019,8

393,"Woke up an hour ago. Again:

""How did you sleep?""
""I didn't.""

 Since I've known him (~4 years) he averages maybe 5 hours/night. Very, very rarely gets anything more than that. 3 nights out of the week he doesn't sleep at all. Works 8 AM to 8 PM every day.

I do whatever I can to help him sleep. I try to encourage good sleep hygiene. Even though I get home late from work I am always in bed before him. I give him massages to help relax, aromatherapy, melatonin, block out the light/turn off screens. I honor his every request.

Despite my best efforts nothing works.

 When he rises to go to work after a sleepless night, like he did this morning, he is absolutely terrible. I understand the stress. Really I do. I want more than anything to help him. I can only imagine how much pain he is in, physically and mentally. But I am also just so unhappy at this point.  Almost every day I am awoken by this frustrated display of aggression- and  even though I understand he is only angry at the lack of sleep (and maybe at himself)- the way he carries on really affects me and feels directed at me. 

I'm getting frustrated because I see how badly this is affecting his health and if he doesn't try to change it, this will probably kill him in the end.
 I'm  willing to do anything in my power to help him sleep. If cutting off my finger would magically cure him I'd do it. 

The reason I didnt post this to r/relationshipadvice is because my primary concern is not about the affect this has on us as a couple. I am really a lot more concerned for his immediate health. And he simply refuses to see a doctor for anything. Hasn't been to a physician in over ten years. 

He is genetically predisposed to insomnia but also has a variety of bad habits he refuses to change. He is basically a bundle of frayed nerves at this point, extremely hostile. I worry he is a danger to himself. 

How do I help him? What can I do?",27May2019,8
394,"I have been friends with this boy for about 2 years or so and its been pretty chill but now its getting too much.  He previously had a crush on me and apparently still does, even though he knows i'm a lesbian. He cracks crude jokes and constantly talks about having sex with me.

At an event, he completely separated from me and left early by like 5 hours for no reason while i spent about 2 hours waiting for him. I had to ask him where he was and the time he spent with me was boring and uncomfortable, he kept touching my neck around other people and trying to act like a couple.

Last week we agreed to smoke weed after the event (my first time, he smokes regularly) it was chill until we sat down and he said that I was fake and kept trying to prompt an argument or my secrets. I asked him to stop being intrusive but he didn't so I just stopped talking to him then. I forcefully had to ground myself while high because I started to feel unsafe around him. We had planned to go to his room but I was still feeling pretty paranoid so I just went straight to my hotel room and locked myself in. He proceeded to call me a cunt the next morning.

396,"I work for a small electrical company, roughly about 10 workers not including a few people in the office.  My problem is I'm young, and the past few months I have been going out of town every week. It isn't a bad gig, the pay is good, and it's 4 10's with a three day weekend.  More so, it was my choice to take the out of town shifts.

However with the summer months approaching, I'm finding myself enjoying it less and less because right now I feel I'm at a time in my life where I need to be out with my friends and enjoying my life and making fond memories rather than spending 4 days out of the week out of state working and then sitting in a hotel room the rest of the time.

I have a good relationship with my boss, but I feel like I'd be a dick for telling him I want to start working in town.  There's only two people, me and a journeyman, who are able and willing to go out of town, and although this journeyman used to brag about how hard he used to work out of town by himself doing ground up jobs, he's also been vocal about how much he appreciates me going with him to help him on these jobs.

Starting tomorrow I go out of town again for the week to start a ground up job (essentially digging and laying wire and pipes before the actual building gets put up).

Me and john are always together, in school and out of school but lately he really started targetting me always giving nasty and stupid comments about my style/hair/just everything he has been doing that since months ago and it's really fucking annoying me, it's like he really want to embarres me infront of people, like he is so jealous of me he wants to kill me for it. Lately my friends have been telling that they are growing tired of john because of his constant annoying behaviour, i have to say it isn't always that bad but it's definetly recurring. He's never been like that so it's big suprise to us all, but here is the thing. Lately i have spoken to a good friend of his, she told me that john has been calling her up at night saying he wants to end his own life that he doesnt have any friends that no-one wants him in his life, i've been hearing stuff that i would have never of taught. John always acts like this big happy tuff dude but deep down he's all broken it seems. I just dont know why because in those 6 years he has never ever told me anything about his own feelings while i clearly stated that he could say anything to me. It's like he puts this ""shield"" around him so he doesnt get hurt but he's only hurting others in the progress.

I spent most of my “school career” wishing I could graduate but now it’s almost the end of junior year and it’s really sinking in how close I am to graduating. I’m seeing these posts on Instagram about people from my graduating class going to prom with seniors (we don’t have junior prom) and it’s jarring. Yesterday, I was looking over my senior portraits that came in and went on the company’s website. The company has pages for the schools they work with and I scrolled through my school’s page and the “student life” photos they had for the years I’ve been in the school. Everyone has changed so much since freshmen year, physically and mentally.  Even in my case, it felt like only yesterday I was an awkward, shy freshmen with no true identity. I’ve grown so much since then and I know there’s still more changes to come but it’s kind of frightening.

On one hand, I want new experiences and more freedom but I’m also scared of growing up. I don’t want to leave this house that I’ve lived in for most of my life. I don’t want to move away from my family for college or work. I don’t want to drift apart from some of my closest friends. I guess I’m just used to this monotonous routine of waking up and going to school and hanging out with friends. 

Now it’s important to note that I’m generally not good with change. I skipped my middle school graduation but I remember crying that day because I wasn’t ready to leave behind middle school. I was completely glossing over the not so good memories and only focusing on the happy ones. Now I’m honestly glad I’m not in middle school anymore and I would never ever want to return to that point of my life. 

Nostalgia also plays a factor, I guess. 

Do you have any advice? Is it normal to feel this way? How do I overcome it and welcome senior year and everything onwards with an open heart?",27May2019,1
400,"Today me and two other boys suspended from my chemistry class for an indefinite time as we were being 'rude and disruptive'. When I tried to explain that my teacher never had any problems with me the principal kept cutting me off and talking over me. I tried to explain that my teacher never talked to me about my behaviour and that I didn't disrupt the class. The principal continued to ignore me and bend my words. Even when the other boys said that they didn't know what I did wrong he still ignored them. What really annoys me though, is that he began writing our suspension reports before we even had a chance to defend ourselves. He said that we were defiant as all the boys in the class were called into the office as one boy was being loud when a substitute was there and she just wrote down all of the boy's names. The principal kept accusing us of doing things we didn't do and he wouldn't let us explain ourselves. What do I do? Who do I complain to?",27May2019,1
401,"So I'm in my final year of a Bachelor of Sport and Exercise Science. I was planning on finishing my degree and either doing a masters in biomechanics and then doing a PhD and onto research and lecturing. I got offered the opportunity to do my honours in either biomechanics or motor control both subjects I topped the class and really enjoyed them.  Doing honours would save me a year from my plan.  I've been offered the position already and have been pre-approved for honours and leaning towards biomechanics. As there are a lot of scholarships for it and offer some quite high paying research projects.  

The Dean of my college gave me an amazing recommendation for honours. I kind of feel guilty about it cause it feels like I'm going to be found out that I'm not as smart as everyone thinks I am.  I've been promoted to manager at my current casual job and  feel the same way about it. 

I tried telling my best friend how I felt about it all cause I was really excited then just realised how scary everything is.  Like I was just so excited about how many opportunities it's opened up.  But then all I could think about is how they gonna figure out I dunno what I'm doing.  Like I really trust her and she is really mature but she doesn't understand what it's like. I get that she dropped out of school and become a hairdresser. I love her too bits but when she says everything will be fine it just makes me panic and then brings up how successful I am now and how much more successful I will be and then it makes me more scared.",27May2019,1

407,"Hello, and thank you in advance,

As my user name states, I have been looking for ""Karin"", my best friend and lover, for over 4 years.

This story is surreal, but please understand that it's true. All too very true. 

Karin is my everything. A part of me inseparable. Though she isn't here physically with me, and i have never seen her, and her voice is but a toneless echo in my head. 

I know what her soul looks like, red headed, amber eyed, porcelain white skinned, with lips so vivid, so ethereal, almost fading as they are a lovely ivorish red.

I said how her ""soul"" looks like, but her physical appearance is not determined. It might be exactly like her soul, or completely diffrent.

The only way to know wether or not she is Karin is through asking her about her existence : if she is depressed by the fact that she thinks she is replacable, that if she vanishes, no one would be truly affected, no one would really care, no one would remember her.

She is a part of me, and i am her complimentary part. We are whole only when we are together. 

I simply ask of you all to spread this message, in the hopes that i may find her one day.

Thank you again. And please, spread the message, she will understand if she reads it.",27May2019,0
408,"So my best friend and I work together. It's actually how we met.  This past Wednesday she skipped work but called in sick. OnThursday, she didn't show up and she didn't call anyone to inform that she would be out. We all sent text messages but they weren't marked as read until later in the afternoon.

Same day, we get in touch with her boyfriend who says she is in the ER with her, because of bad stomach pains.  Everyone accepted this, I still felt something was off.

Next day (Friday), I'm in surgery with one of my doctors and she sends me a text message saying that she tried to overdose, and she was going to be hospitalized for an undetermined amount of time.  She told me not to tell anyone.  From what I understand, her boyfriend and I are the only ones who know this.  I'm one of two people she authorized to visit her while she's in the hospital.

Obviously I'm having a hard time dealing with this, I know there really isn't much I can do at the moment.  BUT, I feel like this is something that, at least, the bosses at our workplace should know.  Should I tell them?  Should I say I know nothing?  I really don't know what to do here.

411,"So I want to try an lay the foundation so everyone understands where I’m coming from and to be honest I’ve never posted on reddit before but a friend told me to try it out and maybe get a legitimate answer because right now, my IRL community is not as forthcoming with answers. If I’m in the wrong place Please Let Me Know! Ok here goes. First of  all I’m a pretty average 25 y/o guy and everyone around me thinks I’m straight, whatever that means anymore. But I’ve slept with a lot of guys and done everything short of anal. All the men have been at least 20 or 30 years older than me and it’s just been short flingy things. I really like it and I like pleasing them, something inside me just fires up and it’s really amazing. But when each relationship ends I feel really sad like I lost something special. As time goes by I keep dating women and not really being as satisfied. In some ways it’s physical, having to be in charge all the time, it’s nice but then it fades, which isn’t something I’ve felt when I’m with other guys.  But mostly it’s emotional, I want someone that guides me and teaches me and wants me, and yeah I like it when that person takes control for an hour and reminds me that passion exists. Naturally this all leads to me spending anxious hours thinking about what I’m supposed to be doing with my life and who to do it with, which isn’t relevant here because My question needs more objectivity than that. Want I want to know is if maybe there is something I should be doing to try and answer these feelings and change, or whether this is just a state of mind that happens to many and just takes time to make decisions. Am I just lost inside of some sort of sex craze or is my body trying to say hey you need to re-evaluate what matters to you.

414,"like 10 seconds ago i had left my food for what would be 2 to 5 seconds and i saw my grandfather trying to put a cloth over it and stuff... the cloth was full of ants since last time they did that it sunk into the oats and we hadn't cleaned it, so i rapidly asked him ""PLEASE don't touch it, leave it like that""

So he sees me for what felt like a long pause and then bursts out in anger... screaming and stuff

Its not about him having a bad day and it isnt about bad relationships between him and i, he hates most neighbours because little stupid things they tried to do and he didnt agree with, and even people that might consider him a friend eventually get this mini-slip that causes him to burst once more

Its... Really frustrating to say the least that we have to be constantly giving him special treatment when it comes to   who's right and stuff... i've seen him ask me about his computer and if this or that is the right thing to do, and when i say its going to damage the computer he just shrugs it off angrily, then DAMAGES THE COMPUTER AND HAS TO REPAIR IT (NO JOKE AT ALL, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME... A.L.L THE TIME.)  
And he never accepts anything which also stresses me since him doing something and not completing it like filling water bottles and leaving them, which makes them overflow in the kitchen apparently is my grandmother's fault or worse, MY fault for idk... reasons? did he tell us to check it? no! didnt even know he was doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

And thats the top of the iceberg, lets not go into the constantly pulling out his weapon every 30 mins on the car... how he drives like mad-max... the fact that from what his three children have to say (one of which is obviously my mother) he was kind of abusive in the past... (may i add that every single one of them lives currently as far as possible from him?) this is not a healthy life, for none of us...  
I want to know if this is normal and HOW is it normal, or should i force something? like somebody to silently check his behaviour and give us more professional advice...

415,"Hello everybody! I need some input here.

I have been seeing a LICENSED massage therapist (there is a neat little certificate right in her office). She has her own private practice and charges competitive rates for what I consider the best massages I have ever recieved. I have been visiting her for about two years and at one point, was seeing her bi-weekly (I worked a very physically laborious job). She is from China and has had her own practice for about 5 years.

We started off very professional. As time has gone on, however, I have noticed the massages have become increasingly more sensual. We also talk very frequently, and talks to me a lot about her personal life; during our massages, sometimes she will keep going and going (I find it endearing!). Sometimes after the massage, we will talk for nearly an hour after the session, and it is often me that has to break away and leave. On top of all this, I have noticed her becoming more...modest with the draping.

About four sessions ago, I had gotten an erection on the table (not that this has never happened, it happens almost every time, but I decided to address it...). I apologized and she said ""oh, I'm okay with it if you are!"" And I told her I was. Every time since, I have noticed she has become less and less strict with the draping. This last time, however, the sheet slipped off...and she left it off. I also had noticed her grazing my genitals a few times, and also began breathing heavily during the massage. I can feel tension in the room. As I turned over, she puts the *very thin* sheet over me and begins massaging my leg. Her arm/fist hit my genitals SEVERAL times and it induced an extremely noticeable erection. There is no way she would NOT have noticed. It felt almost intentional.

Please, what is happening here? She is such a sweet lovely lady; very intelligent and talented at what she does. Is she expecting me to make a pass? Is she just trying to keep me coming back? Does she like me? Could she secretly be a sex worker? (Doubt it would take 2 years to come out of the woodwork...). I would like to keep seeing her but I am not sure what is happening. 

Any input is appreciated.",27May2019,13

419,"(I am f age 16, my ex is 14)

My ex of a year recently broke up with me last month. Might I add he broke up with me over email seeing I was grounded and didn’t have my phone at that time.It’s taken me some time to move on of course, I mean that was my longest relationship after all. I send him an email the night before (for some reason this past month after the breakup we ONLY communicate via email) just explaining when I have to go get what I think is a hearing? Or like another interview for my case? I don’t know, I was just explaining to him that I might be going to court and getting arrested (I was raped after the breakup, not by him, I’ll go into that another time) but in short, the state of Florida has a charge against me because the boy was younger and stuff, like I said I’ll get into that another time. 

Anyways ex boyfriend and I were really close. We were best friends and we were inseparable. He was one of the only few people that would talk to me after the break up, seeing all my friends decide to be friends with him instead of me, I know that stupid but that’s just my high school for you. I won’t even go in the to the bullying that those girls gave me, the things my ex said the things that he did and the way he manipulated me after a break up, I’m not sure how much I want to go into. But it became can’t stay and almost daily, that he would only message me for nudes. No it was like that a relationship but it was more... friendly I guess is the word. It was more casual and I was just like “oh hey baby you want to do this?” “Okay, yeah” that kind of stuff. But now he family talk to me when he wanted me to show him something. He would only text that, and if I asked him but anything else he would get upset. He would always talk about this other girl. No this other girl may not seem important now, but trust me she’s important. He would tell me things like “oh she used to be your friend, but she hate you “ or “she has a nicer body than you” things like that. I remember sitting there and him comparing it my breast to hers, Feeling so so so uncomfortable. So sick and uneasy. Because she would tell me about how she was cheated on her boyfriend for him. I said that’s not right. I would never fuck around with a guy that had a girlfriend. No way.

you might asked me, why did I keep going back? Why did I keep doing the things he asked to me even though he was manipulating me and he was hurting me? It made me feel validated. And made me feel beautiful. It made me feel like you still wanted me. It made me feel like he might take me back. But she was there the whole time. He even told me that, he was going to cheat on me with her and that’s why he broke up with me.  

Let me get back to that email I was talking about. We were talking and it would been weeks since we talked and I was like trying to catch up with him but he didn’t want to. And I said hey do you want to screw them? And we switch the chat over the Snapchat. And he asked me a bunch of stupid questions and I said yes to and then he screenshot of them and send them to this girl that I hate. Yeah. And he goes no, I might be getting a girlfriend today. Is it oh OK who? And I apologize for what i had said. And he said guess. And I said no. And he said guess. And I said no.  He says, oh she sent me so far we were dating remember? And I felt my heartbreak. This girl, that I had basically taken it as my own daughter, I brought her food I brought her clothes I took care of her. I even helped her get with my friend because she asked me to. And now she was cheating on him, nonetheless with my ex? That hurts so much. I don’t remember what I said to him. Maybe I acted out of anger. But he stopped snap chatting me and then he went back to email. I was talking with him like all nonchalant just trying to be nice. And she sent me a message. And she said something really mean and I told her how awful nasty I thought she was for doing that to me. I called her names I I absolutely hate to say. I said the meanest things. And we were just fighting. And then she told me something that really really really made me upset. She told me she took my exes phone and leaked my nudes all over the school. (I don’t go there anymore so how would I know) I went off on her. I threatened her I told her I was going to kill her and I flip his phone I said why would you let her do that why if you cared about me why would you let her do that and he goes I don’t know what you’re talking about I don’t know what you’re talking about I said bullshit. And then he wrote to me dog cab saying stop she’s just trying to piss you off. She did.

I decided that I hate her. But I don’t want anything to do with her I don’t want anything to do with her stupid relationship I don’t even wanna help her. I hated her. But so much and it hurts so much because no she wasn’t my best friend, but she she was so much that amazing person to b I hated her. But so much and it hurt so much because no she wasn’t my best friend, but she was such support for me when I needed something. When I can the school I didn’t know was picture day and I would like a mass she came to me and she switch shirts with me, fixed my hair and helped me look good for that picture. So yeah, and I have matching pictures in the yearbook.

Last night I posted something on my Snapchat and it was a thing about boys sending paragraphs and whatever. And I saw her story that she screenshot of mine and posted of hers. But my name on her phone is “I hate her “so I responded to the post and I said I hate you too. And she asked me she said are you OK do you need anything. Was confused and I asked her what she meant, because she told me she was having a breakdown and she opened up to me eventually about the abuse of her life. I told her to be careful about my ex, he doesn’t know much he doesn’t know well. I was his first everything. So I helped her and calm her down I took care of her. She’s said she’s right about him.

And now that leads me up to right now, Monday, May 27, 11 AM. We’re not fighting but we’re not talking. I apologize to her but I don’t know what to do. He promised me a second chance once I seek help, And I change because I have bad anxiety and I’m impulsive and all that stuff. But saying is… She is the same exact way. She’s just like me in all those ways, And might be even worse than me. Why would he do that to me why would he rub it in my face like that?

What do you guys have to say about this? Do you have any advice for me on what to do? Do you think I’m being overdramatic? 

You for taking your time to read my post it means a lot.",27May2019,1
420,"Last September, I was mugged while coming home from a coaching.
It was quite unexpected as the area I live in is usually known to be safe and lacking any people of this kind.
3 people rushed me and took my phone, watch and wallet. I was pretty confused for a few moments after this.

I've accepted the fact that this had happened and I don't have any issues with my mental health or anything. The thing is, I still can't get over losing my watch. My mother got me it for my birthday and got it for me for a pretty lavish price. I couldn't be bothered less about the phone as it was pretty old and I was going to replace it anyway. The wallet had about $10 in it so that doesn't concern me either. I just can't get over the losing the watch. My mother got me a replacement one but I really liked it and I don't know how to get over losing it. It was a somewhat ostentatious looking watch from fastrack. Is there any way I can get myself to accept this loss and let it go?

Legal actions are not exactly possible at this point as nearly 8 months have passed. My parents did not do anything as they didnt want me to be interrogated by the police and get into a longer issue.

Lastly, I want to clarify that its not the price of the watch that is bothering me. My family is decently wealthy and so I can probably get the same watch again without much issues. Its just losing that very watch that's an issue for me.",27May2019,6

426,"So my husband and I are friends with this couple. Both of them are nice smart reasonable people but it seems like the fact that their 3 year old weights over 50lb and continues to eat pizza donuts and ice cream on regular bases, doesn't bother them at all. 

I've spoken to the mother on the topic, without giving my opinion. She says that the doctor they go to says the baby is in good health so it doesn't matter that she is a little bigger, which seems odd to me. She also claims that on the BMI scale the child is within the normal range which just can not be true, she. According to every BMI scale for children that I've seen, she's not even overweight. The kid is obese. And it shows. But the family doesn't seem to make adjustments to her diet or encourage her to excercise or move around more. Obviously I don't know the whole picture, but I've only seen the kid eat pizza, doughnuts and chicken nuggets, drink milk, juice and soda (never water), and she sits and lays down more than I think a toddler should. 

Now I would never give my opinion on anybody's parenting style. That is none of my business. And if I'm being honest with myself, neither is the child's weight. But the fact that they appear to sincerely believe that there is no problem, really bothers me. And maybe an outside opinion would help them realise that there is definitely an issue to address. 

I would hate to ruin our friendship by bringing up this topic, but isn't being honest is a part of being a friend? And if I do tell them, what would be the best way to approach it?",27May2019,15

This is a major one that a great many people don’t understand hurts their rest and efficiency. Short-wavelength blue light assumes an essential job in your disposition, vitality level, and rest quality.

Toward the beginning of the day, daylight contains high centralizations of this blue light.

At the point when your eyes are presented to it straightforwardly, the blue light ends creation of the rest prompting hormone melatonin and makes you feel progressively alert.

Toward the evening, the sun’s beams lose their blue light, which enables your body to create melatonin and begin making you languid. By the night, your mind doesn’t anticipate any blue light presentation and is touchy to it.

The vast majority of our most loved night gadgets workstations, tablets, and cell phones-produce short-wavelength blue light brilliantly and directly in your face.

This introduction disables melatonin generation and meddles with your capacity to nod off just as with the Quality of your rest once you do fall asleep.

As we’ve all accomplished, a poor night’s rest has appalling impacts.

The Most Unexceptional thing you can do is to maintain a strategic distance from these gadgets after supper (TV is OK for the vast majority as long as they sit sufficiently far from the set).",27May2019,1
430,"To provide some backstory, my mom and dad never really had a good relationship, iirc he visited our house around twice before leaving and they always fought when he visited (he hurt me once). my mom died from childbirth (the child survived and is with her father who my mom met a few years after dad left...its a long story).

&amp;#x200B;

I was six when had to leave everyone that i knew at the time to live with to live with my grandma. Recently i realized how messed up it was. i felt so alone and helpless and i think it messed me up on a deep level. I still have to deal with the fallout of the childhood trauma even at eighteen (depression, anxiety, behavioral addiction, that kinda stuff). i quit school two years ago because i realized how messed up things were at the time and i couldn't cope and do my tasks at the same time without falling apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the bright side though, despite a rocky start with the new group of people that i had to live with, we now seem to be getting along quite well. and with all the spare time that i had to self-reflect and work on myself, i've managed to lessen the social anxiety and while depression is still kinda there but i can manage it more to some degree. i've also learned to be less intense (i was always insecure and on attack mode years ago). and i am hopefully coming back to school this year.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad was in contact with me for a bit. he didn't really talk that much but to be fair i didn't either since i didn't really know what to do with everything that i was feeling back then (heck idfk right now). i tried telling him about what happened to mom but i think he thought that i was joking . I was around twelve when i tried to tell him and again to be fair, one might not take that seriously coming from a child. i just checked while im writing this and he spoke to me a bit from 2012 to 2015. The messages gradually got less frequent until they stopped and that was pretty much the last that i've heard from him.  


  
Ok backstory done, so like...my dad's cousin messaged me and asked how mom was doing. im really not sure how much they know because my parents weren't born close to each other and i guess news could travel slowly. turns out she didn't know and that she was close with my mom back when i was really young. eventually she asked where my mom was buried and asked if i wanted them to visit.  i said that they could go but they shouldn't expect much from me since there really wasn't much to talk about (i felt bad for replying semi-rudely and i honestly regret not taking the time to prepare for the conversation).  and then she asked me again if i wanted to see my dad and that's when i stopped replying since i legit dont know.  


As much as i hate the guy for just leaving me, it would be nice for the both of us to get closure. but im not so sure if i could handle the whole thing emotionally. plus the uncertainty of what would happen afterwards scares me. could we have a good relationship or would i just get messed up again?  would relationships between our families get weird? like.......??????????????

438,"I decided to change stuff up in my life. Started methodically getting rid of everything I want to change. Which was basically almost everything.

So currently I have a lot of free time. Like, a lot. Have no job, no chores which must be done, no relationships and enough money in my bank to last a decade. All the freedom there can be and absolutely no responsibilities whatsoever. Honestly, I love getting rid of all the crap in my life, all the related anxieties, project deadlines, etc. 

My intention was to use all the free time doing anything I want, watching movies, playing games, doing some projects for myself, learn to cook, lose weight, fix sleep schedule etc. Maybe go visit Italy, Japan or something. Get a cat. Then after the summer to dive right back into my career, all rested, rejuvenated and healthier. 

And at first it went absolutely great. Until I ran out of things to do. Very fast so. To clarify- not the things I want to do, but the things I ""WANT"" to do- it's not that I can't find or think of anything to do, in fact I find fun doing basically anything, and I have tons of ideas. I can't actually force myself to go through that first phase of actually starting doing something. The phase which feels like doing an extremely boring chore for like 20 minutes and your mind constantly races to ""maybe there is something ELSE you could do?"". After I am doing anything for some time though, the activity hooks me in and I can do it the whole day. Sometimes forgetting to eat even. Then next day comes and it's all over again. I actually had the same problem in my job, after I switched to working from home full time. Maybe some kind of not wanting others to find you slacking in the morning was my ""push"" when I used to work from office, I don't know. Now when I think about it, it used to be the same problem in my university days too, back then only the threat of expulsion could force me to actually do stuff. But once I started doing stuff, oh boy! Like half a years worth of learning crammed into the very last week. How did I manage to finish my degree, I have no idea lol.

Does anyone have any kind of techniques of soldiering through that first stage? Because right now the only activities I can reliably do are those which force themselves on me- preparing food, eating and sleeping basically, and that's it. I can't even do two of those things that much anymore since I am on a diet. And during all the leftover free time my old pal anxiety, dressed up in it's existential dread attire comes to visit me.",27May2019,2
439,"I’m 17 weeks pregnant &amp; I don’t know what to do. I found out when I was 6 weeks on March 15th &amp; this is the first time I have ever been in this situation. I’m 19 years old &amp; Asian so if I was to keep the baby my family would literally kill themselves because they believe it brings “shame” on them &amp; I would have to move out but mentally I am not ready for a baby. I’m not ready for an abortion either so I’m basically stuck. I know I would feel guilty.

The only 2 options I have are to either have a termination or have the baby &amp; put it up for adoption. I feel really shitty about having an abortion &amp; I’ve even tried 2 times, I’ve been to the clinic but just ended up backing out because I just couldn’t do it, who am I to take a life?? I feel blessed to be pregnant but I just wish this situation was easier &amp; I was a bit older. My mum is aware &amp; I’m glad because I don’t know what I would do without her. She wants me to have a termination because she believes it’s the right thing to do. I’m not speaking to the baby’s father, he’s my ex boyfriend &amp; I’ve known him for a year, started off as friends but then ended up being more, we were together for about 4 months.

One side of me says, have a termination &amp; just forget about this whole situation, move on &amp; don’t bother with boys again &amp; don’t even have sex without contraception before marriage but at the same time I’m scared, God forbid what if the termination has complications &amp; I get infertile?? I also feel really bad for the baby because she’s gonna have to go through this pain &amp; she doesn’t deserve that.

The other side of me says, keep the baby &amp; put it up for adoption, give it to someone who can financially support it &amp; look after it. At least I wouldn’t be ending it’s life &amp; at least she will be alive &amp; looked after. I’m also worried about this option because I know II get emotionally attached to the baby going through this whole pregnancy &amp; I would have to move out &amp; be alone &amp; it would be hard to manage but I would do it for the baby because even though she’s not born yet, I already love her. A part of me would always wonder if she’s okay, what she’s doing, is she being treated right but I would be content knowing she is alive &amp; would do everything to make sure she gets brought up in a loving family. I would also love to meet her when she’s 18 &amp; tell her everything that’s happened &amp; why I did what I did.

I just don’t know what to do &amp; wish things were easier. I have a stand by appointment for a termination tomorrow &amp; inside my heart, I’m hoping that they don’t see me &amp; I don’t terminate this pregnancy.

465,"One of my best friends and I have a mutual friend that seems to be spiraling out. I’m closer to my bff than her but I really like her. We’ve hung out multiple times one on one and have had deep conversations over the last year. I’m the last 3-4months she has become more and more paranoid, anxious and is now into the edges of emotionally abusive towards my BFF. Everything that is wrong with her is his fault. If he doesn’t tell her everything including private information about others he was trusted with then it’s his fault she’s upset. He NEEDS to tell her because that’s how her brain works. When he doesn’t respond or say what she expects or needs then he doesn’t care. You get the gist. It culminated Saturday in her sending a message basically saying if something happens to me it’s not your fault and I love you. He responded immediately asking what does that mean. She purposely didn’t respond all night into the next day. When he talked to her about it she said it was a silly message and he only cared because of the message. 

She has a lot of emotional and mental pain to unpack. She and i have talked about our shit upbringings and how therapy is important. I’ve been on the search for a therapist unapologetically and I’m open about it. When she and I talk she says she wants to find someone and we talk about insurance, ways to find someone etc. We’ve spent hours at a time talking about it. But she refuses to try. 

She seems to be spiraling out and the worse she gets the more she puts her emotional and mental well-being on my BFF as his responsibility. To her if he would just say what she wants him to say everything would be perfect. He doesn’t know what to do and has told her multiple times he’s not equipped to handle this and she should meet with someone that is a professional. Now that the veiled suicide attempts and it won’t be your fault is starting I feel like I need to talk to her. He’s worried thinking it will make things worse and she’ll get angry. But I honestly can’t see it getting any better without talking about it.

Any suggestions on how to approach this?",27May2019,2
466,"My boyfriend today bought Garmin Drive 51 with FULL EU map from one of official distributors of my country physical store as Garmin website states. As he showed it to me, I saw that it has that distributor logo glued on actual GPS device, USB cable was missing and it came with SD card (other websites and official ones state that there is no SD card added). My boyfriend told me, that he said that he added additional maps, so there would be more spots of interest &amp; etc. When booted, device was already set to our language (not English) and everything seemed ok, until I decided to connect it to PC and start Garmin Express. 

So I connected it to Garmin Express, registred product, saw that there is few unecessary updates (one small for software, 4 smalls for languages). We decided to install them and followed steps as shown in the program. There was no errors during installation, no errors during unpluging, but after restart ""Maps are corrupt and cannot be used"" error appeared. Of course, I thought I did something wrong, but what can go wrong when I haven't updated actuals maps and there was only few minor ~40mB updates. 

I tried googling this error and found only information about errors while installing actual map packages AND one post about possibility to receive this error if you have cracked maps. 


Tomorrow I'm going to call seller and ask him how to fix it (already googled how to fix it, factory reset and download of maps seems like the best choice, just want to hear seller opinion), BUT i'm concerned about SD card, additional sticker, error after installing minor updates, additional maps (map was called ""MyCountryName roads"") and I think that probably we don't have Lifetime FULL Eu maps, maybe smaller region maps and FULL EU maps was added by hand. 

As a background, I am Computer Science student so I have knowledge of operating different systems, so simple update for GPS shouldn't lead me to trouble. My boyfriend has a casual computer user knowledge and can operate basic stuff like rewriting Windows &amp; etc. 


Would like to get advice, your opinion and what should I do. I'm thinking of contacting Garmin in my country and asking about what should be in the box, how first time turning it on should look like and etc. But Im afraid, that if I try to contact official distributors, seller would decline my complaint and I would have no right to get it fixed/changed",27May2019,1

I know this sounds absolutely awful but the other night I went out with a group of my girls and we met with a few lads, me and Andrew we’ll say his name is started talking and having the crack as you do. The club started closing and none of us wanted the night to be over so we all came back to my house for a few drinks and chats. Before that, me and Andrew ended up in an alley way alone and some how started neckjng on. We both said we’d say nothing. When we got to mine Me and Andrew were lying on the couch with a blanket over us in the same room as the rest and things went a bit further, he started fingering me. None of the lads or girls knew what was happening and they still done. It came very late and everyone eventually left but Andrew.

468,"So I’m a really social, outgoing person. (18F btw) I love trying my best to make other people smile and I like making people feel comfortable being themselves around me. 

This results in me being goofy and raising the energy level just a bit so they can meet me halfway if you know what I mean.

It’s kinda hard to explain, think Mikaela Long x Emilia Clarke x a golden retriever x 10. I smile constantly, it’s just my neutral facial expression.

Long story short, my coworker just told me that he thinks I’m annoying and too bubbly and that no one at work likes me. He said that I don’t have a personality and being nice isn’t interesting. I don’t really seek anyone’s approval and I don’t mind being disliked but I honestly thought that my personality was fine ya know? I’ve never been self conscious about it before and tbh I’ve been kinda proud about it, especially after dealing with a pretty tough childhood. 

I think it has to do with my MASSIVE crush on this dude that makes me so self conscious and unsure of myself. Is it possible to be too bubbly? Should I tone it down a bit? I asked my best friend and she said that it can be a lot sometimes.

470,Hey everyone. I finished my first year of uni last month and am currently on break. Looking back on my first year I can say that I wasnt happy. Most of the people I met I didnt like. I came from a high school where studying was the main focus. At my uni people like to drink and party which is not for me. People were just different and I didnt make good friends with anyone. This ultimately led me to miss home alot. I felt like I was constantly counting down the days till I was back home again. I would love to switch to another university close to home. Problem is the programs that I can switch to are not as highly regarded as the one I'd be leaving. I just dont know what to do. I dont want to be miserable the next three years. But I also dont want to regret picking a lesser program and damaging my future.,27May2019,1

I met one older girl because she eavesdropped into my conversations and then laughed loudly at a joke she clearly heard me make then asked me to repeat it to her, then after I talked to her, her and her friend wait after class for me so she can pop out and say boo and smile at me and she got in my face to do so. Then she began laughing at dumb stuff I say to other people, butting into my conversations, responding to me or asking me to repeat stuff to her. She couldn't look me in the eyes and say hi first. At first, her friend girl 2 didn't talk to me and she just pushed me to the first one. While talking to me 1 would get red and make no eye contact, hide her face and didn't stand still. She blushed and smiled when I say hi first. Then her friend asked me to be around them and she was embarrassed and had an attitude but 1 wanted me as close as possible to her and talked to me as much as possible. She scared me after I talked to her and she got my attention. Then she had her friend come and get me for a selfie when she dressed up and wore something showing cleavage. 1 asked for a picture with me when I talked to her and for me to get close to her. She found any way she could to compliment me and approached me with her friend next to her. They both laughed at everything found any excuse to be around me and talk. 2 offered me a ride when it wasn't necessary. Theyd both give me no space smile and make eye contact. Laugh at dumb stuff I said. Theyd get in my face trying to talk to me then follow me around. Find any excuse to be around me and as close as possible. Compliment me a lot. Theyd talk in a tone with me or talk in a higher pitched voice.

476,"I'm 30 yo, male, and gay. I started hooking up with this guy(lets call him Stan) who is 28 yo and male. Stan is bisexual and is just starting to explore his gay side. He has said that he is not looking for anything and he is only interested in having ""fun"" (which in gay lingo means sex) with other guys. He's also stated that he wants to marry a girl one day and have kids. We've hooked up a few times and I've gone out with him to explore some gay scene things here in San Francisco. This past weekend we went to a gay club and I introduced him to my gay friends. My friends seemed to like him, and some of them were very flirtatious with him. I thought nothing of it since I was on MDMA, and so were they. In fact it was Stan's first time doing MDMA. One of my friends (lets call him John ) was massaging Stan and talking with him while we were at the club.

I ended up going home with Stan that night and sleeping over with him. He asked me if I would be offended if he hooked up with some of my friends. I said no, although that was a lie. He was wanting John's phone number and I dodged the question, not wanting to give it to him. Later on that night, with me present, he was browsing profiles on the dating app Grindr, and found John's profile. Stan messaged John and started flirting with him, with me right next to him. I watched as he basically flirted with my friend John on the app. He even sent over an emoji of a kiss emoji 😘 . Later on i stupidly invited him to have brunch with us. 

I want to tell my friend John to back off and to not entertain Stan, at least for now. If it were any other guy that Stan wanted to hook up with then I wouldn't care, but since it is my friend, I would feel awkward being around either of them if they got together.

478,"My bf (25 m) and I (21 F) broke up a 2nd time. I have mental health issues and they end up affecting/hurting him. We decided on taking 3 months apart before I start uni, so I can collect myself. We talk just about everyday, say I love you, are sexual and plan towards being together. We are technically broken up but don't act like it. He told me he was going to meet one of his old romantic partners and I broke down and told him how much it scared me but he reminded me we broken up. He messaged me this morning and said he was intimate and affectionate with her, then blocked me bc scared of my reaction.

I've been having severe anxiety and depression anticipating this and now it's happened I'm dying. Last time we broke up he slept with other girls right after being with me and it sent me into a huge down spiral. It's rational for him to be able to do whatever tf he wants. Emotionally it destroys me. It makes me not want to speak to him again bc I don't feel like i can trust him around people if we got back together.

The issue is he is absolutely perfect, I'm the one with the problems. I get angry, jealous and insecure easily most of the time over nothing. I have been abusive and have been working on changing all my behaviours and how I think about things. I am afraid of hurting him again later down the road if my mental illness flares up. 

He has done nothing wrong but I don't know if I am at a point of being emotionally stable to handle things like this. I really don't want to hurt him. I don't know if I should push past it and in 2 months agree to get back together or just move on and stay strong alone?",27May2019,1

Two years ago I began in a new school, as you do when turning 16 in my country. This meant I left the class I've been in for 10 years of my life. Most of the people in my class had been together in kindergarten as well, so we were all more or less like siblings. I guess there was some drama from time to time and of course I didn't like every single one of my classmates constantly for 10 years, but I really appreciate the time we spent together and now in retrospect I know that I loved them to bits. At the time I was ungrateful for the friends I had though and took them for granted, which is something I regret a lot. I simply didn't know how lucky I was to have such amazing friends.

I haven't met up with my friends since we parted ways, though I know they've met up with each other. I'm a very passive person who's bad at taking initiative. I find it hard to tell people how I feel, that I want to meet up and so on. I've tried a few times to ask if I could tag along on someone's walk with the dog, but they've always been out of town or already had plans. About a year ago my only other social circle died out, and I haven't really met them since. I used to have close online friends too but we've drifted apart. I feel lonely.

It takes me a long time to warm up to new people and even now, two years after beginning in my new school, I am not completely comfortable in my new class. Like I can start a conversation with everyone and I don't cry every week missing my old friends, but it's still hard. I'm in a small friend group of five, and though I like them I've never felt like we ""clicked"". We definitely don't have the same humour and I fake laugh every day to their jokes because I don't want to hurt them, which only results in them thinking we do have the same humour. This makes me feel like such a fraud and makes me lose my sense of identity. I also find it awkward and nearly impossible to hold small talk within the group, even now after two years together. It just doesn't work. I feel like I'm carrying the whole conversation and it doesn't feel natural. I enjoy deep discussions, but it's not something they seem interested in. Neither does it work to talk about random facts or show them a funny video or meme, we don't seem to share the same interests.

When I talk to other people in my class on the other hand, I feel like we click immediately and I enjoy talking to them a lot. I have tried really hard to get out of my comfort zone to talk to them and I've managed to socialise with them more, but I feel like the structure of the class (the groups) are too strong to break. I also don't like socialising after school as I need to spend a lot of time by myself to rest, so I don't often tag along when others are going somewhere. I wish I were a more open person, because then I would have noticed who I enjoy being with from the beginning, and they would have noticed me.

I've noticed I enjoy life less. Don't get me wrong, I love living and never want to die, it's more like I wonder every so often what I'm doing with my life, what there is to enjoy. I don't feel like I'm an interesting person, I catch myself wondering if people really want to be with me, what they see in me. Because in my own opinion I've changed so much these past two years that I don't know who I am. I'm more quiet, I don't speak what's on my mind in that uncensored way I used to, I overthink things and I don't remember the last time I laughed so much that I couldn't stop, which is something I used to do every day before. In only a year I will graduate and I'm scared all of this will happen all over again when I need to find new friends. I doubt I will still be in contact with my current ones.

In the past I had a clear picture of who I was, but now it's a blur. I believe a lot of your sense of identity is based on how you interact with others but I'm clearly not being honest with myself or others when I socialise with my new friend group. I know it might not sound like I'm having such a hard time but it honestly makes me cry a lot and I'm not feeling happy.

How can i find myself again, feel less lonely and enjoy life to the fullest? Any advice is appreciated. About anything you thought of while reading.

I'm looking for advice from people who might have had to navigate a similar situation that I am about to run into. One of my best friends growing up is now a recovered drug addict.

488,"Hello,

Long story short, I didn’t realise I shouldn’t be drinking on my new medication (stupid, I know) and got absolutely plastered when I went out in town with my coworkers, one of which was a member of senior management. 

I ended up throwing up on myself and having to go outside because I was too drunk, which I think I could recover myself from if this was all that had happened. However, the lady from senior management came outside with me and I started having an emotional meltdown. I revealed to her that my husband recently left, that my parents have cut me off, various aspects of trauma and abuse from my childhood AND the cherry on top, revealed that I don’t wear short sleeves at work due to my self harm scars on my arms (I often get asked why I’m wearing long sleeves/jumpers in hot weather at work). I can’t remember what exactly I said, but this lady was crying too by the end of it, and messaged me the next morning to say that I had said ‘some things’ and she was always there to talk. I replied that I was sorry for oversharing and that I know that’s not cool but thanked her for being nice about it. 

My question is, how on earth can I show my face at work after doing this? I am cringing so hard thinking about it, because I’ve done everything I can to separate my personal life and mental health from my work life and professional image and feel I’ve now sabotaged this by sharing SO MUCH. 

I am in therapy and am doing extremely well, my husband leaving knocked me back quite a bit which is why I was so fragile that day but I am generally quite mentally healthy these days. I also do not have a problem with alcohol, I have been dieting recently and also was taking some medication temporarily which I think both meant that my alcohol tolerance was significantly lower than it usually is. I have apologised to other coworkers who had to deal with my sick/help me outside. It’s purely just this embarrassment of revealing all of my personal information that I’m terrified of dealing with when returning to work.",27May2019,1
489,"Overview:

I graduated from school in 2018 with a degree in chemical engineering and minor in reliability and maintainability engineering. I got my first job working for a manufacturing consumer goods production company on OCT 1st of 2018. I was hired in as a manager apart of their reliability division. I got injured in Dec of 2018, and lost my job in Jan of 2019 due to the event. I've been looking for a job ever since. I've tried many temp agencies around here and they all tell me I'm overqualified for the positions they are looking for. I've applied to every position I can find online that can build my career experience, to no avail. I've been looking all over the country, as I'm open to relocation.

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to the injury:

I had no previous experience in the manufacturing environment, so they had me on a training plan that was self driven. They had a yellow hat program to distinguish new workers from old ones. They had 2 hours of mandatory training for managers, as opposed to technicians that received 2 weeks training. I was injured after coming back from break during scheduled downtime. On my way back to the machine I had locked out, the team leader and technician asked me to help them with what they were doing. I didn't cross the equipment plane boundary.  They asked me to use a crowbar to lift up on a drive shaft so that they could put bolts to hold it in place. Crowbar slips, chips one of my teeth, and ends up being  a record-able injury.  I was fired for a lock-out-tag-out violation (Involuntary Termination - lock-out-tag-out violation).

&amp;#x200B;

My Thoughts:

I'll be honest, I still have hurt feelings from the incident. I gave a presentation on safety absolutes, which dictate the difference between a knowing lock-out-tag-out violation and an unknowing one. Considering it was unknowing, it bothers me that I was fired.  I feel that I was fired due to it being a record-able injury. A lot of my previous colleagues feel that I was treated unfairly.

I had a lapse in judgement. I should have locked out the machine. I also should have not listened to others in how I should have helped, and taken personal responsibility for my own safety. 

I do understand that it is something that has to be taken seriously and can't be endorsed in those environments. I respect the decision even with those hurt feelings.

My problem is that it has been four months, I just had my first child in April and can't find another opportunity.

I've tried adding to my skills with six sigma and PLC. These have been courses that are available on LinkedIn not official examinations for certification.

&amp;#x200B;

I have one opportunity lined up for a full day of interviews on June 6th with a steel mill company. After that though, I'm not sure what else to do.

I've had two other face to face interviews, with neither turning out successful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any advice or feedback.

491,"At my regular café there's a barista who's really nice, I don't get to interact with my people so I appreciate he's always chatty and friendly. 

He's going to be leaving the job in a few weeks, since telling me he has a new job the conversation has stepped up a little bit - I finally asked him his name/told him mine, a bit of talk on how application for the new job is going, etc.

Note : I am not attracted to him, but I've not got many friends and he seems cool with similar interests to me so I'd like to be friends with him or at least stay in touch once he leaves. He's just a friendly guy so no reason for me to think he's interested in me, but being so friendly maybe he's also no interest in being friends either.

Anyway...

So he's quitting smoking and finding it difficult. I've a copy of Easyway (90% success rate, helped me quit) and I thought about giving it to him. Maybe ask him how he's getting on and if he says he's failed then casually give him the book to try.

Would that be weird?

493,"Was in a minor accident yesterday - No one other than myself was involved. 

I called the police cause I honestly had no idea if I was supposed to or not and didn't want any issues. There was city property damage (sign I hit), but I wasn't given a ticket. I was super apologetic - cause the damage was obviously my fault. After, when the officer was giving me the report number he also wrote down his name and number on the scrap paper and told me to call if I had any questions. The officer WAS NOT hitting on me.

I'm trying to figure out why the officer gave me his number and what I'm supposed to do with it. I'll eventually need a copy of the report for insurance purposes, but assumed I'd just call the non emergency police line.

It was night and the officer also waited (in his car, did not interact with me) until my tow truck came (technically I didn't need one, but there was some liquid coming from my car so I chose to get one - I'm nothing if not overly cautious) - should I thank him?",27May2019,0

I could list the things one by one but I keep feeling like I wouldn't be able to convey why they affect me the way they do, not without making huge convoluted post (the kind I sort of detest). In short, they humiliate and ridicule me, with clear knowledge of what they are doing is unfair, and get off on it. It makes them feel superior. 

And truly none of it is constructive criticism, they just start arguments and call me names and gang up on me as if just to relieve stress. The looks on their faces, they completely know what they are doing isn't good, they know what they are accusing me of isn't true and they love feeling I'm under their heels.

496,"I’ve lived with this girl for two years, and she isn’t the worst roommate—she’s not crazy, she doesn’t like conflict, etc. BUT. She doesn’t ever contribute anything (as in I’ve bought ALL shared items) and all the cleaning is always left to me. It has really worn on me. I hate coming home to a disgusting sink, dusty floors, and food debris everywhere and then having to clean up messes I didn’t make. 

She is staying in town for one more year and I also found a job in the city. We signed a lease in a new place with one additional roommate who gets their own living quarters. Me and my original roommate are set to share a bathroom, and I know I’m always going to have to clean it (along with everything else). I signed the lease originally because I thought why not? She’s not a bad person or anything. And she also really seemed insistent on living with me and I didn’t have the heart to say no. 

Now I’m having major regrets because I feel very much taken advantage of in the last two years and now. She doesn’t contribute ANYTHING and she’s extremely passive. If I say “please clean” shell MAYBE sweep the floors a week later. I’ve already signed this lease but with her and one additional roommate, I’m starting to freak out (especially because I’ll be starting a fairly stressful job next year).

502,"Hey, so I just talked to my mother about my internship. The due date to turn in a paper is tomorrow, and my mother is arguing against it. You see, I have this monthly pay from social security due to my autism, which is important to note that it hardly even affects me anymore. From joining this internship, supposedly, that number is supposed to drop hard. And knowing how money goes around in this household, she might have to work another job. She says she uses my money to only pay for the mortgage on the house and phone bills and all other things (which is all things I use, just to clarify). But on the other hand, I need those community service hours if I want to get into a college, especially now that I forgot about the options I had during my Senior year. My school year is almost up, and I'll be a Junior next year, which means colleges are going to look at my grades and overall dedication. I've got some big plans in the future, and frankly I don't mind eating cheap stuff as long as I can start stepping towards those plans. And frankly, this is more than just wages or colleges I'm concerned about. The biggest thing I want...

&amp;#x200B;

Is to have more freedom. My mom would *never* allow me outside without some sort of supervision. She'd let me out with my friends, but that took a metric ton of talking and compromise. Now, outside all on my own, just walking around with nothing but my phone and maybe a bit of cash? She'd go absolutely *apeshit.* And to her credit, I was an absolute bastard child in my younger years (which may be due to all the childhood trauma but that's something for another day), and I think every other week I'd run out of the house just to grab their attention. But I've grown since then. I've grown but I was treated the same since I was nine years old up until around half a year ago when I actually started doing stuff against my mother's wishes. Up until half a year ago, she'd pick my own clothes for me, made me do whatever sort of chores, this and that, and I never spoke up for any of it, because whenever I did, she'd usually shut it down with something like 'I am your mother' or 'It's for your own good!'. Fucking hell, I just turned 16 and she's still pinning me down to pop pimples for no apparent reason than for satisfaction. Before she'd tell me some lies on like how if she doesn't do it, it'll turn out like those 40 year old fossil blackheads you'd see on youtube at 3 AM in the morning even though you're clearly disgusted by it. Or something about how 'beauty hurts' or some shit like that, but now she isn't even hiding it. How long did she lie about that shit now, 3 years? 3 fucking years of begging my mother to stop, and even when I'm sweating and crying she'd keep going for another 10 minutes, pin my head against a light so bright that it'd burn my eyes just so she could get a clear view of my forehead? And then after those three years, I'm left with a partially numb face and an obsession over my own pimples as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I couldn't even hang out with my friends after fucking 4 PM just cause my mother wouldn't immediately be there to pick me up because of a nightly job she had. Hell I remember when I actually went with my friends for the first time, when I departed from my tournament. It was cold and windy. The lights were still leftover from Christmas, and the cars were passing by from my school. It was a beautiful night, one filled with calming lights from the posts and falling snowflakes from above. And as I walked, and looked back at my school, and around me, I realized how free I was at that moment. I could just go anywhere at that moment and explore for myself. I realized how much control my mother had in my life, and why this is all happening to me. Because she thinks she knows what's best for me, for myself. She thinks she's entitled to my own being just because she cared for me and made me. I know she loves me, and I know she's doing what she believes is best for me, but I'm pissed. I want to be my own self damn it, she never taught me how to do anything, I had to learn it all my god damn self. When I asked 'why couldn't I pop my own pimples myself', she just shrugs it off and says 'don't grow any pimples'. When I asked her why she kept on going after I said it hurt, and how I actually shed tears, she just started laughing. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Laughing.* She laughed whenever I complained about something, either that or she got defensive and brought up the 'I am your mother' excuse. She laughed when I cried, she laughed when I burned my feet at the beach, tearing out the pieces of grass in pain. Does she really love me? Does she really love me or does she just use me? No, of course she loves me,she started crying one time and hugged me. She takes my birthday seriously, a time to celebrate. In fact, that might be the problem. She cares too much. Or is she caring but just doesn't know how to care?

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck. Fucking hell. I'm sorry for typing all this out. This was supposed to be a post for advice, but I went on a rant instead. I'll sum it all up.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr: My mom says I shouldn't take the internship because it'll make my social security income drop. In addition, from what I know, my family is reliant on my social security and if I were to take it up, my mother might have to work two jobs again. But at the same time, I want to be my own person with my own cash that I can spend on my own things. What do I do?**",27May2019,8
503,"Hey guys, first off this is my first reddit post! I am a 21 year old male, I go to college full time (accounting) and I also work full time. I work in the environmental trucking industry, its crazy hours (usually 60 when not in school but has been over 100 hours at times) but the pay is great, I grossed $45,000 last year. Anyway, I pay for virtually everything and I have been my whole life, I pay my university tuition as I go so no debt, I own my truck, pay for insurance, gas, other bills and anything personal I want/ need. This is the way my dad raised me since he came over in his 30s from Albania and started a life for us through hard work. I love and respect my dad for everything he's done but the thing is he's so controlling. I have to lie to him that I am working to have any social life because he'd start complaining that I'm not helping around the house enough or that I'm selfish for doing things that don't benefit the family. I hate lying to him but I've been doing it for years and I'm sick of it. Side note, I have two older sisters ones 24, has masters in nursing and the others 22 and has her bachelors in nursing, both live at home and we all give him any extra money we make to help him with the bills. I gave him around 6,000 dollars or so last year and doesn't even acknowledged it. He said to me ""you made almost 45gs last year and kept it all for yourself"" when I told him I was gonna get new tires for my truck. I want to move out so badly, I know I can do it, I am a very responsible person and my best friend offered a room at his apartment where rent would be 650 a month. I want to be in control of my own life and be an adult and do things that I want to do but I know if I bring it up to my dad he'll try and shame me about how I'm just selfish and taking the easy way out and deserting the family etc. The issue with me moving out is I don't want to hurt my parents, my parents always tell me they love me and are proud of me but are also always criticizing me which makes it harder. I completely understand in his eyes he's doing what he thinks is right by his family which I respect but I also know if I do go through with moving out he'll never understand and will always look at me differently and just be so disappointed and it will strain my relationship with them and he'll be constantly shaming me because of how hurt he'd be bc he'd see it as me leaving the family in a time of need even though I'm only home on Sundays and the rest of the week I come home at midnight just to sleep. All I want is to be able to do normal things like spend the night with my amazing gf or just hangout with my friends for a weekend at the beach that I never get to do. I'm truly living a double life and it makes me so stressed all the time I feel like there's no escape. My other option is stay at home for another 2 years until my parents sell the house and retire back in Albania for half the year and my sisters and I go about our way. Moving out is such a dumb idea in his mind it doesn't help that my oldest sister loves living at home and has no plans of moving out and he is always comparing me and my other sister to her because shes the token child. Also, he wants to find me an arranged marriage with an Albanian girl when I don't want that and have even told him but he says ""listen to me, I know best"". How do you guys think I should approach this situation, what would you say to him if you were gonna move out.

504,"This girl and I have been together for a few months but have been close friends for two years. She has depression, low self worth, and undiagnosed BPD. I try to be patient with all of this as i love her very much.

Every few weeks she has a breakdown. Early on I used to try to help her constantly during the breakdown and it drained me  pretty bad to the point of me being distant with her. I have changed this and I try to be there with her when shes in a rough patch but I'm also trying to make sure I don't drain myself either.

She is constantly seeking validation for everything about her and this often leads into her questioning if I actually love her and am interested in her. I know this comes from her low self worth and everything but it really does suck always proving my love. She recognizes that she does this and she says she wants to get better with that but it happens near every other day.

Lately she has been more distant and I could tell something was bothering her. We are both done with high school as of a few days ago and we are both going into full time jobs for the foreseeable future. Naturually we are going to see eachother less frequently but I tell her we will find time to see eachother. This is really tearing into her and she told me her auto solution is to distance herself and try to lose her feelings for me. I really don't know what to make of this as she constantly tells me that she wants us to work out and be good.

We had a big argument last night and to end it I just said that I will try to make it work with her and that I want to be with her. I am now questioning if I just said that to end it rather then I actually meant it.

There's a lot more to this obviously and I don't know if I want to continue this when I feel like I have gotten nothing but being drained from being with her. This is my first relationship if you can't tell. I do love her and I do want things to work out but I don't know if they will and I don't know if its worth it.",27May2019,1

Anyways, my parents had decided that they would look after Y ( the boy) that way my grandmother only had to focus on the girl (X) who was now pregnant. Things were fine until the boy started touching me. I was 6, he was around the ages of 12-14 years old.

Several years later, I woke up laying on my stomach with my pants pulled down and my brother was sticking his dick between my cheeks, he never went in but I was shocked and the same thing happened. I woke up again with him groping my breast, and taking pictures. There would be time were I would be taking a shower and would see a camera flash under the door. Ince again, I felt stuck and couldn’t talk to my parents afraid that I would cause issues within the family. So I started avoiding my brother, I would put things in from of my door to block him or at least make noises so that I would wake up before he could do anything.

I previously asked him out on a date to which he said yes but unfortunately I had to cancel due to an emergency. When I asked him if he wanted to rearrange he said he wasn’t sure what he wanted at the moment and it didn’t seem like a good idea.
I gave him the cold shouldn’t and decided I should try and keep my distance but he continued to talk to me and got upset that I seemed distant.
Last week I saw him at a work event and spent the whole evening talking to him. I invited him back to mine and he agreed. There is some level of expectation there but when he came back to mine literally nothing happened. Not a kiss or anything. We shared a bed and cuddled but that was it.
I asked him the next day why he even came back and he said he just wasn’t sure what he wanted again.
His best friend said I should play it cold and he’ll come running back, I know someone who doesn’t know what they want is bad for me but I’ve become invested now.

511,"Hey guys. I just finished my undergrad degree and I am going for a masters. I got a job in my college town at a burger place, and its decent money for a part time job. I should make anywhere between 1700-2400, depending on how many hours i want. My masters degree is offering a 60% tuition scholarship which is 7k a year, leaving me with roughly 5k a year to cover. Im living with family so housing costs won't be a problem. I should also be getting loans, which would likely cover the 5k anyway. 

I haven't been on a proper vacation in a long time where i got to relax and recharge, and i really either want to go to Ireland again or the Pacific Northwest. I would go next summer or in 2 years after my masters is done. I also would like to apply for Irish citizenship as well, being that I'm eligible. ($3-400 depending on the exchange rate)

Its been suggested that i should pay off some current unsubsidized Federal loans i have as well, as im lucky enough to only have the Federal loans. (My mom is poor but that helped me get a lot of financial aid for undergrad. My dad has money but is an absolute scrooge. Theyre both bad people, thats not what this is about though.) 

However, the money im making is such a drop in the bucket. Ill have 40k in loans at the end of 6 years, 2k isnt really going to do much for me, but this would be the more ""responsible"" option.

I am 28 yo. I don't know how to pass over my situation with my mother. When I was 11, she ask me to leave. I went to my father place. Always hopping for a better relationship with her. We had a pattern. She accepted in the begin, after she start to be super selfish. If I said something she doesn't like, we stopped talking to me for 1 or 2 years ... 

I don't explain all the details, of course, it's super complicate and it's a lot of horrible little stories... It's breaking me every time she talk to me, I fill like she reopened a scar...

14 months ago, I toke a decision : Stopping this relationship.

I have a therapist. I don't think she really help me. We talk a lot about my culpability sentiment. I understand I was a kid and she was the mother and it's not my fault and blablabla.

516,"So I met my boyfriend overseas, and we only saw each other a few times in the winter and he’d always wear coats etc.. Before I met him he was maybe 20-30 kgs heavier, but when I met him he looked fine, but I almost always saw him wearing layers. We never had sex and I never got to see his body. Then I left and thought we’d just drift apart but here we are in a long distance relationship. 

We spent a year apart and he lost even more weight at that time. I saw him again and got to see his body. He had lost even more weight and I tried to convince him to go to the gym since he’s got saggy skin. I tried to say it nicely and I told him it’s because he’s getting a bit too skinny so I suggested the gym, as I was going to the gym to tone up at the time as well.

It’s been a year and a half since then, and now I’ve fallen in love with him deeply, but nothing has changed. He actually gained a bit of weight which has filled his man boobs out a bit more, which is even more of a turn off. I’ve told him that I actually would like him to try the gym (yes I’m a bitch sorry) and how it’s extremely important to me that we both put effort into our appearance.  He sent me a photo today and it was a complete turn off. I really don’t know what to do since he’s trying to go to the gym but he’ll go once every 2 weeks and then he keeps telling me how when we close the gap he’ll be more consistent. I don’t want to move back/want him to move here unless I’m 100% sure about the relationship. But giving him an ultimatum about his appearance is a shitty thing to do. 

And before anyone asks I do go to the gym and I take very good care of my appearance both for myself and for him. I’ll go out of my way to work on the body parts I know he’d want me to  (glutes) just for him. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Please don’t be too harsh. I would also rather not break up with him because I absolutely adore him otherwise, and if I could overlook this I 100% would... but I can’t.",27May2019,0

519,"It makes you bitter and full of hatred when you really internalize how fucking ugly you are.

On 13th of december in 2017, I got called ugly by a person who was angry at me. I have not been happy ever since. It was not the first time I've been mogged because of my face, but it was different. Previous times that had happened I was feeling low for a few days, but that one last time it happened it really broke my self confidence. It broke my reality. It happened over 500 days ago, but I'm still fucked because of it. I have not been happy ever since. I was 17 when that happened, I'm 18 at the moment.

Looks is the only thing that matters. It is truly soul crushing when you realize it.

The truth is that world is obsessed with appearance, not me. Just because I identify all the drawbacks of being a physically unattractive male, doesn't mean that I am obsessed with appearance. I would never be obsessed with my appearance if I wasn't bullied and rejected in high school for being ugly.

There is no fixing me anymore. I hate my face, and there is no way you could change your face. If you have shitty genetics, you're fucked.

I don't think there is anything left to do. What the fuck is this life worth if you're ugly. No matter how rich or famous you are, you can't change your face. Look at Jack Ma or Casey Neistat for an example. I don't see them winners in this life even though they are successful in what they are doing. So why would I even bother trying to do anything. Fuck this shitty little game.

Don't tell me about mewing. Don't tell me about self-improvement. Don't tell me that getting a gf would change anything. Don't tell me that looks don't matter. Don't give me any of that bullshit. That won't do anything for me.

520,"As a disclaimer I want to point out that I am in no way bitter towards women, other men who get women, or blaming anyone but myself for not improving in this regard. I am genuinely just curious to hear what advice some of you may have for me in improving. 

To give you guys some context, I am 20 year old male currently studying at a big state university. The party scene at my school is very ripe and many would say it is very easy to hook up with girls and have sex. I am a virgin, but I have had several hookups with girls throughout high school. I am asking for help on how to improve with women because I started to notice that more and more of my friends are seemingly getting into relationships and generally have an average sense of how to talk to women. Now, I am not completely socially inept in any way. I can hold a conversation with girls just fine, and many of my friends and acquaintances have told me that I have a good sense of humor and am funny. The thing I don’t understand is how to attract women. I just don’t understand how to act around a woman to basically compel them to spend time with me in an intimate environment, or attract them sexually for that matter. I feel as if there is almost an inherent element that makes women somewhat  attracted to men, whether it be their confidence, way of talking, and to a certain extent physical appearance. What are some of your experiences in improving in this regard and what can you suggest for me?",27May2019,3

523,"This is going to be controversial but I want to change. Over the last year and a half after a suicide attempt I decided to start aggressively fixing my life. I started working out 4-5 times a week, eating better, dressing better, practicing my social skills and using it to get better jobs and more friends. I went from being, in my area, a 4/10 to I would say a 6-7/10(judging by peoples reactions). I noticed a change in how girls acted around me. Heres where the issue comes in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because I was addicted to porn for so long, and because I am around college aged girls, and having nothing but bad experiences with women when I was a socially awkward nerd, it racks my brain to think about what else they can be good for besides sex. I try not to use them for that reason but occasionally I do and they literally don't seem to care. Pretty much most of the girls I've slept with I don't give a fuck about because they are boring and have zero life skills or redeemable qualities. It actually blows my mind how little they can actually do and how much in their life requires either an older person or another man to help them with. I haven't been with a girl who even knows how to heat up water or fold their own laundry. I'm 21 and can do more than every girl I've met so far. I feel like this might be because my confidence is still what it was a year and a half ago, I'm just in the body of someone who looks better. I tend to date down and feel more comfortable sleeping with someone who isn't at the same looks as me. I feel like if I act as flirty around a girl who is more attractive, she will get pissy and send some white knight orbiter to beat my ass, or at the very least fight me. I have no base for this at all, I just feel like it since guys like to protect attractive looking girls. I feel like I am pushy and disrespectful and in general degenerate. I am not living the life I want to live, I want to feel mutual love and happiness, I want a partner who I care about. I want to feel like the person next to me is human like me and sex isn't the only thing holding things together. I just don't think women can feel love, I've never seen it or been shown it because of my bad childhood and experiences. I assume thats wrong though, and would like to know it.",27May2019,2
524,"This was probably 4 years ago, and this conversation still bothers me a lot. 

A little background: When my mom was only 1, her parents got divorced. My mom grew up with a man that my grandma married not long after, we’ll call him R. Now, R wasn’t that great or a man. He was an alcoholic and was addicted to pain meds. He never abused my grandma like her previous husband had, but my mom has told me some rather creepy stories about R. She says he would try and watch her shower, and she’d just try to ignore that he was there or put a towel over the glass door of the shower so he couldn’t see in. My mom would occasionally argue with her mom about this, but I don’t think anything ever came of it. 

Anyways, I had overheard a conversation about 4 years ago between my mom and grandma. They were talking about R, and how my mom wanted my grandma to split from him because he had recently stolen pain meds from my mom and dad (they both had just had surgeries). My mom was crying (one of the only times I’ve heard her cry) and just ranted to her mother about all the things she kept secret about him from her. One of those things was about me, and how when I was still wearing diapers and a little after, whenever he’d change me I’d come back crying and grabbing at my private area. This kind of took me aback and I tried to just forget about it. The more I think about it, the more it just makes sense on how whenever I stayed the night with my grandma, R would insist on me sleeping in the guest room with him. (I also don’t know if this is related, but I have really bad trust issues when it comes to men).

525,"So prom is finally coming up. In about two weeks the highly anticipated event that everyone talks about and usually ends up disapointed with is here. I've never been too excited about the whole prom situation, but with it coming up, and everyone talking about it, it's hard not to think about.

Just about everyone I know now has a date to this prom. Couples, friends, everyone. I however, do not. And while facing rejection to prom by the girl you like is rough enough, I'm also left with nobody to go with.  

I know you don't need a date, but every one of my friends has a date already, and I can't help but to feel left out, or at least have the idea I won't have any fun.

530,"Hello reddit.
So my neighbor is an ex-soldier or something like that and he is a big fucking bastard. Idk if he has some kind of mental illness but all the neighbors hate him and at the same time we're afraid of him, so we tend to avoid any kind of interaction with Mr. Soldier, cuz he may threaten us with pulling out his guns if we ever fuck with his stuff.

To give more context, he does things like putting giant rocks next to the sidewalk so no one will park in front of his house. He even painted them yellow so they become the sidewalk... We can't deal with this kind of shit cuz he will threaten to shoot us. 

Anyways, the thing is that he recently acquired five dogs which live in the ceiling of his house, and probably live in poor conditions (cuz they look so)... And i have a Great Dane that every time we open the entrance gate, he goes out and barks at them. I had been making an effort so my dog doesn't do that, but sometimes he can't help it. Every time we open the gate the dogs start barking and he goes out.

This morning my sister came out, opened the gate and the neighbor was out there too. The dogs barked each other and then he threatened my sister. ""I'll pull out my gun"". Idk if he referred to her or my dog, but i've fucken had it with this guy, im so angry.

534,"!!!! Disclaimer!!!!this is long af I’m sorry 
I really need some advice. Last year during the end of April me and my dad left to Hawaii for a wedding and we were staying with my aunt. I was 14 just turning 15 and my cousin was 19 then. Most of nights we were there my dad was pretty drunk and so was the rest of the family. The first night i was there i met my older cousin and I could tell he was staring at me and checking me out. The second night I was there he knocked on my door and asked if I wanted to hang out. He came in the room I was staying in and we were just laying on the bed talking. And he was pretty drunk when we were hanging out. He asked me if I wanted to play Xbox in his room and I said sure. So we go in there and then he proceeds to ask me if I wanted to sit on his lap and I said no. I didn’t know what to do. He turned the Xbox off  and the lights and put a movie on. I was sitting at the end of his bed and he starts laying on me and puts his arm around me and starts telling me how pretty I am and everything. He starts touching me and kissing me. My mind has gone blank at this point and i really didn’t know what to do. He starts lifting my shirt up and from there we had sex. I started developing feelings for him after this cause we had sex. I was scared to tell my dad cause I was scared I would just be causing problems and I wanted my dad to have fun cause he hadn’t seen his family since I was born. The rest of the time I was there we didn’t talk much. But he was like playfully flirting with me. And I could feel his eyes staring at me alot. 
(I didn’t realize it was sexual assault throughout our whole relationship but I feel like I always knew in the back of my mind I was trying to excuse what he had done to me and I was having nightmares about that night a lot.) 
So me and him proceed to have a relationship for a year and he was honestly my first love. I really loved him. Even though it was toxic and I knew it was wrong I loved him so much. We’d talk about having a future and adopting kids. But throughout our relationship he would always make fun of things he knew I was insecure about. And he would always try to make me forgive him by making me feel guilty for him. He caused most of the issues in out relationship. But I excused everything cause I loved him and I wanted things to workout so bad. So I tell my older sister after a year of dating that we were cousins and that he was 20 and that we had sex that night. and she tells me “babygirl he sexually assaulted you” and we both start crying heavily. I always knew what he did to me was wrong I would always try to push it back and excuse it. But now that I fully realize what happened I’m mad and sad that someone I loved dearly could do that to me. And I felt so disgusted with myself. So I broke up with him after everything went down. It’s been a month since our breakup and me and him are still talking and I still love him. But every time i look at him what happened that night just comes rushing back to my head and I feel so sad. I know I need to cut him off and move on so I can fully heal from what happened but I love him. And I know our love is wrong and it should never have been a thing so I need advice on how to move on from him. And how to accept and cope with what he did to me.",27May2019,3

536,"I started working at my job in the beginning of May. This is my first job ever, excluding internships. The problem is I feel like I'm in way over my head here, Im making decisions I don't feel comfortable making but there is no one overseeing or supervising my work right now. Ofcourse I do make mistakes but my boss and team aren't exactly understanding of those mistakes. 
The first happened about in the first week. I noticed most people packed their things and left by 5:30 rather than six which was ofcourse the stipulated time. So on days my work for the day was done, I would leave too. Until my boss came into office one day and saw that I wasn't around. She sent a message on the office group chat after which I called her and we spoke. The next day she called a meeting of the whole office to discuss how me leaving early was unprofessional and the whole team should be upset since I essentially was delaying all of their work by not putting a 110% into mine. It wasn't great and I wish we could have spoken privately but I guess to each their own. 
The next thing was after I had written a small bio about someone (about 2 sentences) She didn't have a problem with the bio until she asked me who I interviewed and I told her the person in question and one other person. Again she called me ""the heights of laziness"" for not asking everyone in office before writing the bio. 
Then the final straw was today when I wrote the content for a short video. She was out of town and told me (once again on the group rather than in private) that my English is wrong, which it wasn't and that the concept wasn't great. I hadn't picked the concept. She said the work should have been done earlier even though my end of the work was done on Friday. I tried explaining this to her but no dice. 
It seems like I'm not learning anything and just making mistakes. I have no guidance whatsoever but perfection is still pretty much expected. I'm so bored everyday writting terrible content with people I don't like just waiting for the day to end so I can go home. Every evening thinking about going back there causes me so much anxiety because it seems impossible not to fuck up and it's just another time I'll get called lazy or stupid in front of my team members. She doesn't treat anyone else like this making me believe that I might actually be lazy and stupid.

540,"Hello.  


I've immigrated to Texas. It's a long story and it would take way too much time to explain everything so I'll try to be brief. 

I've immigrated to a small city in Texas from Europe. I was able to immigrate because my mother married an American husband through the ""mail-order bride"" service. They are both extremely irresponsible, mentally ill and villainous people and my life here has been absolutely terrible. You'd say, ""why is your life terrible because of some bad people?"" and you would be correct, but that's not how it is.   
I am stuck in a house with extremely thin walls, so I can hear these people screaming, walking, talking etc. all the time. Even if I use earplugs - the sound still leaks in. Fighting is something these people love doing and they fight every weekend (at least!). My mother doesn't work or do anything, she just sleeps in until 2-3PM, doesn't shower and waits until her husband comes home so they can go shopping, eating or fight for hours. Her husband is even worse and he's like a 100% replica of my biological father: makes empty promises, doesn't care about anything, greedy, judgmental, racist, a show-off...  Just to make one example, I'll mention that he kept me here for a year when I was 15 and he refused to do my papers. Basically, I was close to turn into an illegal immigrant because he didn't want to fill in my paper-work. He'd say ""it's too difficult, I don't know how to fill them"". I was able to go back to USA after that because of one legal condition that allowed me to get a green-card without him filling the papers. 

These people have abused me for a few years by now and you can imagine that living with someone who abused you, constantly being forced to listen to them fight for hours, walk, talk and just know that they are right there, behind the wall is something out of a horror movie.

  
Either way, I need to get out of this house. I looked for a job on various websites for about a month and haven't found anything. I am not physically strong, so those kinds of jobs are out of question. The only education that I have is a foreign high school, but my diploma is evaluated and translated. My resume is written nicely, and I've been applying for jobs for about a month by now - the ones I quality for and don't quality for. I've been applying to absolutely everything, be it internship or part-time, or full time - not a single interview.

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth to note that I can't drive due to some reasons (health and not only that) and there's no way I can get a driving license. So, my job search is limited to two cities - the ones I can get around by foot. Nobody walks here and there aren't any sidewalks, but it is possible to get around by foot. I asked her husband to help me for just one year and drive me to work, he drives to a bigger city for his work and he could drop me off or something - he refuses and says ""I'm busy"" - even though he sleeps until 10-11AM.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had one interview appointment but had to cancel it because her husband refused to drive me there. And the 2 cities that I can get to by foot are very-very small. There's literally 3-5 job ads per day and that is it. And most of those jobs require some kind of education, physical strength or experience. I tried to apply to Best Buy, Gamestop and others but they refused my applications all the time, wouldn't even agree to an interview.  


Do you think there's anything I can do to find a job here? 

I don't want to go back to my homeland. As a male, I'll have to go to army and there's actual war there as of now, so I'll have to train for 1,5 year then serve for a year if the army will find me ""qualified"". That's the law there... only those with bad health don't have to serve. My health is bad but because people are trying to avoid army (bribes, fake documents, etc). And the military would often close their eyes on people's bad health just because they have to have a certain number of young people in army. 

Then there's the hobby situation. I have a few hobbies (video games and something else) and they are very expensive in my homeland. One new game costs as much as half of the rent and the wages are very low. I've calculated and the jobs I can get in Ukraine will not make it possible for me to have any savings, everything will go into rent, food and bills. Now, it's not like I can buy games now in USA, but when I'd get a job, it would not be a problem.

Lastly, there's the overall quality of life, which is very low in my homeland...

&amp;#x200B;

I have enough money for the ticket back home, but it's not enough to, say, move out to a different city in USA and start working there. I've thought about everything and I have no choice but to go back to my homeland. Today I'll buy a ticket but I thought maybe someone can offer me an advice on this whole situation.",27May2019,1

I'm not sure where they got the earphones and how they reached for it but my brother will pin the blame on me since I was with the puppies and that the earphones are in his room (where I slept). I can already imagine him saying that I should have kept it somewhere more safe but I had absolutely no clue where it was placed. As I mention again, I don't know how they got it. I'm a bit afraid that my brother will find out about this since it cost him quite the money.

When she asked for constructive comments, i said it made her look life less and all those effort is just her trying too hard to match mannequins' standards and a light make up with only blush and lipstick could have done better. That made her really mad at me as she said makeup were where she calm herself down from the criticisms also make herself confident and my comments eventually crushed it all. Now that she's stubbornly denying the fact that she was praised to have an above average beauty by a large number of people and my efforts telling her so just got stopped by the one debate she kept on using: ""you aren't me and you don't know what people tell me"". What can i do to get out of this situation and stop her from sounding like the one trying to get praised by others over shallow standards?",27May2019,2

I have much ambitions in life, but it feels like my brain is going to mush because I can’t get a hold of this and I’m not sure exactly what’s wrong with me. I’ve just always been like this. Even make up is a difficult concept for me to grasp and I seek sensory experience by listening to music and by listening to music it triggers excessive daydreaming and world-building and I start rocking back and forth or I pace around a lot. I feel like an absolute weirdo for this. I don’t know where to start nor how to bring this up as a main concern to a professional. The only time I can focus is in an environment like school or work where I basically have to sit down and buckle up, but I just want to learn to do this without answering to someone else.

It gets to the point where I could be lying down in bed and thinking about all the stuff I want to do and just wanting to scream or move my body cause of the stress overload I feel overcoming me.

It's not the first time she does this, so I told her that we'd like her to use a spoon or something to taste food instead, because it's more hygienic this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Then she got defensive, saying the food was made by her bare hands, as well as telling we will miss her hands after she will be gone (Nobody complained about the actual food, so I don't see the reason for saying that, It's irrelevant), following by shouting at my grandfather nobody will ever change her opinion about anything, and that she thinks before she acts.

He’d mentioned in the past that when he’s depressed he just feels nothing and while he was breaking up with me I asked how he could be so callous when last time he cried over losing me and he told me “I don’t feel anything about anything anymore”. He just kept saying he was a shitty person and I didn’t deserve to be with a shitty person. It’s very very obvious that he’s horribly depressed so it’s hard for me to accept this breakup but I’m trying to. This was the man that I thought I was going to marry. The man that promised me forever, in spite of my PTSD from my ex-husband. 

I do intend to reach out to him in a few months time, just to see how he’s doing because I love him and I’m worried about him.

557,"Hello everyone, I hope you're having a great day. Im posting on mobile, sorry for any formatting issues. Also, english isnt my first language so there may be some grammar mistakes.

Im a 15 year old female and i dont shave my legs (nor do i wear makeup or pluck my eyebrows - basically dont care about beauty), which a lot of people around me find absolutely unacceptable, disgusting and ugly. I used to shave my legs - i only did it for a year though - but now i havent let a razor touch my leg hair for approx. 10-11 months. I stopped doing it because i found it tiring and a huge waste of time and effort for nothing but 'beauty' and social standarts. I didnt enjoy it at all, so i decided to stop. At first it was hard to get used to my newly hairy legs, considering the hair was prickly and 'ugly',  but after my leg hair fully grew out it started getting softer. Now it feels soft, just like my head hair. 

The problem is - the hair grew out WAY longer and darker than it used to be, making it more noticeable. Even though some people have already gotten used to it, they often throw some nasty comments about my leg hair at me. I personally dont give a flying f*ck about other people's opinions, especially if theyre only a stranger or just someone i know, but then these comments started coming out of my relatives' mouths, which kind of hurts. [I feel like girls are oppressed to be the literal definition of beauty, much like boys are oppressed to be strong and sporty (I THINK) and i want to fix this issue, thats one of the reasons for me not to shave my legs.]

Good things about not shaving legs:
1) not wasting time
2) not wasting money on shaving cream, razors and etc.
3) no razor burns or cuts whatsoever
4) showing one of my good qualities: being myself and not giving in to other people's opinions unless i really need it (which is now)
5) feels natural
6) gets softer
7) no one is going to shave their legs when theyre old, so why not stop earlier and get used to it?
8) its not unhygienic
9) body hair grows EVERYWHERE, why not just leave it be?
10) protest against norms

Bad things about not shaving legs:
1) nasty, annoying and tiring comments from others
2) cant wear shorts (or - i never wear them anyways - skirts and dresses) without getting unecessary opinions (HOWEVER, i wear thin sweatpants as a 'substitute')
3) disturbing stares

So, now i need your help on deciding what to do. Currently all i can think of is:
1) dont shave, keep on being the way i am, show others that they dont have to live up to the world's norms to be considered human
2) bleach it 
3) dye it crazy colors (like blue), which would PERHAPS make it more 'beautiful' and acceptable, or maybe even start a trend
4) just give it up and shave, waste my time, money and effort for the most useless thing (imo)
5) other (please write in the comments)

I am most likely going to have an international flight soon and I need some help. I'll appreciate any help.

1. I have a few gaming consoles. I can put one in my backpack but another one just doesn't fit. If I put it into my luggage and wrap it into clothes or bubble-wrap, can I expect it to work after the flight? Is it even allowed to put it into the luggage (not the one that I carry on the plane!) ? 
2. I'll be flying from USA and I have a laptop. The laptop is in bad condition and it's impossible to turn it on if the charger isn't positioned in a proper way. The charger that I have now works but I kind of need to turn it around 100 times to make it work... I've decided to buy a new one in the country where I'm travelling to because the wallplugs there are different.   
Can I put this laptop into my luggage? Or do I need to carry it with me on the plane? Will the airport workers need to turn it on? I heard about some new regulation about laptops and airport staff being more careful with that.
3. I have a few external hard drives with backed up data. Am I allowed to carry them on the airplane?

563,"They're mostly being selfish when it comes to me, &amp; it's been a semi long time coming. I don't know if I should just back off from the friendship or confront them. Here's the straw that broke the camels back. 

My friend has had 3 kids, I've thrown her a baby shower for one &amp; helped with another. She also moved 2 hrs away several years ago, to which I've always tried to take the time to come visit her &amp; her family once a month &amp; for kids birthday parties. She's very seldom come to see me which I used to understand because she didn't want to travel that far with three young kids &amp; many times her husband would work weekends. So hard to schedule. (Calling this friend N &amp; close friend A)

But now it gets annoying. I'm pregnant &amp; she wanted to help with the baby shower &amp; do the gift registry with me. Great! A friend who lives closer(A) took over the basics of the shower &amp; sent out an email with all the information &amp; what N could do with suggestions. A &amp; I had met &amp; planned a lot, brain stormed etc. N called me complaining why I wanted such a big baby shower &amp; how I'm just going to be the center of attention (though A and I planned it so it wouldn't be like that). I was then upset and called A asking if I was asking too much out of them and I could downsize anything. She got mad because according to her it is small, apparently called N (theyre both friends too) &amp; yelled at her &amp; told her to back off &amp; if she didn't want to do something to go to her. N has called me since about complaints but I brush them off because I trust A to deal with it. 

Fine. But then I scheduled a day to drive 2 hrs to come and see her and spend the day with her &amp; her family &amp; do the baby registry since she volunteered to do that with me. She's acting weird before trying to pin down times etc which we don't do, making sure of what day I'm coming which is weird too. Finally I get there with the father of my child &amp; find out that N &amp; family are actually driving down to my area to visit friends that night &amp; to go out with them the next day. So we get a rushed baby registry done while she's packing her kids stuff, we go out for a rushed dinner where children are upset because they weren't allowed to pack electronics they wanted because of time, &amp; then we all left after dinner to make the long drive back. &amp; yes, in a third trimester a 2 hr drive can be long. I don't understand why she couldn't just meet me in my area to do the registry, I love her family &amp; wouldn't have minded being at my house or at an IHOP or chick fil a with a kids area. But no. She hid this until I got there. 

The other part of this that gets me is she has mentioned several times the friends she went to see have never made the drive to visit them, not even for birthdays. I do &amp; she never comes down to visit me. I could count the times she visited me for me on one hand. The baby father actually made the point that almost every time she comes to visit with the family it's because they're on the way to visit these friends or something else and I'm just a stop. Which is true. She's said they have more parties, but her old friends and I have game nights, dinners etc kids welcome, so we do things too she just doesn't want to make the drive. 

So do I confront her on how hurt I am by her complaining about my baby shower and how she's disregarding our friendship &amp; wasting my time, or do I just stop putting as much effort into the friendship and see where she wants it to go? Let her be in control a bit?",27May2019,2

I have been looking at apartments in the area and everything is super expensive. I would likely be paying 1900/mo after parking. My brother has been pushing me to potentially buy a home near him and commute into Seattle, which totally makes financial sense.

569,"Initially I was really freaked out and terrified, then I quickly got a lot better.

Then I got a lot worse with constant nightmares and I was too afraid to get up to use the bathroom or get water during the night. I woke up to all small noises and was paralyzed with fear. I kept my bedroom door locked, had chairs and bags of cans in front of my front door and bedroom door, and checked the front door multiple times every hour. This was three months after it happened.

That was two weeks ago, 2.5 months after the break in. So I sent an email to a therapy center in my area saying I had stress after someone broke in and if they had any openings. I didn't say anything else.

Today I got an email saying I had been assigned a therapist and if I wanted to accept an appointment. I googled the therapist and it was a PTSD specialist. I don't think it's PTSD and feel I may have misrepresented myself in my initial email but I don't want to get into my life story in an email.

I was thinking whether I should reject the appointment or ask for someone who is not into PTSD because I think I might have normal anxiety anyway. My current state is:

* Checking the front door 5-10 times a day (a lot less than before)
* I don't put chairs and cans in front of my bedroom door, I only lock it. One night I slept with the door open but I was really drunk.
* Only occasional waking up in terror from nightmares caused by noises.
* Often I leave the bedroom to go the bathroom or get water. I couldn't do that before. But it still causes anxiety and I do a check around the house to see if anyone's there.
* I still walk around checking under all my furniture, under the bed, behind curtains, or in closets to see if anyone is there (a few times a day, usually if I hear a noise).
* Still sometimes wake up to and have to analyze sounds I hear during the night, while not breathing to not make any noise. Only sometimes they cause intense fear and chest pains if I can't pin them right away. Usually it's just my boyfriend scratching himself or people outside or something but it takes me like 2 minutes to be sure.
* I don't feel grossed out in the spot in my house where we had to confront him.

So I'm asking if anyone has been in my situation, it seems like things are on the right path, would you think the sensible thing to do would be to cancel? I'm thinking if it's unnecessary mentally and financially.

571,"I hope this isn't the wrong sub. 

I'm kind of two people, at least it seems like it. On the surface, and how I feel mostly, I'm a moderately successful guy - I'm a kiwi teaching English in Saint Petersburg Russia, I have an amazing girlfriend - extremely smart, caring, and supportive. I live in my favourite city, have plenty of time and enough money to pursue my many hobbies, and as I say, most of the time I'm satisfied with life and feel that I've come a long way from my chaotic and very dark childhood. 

But that's the other part. I can feel the demons of my past self following me constantly, sometimes I can forget them when life is good but trivial problems can set off a spiral of depression and very dark, personally disgusting compulsions. When this happens I feel another side of myself kind of emerging and taking over. It seems impossible to control. Thank goodness, I don't act or at least haven't acted on them, and thank goodness anyway my compulsions are more about harming myself than other people. But not just about harm.  In this state I question everything. One moment I will be determined that I am not a man - as I am - but a woman, and I can get really worked up or even panicky that its not right. Sometimes this state even brings positive emotions, like a sudden inspiration to write music or poetry, or to change my career altogether. Sometimes I feel gay, sometimes I feel overcome with, for lack of a better word, horniness for women. Sometimes I hate the very concept of sex and wish I'll never think about it again. I get trembles and find myself speaking glossolalia, I guess a leftover from a bad period I had in a Pentecostal church that left me scarred but for some reason still able to ""speak in tongues"" even after losing my faith - I since read that its a natural phenomenon and not only exclusive to spiritual Christians. 

My girlfriend is a solid rock in my life and she keeps me going - I just remind myself that I do it all for her. But it's not healthy, I know, and not fair to her or myself. She doesn't know most of this, by the way. She knows I struggle with depression, but I can't tell anyone the truth - I've left out the worst of it here. 

Antidepressants are really hard to come by here in Russia due to strong anti drug policies so I can't seem to help there, and psychiatrists who speak English aren't really dime a dozen. In some ways I respect the Russian work ethic of ""be stronk and vork hard"" but I guess I just can't do it sometimes. I've had a string of consecutive blows and I'm feeling just about ready to throw everything away and walk into the forest, see how long I'll last. Then again, I think I'm too cowardly to consciously wreck myself like that. 

Sorry for the rant. Just at wits end and have no one else to talk to. 

Love you reddit ♥️",27May2019,0
572,"Sorry for the length. 

I’m thinking about moving with my boyfriend of two years as soon as next week and both of my parents are insanely strict and are both mentally and emotionally abusive towards me. 

Some Background Info: My dad has always had extremely bad anger issues and loves to put my mom and I down whenever he has the chance. He throws things, yells and slams doors. He comes home angry most nights. He hits my dog and my mom. My mom is too scared to get the police involved, much like everyone else. He constantly fought with my mother for years and she would often leave him, only to return on broken promises. He was insanely controlling and strict while I was growing up. I couldn’t cut/dye my hair, have slumber parties or even hang out with friends. I also couldn’t close my door for privacy and my sketchbooks and phones were always gone through. I have to hide the phone I have now from my dad. I’m not allowed to have a job or a permit/license. I was never allowed to apply for a job or go take my permit test. When I started dating my boyfriend, I was sixteen and a junior in high school, my dad refused to let us see each other after he graduated from high school. We had to go months without seeing each other and, with the help of my mother and grandmother, we occasionally snuck around to see each other. My dad DISPROVES of my boyfriend so much and is constantly saying how our relationship won’t last. He puts my boyfriend down a lot for his weight, (he’s a cute chubby guy), and his financial situation. My boyfriend’s family doesn’t make a lot of money. 

My mom, who was once cool with us living together after I graduated, is now really against it. I don’t know why. She’s keeping important documents, birth certificate and social security number and card, from me in order to try and make me stay at my house. 

My boyfriend does not do drugs and has only had sex with me and vice versa. He got good grades when he was in high school and is now working a job and planning on going to college in the fall. I plan to get a job, my permit and go to a community college in the fall. 

My boyfriend’s family has offered to take me in multiple times and knows about my family. He wants me to desperately move in with him, because my parents are only getting worse. 

I’m willing to move in with my boyfriend, I want to get away from my parents and have my own life, but the thing is that I’m absolutely fucking terrified of my dad and how he will react to me leaving. I know he’s not gonna take it well and will most likely torment my boyfriend’s family and I. I need to get my legal documents from my mom as well. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time.",27May2019,2
573,"Bryson and I have been dating since we were 16. I initially thought he was confident, a deep thinker, ambitious and open minded. It sounds like I projected what I wanted out of a partner onto him. Anyways it’s been almost 4 years and everything has changed. 

When I was 19 I left home and had to grow up fast and provide for myself. I became a stripper and have never talked to so many men in my life. It just has opened my eyes to what type of men there are out there, thus changing what I want out of a relationship. My suppressed fantasy of dating men 15+ years older than me re emerged. And maybe a hint of daddy issues I really want to be with someone that is mature, can provide for themself (and maybe me?), is experienced in bed, is educated, and is successful in their career. 

Maybe I started comparing the customers to my boyfriend? I started to realize who Bryson is. He is naive, a homebody, has no ambition for much, only wants to hula dance and please his mom. He doesn’t want to travel, to try during sex, or take care of himself. Since he’s moved in I feel like his mom. I nag him to pick up his shit, shower, shave, eat his fruits and veggies, to stop smacking when he eats, to stop putting his feet on the pillows, to apply for a job, etc.  I pay for his gas, the rent and all of our meals. I feel like he has no common sense sometimes. He bullshits when he has no idea what he’s talking about. He’s left my keys and debit card on my car seat in plain view with the car unlocked, and just commonly leaves valuables in plain view when we leave our car. All of this is irritating me 

However there are some positives to him. When he doesn’t annoy me we have fun joking around and keeping eachother company. I have to admit I don’t really have any friends to hangout with aside from him. Also he has helped me when I was cutting off contact with my family and loves me so much. He has never done me wrong aside from being aloof and manchild. He has been nothing but supportive and loving throughout our relationship. He wants to get married and have a family with me.

In October we opened up our relationship, hence comes Sam. Sam is SIGNIFICANTLY older than me. Nonetheless we have a great fling. Sam went to MIT, has a Boston accent, is extremely intelligent, sarcastic, funny, caring, patient, and attentive in bed. He does business all over the world, and I have tagged along with him to London, Miami, NY, Hong Kong, and San Francisco. It’s just a complete 180. I’m so attracted to his intellect,  ambition and experience. Every time he says he will do something, he follows through.

When I first met Bryson I always asked him to go to a pumpkin patch and this particular  beach with horses. Pumpkin patch hasn’t happened in the 4 years I’ve known him and it took us three years before he finally took me serious and went to the beach with me.

I want to travel the world, become an entrepreneur, and live my life to the fullest. I just don’t know if I can do that with Bryson. I feel like I’d have to settle on mediocrity or pull all the weight in the household. But then again I’m conflicted because with Sam, he’s married and we have no real future. Sometimes I just feel like riding Sam/Bryson out until I find the perfect blend of the two? Is that unrealistic?",27May2019,2
574,Hello I’m 17 turning 18 on June 5th my parents often ask me what I want to do since I have no plans of going to college.

577,"Hi! This is my first time posting so I’m not sure if I’m in the right sub.. but I’m here looking for some advice.

A random number from my local area (same area code as me) has been calling and texting me some weird messages. I’m not sure what to do except block the number and try to clear all private info about myself from the internet (I.e. just removed my address from white pages).

Also - I have no clue how he got my number at all, and I’ve already tried looking the number up on Facebook and numerous reverse phone look-ups. According to several reverse phone number search websites, this number is marked as unsafe, and several women have reported that he is making sexual advances towards young teens and is continuously contacting them.

Should I be concerned about his advances? Should I be taking any dire measures to protect myself or is that an over reaction? 

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you :)

578,"My friend (F12), who I (F13) met playing random squads in a video game, has explicitly expressed to me how our friend (M17) has made her uncomfortable with his flirtatious and odd comments (""Cute, gorgeous, and decent at the game... When you turn 18, would you rather date me or Viz?""). 

She and I have told him off a few times. Every week, it seems that he'll say something perverted, she'll get mad at him and block him, he'll manage to convince her to unblock him, and the cycle will repeat. During each ""argument,"" they'll both vent to me about each other. She'll come to me and complain about how he's so perverted, while he'll come to me saying that she got triggered and she needs to learn how to take a joke. 

Every time she comes to me complaining about him, I make sure to inform him and warn him about how she's still underaged, she doesn't feel comfortable with discussing sexual stuff, etc. However, he'll dismiss it, simply say ""Ok,"" and a few days later, he'll slip up again and make her mad or uncomfortable. 

I'm getting really sick and tired of his ignorance and foolishness. Sooner or later, she'll drop him as a friend and permanently block him out from her life... If I advise her to. She's relying heavily on me for advice when it comes to him and I want what's best for her. However, if she drops him, then I must do the same. He's well aware that we're extremely close, and if she blocks him he'll attempt to pressure me into convincing her to unblock him. 

The problem with that is that I don't really want to remove him from my life. If you can get past his perverted comments, he's actually a cool guy that's hilarious and provides entertainment. I'm used to his flirting, so I'm not very bothered when he's being inappropriate. 

I'm torn on what to do. I could do what's best for her, or I could be selfish and just tell her to deal with him. Her blocking him and me and him remaining friends would be unlikely since he'll just pester me about her no matter what I say. I'm afraid that the situation will turn worse if it isn't addressed properly.

581,"I’m going through a bad time of loneliness and have almost zero self esteem left and yet I feel like I can’t talk to anybody about it.

I tried talking to her about how she makes me feel worthless by coming into my room and either sighing or telling me I should be doing something else. She absolutely went off on me about how rude I was and that i should apologize to her.

585,"I’ve (21F) been with my boyfriend (24M) for over a year now. In May 2018, he was wrongfully terminates from his job for “stealing $10.” He didn’t do it. He worked at a job location where racism and prejudice run amok. 

He wanted to take the year off to pursue writing, which I was in full support of. He wrote three short films and has been playing around with editing and filming techniques. Life has been good up until now. 

This month has been the worst possible month of this relationship. He lives with his parents, and has been financially supporting them for the majority of his life (until losing his job) since he’s known nothing else. He never saved a penny and gave every check to his parents. 

His parents have completely fucked him over and destroyed his credit score in return- they put his name on a vehicle which they stopped paying and ended up repossessed, they got two credit cards for him in his name that they never paid, and they put his name on the cable bill and never paid it. The two CCs and the cable bills got sent to collections. They just tried to take out another credit card in his name (without his knowledge!) in February, but it was declined. 

Despite all this, they will constantly demean him for not working, and frequently talk shit behind his back to me. I can’t be in his house with his parents anymore because it makes me so uncomfortable.

He plans to submit an appeal to the company he previously worked for now that 1 year has passed and there are still no charges against him. He wants a higher paying position at a different location. He’s submitting this next week when he can get proof from the state attorney’s office tomorrow. 

Now to the advice part- I’m so stressed out. I love him, and we want to plan for the future, but he has no financial stability on which we can build off of. We can’t even afford to go out to McDonald’s once a week. I’m incredibly bored and we can never go anywhere unless I’m driving, or his parents are not using his car (they all share his car because his parents can’t afford to upkeep the father’s). It’s been like this since October 2018.

Am I selfish for wanting more? Is it wrong of me to dislike his parents? What can I do to prevent myself from losing my fucking mind with his parents and the financial situation they caused? I don’t know how much longer I can hold out with this.",27May2019,3
586,"Yes, you read that right. I know it's the complete opposite of what most are looking for, but bear with me...

So my apt is really quiet because we live on the top floor (3rd) in a quiet neighbourhood, with only the noise of the street and neighbours next door and ridiculously quiet neighbours below. Because of this, every sound in our apt seems way too loud and disturbs other roommates or downstairs neighbours. We play movies at night and we'll have the volume on 15 to hear all dialogue (and barely hear whispered dialogue) but if a loud sound comes, we're rushing to lower the volume.

Here's where I need advice, I want to put things in our living room that creates some background/white noise. Like the way an aquarium will create enough uninvasive noise that natural sounds don't seem so loud, except I don't want to spend too much money and though I love fish, don't really want a fish tank. Our apt isn't even specially sound proof, we have a rug down and without it, stepping anywhere in the living room sounds very loud and everything will echo.

587,"This a long one and I’m sorry lol there’s a TL;DR At the bottom. 
Starting off here’s a little background so everything makes sense: 
Cody is friend I’ve know since I was 16 he was 18 and he’s known my little sister Maggie since she was 13 they both have birthdays in December. Cody is a known alcoholic and drives drunk all the tine contrary to everyone’s attempts and wishes that he wouldn’t, so I’ve made it clear no one, especially my 4 siblings, are allowed to drive with him ever. Maggie and Cody began flirting with each other last year around June and Maggie (17 now) snuck out of the house with Cody (22) during July to “drive around and hangout nothing weird” (her words) which caused mass anger and drama towards her and Cody because he was obviously drunk when I came to pick her up from the park they were at. 
  I had countless long talks with both of them about not disrespecting me and our relationships and to please not fuck. I pleaded with Cody telling him he’s known Maggie since she was 13 and fucking my sister is something I do not want at all. If you wanna date, you can talk to me when she turned 18 in December. Cody reassured me he has no feelings for her and is repulsed by the idea of doing anything. Maggie said close to the same, but I emphasized with Maggie that if anything happened Cody would be doing it just because it’s an easy fuck, not because he cares about her and stressed that this would ruin my relationship with both of them. She reassured me she saw him as a brother 
  Fast forward to last week (May 2019) I found out they had sex at some point in December or spring (Maggie was 18 but still in high school), in my man cave, and in the dead of night. I confronted Cody (23 now) about this, and told him to tell me how often and when this happened if he wants to save our friendship. He said it was one time in December and he was blackout drunk and she took advantage of him slightly and it was a mistake that will never happen again. He emphasized that he doesn’t care about her at all and is repulsed by her, literally admitting it was just easy pussy. Not surprised I figured the drama was over and set out to talk to Maggie when she came back home that next week. 
  Next week rolls around and Maggie’s due home anytime when I found out from a friend of Maggie’s, who’s very against the situation of her and Cody, that it was not a one time thing and has been happening a lot since December. I text both Cody and Maggie stating the information I’ve heard and if it’s true. Cody denied denied denied and Maggie avoided the question until she broke and told me they’ve done sexual actions 3 times claiming they have real feelings for each other. I text Cody and he stated “ no it was only the one time in the winter and then one time in spring” completely changing the story. I called Maggie and explained all my pain and anger and she didn’t give a fuck just kept saying “ I’m an adult I can do what I want” I told her what he said about not giving a fuck and she called me a liar. 
  After all this I haven’t spoken to either of them. It’s blatant that neither one cares about how hurt I am or that they’ve disrespected me and my parents by fucking under our roof without consent and completely behind our backs. If they were to wanna date whatever mazel tov. It’s not the fact they fucked, they’re adults I could care less. It’s the fact they went against my wishes, behind my back, lied to me for months straight to my face, and didn’t even consider how bad this would hurt me. I’m angry at Maggie for not caring about him being my close friend and being selfish and just doing what she wants. I’m angry at Cody for not being the adult and fucking a girl he’s known since 13, who’s my sister, and doing it all with a smile on his face while saying he’d never hurt me like that and damage our friendship. 
At this point I have nothing to say to either of them and don’t even know what to do. I’ve thought of telling Maggie’s mom and dad (she’s my step sister) as they don’t know about the joy ride last year or the consistent sexual actions. Why can’t people have empathy and not be selfish? Anyone have any advice on where to go from here? I care for both of them but I’m so fucking hurt especially since they don’t care I’m hurt. 
TL;DR: 23 year old best friend fucked my 18 year old high school sister in secret even thought I spent a year begging them not to and they spent a year smiling in my face and saying they’d never damage our relationship like that.",27May2019,1
588,"Hey reddit,

First of all I want to apologies for any spelling mistakes  that will ineffably be made by yours truely (can add dyslectic to the list as well). I've tried writing this post for the past 3 weeks but havent been able to make soemthing that I'm comfortable with.

I've never really been the most confident guy in town, this is mostly the case becasue of a few things (stutter, bullied (becase of stutter) and the looks of a shat out baffoon). Because of all of that I never really learned how to make/have friends (kidna hard to do that when you cower away during every social event).

3 years ago I managed to get a gf thru a friend of mine, this was and fro parts of itstill is the best time i can rememeber. 4 months ago we broke up due to her cheating on me with my at the time only friend (ofc not anymore right now). This has left me more hurt and alone than I want to admit and I feel myself in a sense sinking deeper every day.

I'm guessing the advice I'm asking for is ,if poeple who have been in my spot, how did you get out of spiraling out of control and become more social?",27May2019,2
589,"Hi, I'm currently working in retail but was recently offered a job in the field that I studied for.

591,"(17 M) I want to explain my situation because at this point I feel like the support of a congregation of strangers is all I have. I need advice.

For a while I’ve been incredibly close friends (family friends) with this girl, let’s call her Mary. Mary and I have always hit it off, and she was one of the few people I always trusted. She was like a sister to me more than anything else. We talk quite a bit when we have classes together, and we’ll occasionally text. We’d banter the fuck out of each other and we had a wonderful chemistry together. Last year I asked her to junior prom and we went together and it was great! So this year I asked her to prom and that’s when everything started falling apart.

I asked her to prom in the middle of March as colleges were announcing decisions. And suddenly we were texting 24/7, bonding over our mutual rejections and Ls. We were texting during class, after school, during clubs, in the middle of the night, literally every time. And more importantly, we were legitimately bonding. She started talking to me a lot more in class and I felt us getting even closer. I could never tell if I had feelings for her, but suddenly I felt those feelings becoming prominent because it started to look like it was mutual. This lasted for a month or so.

After a ton of deliberation I decided to ask her out on a date. I couldn’t outright explain that I had feelings because again, we’re both teenagers and family friends and that wouldn’t fly over well in our famfriend group. It was just a date, and judging from how close we were, I figured she’d agree, and we would have a good time and see where things went from there. She politely declined, saying that at this point in her life, dating and relationships and just nowhere on her radar. And suddenly my self-confidence plummeted and my already existing depression was seriously exacerbated. I felt like I wasn’t good enough. We both promised each other that nothing about our friendship would change, and we continued texting that day like normal.

The next day, senior internships started and our texting slowed down like crazy virtually overnight. We went from texting close to 24/7 to having a few sparse texts spread out through the day, and it drove me crazy. I had felt a true connection with this girl through our conversations and I thought she felt the same way, so it hurt that she could just slow down the texting the way she did. She insisted she was just busy, and I had no reason not to believe her because we had full trust in each other. But I’d have mood swing episodes of paranoia where I’d convince myself she had somehow become repulsed. Combined with my poor mental state and the fact that I had come to fruition with my true feelings for her, I became scared that I was going to lose her by doing something stupid. By acting pushy and desperate. And that was the beginning of that self-fulfilling prophecy.

I went crazy that our communication had slowed down. And I started acting stupid with her. Whenever she wouldn’t respond to a text or a snap I’d be pushy and text her again. I just began getting so caught up in my feelings that I felt like I began driving her away by being annoying. It was a vicious cycle because I’d act out in my depressive episodes and later feel like I made things worse in our relationship, which would further plunge me down the rabbit hole. I wanted so bad to tell her how I really felt about her, but I couldn’t. Because it wasn’t a crush. I’ve had crushes in the past, I know what it feels like. This wasn’t that, because it felt like love. And telling her that would’ve ended everything, especially as high schoolers. I just wanted to relive the attention she was giving me during our conversations because I missed it. I just wanted that connection back. She was legitimately busy, but my constant attempts to reconnect made me look incredibly pushy and clingy. I knew it was happening too and I needed to stop, but when the night rolled around and I was alone with my thoughts, my emotions would always take over and I’d succumb. It’s pathetic. Meanwhile I started to feel like more and more like she never even considered me as close a friend as I considered her, even though it’s probably untrue. The paranoia was debilitating our relationship because at every point I was trying to force interactions and get close to her.

One thing you should know about me is that I’m very direct and honest with people. So I’d often ask Mary if I was getting to be too much, and she’d always tell me everything was cool. In the past whenever I’d have a conflict with her, we’d always talk everything out honestly, so there was no reason for me not to believe she was lying to me whenever she’d tell me everything was cool. And I kept acting pushy and clingy because she kept telling me everything was fine.

Prom rolls around and we’re taking a TON of pictures together and having a great time. I’m excited because I’ve been wanting to ask her to a slow dance for a long time, and this is finally my chance. The first slow dance, I asked and she responded with kind of an aloof “i suck at slow dancing” while walking away with her friends and kind of laughing, so I figured she didn’t think I was being serious (I feel like I should reiterate, we banter each other a lot so this would not have been out of character). I figured I didn’t ask her formally or properly, so after a while I take her outside and privately explain to her that I was being serious. I tel her I wanted to ask her last year too, to which she tells me she wasn’t comfortable slowdancing with guys in general. In some miscommunication in the moment, I thought she meant she wasn’t comfortable LAST YEAR. So, stupidly, I asked her if she’d be comfortable if another slowdance comes up, and she looked at me and said sure. Another slowdance didn’t come up. I realized how weird everything was getting and I apologized to her. We talked everything out when we got home and she explained that she felt pretty uncomfortable in the scenario and she couldn’t say no, so I explained the miscommunication and we both agreed everything was cool after that.

The next day I was looking at the prom pictures and I was super excited. There were so great many pictures of us together that I couldn’t wait to share with her. When Mary posted her prom pics on Instagram though she didn’t put any couples pics of us. And I got really upset. I messaged her about it and things started to escalate.

She finally broke and told me that our relationship as friends started off great but then I started becoming way too pushy. She brought up the constant messaging when she wouldn’t respond and the the slowdancing incident as examples. This felt especially weird since I specifically trying talking things out after each incident and she would always tell me everything was cool. Even at the beginning of our conversation about the Instagram post, she insisted she wasn’t mad and that she would tell me if something was the matter. In the first block text she sent, she told me to back off or she’d stop trying to maintain our friendship.

We had a few blocktexts exchanged. I told her I was glad she was being so honest because this is the kind of conflict I wanted to avoid whenever I’d ask her if everything was cool between us. I told her I felt like I needed some space too. She told me that she would cut me off it she had to and that if I continued to just stress her out in the future she wouldn’t hesitate. In one blocktext back I told her that she didn’t have to brandish cutting me off since I’m trying to talk things out. Her final block text was her basically telling me that she can’t handle more of this conversation and that she’s going to start being “mean” if it doesn’t stop. She ended it by saying we both need space and that she’s sorry that it’s come to this, but that she’s not cutting me off, just creating some space. 

I need advice here. There was a point where I felt like she may have felt something back, but that ship has long sailed and I have no one to blame but myself. How do I salvage the relationship I once had with her? How do I get that close friendship to heal? It really kills me that she was so ready to threaten cutting me off altogether. Especially because of my feelings for her. I managed to screw everything up and it’s pulled me even further down the depression hole because once again, I feel completely alone in the world. 

She recently removed me from her private snap story which seems more like a cutting off move than a space move. Whenever we’re in the same room we keep glancing at each other and will occasionally make touch and go awkward eye contact. I don’t know at this point if she hates me or is just hurt about the whole situation as well.

**Reddit, what do I do?**

I don't really know who to talk to so I try here and we'll see. it's messy and I don't know if it makes a lot of sense (I'm french btw so excuse me for the bad English..... :/)

here's the story:

i have a bunch of good friends. they are nice and we have a lot of fun together. but,I feel like they like me because I make them laugh,and that's all. and that's kinda sad.

no one talks to me,if I don't text them first. 

today,a friend was not doing great. so I came to see him. I needed to take the train for like 1h30. we ate together,it was cool. but then other persons came and they just talked together, ignoring me. they have a party planned. I'm not invited. 

my friend knows that I went here just for him. all of this for nothing. 
I know that I'm not a party person. i don't really like when there's a lot of people but still,it's not really fair to talk about it all day. 

I have a best friend,but we never talk seriously. all of my friends know that i'm going through a shitty part of my life but I think no one cares.

I try to make new friends online but I'm really shy and I don't know how to respond... and finally I would like to talk to a therapist,but I can't afford it and my parents will mock me. 

so yeah I'm like an emo teenage kid,feeling lonely and shitty",27May2019,2

595,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I was recently admitted to grad school and my current employer wants to help with tuition.  Tuition isn't terribly expensive, probably 12k all in, unknown how much current employer wants to kick in.

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is what to do about the money.  If I accept, is there an expectation that this tuition assistance buys some sort of loyalty from me post-graduation?  Or can I simply look at it as a bonus for working hard and that the employer will see benefit from my school over the next two years?

601,"Hello to anyone who reads this,

This is the first time I have taken up to talk about this on any platform. Soo here goes... I am someone who doesn't like to talk about my feelings with anybody, but off late I have been facing some serious issues with the entirety of things since I have not been happy for a really long time(seems to have forgotten what it feels like). Currently(been close to 3 years), I am stuck with a dead end job which I am neither growing on the financial front nor on the career/ intellectual front, and also I may be on the verge on losing my job since my performance has been inconsistent because of my disdain towards it and also because of my addictions. 
I am an addict to anything that leads to self destruction and that gives me the feeling of being numb, be it drugs, alcohol, smoking, overeating, porn and so on...
I have been single all my life, hence never really had anyone close to talk and share. Never had a girlfriend(hence a virgin too, right now not the top priority), but it is not that I don't know to talk to women, it just that it's difficult to connect emotionally...
Also adding to all this I am obese(which in turn leads to laziness) and it literally feels like I do nothing towards it and it seems to be blowing out of proportion. I tend to overeat and do not have any workout regime set, extremely unfit but I am flexible since I have not always been am obese kid.
I know a lot of people and hang out with as many but only have very few friend friends and out of that only 2-3 that I am close with, maybe something to do with the fact that I am little different and people find it weird but I don't give a fuck ;) Also off late I have become a little anti social because of obvious reasons...

So this is the short version version of my life, and now the question...


Off late I have been thinking of quitting my job and moving in with my grandparents(so that the addictions are in check) and utilize my day to work out and study for competitive examinations, but I don't know whether it is a good option since I am a fairly intelligent guy and my parents(strong believers of ""work expands with the availability of time"") are absolutely against it, maybe there are right because the working out and studying part can be done with a job also is what I believe, but going into work every morning is just sad. I am a very optimistic person, hence I can't give up, I cannot choose to live with mediocrity, but off late I have been having some bad thoughts and need some help.
I want to turn my life around and am just stuck in this conundrum of :
What is the right thing to do? 
Am I just a prey to ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" concept??
Fairly intelligent, hence is it too much to bet with quitting the job???
And so on...????

I hope you get the gist of it, any advice would be platinum for me... Thanks... :)",27May2019,1
602,"I'm an introverted, socially awkward college student and about five months ago, for the first time in two years, I was able to make a close friend. 

I started talking to her through this writing app, after enjoying her amusing comments on my story. We had a lot in common, talking about things for hours and hours. I'd tell her about my problems. She'd tell me hers. We vented, told cringy stories, joked and confided. Even though I'd never met her in real life, I felt like we had a close bond. 

However, one day I fucked up. 

After a resolved argument about her being paranoid that I wasn't who I said I was, she started ignoring my messages. I figured she needed space so I didn't think anything of it but then after a while, it really started to distress me. Then I retardedly blocked her without saying why because I wanted to focus on my exams without her in the forefront of my mind. As you can probably guess, when I unblocked her, she blocked me!

I tried to clear things up by messaging her through a mutual friend but she still wouldn't respond. I could still message her through my secondary account, but I'm not sure if there's any point in trying to message her again seeing as she already ignored my apology. A part of me thinks that there is more to why she blocked me, and I want to figure out what her problem is with me so we can resolve it or so I can at least have closure. 

I really cherished our friendship and I miss our conversations. We even had some plans in the summer to critique each other's manuscripts.

He has a full time job as police officer, a girlfriend, a car, etc. You'd expect people to mature greatly over time, but seeing him act sometimes is just wrong. I can be watching television, playing games; basically not bothering anyone and he would just show up and ask me a whole lot of questions he has no right to ask. These are the typical questions he would ask me. I might be overreacting, but is it even okay to ask these personal questions?

1) When are you going to the gym?
2) When does your job start? How much are you getting paid?
3) Are you off on X day? If so, I have a package. Stay home and get it.
5) Why don't you stop playing all these ridiculous games?

4) Where are you going? Who are you going with? 

Another thing he annoys me, is how hypocritical he can be. I usually leave my cup on the table because I normally grab water time to time. He tells me to put my cup away, saying how mom doesn't want to see it. All the other times I see his cup filled with unnecessary amounts of ounces of beverage and sometimes he just leaves it on the table. Other than that, he leaves other stuff on the table that are his and has the audacity to tell me this. 

When a conversation is put onto him, he always attempts to change the subject. He can be at his own fault, my mom scolding him and he will always try to change the subject by involving other people who have no relation to the issue. He can bring my name up, bring my dad's name up, etc. 

At random times, he even attempts to touch my crotch as if we're little kids again. Like how young kids try to smack each other's groin area. I'm really sick and tired of this immature behavior. If he ever gets angry usually at my mom or me, he'll start ""threatening"" saying ""I'm a police officer. I can arrest you. Send you to jail."" Is this considered having a ""normal"" relationship?

611,"Backstory: Running is a favorite hobby of mine, and lately I've taken up to running on some railroad tracks that run through a forest near my house, as I'm preparing for a trail half-marathon, and the tracks are comparable to running on trails. Normally there are very few trains (&gt;5/week), and when trains do come they come later at night, and go really slowly. Long story short, its a fairly secluded and peaceful place to run.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I was out on a longer run on those train tracks, and I noticed a red stained cloth of some sort. I'll admit the thought passed through my mind that the red could be blood, but it wasn't a convincing enough idea to make me stop and investigate, I just chalked it up to be some trash or something thrown there (people in my neighborhood will occasionally walk down the train tracks, but I've only encountered people out there once). Today, after pondering what I saw for a bit, I figured it was worth running out there to get a second look at it. I brought a sandwich bag and a latex glove to pick it up with if it turned out to be something.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got out there and saw it clearly, it turned out to be a glove that indeed had some large, crusted, red spots.  The glove was probably once white and from what I can find on Google, seems to be made of cotton. The thing is pretty mangled and has a lot of dirt on it, too, so it's been out there for a long while.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a high-schooler, so I showed the thing to my mom who thought it was nothing, and told me to trash it.  But something in my gut just doesn't make me want to throw it away yet, so here I am looking for your advice. The nearest police station is about 1.4 miles away, so I could hypothetically walk/run there and drop it off, but I don't think I could turn it in to the police without my parents knowing, so I really want to be sure that it could be something serious before I try to turn it in without them knowing.

623,"TD;LR A good friend of mine for over 10 years got weird when she went off to college and would take it out on me. After the third time I cut her off and now a year later she has reached out to me again- what should I do?

I had a friend since I was in middle school. We met as we had both moved to the same town that year and had a lot of similarities. She taught me a lot and was honestly such a talented and kind person. Her sister and family were a bit messed up and sometimes I could feel that burden on her, but together we always kept it cool.

We went to the same highschool together and graduated together and ended up going into the same major, but in different parts of the world. We still kept in touch, but she began to change. It started with her being passive aggressive on my facebook posts for no absolute reason. The first time I thought it was her sister who had access to her FB and deleted the comment despite it being public to everyone of my facebook friends. 

We continued to talk every month or so as we were busy with our college lives when it happened again: I posted some great news recently in my life and amongst the positive comments, she slammed it down with something condesending and embarassing. At this point, I replied curtly to her to let her know this was unacceptable. She messaged me privately a day later apologizing and I ignored it. I assumed she was having a hard time at college (she went to a pretty tough one), but I did not think that was an excuse for her to treat me like shit when I did nothing to her, and what was worse made it publically known she was someone I considered my friend.

The third and final straw was when she privated message me just absolute hate. I was so taken aback. At this point, I told her off and told her I won't stand for this. We didn't talk since then but she messaged me a month later with an ""update"" on her life and how things weren't going so great but she wanted to check up on me. Considering we hadn't spoken since then and I had clearly blocked her off of my social media pages, I ignored her.

Today it has been a year later and she messaged me again to wish me well. We haven't spoken ever since but I wonder if I should give her another chance. I am in a better place now (thankfully) but I cannot help but feel bitter at how despite me having my own struggles before, I never took it out on her and instead she did to me countless times. At the same time, I can't help but worry she is going through a lot and wants a friend.

How it works is service finishes at 21:00 and you are expected to have everything done and finish by that time, but it's obviously nearly impossible for a KP to do as you have to wait for the chefs to finish before you can get in to the cooking area to clean up. 

How I usually work is that I'll get everything done, wait a while for pots, pans etc to fill up the sink (it's a quiet hotel and mostly prebookings but almost never busy) and then I'll wash them and keep doing that. Otherwise I'm stood around doing nothing as I'm already productive in finding things to do voluntary between like cleaning the actual bins, the stairs etc. 

Tonight I was doing what I usually do, and I got speaking to a member of the reception staff who I told this too in general conversation. She took it as I'm purposely avoiding work and being lazy but didn't say this to me, she told one of the chefs on shift. So I'm finished up after a 30 + people three course cover and it's 20:30. The chef comes up to me and says ""you'll be done for 21:00 tonight won't you?"" so I told him probably not due to still having to clean up, mop etc. He then in a fit of rage screams at me that I'm lazy and have done fuck all tonight. He's so angry spits flying everywhere, he mentions he will make sure I'm done for 21:00 as he'll stand and watch me. I wasn't the least bit intimidated and we got into a slinging match, he called me a dish bitch etc, I just laughed and called him a child and it went on like that. 

Then a colleague from reception comes in after hearing us shouting, she tells me to change the bins and leave, just as he's reading out texts he's sent the head chef and telling me the head chef called me a ""fucking KP"" and that I'm in trouble tomorrow. So I text the head chef giving him a heads up to get cover for me tomorrow and that's it. I got my things and left. 

Finally, I've only worked there around 6 weeks and I took the job as I needed something after I returned from abroad due to illness and the cost of treatment completely wiped me out. I'm annoyed because aside from me, nobody does the jobs that I do which apparently people don't see and that's why I've left, added with the chef talking to me like a piece of shit! 

I guess advice wise I'm just looking for someone to talk to about what's happened. The head chef has read my text and not replied so that says it all to me. The chefs are lazy for the most part themselves and the plan wasn't to stay there long term anyway as my background is more front of house management but I was hired on the spot without asking for a CV or anything because they've had a lot of KPs walk, including one in my second week there.",27May2019,2

633,"Hello Reddit, I have been on the verge of hospitalization the last week for exhaustion, panic attack after panic attack, etc while I'm trying to sort things out. Let me explain. Some details might seem irrelevent but come into play later.

&amp;#x200B;

I lived in City 1 (won't say where since I want to remain private) since I was born there, but when I was 13 my single mother passed away, and after getting tossed around my family members and friends I was put into foster care. At the first foster house I was abused, left to fend for ourselves basically except when my foster mother tried to have me agree to marry an older man by a few years when I was older. I was soon taken out of that house and put into a foster house in City 2, about 3 hours away from City 1. I am pretty miserable here as I have been picked on and have no friends, nor do I know anybody here the past 4 years I've been in this high school in City 2. I was pretty close to committing suicide in my freshmen year, but since I have a pet turtle with me, the only ""family"" I have since before my mother passed away, I didn't want her to be put into the hands of some stranger who didn't know how to take care of her, so I lived on.

&amp;#x200B;

About my current foster mom. We don't really like each other, we are very different and we always argue. There was an incident in my sophomore year with her when I forgot to pull the trash bin into the street, missing the garbage truck. When my foster mom got home, I told her what happened and she had a full blown meltdown. Crying and screaming how I'm worthless, I ruin everyone's lives I come into contact with and how I make everyone miserable. She said to me that she will send me right back to my social worker. I was shaking and crying begging for forgiveness because she was the only household in the county that would allow me to keep my turtle at the time. I didn't want to move any farther than my hometown. Before this, we were actually really close and we liked to talk to each other, but after this my respect for her dropped and I treated her as just a roommate. She has since tried to regain my forgiveness, but I knew she knew about my past and saying all those things would deeply hurt me, so as to say our relationship is almost nonexistent now. I want to move out as soon as possible and so does she. So I can't really stay in this house past late July. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to my BF, we have known each other since 2nd grade. My foster mother does not know I have a boyfriend. When I was in City 1 we were like childhood enemies but after my mother passed away, I visited him and all my hometown friends in my sophomore year and we met up again, forgiveness yada yada. We helped each other through really dark times and we are as strong as ever. I don't really talk to my hometown friends anymore as they have become incredibly toxic people and I pretty much ghosted them a year and a half ago after they made fun of my appearance and my BF, my past, etc. So my BF is the only one I talk to now. It's going to be our two year anniversary next week so hey, pretty nice. We are long distance but I visit him every weekend. He lives in City 1, which I love visiting so it's like killing two birds with one stone. We have had plans for moving in together for about a year. He wants to move out for not only being closer to me, much closer, but because he lives with his abusive dad and great grandmother, who hit him, throw things at him, scream at him, make him cry, etc. We both want him out of there.

&amp;#x200B;

In two weeks I am graduating high school in City 2 and have already been accepted into the community college in City 1. I plan to go to school full time but will be getting about $900 a month in foster care help for rent, etc. So money on my side isn't really an issue. I have been saving up thousands of dollars just in case. I have a part time job through my high school right now to help with more costs, and take online classes through some foster care programs that give money if you complete them. Along with that, I have been working myself to the bone doing extra chores for neighbors for extra cash. 

&amp;#x200B;

My BF, left high school in March because he graduated early. I told him he needed to start working if we were going to make this plan work. He didn't really start taking things seriously until late April, but nobody he contacted for a job called back so right now he is jobless. Right now he has been going around town looking for jobs in person but to no avail. I told him ""how are we going to move in together if we can't provide that we make enough money for rent or if you can't provide basic job stability?"" stressed out. We were originally going to move out in early June but now it is pushed back to late July and I told him I can't and won't push it back further. He has felt incredibly guilty about not taking things seriously before, telling me that he promised he would not let me go into another foster house (I would have to do that in order to be closer to my school in city 1). But to be honest I'm becoming hopeless with him finding a job anytime soon. And THEN it gets worse.

&amp;#x200B;

His father, a man with serious anger issues, is the sole provider of the household. The great grandmother gets money but not a lot. He works at a grocery store full time in city A and falls in love with the manager at said store. I guess that he has fallen so in love with her that they are moving in together IN JUNE, basically leaving my BF and the great grandmother to fend for themselves in the apartment with my BF still job hunting. He made my BF put his and the great grandmother's on the renewed lease this morning, so the dad will not be paying anymore of the bills or anything. I told my BF that he should not have done that, and that with this it will make it virtually impossible for us to move in together. To make matters worse, the dad's girlfriend has been trying to become ""the cool step mom"" to my BF even though my BF has expressed he does not want this kind  of attention in his life. She has texted him (the dad gave her my BF's number, I guess?) that she would take him to Hooters for my BF for graduating high school, offering to have my BF live with her and his dad, help him find a job at the store she manages, making my BF meet her kids, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My BF suggested that I move in with him. The thing is, his great grandmother HATES animals and HATES me. The only time she has ever expressed any sort of kindness to me was when I brought her cookies. Ever since I've stopped doing that she has repeatedly called me names, yelled at me in their house, called me a slut (for wearing a tank top on a 90+ degree day), talks shit to me in front of my BF's relatives when I'm over. My BF has told her to stop this but she just keeps doing it. I would hate to be living in that situation, especially since she hates animals, I would not want to put my turtle near her, especially since she's always locking my BF's cat outside almost 24/7 even though he gets his food inside, she yells at him, etc. I don't want her to scowl at me or yell at me for cleaning my turtle's 20 gallon tank every week if it's going to inturrupt her stupid spanish novellas on TV. I have told my BF my reasonings and he agrees it's not a good idea, so he's trying to find other solutions, but if he moved out, then the great grandmother would be left alone by herself, and we also agreed that wouldn't be a great idea either of course. Even though she's a complete bitch to me I am not about that type of abandonment. My BF's uncle is getting money to take care of her but he only checks on her 5 minutes a day, and refuses to care for her fully as he is an alcoholic, so yeah. I have to think about where this woman is going to go too, aparently.  My BF has not been able to save any money since his father would hide his social security so he couldn't get a bank account, and his dad and great grandmother would either go through his room and steal whatever money they found or would guilt him into buying things for them, so I pay for me and my Bf for bus tokens, food we eat, everything when I visit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My social worker offered me a program that goes through the county, where they help provide 18 year old and up foster kids with housing solutions. Mainly apartment complexes around the county. I have signed up for this program only as backup, but even a placement is not guranteed which I am terrified of. I don't want to be put in a group home where everyone acts like a thug and steals from each other, and where I'll be seperated from my pet. I have seen how those places operate and I would rather be homeless than go to a group home.

Reddit, I have been stressing myself to near exhaustion. I have been dizzy and throwing up constantly from the stress, I was too weak to stand on thursday and fell while I was cooking meat that I would eat for the next few days since I would be busy, my head has been pounding nonstop and I just feel like breaking down. My vision has started to become blurry.  I have not been able to see my therapist because I have been too busy working on projects from school, work, moving out, researching, trying not to pass out, etc. Any advice, especially relating to housing would be AMAZING. Anything related to helping my BF get a job soon and the situation with his apartment, because those two are the ones I'm really stressing about right now. THANK YOU!!!!

634,"So recently me and my girlfriend have been fighting. I did something bad(not cheating) and she still brings it up a lot even though she said she forgave me.

Usually we have a little argument then everything is okay but yesterday we had a pretty big fight over nothing. She still hasn't told me the reason and idk what I did wrong. She said it was because no teen boys take relationships seriously and that I lie to her even though I never lied to her.

636,"I  initially seeked therapy because I was literally on the verge of losing  control of myself. It really helped me, and I've come a long way since  that first session (I've been going to therapy every wednesday for  almost a year now.)

I know mental health  is super important, and I don't think I'm exactly ""cured"" yet, but I've  gained a lot of self-awareness and have also learned a lot of emotional  regulation techniques. The thing's that therapy is quite expensive and  my salary isn't that great. (I've been struggling a lot with my finances  for a while now).

I once brought this  topic to my therapist, and she told me that she didn't want me to quit  therapy, and that we could agree on some kind of ""loan"" (I didn't need  to pay her right away, I could pay her when I had the money). I agreed  on that, and ended up owing her a good amount of money. I recently ""paid  off"" that loan, but barely scraping by.

The  second time I brought up this topic up, she got a little bit mad, and  told me that I couldn't just stop going to therapy, because I still  needed guidance.

Okay, I get it, but  lady, I BARELY have enough money for my basic needs (paying other bills  with legal repercussions if I don't do it, groceries, etc.). And not  having enough money for my other needs really gives me a lot of anxiety  (I live in a third world country, lots of things are too expensive for  me)

I have a group of friends that I met up with once when we all got home, but since then I haven’t seen them. I still like them for the most part, but lately they’ve kind of been annoying me. They seemed unnecessarily meaner, and I found myself less connected to them. Part of it was that we hadn’t seen each other for a while, but there was something else. A bunch of them are hanging out at someone’s house tonight, and I just don’t feel like going. I’ve been tired from work and even busy on my days off, so I just want to have an evening to myself where I can chill and watch Netflix or play video games.

I just feel bad because I already backed out of something before. I had a legitimate excuse, but it seemed like I was flaking on them even though I wasn’t.

647," I attained a masters in archaeology a few years ago and have been considering going back to school lately. I've lost my passion for the field and my career has gone nowhere and likely never will. Plus my circumstances changed to where I am financially independent, so I feel like I can cut my losses and get out now.

I have been considering retraining into marine biology, but it's such a different field from what I have studied that I will probably have to take a bunch of undergraduate courses to even qualify for the masters. The only training I have that crosses over is my CMAS diving certification since I participated in underwater excavations.

I know they always say ""it's never too late to go back to school"" but ageism is a thing no matter how much we want to pretend, I have personally seen it in my archaeology studies where older students were often passed over and had fewer opportunities than younger ""fresher"" students.

So, I want to study again, I love the ocean and the more I think of it the more I'm convinced I should have studied this field in the first place, but I also don't want to waste any more time in school if I'm not going to be able to apply what I have studied in the real world (again).

Yesterday I witnessed the shouts of a woman that moved in a while ago across the street, while she was getting beaten and crying for help.  


To keep it short I will list the important facts:

&amp;#x200B;

* This took place in germany. So she/me can only act in the frame of german laws. 
* I dont know her nor had i seen her until what happened
* The police was already called when I got notified of whats happening
* I talked to her through the windows and her door. She never responded but I got her to leave the apartment.
* She was having a panic attack and asked us to leave and not call the police cause ""he"" would punish her.
* When the police arrived she refused any help and told them nothing happened, at least thats what the police told us.
* She didnt allowe anyone into the appartment.
* The agressor keeps unkown.
* She didnt wanted him removed from the apartment.
* The begging keeped going as soon as the police left the house.
* The agressor started closing all windows and roller blinds using the flash on his mobile phone. He switched all the lights of beforehand.
* The blinds kept closed for nearly 24hr after the incident. They are open by now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way of helping the woman through legal actions ? The problem here would probably be that she refuses to testify against the agressor.  
Should I file a report?

Should I inform any other instances besides the police of what happened?  
Is there any way I can bring her in contact with somebody that can provide psychologial help? (I guess the helping institution would have to contact her for her to accept it)

Besied legal actions I'd even be willing to have a talk with her. But as long as I'm not sure that shes alone in her apartment I wont go near it.

651,"So I’m a 15 year old boy, and I’m not really the type you’d think would do this kinda stuff. I get straight A’s, I never go to party’s, have never done drugs, and am too anxious to go out most of the time. But somehow, me and a friend of mine started planning on hooking up. We were both virgins, and I knew she had a crush on me. And aside from thinking she was really hot and cute, I think I might have had a little bit of a crush on her too as a person. But anyway, one thing led to another, and we were planning on hooking up. She was really into the idea of it, and we promised never to tell anyone. We made plans and I got to her house. We started making out for awhile, and then as things were starting to getting heated, she backed out at the last second. She just said “I can’t do this”. And so obviously I just said “ok” and we stopped. I was a little disappointed, but myself realized that maybe it wasn’t the best idea after all. And though I’ve known her and been close to her for years, I still think I should wait and do it with someone more meaningful. But that’s not the point. The thing is that now she acts different around me. She hardly ever goes up to talk to me, unlike she used to. She never initiates conversations over texts, and sometimes seems like she’s trying to get rid of me. I think that maybe in the moment she changed what she thought of me, maybe she’s just uncomfortable around me now (but knowing her I doubt that), maybe she’s thinking the same thing I am, and maybe its a combination of them. And of course it could be in my head. But I just want her to be friends with me again. We weren’t the closest in the world, but she’s still my friend. And although I don’t think of her like I did before anymore, every time I see her I feel this longing and I can’t get rid of it. Honestly I don’t know what to do. I think I should forget it. There is this girl that I’ve been really into for a long time, and now I’m finally thinking of asking her out.

654,"Hiyaaaa Reddit. I've come here under a throwaway for reasons which shall become obvious - I need some medical advice with my between-me-down-there. 

Context: 29 F in the UK. No major health conditions ever known of or diagnosed. 

Issue: it burns. Not just when I pee though - all. The. Time. It's hard to specify exactly where the burning is coming from but it's roughly I'm the urethral / clitoral region. Has been going on, daily, for nearly 2 years. I feel that I have to urinate more frequently than is normal too, especially at night, although the feeling of needing to urinate is there even when I have just been. 

What the doctors said: well, this will be a long bit. 
First, I went to my gp, female, who tested my urine for bladder infections. Came back clean. She put me on antibiotics anyway just in case. 

Went back a month later, issue still occuring. Test was again clean, physical examination revealed no issues. More antibiotics given. 

Rinse and repeat twice more and by now I have been on 4 sets of  antibiotics, no relief, losing patience. My immune system is fucked from all the meds and I get sick a lot. 

Went to visit a sexual health nurse at a specialty clinic. She repeated the urine test and also ran a test for STDs and did swabs of my urethra. No results found, back to GP I go. 

GP referrs me to urologist, (male), who gives me a cystoscopy and MRI, tells me nothing is wrong with me and the pain should go away in a few years. 

His basic explanation is that sometimes bacteria gets trapped in the urethral lining and sometimes irritates it causing pain. 

Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? At this point I don't even care what it is, I just want the pain to be manageable :(",27May2019,1

I wish I knew you were attracted to me.” I guess my point is I don’t know if I should tell him it was me. In my original message I told him I was okay if nothing happened between us and I am. But I’m now wondering if it’s better to stay anonymous.

661,"Lately it's been so hard for me to eat healthy because I've been tired and dont have a lot of down time for cooking, plus I've been super anxious, which is ruining my appetite. Lately I've gotten to the point where there are some days where I would just rather snack a little bit here and there rather than eat actual meals. This is stressing me out even more because the combination of snacks and being at an office job all day is making me gain weight. The problem is that when I'm stressed, eating whole meals feels like torture unless it's something super unhealthy like a piece of pizza or cheeseburger, but I can't keep eating that junk all the time. I don't know what to do when even the foods that used to make me happy either feel like torture to eat, or if i do manage to scarf it all down, I end up getting physically ill and spending a good portion of the day in the bathroom.",27May2019,1

Saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/btnr96/not_leaving_my_apt_for_several_days_starter_pack/?sort=top) on the front page. Made me want to vent this out (at the very least).

Typically I'll go to the grocery store 1 time a month ( if I don't get them delivered straight to my house)I have tennants and honestly I let them walk all over me because they are the only source of my income.

At around 16 I tried to play pro-gaming. I have a rare disease called Spastic Paraplegia. Although I use it more as an excuse; I can still walk, it's getting worse but I don't need a cane or anything. I'm 22 now. After I got signed to a team when I was 18-19 (Starcraft 2; for those curious) the lifestyle I was living was pretty much ingrained in my brain. I would get up and play video games for most of the day, eat in between and was prescribed copious amounts of adderall.

When I was 19 I had enough of it. I met a hippy chick and got in her RV and basically ran away to California. I live near Philadelphia so it was quite the road trip. I hadn't lived at that point. I hadn't known what the world was all about. To keep this short; It was .. eventful. I learned a lot. Some trauma to be honest; but I'd rather stay on track:

After that I came home and got engaged to a .. cheater. She walked all over me as most people seem to do and would constantly fuck other people without shame. She ended up leaving me after the fights got really toxic. Since then the years honestly have gotten so jumbled up. I've tried more relationships; but holy fuck I think about this one girl all the time. This girl that saw how introverted I was and accepted it yet I still somehow managed to destroy her trust in me and lose her because of it. This was about a year ago and I can't stop thinking about her. How do I think about somebody every single day for a year; when that person wants nothing to do with me..

Anyway, I didn't want to dive into exactly the events and how to get over THEM specifically. The main purpose of explaining all this is to .. admit? I'm extremely privileged. In fact, once my dad realized that fending for myself wasn't working out well; he bought a house and let me live in it / rent the other rooms for income. It's been a fucking year.

A FUCKING. YEAR. The best friends that I have are internet friends. The real life friends I have (don't worry I actually do have friends somehow still) seem to either walk all over me / take advantage of me / ... are just anything besides quality. I go for walks and runs, recently have been exercising a lot. I prefer to go at 5am so nobody can see how retarded I look when I walk/run. Besides that and the grocery store; I haven't left a quarter mile radius in one year. 99.9999% of that time being spent inside; in bed or on the computer. I'm writing a book and want to be a writer. But it's only contributing to my fear of the outside world.

I don't even go to the 7-11 up the street anymore because I'm worried that I'll run into my ex. She does go there. Now that feeling has expanded to everything. ""What if I see ""X"" there? What if I run into that person?""

I'm incredibly irrationally .. perpetually paranoid. But I'm not insane (yet) although that seems like the current trajectory. It's like I would rather rot away in this chair, rather than ever see myself happy.

TL:DR

Anyway; Like I said I just wanted to vent it out. It did feel good to be honest here because I usually pretend (lie profusely) like I'm a normal person and can keep up the act until the person realizes I never want to go anywhere. I'm only 22 years old and see myself on a terrible path to .. darkness. I can't even control my thoughts anymore. I know they're ""unwanted"" or ""irrational"" thoughts but they're completely involuntary and ALWAYS racing. It makes it incredibly hard to focus; therefore I've always been an underachiever and have no (good) school / work experience besides a GED and dish washing. Talking about this shit felt great because I'm never honest to anybody. Once the mask starts to slip I really do lose it. Everybody sees right through the act.

I'm dying inside and (serious emphasis here) ***never can let anything go.*** How do I stop living in the past? How do I move forward when I have done nothing but move backward for 6 years?

For example, she freaked out when I tried to fix the WiFi when she was gone for a weekend or she got mad at me when I told her I could deposit my check at the bank without her help.

When I have a goal or an objective to succeed or work hard on something (and most of these things are skills or talents you can learn), I can get there and become hard working and productive.

Finished up my first year of college. Became pretty depressed form the transition back home. In a long distance relationship, looking for ways to prevent the depression from effecting my relationship.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months now which may not seem like a long time, but I love him more than I've loved anything else in my life. It feels like the most healthy and mature relationship in my entire life. We live together over the school year at college, but over the summer I stay in MI and he goes back home to IL.

I am struggling pretty hard with being long distance. It bears mentioning that my main love language is touch so that makes long distance pretty damn hard outright, but that's not the bulk of my issue just an important side note.

Since the transition back home I've become depressed like never before in my life. I've taken steps to try and fight the depression, ie staying active and diving into my work. But I am having a really hard time shaking the feeling that its effecting my relationship. 

I hate the idea that because I am sad and lonely feeling all the time that I have become a source of negativity in my eyes. I try so hard to be encouraging and positive for him and the idea that I am annoying and sad to him kills me. 

 I feel like a source of negativity in his life and I live in constant fear that he will get bored or annoyed and go find someone else more fun. Let me be clear, he has given my no rational reason to think this. Its merely a result of my own insecurities that tell me I am ""not enough."" 

Because I feel this way I feel constantly guilty and afraid to share how I'm feeling with him because I don't want him to feel burdened with my problems. But on the flip side, he's my best friend so if I don't talk to him I'm talking to no one, which is equally as bad. And now I've got myself stuck in this dilemma. 

I've shared some of my feelings with him and he constantly tells me that he want me to share with him and that he loves me, but I still feel guilty as hell.

My questions are: How have you guys found success in long distance relationships? How do I get a handle the depression before it ruins my relationship?",27May2019,1
681,"Pardon my wall of texts.

My friend (Lin*), and I have a long history, I know all of her siblings and her family. We’ve known each other for more 10 years and I’m a godmother to her son. She has a very, “I don’t care” attitude towards a lot of situations. She’s almost like my best friend.

Her sister’s (Marion*) best friend (Jane*) became my co-worker. I left that job because it was quite toxic. People were willing to destroy people at all cost to get ahead kind of culture. I became quite a target so I quit but of course I didn’t tell them the true reason. 

Having some kind of history, Jane and I had a semi-close relationship as we have quite a lot of common friends and we’re within the same age group. We also talked a lot about how the toxic the culture is. I admitted to her that it was the real reason why I left. Jane shared my story to her boyfriend because that’s how relationships are.

Marion threw a small birthday party for her closest friends and her family.  Of course, Lin was there and Jane brought her boyfriend with her. 

At the dining table, Lin mentioned to me that my name suddenly came up. Jane’s boyfriend, whom Lin met for the first time, was telling my story and painted me in a negative light. She said, “I didn’t pay attention to him, I don’t like him anyway.” Lin didn’t even try to stop him from dabbling and let him go on talk about me even though I have never really met him.

I honestly felt hurt about the situation. Personally, I won’t let anybody talk down other people. And I would be even pissed off if it was about my friend.

Should I end my relationship with Lin? Or am I overreacting? I honestly feel hurt that she didn’t even try to stand up for me or defend me when I’m not around to defend myself. But that’s always been her attitude. She always just doesn’t care if it doesn’t hurt her directly.

I grew up in rural Portugal. My town was made of a small church, a local market, small stone houses and lots of land. The nearest school, supermarket, hospital etc was 20 minutes away by car, and it was still kind of isolated as it was all in the middle of the mountains.

When I turned 16 I moved with my family to Hamburg, Germany, a metropolis with almost two million citizens. Obviously it was a big shock. People here take *trains* to go to work (something I had only seen when I had to take one to get to the airport in the capital for the first time), there's a store in every corner, huge malls, subway stations and all that. 

The problem is that after almost two years, I'm still not used to this. I work perfectly with public transportation, I've turned street smart and enjoy visiting new places, *but* I've realised I'm always much more tired. I just think the city is too much of everything. Two daily hours of commute just to go to school and come back, ads being shoved in my face literally everywhere (and I'm not using literally the wrong way here), the complex bureaucratic system that makes you travel an hour to get to some office three times for one paper, loud noises that give me headaches, rude people who act all itchy to get the seat on the train, weird people on the streets who grab me by the arm to ask me for change... 

By the time I get home, I just flop on my bed and close my eyes, when though I know I really should study. When I lived in Portugal I had classes from 8 to sometimes 6pm and I still arrived home with enough energy to do my homework, go outside and play a little, and help my parents with chores.

689," 

This will be a long text, so i hope you guys have the patience to read it, it's really a troubling situation that i really only feel confortable talking about here, behind a virtual identity.

I dated a girl for close to two years. We were very happy together for the most part. However her life was always a mess. She comes from a poor and abusing family (her mother has a tendency to beat her, as does her dad to the point she has marks of this, and her family overall are a mess). Also, her previous boyfriend was and is (you will later understand) a complete and utter asswipe. Outside of me, and a couple of friends, she was in constant trouble.

As you obviously already might have figured out, she has never been able to find the courage to leave it all behind, because of fear of her mother and father beating her senseless and because she has no way of having financial autonomy, since all her family is poor, and because, her own words: ""I can't leave my family behind"".

During our relationship, she entered college with a scholarship, and that went well, in terms of her grades. She was also studying away from home, so things, in that regard, were at least, temporarily well. However, she became distant, and too focused on her degree (she's studying to be an actress). It was not something sudden, it was gradual but it wore on on our relationship to the point i did not want more part of it, even though i loved her. She understood my reasons, and we had one last night together and off we went to our lifes. We stopped talking completely and eventually i entered a state where it stopped hurting, even though deep down, i still liked her. I started seeing other girls, even though nothing resulted of it.

However, she texted me, half a year after our breakup, asking if she could call me, because she was desperate. I accepted her request and she called me and what happens next is absolutely brutal to understand. Her family's financial problems became even worse, and along with that she started having some health problems, which were expensive to treat. Her ex actually, once again (he stopped when we dated after i caught him doing that once), begun stalking her and eventually used her financial problems to his advantage and paid for all she needed, under the condition, that until she paid all of the value back, she was his property.

She said yes to that proposal and since then, from what i figured out from the call, they been having casual sex and dates and it will continue until she pays the debt, which considering her financial situation, will take ages. She was on the verge of having a nervous breakdown, because she feels completely empty inside and like a slut, during the conversation, i've never heard her voice like that. And i? I could not believe she sank so low, i was completely mind fucked at what i had just heard.

Still, i regrouped and tried to not shame her. I tried to tell her to quit college (or a part-time, so she can still study) for a year and get a job to pay the debt first, and then return to it. She said her parents don't allow her to work (because it reduces her scholarship value, which goes to her mother´s account), and will stop helping her if she does. I even offered, to help her gradually pay it, but she refused, saying it's a mess she and only she got herself into. I finally said she should go to the police, because what he's doing is blackmail, and he paid for it, but he has no legal grounds to contest she legally owns him money. And i added, that he could try something stupid afterwards, but a restraining order could be asked. She also dismissed that.

At that point, i lost my temper, and exploded. I brutally told her, that she has two options. She either continues getting repressed by the people she has in her life (her parents are actually ok with the thing she made with her ex), being a slave to them, and not living her own life, or she can go away, ask for social help for a bedroom in her college or social institutions, try to get a job, have the scholarship as well, and go to the police to report the situation. She said she can't leave her family, and i said ""what has your family ever did that was good for you?"". She said she understood my point but she just can't do that.

I finished by saying that ""No matter how much i loved you, i can't help you then. If you want to take action, i would go to the police with you so you wouldn't go through that pain alone and i would protect you from that asshole. But if you maintain that position, even if it pains me to so because of our happy times, i can't do anything, because you would just deny everything if i called the police. There's a point in life, when you really have to think only about yourself, specially when the rest only brings you pain like the one you have, think about that, maybe it will change your mind"".

I ended the call, and she has tried to text me since then (been a couple of days since the call), casually, but i just can't speak to her until she realizes what she needs to do. She's at the verge of losing herself for good. Her life was always tough, but i never imagined she could go so low.

What would you guys do? This ain't even about possible leftover feelings or not for me, this is about a person in a absolutely destructive situation, that was once my partner, and that is in serious risk of being a ""slave"" to everyone around her.

TL:DR: Dated a girl with a problematic background, broke up, she then entered a complete storm of more serious problems which culminate with her ex doing a classless proposal, which she accepts.",27May2019,0

691,"Me and my family have moved to this new house in South Philly at the end of 2014 and the house was brought by my uncle and one of my other relatives. It was vacant for a few years before we moved in and noticed there were alot of cigar butts in our backyard. From time to time, the neighbors across our backyard would sometimes threw cigar butts and chicken bones etc over the wall to our backyard. One time I happen to be in the upstairs bedroom near the window and saw 3 guys in their backyard smoking cigar and later on, one of the guy just looks around before he threw it over so after that they all went back inside immediate before I had the chance to do anything. I told my dad all about this and we waited until a guy comes out in the backyard in order to confront him about it. When we asked him about it and he said it was probably one of his friends who did it. To be honest, I do think it could be him and his friends are part of it but he just doesn't want to admit it. I don't want to call the police over such a small matter and even if the police comes, they won't be able to do much in this situation since we don't have evidence to prove they're the ones who threw it. They still do it now from time to time but not as much as it did before we confront them. One time I noticed they even threw a half eaten piece of bread all the way near our backyard door. Last night they threw a piece of glass, dirty paper towels and a glass marble and I already knew it was them no doubt. I want to know if I should do something similar by throwing it back to them and see if they like it? I don't want them to harass or bully us like we're somebody easily to be pick on or mess with. We're just thinking that we should probably do the same thing back to them if they keep doing it and to show them we're not afraid. So what do you guys think?",27May2019,1

695,"Hello all, 

\*All names are changed

I'm really torn about what to do with this situation. I used to work with these two individuals, Bob and Nancy. I have a good relationship with them, we're not close or have BBQs or anything like that, but we occasionally text or comment on each other's things on social media. Bob also happens to sell small drugs on the side, which is why my sister in law Jessica also knew of him and in fact I introduced them over a year ago.  Anyway, back in January,  Jessica, messaged me and said she felt bad about what she did. Turns out Jessica and Bob had a ""fling"" that went on for about 2 months or so (can't confirm as I don't know if they will admit the truth), but that it ended before or after the fact that Jessica's boyfriend found out about it through text messages he found on Jessica's phone. I confronted Bob about what happened, and he claims it was a mistake, and that him and Jessica were both in unhappy relationships and they realized that it wasn't worth losing people they loved. He begged me not to say anything to Nancy as they have a 4 year old daughter, and Bob had gone through some traumatic family events lately. 

So I didn't say anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to  April and turns out Bob had gone to see Jessica at work because he needed some work done (she works in a clinic). I messaged Bob again asking if he did that, and he said that if Jessica felt uncomfortable by it all she would have told him, and that ""the past is in the past"" and he has another appointment with his daughter at that clinic sometime in the summer. I told him to find another clinic to go to, as there are so many way closer to where they live and it's a 30 min drive just to go to Jessica's clinic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Nancy posted a picture that she is pregnant, due in a few months. I feel horrible and grossed out by Bob. That he was cheating on Nancy and then got her pregnant. I feel terrible I didn't tell her in the first place but I also don't want to ruin their family. There's possibility that he may have cheated with other women too but I have no proof of that. What should I do? Thank you for any input. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I used to work with this guy and this girl, who have a kid together and are now expecting another kid. I found out the guy cheated on his fiance with my sister in law 3-4 months before he got his fiance pregnant with their new kid. Do I tell the girl?",27May2019,0

699,"I'm getting married in October and invited one of my closest friends from college to be a groomsman. My fiancee and the groomsman used to be good friends when we were all in school, and he was actually the person who introduced us. Over the years, she's grown to strongly dislike him; she thinks he's selfish, inconsiderate, and annoying. She now actively avoids seeing him--he moved across the country about a year ago, which made that easier--and she has previously expressed on several occasions that she was not excited for him to be in the wedding party. That said, she understands that he and I still have a very close friendship and has always been accepting of that.

This past weekend we all stayed together with some friends from college at another wedding. Staying with him reminded my fiancee of a lot of the life habits/personality traits she finds so unpleasant, but things really came to a head at the reception. My friend traveled without his long-term girlfriend (who my fiancee and I both know and love), and at the reception, we saw him flirting with one of the bride's friends. We later learned from the friend that the two made out. As far as I know, his relationship is not open, and we've heard from others that this isn't the first time he's done something like that while his partner was away. When I asked him about it directly, he said that if they kissed, he didn't remember it because he was drunk, which I don't believe. We don't know yet if he is going to tell his girlfriend (my fiancee and I have both been thinking about doing it, which is another issue). Either way, we're all pissed at him.

My fiancee is completely out of patience after spending a whole weekend with him and hearing what he did at the reception. Yesterday she told me that she wanted me to take him out of the bridal party. She said that having him around on our wedding day will be a distraction and make her unhappy. I obviously want everything to be perfect for her at the wedding, and I'm not pleased with him either right now. But I still love him and know that being a groomsman means a lot to him, so I don't want to end up totally wrecking our relationship. I am leaning toward kicking him out of the party, but it just feels like such a shitty thing to have to do, and I wouldn't even know how to approach that conversation.

700,This is my throw away account. So I need advice with my relationship. I (20F) have been in a long term relationship with (22M) and we have a one and a half year old son together. We have lived together for a little over 2 years and we are currently renting our home. Before he and I started dating I was friends with this guy at work a now (24M) and I didnt think the (22M) relationship was going to be anything serious and I cheated on him in the first 3 months. I was intimate and had feelings for (24M) when I moved in with (22M) and knew it was serious I broke things off with 24M. I tried to be friends with him but he still had feelings for me and I just couldn't do it. About 2 months ago my boyfriend stopped trying in our relationship. He has also gained a lot of weight and I tried so hard to get him to be healthy but he wont. I'm not attracted to him anymore. He doesnt make my life any easier. I take care of him. The only thing he contributes to the relationship is money because I'm a stay at home mom. He quit trying. Rarely gave me attention. I'm not saying what I've done is excusable at all. But I messaged 24M. We started talking again. He has a child 5 months younger than mine. And recently split his 6 year relationship with his baby MoMA. We became intimate again. And I've fallen in love with him. He loves me and wants to be with me. Idk what to do. I care about 22M and we have this whole life and history together. But 24M treats me so much better. He makes me happy. We just have great chemistry. And 22M is always crabby. VERY VERY VERY lazy and throws a huge fit if I ask him to do one little thing. But we have a family. What do I do? Do I try to work things out with 22M or do I leave him and be with 24M? I'm so torn. I feel like I love them both. I care about them so much.

I've been attending online courses for videogame scriptwriters/narrative designers for 1.5 years, but it seems that I need more time to become a good one and find job.

I have SMM (2 months), SEO (2 months) and UI/UX design (6 monthes) courses near my house. I like SMM and UI/IX as Idea, but I've never tried it.

I also have really good online course on Motion design on my HDD.

I also tried to learn ruby on rails for around 2 years, but I failed because didn't have time and ended up hating too many coding (but I like to play around some Unity 3D courses).

* I really like scriptwriting but , it seems like forever to get a job. I also think, that I will try to proceed with scriptwriting in my free time even if I go another route, but I'm afraid to miss a chance to spend more time on this.

To be honest, I had a chance to become good at it much earlier, but I was afraid I just won't find a job.

*  I also like motion and UI/UX design ideas.  But I'm not shure if I'll last there for 6 monthes and more at home to get a job.
* Friends are telling me that I'll be sucessfull in SMM, because I'm creative in my writing and I have powerfull imagination.
* I like motion because I really like cartoons, anime and comics and it's a chance to do something like that. But I don't know how long will it take to become good.

710,"   Tldr-- into a type of porn that would definitely scare away anyone that found out. Can cut it off for sure and just watch regular porn.  But I'm concerned about the fact that I can get off to it in the first place.--


   So I'm a 26 year old guy, average in just about every way. Never been on a date or even held hands with anyone or anything even close to that. 

  This isn't to complain, only reason I mention it is to give a bit of context. Like many since I was a teen I've watched porn. Dating and sex have never even been an option for me. 

  The choice will pretty much always be either date or have a relationship with my parents and brother. The only girl they would ever approve of would be an extremely religious girl from thier church. 

  So that's pretty much my history with anything romantic / sexual. My concern is that I have basically in the porn that I watch. Definitely not addicted or anything like that, but I have for a long time gravitated towards Violent horror movie style ""porn"". 

  Doesn't even have to have any nudity sometimes. Just a lady getting killed.

   I have tested stuff to see if I'm going crazy, and no. I can still get just as much pleasure from a simple pic of a naked woman just like everyone else. But I can just as easily get turned on watching a girl drown in a horror movie.

I had a family drama that was very painful for the people in my family. My sister's son did something add and had to go to jail for 3 months. His actions did not involve any other people is just that he broke the law and had to pay for it. My sister was so upset and embarrassed about it she's never actually spoke to any of us in the family directly about it. The whole experience was horrible for her and her husband their kids and our entire extended family. 
I didn't tell anybody about it at all until recently because one of my best friends, her nephew is good friends with my nephew and best kind of got out.to my friends. I told my friend group about it but I told them that it can never be brought up in front of my family, can never be discussed outside our circle, and they should not bring it up at all. My sister would go ballistic if she thought we were all talking about it out in the open or gossiping about it.
Cut to this weekend when one of my best friend's husband runs into my daughter and says "" was your cousin really in jail?"". He heard this from his wife, one of my closest friends. My daughter didn't really know anything about it and didn't know what to say. When she got back to our family vacation home that night, my nephew was there- so she asked ""where you really in jail?""
My daughter asked me about it and we talked about it and I made it clear to her that she should not answer questions about her cousin because that's none of our business, it's no one else's business,and don't tell anyone.

As the title suggests I'm a boy and I noticed, that comparing to my friends, I find it very hard to date and so on.   
The problem is, that I don't know how to engage into conversations with girls I find cute, since at the places, where I am seeing such girls the most, they're often talking (understandably) remaining in their own circle of friends and I don't know how to naturally start a conversation with them, without being weird. 

Also, even if I manage to talk to a girl that I am interesed in, it's very hard for me to make them get interested in me. Now, don't give that crap, telling me to just 'be myself'! I'm only asking for advice that advice did not work. 

I wouldnt say, that the problem is my general personality, since I have plenty of (female) friends. I am also not really introverted and in general maybe just a little bit awkward (but, show me someone, who isn't :) ).

However however, shortly before the chat disconnected, I gave him my Kik username. He said he avoids social media but might download it if it means he could keep talking to me. So he said he wrote my username down. But we moved on from that topic quick.

I have the name of his band and their band's official Instagram. Only 2,000 followers, no crazy big song hits, doesn't seem like a lie.

Should I send a DM to the band's Instagram, asking if it seems like one of their members? I was going to describe how I was speaking to someone who said they were in that band, and the personal info they gave me that could be used to recognize him.

720,"I (18F) was adopted by a single mother and I only have a sister. I am straight and I get really awkward around guys (it doesn’t help that I’m an introvert either) and sometimes I feel like this might have a negative impact on dating. I don’t know if growing up with men around would have helped or not. Sometimes I wish I had a dad to also ask about dating and stuff. I am about to start college in the fall and just thinking about dating kind of stresses me out. I want to be able to but I just get so nervous and awkward around guys that I can barely carry on a conversation.

721,"Okay, so I have a friend, I’ve been friends with her for about 2 years now, and we ended up forming a really really close friendship, and by really close, I mean REALLY close. It started off with her in a vulnerable state, which made me want to help her, so I did. I spent a lot of time helping this friend out back when our friendship began and our friendship kind of grew on the principle of ‘you help me, i help you’.
We were in a larger friend group together from when we got close to about mid 2018. I’ve recently sort of rejoined that group, for them to tell me they think she’s been in love with me the whole time, and they are not the only people to say that. Many people around college who have just met us both also saw the friendship as intense, and a bit romantic on her side. I have a boyfriend, and have never romantically been into her. 
We have a history of arguing, especially in moments of her being highly emotional. But from the start of this year we have been frequently arguing. She is currently going through an emotional time (without particular reasoning) which pushed me away and has put a significant amount of space between us.
The space has made me realise a few things about the friendship. She dislikes it when I have other friends, and constantly attempts to meet me and be with me. She also likes to be physically close, say goodnight, good morning, I love you .etc. She’s been very clear about not wanting me to get a boyfriend. I told her I had a crush on a guy and she told me she didn’t want me to leave her, and when I told her I was getting close to my (now) boyfriend, she said some horrible things and it led to a significant argument, including telling me that if my heart was broken, she would be relieved, as that means I would come back to her. She consistently states she likes helping others, and very much relies on my lack of wellbeing, as she likes to help me. I’ve ignored health issues due to helping her, and as much as that is my fault, she has helped me indulge in self destructive behaviours, and has witnessed me doing so, without telling me to stop. She likes to control small elements of my life also, dictating when we meet, even if it isn’t ideal for me. She is hyper specific on what she wants me to do, telling me what colour my bedroom light should be when she is over, how much eye contact I should make, and how I naturally react to her jokes. 
The distance has done us both well but she is recently becoming very questioning on why I have stopped saying i love you and partaking in other routines we used to have. Her mental health is going downhill again and she has taken me away from my friends to cry on my shoulder, as she used to do every day. I don’t feel as connected to her as before, and when we go out it’s okay, when alcohol is involved, but usually there isn’t the same feeling as beforehand.
This friendship hasn’t really done me well mentally and socially, and as I am coming back from before and being more forward and honest with her I’m not sure what to do. Many people have said I should leave her, but I feel they will be biased, as they see how she treats me first hand.

724,"Hi Reddit,

I've run into a big issue with my in-laws and I'm not really sure how to help.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years ago my MIL decided that she wanted to get a divorce. It took a huge toll on the family, some of their kids were still living with them and she decided on a whim that she wanted to move out into an apartment with the youngest daughter, things were difficult, to say the least but I and most of the family decided to support the decision because we had seen how toxic the relationship was. Things started to take a turn for the worst when my very religious FIL  began to drink and really went off the deep end, he was severely depressed and talked about suicide on a daily basis. This was a really big deal for my wife and her family because none of us had experience with depression and immediately called the cops to get him some help. After being put into a mental institution he began doing a lot better and secured a job, he began getting really healthy and things began to get better for him, we all noticed that he was much happier and thought it was a success.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while my MIL decided to get back with her husband because he was back up on his feet and could provide her and the daughter that was still living with her, not sure if the reasons why she wanted to get back with him were healthy but they seemed to be doing okay for the most part. I've been a part of the family for 9 years now so I guess you could say I was really close to my wife's family, I care for them as much as I do my own and always want to be there to help them, but just recently my MIL decided to leave her husband again and has been acting out in very unhealthy ways. She too has begun to drink excessively and created a dating app for herself (Mind you, they are still married and haven't even started filing for a divorce). This has left my FIL in a wreck, he is now living on his own again and talking about suicide again. He has texted my wife saying that he has already planned out his death on the 31st and has already created a Will on what he wants to happen with his money after he's died. He's bought a gun so things are starting to seem very real at this moment, Whenever my wife tries to reach out to his siblings they approach him but he acts like nothing is wrong and says he doesn't know what they're talking about. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is pregnant and she cares deeply about her dad, It has been taking a toll on her because she wants to help him in any way that she can but things seem really hopeless and it's really sad to see her and her siblings go through this. It feels like what we've tried in the past helped but only for a little. He may be seeking attention but whenever we try to bring this up he completely shuts down and denies it. I understand that depression can make you do some crazy things and I can't imagine how hard it is for him to see his wife completely get up and leave and start dating other people so nonchalant. But he needs to get over this and he needs help. What can we do?",27May2019,1

726,"So about 3-4 years ago I my dad was diagnosed with cancer in his throat and lymph node in his throat. I was living at home at the time. 

My parents told me face to face and it was confusing and devastating. I knew cancer was bad but it was my first time seeing it first hand and I had no idea what to expect. It was horrible. The chemo and radiation therapy was brutal. He lost most of his hair on his head and he had to be fed through a tube for most of the time because he couldn't eat, it was too painful for him. I remember nights waking up to him crying because the chemo would make him vomit, since his throat was blistering and sore from the radio therapy that it would make him scream and cry every time he did. He had damaged nerves from the treatments and couldn't move his arms up. He missed out on a lot because he was too tired and unwell, like Christmas and birthdays. I don't think he realised but it really affected my mother too, she was running her own business, looking after us four kids and looking after him too. 

It was really traumatic for everyone. 

Eventually he got better and he was cleared from cancer and was put on watch incase it came back. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast forward to now** and the doctor has found more cancer in his prostate. 

I don't know much about it, because I found out late last night, but you'd have to assume that cancer going from one end of your body to the next isn't a good sign. 

My mum texted me last night and she said that they found cancer in him again and that she wanted to tell me quickly before I read about it on facebook... Yeah he posted about it on facebook before telling any of his family. 

My sister didn't even get the heads up text from my mum, she actually saw it on facebook first. 

Mum kept saying that it just a little one that they can take out and it's not a big deal... but how isn't it a big deal. 

I got a text from my dad this morning apologising that he didn't tell us first, that he wrote it on facebook because he hates talking about it, but now he's created a bigger conversation with hundreds of 'facebook friends'. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be selfish and let myself be angry at my parents, but I can't help but to feel extremely hurt. I live out of home now so I wont get to be with them as much as I'd like.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I respond to everything, and am I a bad person for being angry at my parents?

TLDR; My dad has cancer for the second time and posted it on facebook before telling me and my sister. Am I wrong for being upset?",27May2019,4

728,"Hey guys! Going on a first date with my boyfriend of two days tomorrow. I haven't been on an actual date before, so I'm really nervous and unsure of what to bring.

Right now, my list is
 * Wallet
 * Keys
 * Phone
 * Phone charger
 * Peanut butter cookies (his favorite, a small treat I made him today)
 * Gum/breath mints
 *Make-up (Color corrector, foundation, make-up sponge, ect. Just in the event I need to cover up a hickey.)

We're both the same age (16) and are meeting at a university in our town. It's really large and has stuff like a free open to the public art museum, and a lot of nearby shops and restaurants. We've never even kissed yet, and honestly I get super flustered thinking about it, so I don't think condoms are a necessity. In the unlikely event it escalates to that, I have the contraceptive implant anyways.

729,"So I have worked in fast food for 4 years, I'm 22F. Ive recently graduated from college with a diploma and currently living with my Mom to save up for a place in the city with my boyfriend by Oct-Nov. 

I work at Dairy Queen which is $14 an hour, but Ive been wanting something that is different than fast food. My mom lives out in the country so it is unlikely for me to get a job somewhere that relates to my diploma. 

I had a job interview for a new resturaunt that just opened in December, it pays $15 an hour, and I get paid for a full 8 hours plus any tips. 

However, the place is very slow. Like, very slow. It is hidden and not much people know about it. The lady said I would be allowed to even bring my laptop in. She has guaranteed me at least 24 hours a week plus more if I want some. My thoughts are to take the 24 hours but also work at Dairy Queen for 2-3 days. I think it will be good to put on my resume that I have worked as a Server, not only fast food. Plus the resturaunt pays weekly and it is $1 more. 

Any advice is appreciated. Is it worth it?",27May2019,2
731,"Few weeks ago I was at a bar and met a guy (I’m a female in my early 20s). I wasn’t looking for anything, this guy just caught me at the right time between me trying to find my friends who ran off to god knows where, and me calling it a night. At first he lightly grabbed me and asked me some question about if I had a million dollars and could get any drink at the bar what would it be. So we started from there, I figured why not? He seemed normal, his friends were NBA players (not that that matters, but for safety reasons made me feel a little better about who I was with as they were well known) and after a few minutes he wanted to break off and have a conversation of our own.

I agreed to do so, like I said, I figured my friends were somewhere around and hoped while I was talking to him they’d pop up somewhere. Our conversation was entirely normal and innocent, up until I said something funny and he physically grabbed my face and kissed me (no joke, both his hands were on my head). Naturally I leaned away, because to be honest I was pretty surprised. He jokingly called me out on it and I just told him I wasn’t into it. If you think that would’ve stopped him, you’d be wrong.

Conversation got normal again, the night was nearing bar close and he couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful he thought I was and even asked me if I was “ready to call it a night”. Without thinking I was like yeah forsure! (As in, I’m ready to go home alone, ha ha). And then I realized he totally thought I was going back home with him. Before we left I broke the news to him that I’d be going home alone. 

He wouldn’t take no for an answer. The look on his face was visibly sad. He actually sat me down at a table and tried giving me a million reasons to say yes (like how his flight leaves in a few hours and just needs a place to stay - right like I haven’t heard that one before 😂) I finally ended up making up some lie about how my friends needed me home and weren’t feeling well and he accepted it. He then started telling me how he wanted to make out with me “so bad” but wasn’t going to, but also that he would make sure he would kiss me again before the night was over... and he did. (To clarify when he said this to me we were interrupted by the bouncer to leave, so I didn’t get a chance to say no, I just started walking away and he ran up to me and grabbed my face again). 

He then grabbed my hand and pulled me outside so I kinda went with it?? Idk I was pretty drunk. I started calling my uber, and he could tell I was freezing so he offered me his jacket (which I said no) so he began warming me up with his hands on my arms. My Uber came, I left, and he sent me texts saying he hasn’t felt this way about a girl in a long time. He then found me on instagram and Snapchat and added me. I eventually told him I wasn’t looking for anything and to leave it. He was still snapping me until a few weeks ago when I decided to finally ghost him and stop acting nice.

Looking more so for opinions on this. Overall I thought he was a cool guy but his approach was almost a little scary. Sorry for the novel but I thought a lot of the minor details were important. Advice redditors, what do you think?",27May2019,0

742,"Anon bc my husband knows my UN.

So we moved together with my MIL to a new home about a year ago, in part because of her health issues. We found a place with an in law suite so we could have separate living spaces.  We have the main house with out two young kids and she has the suite by herself.

She shares dinner with us and goes to church with us. Outdoor space is shared, but we have some areas that are more ""hers"" or ""ours"".

When we first moved in together, I had the impression we would basically be living our separate lives under the same roof (besides dinners bc she doesn't have a full kitchen).  But there are a few things that have been getting to me and I'm not sure how to approach them.  I really don't want to be an a-hole about it.

One of the things digging at me is social stuff. Like if we have a party at our home, does mil automatically get invited?

Example, I'm having a bday party for my daughter, inviting her friends, the parents of whom I am personally friends with. We also do a family party as most ppl do, but does she get invited to the friend's party too bc it's her home too? I feel like a jerk if I don't include her, even if it's something I normally wouldn't invite her to if we lived in separate homes.

Another example, we just went to a party with church friends, our kids all know each other and us women have been hanging out separately (minus my mil) I got the invite to come with family. I tell my husband and he immediately asks if his mom can come. I feel like a terrible person if I say no, bc I can't express why I want it to just be ""our family"".

I do want to be just with my direct family sometimes, but I don't want to be hurtful or exclude her in something she would want. I don't feel like I can relax and be fully myself with her there, though.

I'm feeling super trapped now and don't know how to deal with this. Could anyone give me any input on how to establish some boundaries in a gentle loving manner.  She's a wonderful person and I don't want to be hurtful, I just dont think anyone wants a mil, no matter how sweet, in every aspect of their lives?",27May2019,2

He has disowned all of his other family (he's a narcissistic nutjob), so I am his one last connection to his daughter. I understand this, but it's not my fault and I don't want to deal those issues. 
I just want to move forward with my life, and he is not a part of it.",27May2019,2
752," I feel lost as a person as nothing really interests me, and I really don’t find the worth of putting effort into anything I do. It’s been about 5 months since my last relationship, and there’s been girls that have been trying to have something with me, but I just can’t. It’s not that I’m not physically attracted to them (because I am) but I just don’t find it worth it to put in effort to get back into a relationship. I don’t know what to do with my life at the moment, and I just need guidance right now.",27May2019,1
753,"I’ve been invited by some friends of mine to play a song with them in a school “talent show” and I accepted. I am kind of nervous because a) I usually play in front of 4 to 10 people and tomorrow I expect there to be about 150 and b) I am going to play the bass even though I am a guitarist (I know how to play the basics of bass, but I am still not that confident). Any thoughts or advice on how to chill?",27May2019,2
754,"So I'm an alumnus from my college but it's a small one and my ex-classmates and I heard about this case. They know that I was a victim of this professor for almost three years too. The story that this girl is telling is that this man tried to open her blouse to see her breasts. I totally believe her but she wants me to speak up about my situation with this professor when I was a student. The thing is that I never really cared about this stuff because this man knew that if he ever tried to touch me (but literally) he knew that I was going to beat him up and kill him, since I'm twice his height and weight.

I remember three specific cases that you would consider sexual harassment, but two of these situations happened outside school.

&amp;#x200B;

1- I was an administrative assistant and I was at my office. He showed up and closed the door. He put a lot of money on my desk and asked me how much was my cost for giving him a blowjob. At first, I thought this was a joke, since this man likes to joke about these things all the time, but then he started to handle me the money. I told him that on my dead body my lips were going to touch him. Eventually, he fucked off and left me alone. 

2- I was on a trip with my friends for a photography event and he went too. We stayed at the same hotel. He sent me a lot of voice messages one day around 4 am telling me with a lot of details all the things that we wanted to do with me. 

3- During the same trip we (the public of the photography event) went to the beach and he kept running after me telling me how sexy I was and trying to go topless for him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, at the time I really didn't care about this because I wasn't (and I'm not) afraid of this man. But now that this girl is being harassed too I'm preoccupied. The thing is that I don't know if I should speak up because I can't prove all of these incidents.

What should I do?",27May2019,0
755,"I (M17) have started my in car driving lessons. I was always nervous about getting into a car and driving because i feel like I will cause accidents. I went through my first lesson 10 days ago and it was fine but today was terrible. I was being told to do movements i have never done before and i messed up a couple of times for each thing because im trying to get used to it. My instructor who is usually nice was clearly getting very frustrated and annoyed and would be a little condescending. This made me more nervous and panic which made things worse. I hated it so much that i couldn't wait for it to end as we were driving home and when i got in my home i cried. I feel like I shouldn't drive after today but my parents want me to get my license. My parents arent aware of what happened today but I want to bring it up to them. If i can live the rest of my life off of buses or taxis i will gladly take that option because i dont want to do this, i dont trust myself.

757,"Hey guys, I’m Jake. I’m 23, just graduated from college and one week into a new job working as an account manager. This moment in life is supposed to be exciting because I’m young with some amazing opportunities ahead of me. I instead feel like my life has ended. I just moved in with my parents, who live in a state that I’m not familiar with, all of my friends are hundreds of miles away, basically everything I’ve known is no longer a part of my life. I know I’m likely feeling this way because of the change in environments, but fuck. I can’t ever remember feeling so hopeless. I’m usually upbeat and optimistic lol, it kills me to feel like this! I guess I’m looking for advice how to combat these feelings and make this situation a more positive one - thanks for reading😄

758,"The title pretty much says it all, Im just good at conversation. Maybe it’s because I have a pretty boring life go to school and be a mild trouble maker, go home workout and watch YouTube repeat. I also don’t have a weekend due to work. My main focus at the moment is football, I like to think I’m an above average player but I doubt there’s a future due to me living in such an extremely small area. 

Don’t get me wrong I have friends and damn good ones but I feel like my life is on repeat because we seem to talk about the same things all the time. I’m not an introvert just a quiet person, I don’t feel the need to talk but I find myself in awkward silences way to often. It’s not like I can go and explore the city because I live in the middle of nowhere like 20 miles from my town. I haven’t really found anything that truly interests me either besides football. I’ve considered quitting my job to make time for weekends but I just don’t know how to. The only reason I even have it is because of one of my best buddies. My friend just asked me if I wanted a job then told me to show up which is exactly what I did and I got the job. I can’t see myself quitting because it’s a family run restaurant and I have lots of respect for the owners. 

I know this is a jumbled mess but I just wanted to explain myself so you can get a general idea of me. (Not a writer btw)",27May2019,1
759,"So pretty much I dont know how to be interested in things anymore. A couple weeks ago I found myself becoming annoyed whenever my long term boyfriends would talk about his hobbies. I know it's not healthy and I know his hobbies are important to him. Since that realization I've gotten back into therapy and have restarted on some medication. My doctors told me that even though I dont feel sad my blatant dsinterest and having no attention for hobbies is an indication of depression. 

Not only for my boyfriend's sake, but for my own, I really just want some advice on how to regain interest in things. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm tired of doing nothing and I want to share my boyfriends joy in things.",27May2019,1
760,"I haven't been able to read books for years over my bitter envy of the authors. I've wanted to write a book for so badly, for so long, but every single attempt that I've made falls short, every single idea I have starts feeling stupid and not worth writing, or I don't have the talent to execute what I had in mind, or the sheer amount of research is too daunting and the subject far out of my reach.

 I've been trying for ten years, ten years trying to drag my own bleeding corpse over shards of glass to get writing done, but *I. can't.* I cannot write. I simply can not. I am unable to can.

 The only thing I ever wanted to do, the thing I thought was the thing I was good at, I cannot do it, and I can't forgive myself for it. I can't thrive or excel in anything else, either, there is nothing I could do better than the one thing that I am unable to do.

 How does one forgive themselves for failing at life?",27May2019,1
761,"I'm sorry, this is so TMI but it's a real concern. I'm also sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I can't find anywhere else. 

I (F17) have been curious about masturbation, in regards to sticking your fingers in your vagina.  I've never tried it and have been wanting to but didn't try it until tonight. My school hasn't taught us any type of sex education besides the risk of STDs and you should use a condom. They haven't taught us the anatomy of the genitals either, so I'm at a loss as to the female parts. 

When I tried masturbating, I could only stick one finger up my vagina and when I tried two, it would be uncomfortable and it would almost hurt. 

I'm completely ignorant on stuff like this and I just want to be informed. Am I unknowingly sticking them in the wrong hole? Is this normal? 

Again, I apologize for the TMI but I don't know where else to go or who to talk to. Thank you",27May2019,1
762,"I'm going to leave actual names out of this and just call my two ""friends"" Jack and Jill. I \[M21\] met Jack \[M31\] and Jill \[F23\] about 6 months back through another friend of mine. We hit it off at a house party one night and have been pretty friendly ever since. Now, I like Jack and Jill and would like nothing more but to be their friend, but as of late they've been getting pretty entitled with me. They don't own their own car and feel as if i owe them rides and even to the extent of borrowing my vehicle sometimes which is getting in the way of my personal life. The only thing they do is sometimes put gas in my car and occasionally buy me meals. Now this wouldn't be a problem if they didn't come off as so aggressive and straight up rude. When I do refuse to let them borrow my vehicle or I'm too busy to give them rides, they often send very rude texts or say rude things on the phone as if I've killed a family member or something, commonly referring to events in which they've helped me which have never happened nor have they ever done.I know this is probably an obvious case of manipulation at its finest, but i can't help to think maybe I'm just not being a good friend. Am I in the wrong? am I doing something wrong? and finally, should i just cut ties with them?",27May2019,2
