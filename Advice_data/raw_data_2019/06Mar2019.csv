0,"I'll start form the beginning. She and my father met and they got married not long after. I grew up in not so well off family but after my dad married my step-mom we've balanced out into what's about middle class. Now this wouldn't be a problem if she didn't bully my sister out of the house and so out of proper education. She constantly attacked her for ""being fat"" even though she was bellow weight for her height. While her youngest (Let's call him A) is well over chubby for his age. She has attempted to bully me but as I really don't give a whole hell of a lot about what anyone thinks about me this didn't work. She has now gone to extra steps to try and ground me at every turn she can. On top of that she turns a blind eye to her own kids when they do stuff that I just did and got in troubled for. Example: I ripped while biking. Got grounded, A rips his coat and refuses to tell hwo it happened he doesnt. This was the same day. So What can I do to get her to piss off? I've tried talking to everyone I know but they don't seem to give a damn.

2,"I haven’t seen my phone ex in 3 weeks. And today I went to school after lunch to find out about our nationals trip and see how low numbers are. Well my ex was in the music room when I arrived and she left like two minutes after I arrived. Then wouldn’t come back in and had others get her stuff from the music room. Like whatever right? Who cares, she wants to act like that then fine she can. But doesn’t that seem like an over reaction? Now keep in mind I never was abusive or anything. So its not like she was afraid of me abusing her. As that simply isn’t the case. But why would she just run out like that? And not go back in? Should I even care?  ",06Mar2019,0
3,"The guy in question isn't a people person, he doesn't talk at all when we're at work together - it may be because I only work 5 hours per week and either he's at the other end of the office or downstairs, plus he doesn't talk much to anyone...but it wasn't until a year of working there we finally got talking at a Christmas party. 

So we've been messaging on Facebook often, he'll often initiate the conversation. 

I was sure he was interested in me but maybe just shy, as I remember him checking me out when I'd come into work as a client, plus on one occasion when drunk he commented on my having nice legs and a good ass. 

But he's never made a move on me, a couple of very vague 'you could come to X thing I'm going to' (without any sign it'd actually be *with him*). Also he's twice now mentioned his penis, not in a gross way just kind of a weird TMI, but that's included telling me he's not well endowed...if you like someone you don't do that, right? 

To be clear I don't want him to be into me as I'm not into him, I just like knowing where I stand...as there have been too many guys I thought were being nice or who I thought could be friends, just to have them turn out to be only after one thing. ",06Mar2019,2

5,"My boss has suddenly stopped providing a work schedule 2 months  in advance and started expecting me to come in practically “on call”. As in giving me only 1 or 2 days notice or sometimes letting me know that I have to come in the night before.


I was told when I was hired at the end of last summer that the schedule would not always be “regular” as far as which days of the week, but that it was always posted at least a month in advance. 
That was only true for about the first 2 months. Then it started changing up with only about 1 week notice, and now I’m frequently being asked to work with only 1 day or sometimes even only hours of notice. 


I have declined a few times because I had already made my own plans for days that I thought I had off. 
Today I was given an ultimatum. I can either deal with it or go to part time and lose my health insurance:/. If I choose to go part time, I *would* have a more “set” schedule, my hours wouldn’t actually decrease by too much, and I’d save a little bit of money by not having the biweekly $25 that I have been contributing to the health insurance come out of my pay as well a saving a bit from not commuting as often I guess. 


I can’t afford to get health insurance on my own and I make too much to qualify for government assistance with that.  I know that insurance is important to have, but is it worth giving up the freedom of knowing when you’ll ever have a day off? ",06Mar2019,1
6,"I'll add a TL Dr at the bottom of the post. If you take a few minutes of your day to read this I already apreciate it and sincerely thank you.


I guess you could say that this subject is somewhat, common. In my life I experienced a bit what is like to feel betrayed, but not like this.

So a few months ago, perhaps in November or early December, I've met a girl on Instagram. I simply replied to her instastory because I found it funny, and for that moment going foward we started talking. We shared a couple of laughs by sharing memes etc, and even playing some games together with some other of my friends and also helping her out with moving on with her previous relationship and other personal problems. It became a habit to talk to her even if it was as little as a minute. As the friendship moved foward I purposed the idea to meet up. She doesn't live to far from me, so I thought it would be a good idea. Unfortunately a few things stood in the way, mostly because she worked and i was busy with college work. 

Fast foward to just a few weeks ago and she drops the bomb that she ""likes"" me. Or, in her words, ""I'm one of her crushes"".  Throughout my entire life, I've never had anyone that liked me. Was always the other way around. I was like a kid in a candy store, freaking happy. But confused because we never actually met. The only moments we ever had was playing games together and sharing memes and raccons (since she loves raccons). In my head, that's not enough to develop a ""crush"", at least in my opinion. Throughout an entire week, this entire idea stuck in my head. Anxiety kicked in like a mule and I could barely sleep at times. 


Fast a foward to a just a few days, and I found out that she's actually dating another guy. I was genuinely and utterly heartbroken. I sent a message saying that I'm going back away from her to have sometime to think and ""breathe"". But I don't think it matters.  What makes this situation so diferent and yet difficult is that there's a part of me holding on to the idea that she will send me a message apologizing of what she's done. But there's also a part of me that doesnt want to step in her happiness by sending her messages that she did this and that. I REALLY don't want to be ""nice guy"". 

While writing this, I think I'm going to severe any communication/friendship with her as this would give me some peace of mind, but again, I'm hesitant.

Would love to know your opinion and thoughts on this. Again takes for reading this far.


TL: DR : Met a girl. She liked me and I liked her. But she started to date someone else. ",06Mar2019,1
7,"Okay, so I’m into a variety of things like HTTYD and a few other things. But I can’t express my love for them and I always have to hide it.

At the moment I am living with my family and will for a few more years. Ever since I started becoming interested in different topics, which was at an early age, my older brother has made fun of me for it.  I can never show my appreciation for anything. Music, book series, movies, you name it. I can’t express my love for anything in the comfort of my own home. 

I’ve asked him to stop multiple times. I’ve asked my parents for help in the past. And yet he doesn’t stop.

He’s always making cruel comments and I’ve gone to the point where I’m changing myself to appeal to his likes so that he just stops, but he never does. Most songs I know are metal. I don’t watch TV or movies that he doesn’t like. My YouTube recommended feed is filled with videos and channels that I’m not interested in at all.

8,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was young, from the ages of probably 8 until 11, my older brother's friend (5 years older than me), would sexually abuse me... I think. The reason I'm not sure is that the details are fuzzy. I remember him performing oral on me, and although he asked, never forced me to give him oral. There was no full penetration although we may have tried it a little bit, but nothing to the extent that I can remember.   


The thing that is confusing to me is that it has never really bothered me, and it still doesn't bother me to this day. I consider myself pretty normal. I am straight, but not so straight that homosexuality disgusts me. (read: I've done MFM threesomes). I am pretty comfortable around both men and women and have never had any sexual issues in my relationships. I am mentally healthy and I am thankful every day for that. I guess I am looking for validation that it is okay to not have any issues from this. I never felt forced to do any of these things, and my impression was it could have stopped whenever I wanted to. Another interesting thing to note is that my cousin and I used to be sexual with/around each other at that same, and we're the same age, and I feel that that was just two kids exploring sexuality.  


I wonder if this was just an exploratory phase in my life, and potentially for my brother's friend as well. I guess I just wanted to hear opinions on the situation.",06Mar2019,0
9,"I need to build a small device for college and I have not been able to do it on my own. The college is refusing to let me graduate unless this project works. 

It’s a small device that includes hardware and software programming. I studied electrical engineering so I was able to build the hardware however I cannot program and I do not understand why the college is all of a sudden expecting me to learn this in order to graduate when there were no courses given on it.

Is there a website where I can offer money in order for someone to build this for me? I have been incredibly stressed about this and if I cannot find a solution they are making me retake the course and stay for another year.

10,"Sorry if this is a boring topic, but I’m absolutely heartbroken and feeling very uncertain. I’m a third year Education Studies student, and until tonight I was certain I’d be continuing my studies with my university into postgrad, doing primary 5-11 years. 

Some of my classmates are doing the same thing, and have already been accepted onto the course. We were repeatedly reassured the course doesn’t usually fill up, and applications are open until September where normally some spaces still aren’t filled. Today I went to send my application only to find out the course is full. I am not blaming those who reassured us. I know you cannot predict the volume of applications every year precisely. 

The problem is, now I feel completely lost. I thought about maybe becoming a teaching assistant instead for a year or two then going back to teaching. But by leaving my current university I leave all my friends, and my society which I founded and am the current chair of. I love the society with all my heart and I’ve put everything into it. I also don’t feel I’m ready to leave education and enter into a graduate job. 

It is still possible I could study elsewhere, but I have already signed on for a student house next year with my classmates who are attending postgrad at my current university and I don’t drive to travel to other cities. I could use the trains but I would probably have to get a second job to earn extra money for the travel costs. (I currently have a job where I only work every other Saturday and full time during university holidays). Is it worth it? I am afraid I would end up completely over-exerted. 

My other option is to get an unrelated full time job in my current university city and work for a year to pay off the rent on the house I have already signed up for, then reapply earlier for the postgrad course next year.  

This is probably irrelevant but my dream is in the future to open my own vegan bakery. I don’t know if there’s something I could use this year for to support that goal while also making enough money for rent, but in case there is I thought I might as well include it. 

Thank you if anyone reads this. Sorry again it’s not more juicy or interesting. I just feel so disappointed in myself and am trying not to overreact and give up. ",06Mar2019,1

12,"There are 5 of us guys in our group, (me, Ryan, Blake, and James are 18), (Matt  is 19.) (not their real names for the sake of privacy or whatever). 

My friend Ryan who I’ve known since pre school had been acting weird for the past 5 months or so when we were at our friend Matt’s house. Matt has a younger sister who is 17 and Ryan would almost always talk to her whenever she was around and direct his attention toward her all the time. Naturally as friends we gave him shit for it as a joke but we wouldn’t ever take it far, like if we had some disagreement someone might be like “go talk to Matt’s sister” or something along those lines as a “comeback”. 

When Ryan would be talking to Matt’s sister I never really got too annoyed but my friends Blake, James, and Matt even  got annoyed and they were kinda irritated about it. I never really saw it as Ryan hitting on his sister, I just thought he was being nice. Blake and James thought it was clear he liked her and kept Telling me that you don’t hit on your friends sister, it just seems like something you should avoid especially in a close friend group. Which I agree with but I still didn’t think much of it. 

Within the last month Ryan came forward to Matt that he had feelings for his sister and told him that they basically dated for 3-4 months behind his back and the reason Ryan told Matt it all was because it was all over and they weren’t seeing each other anymore. Matt wasn’t really upset he was just shocked that they actually liked each other. The only other person Ryan told about this was James. Ryan didn’t say a word to me or Blake. Me and Blake found out because we hung out last week and Ryan wasn’t able to hang so James and Matt told us. Apparently Ryan even told James and Matt not to tell me and Blake because he thought we were “immature”. 

Ryan always brags about stuff and he’s VERY judgy about everything. He would always give me and Blake shit because we thought a certain person a grade below us was hot, he gave us shit because the girl was 17 and we were 18, I get that I’m legal at 18 but I never did anything with this chick, I just thought she was pretty and Ryan didn’t even think that was ok. Now he goes and dates a girl who is 17.... and it’s our friends sister?! And I’m not trying to be mean but Matt’s sister is by no means attractive, and he constantly judges who we think is pretty. He can think who he wants is pretty, I’m not gonna judge him, and I never will, he has his own taste and I have mine, for years I’ve constantly put up with him bashing me for not thinking girls with huge tits and asses are hot and I’ve never said a word back. Now he goes and dates someone underage after all the time of giving us shit. 

I don’t know what he was thinking to think I or Blake would have judged him for liking a certain person, we would never do that if something was serious. The reason we all gave him shit when we thought he liked Matt’s sister was because we all actually thought it was a joke. If he came to me and seriously told me it wasn’t a joke I wouldn’t laugh, I’d take it serious. 

Ryan then basically found out everyone in the group heard about it and got all mad at James and Matt for telling me and Blake about it. Our group is very close, you tell something to someone, you tell it to everyone, I don’t know why he expected it to stay a secret. Me and Blake talked to Ryan the other day about it and it was pretty quick conversation he just asked if we “had any questions” and we were like no and that was it. Only other thing he said was almost a demanding “forget about it and don’t talk about it because I don’t want to hear it”

Now Ryan hasn’t even changed a bit, he still is giving me shit for thinking certain people are pretty and constantly judges everyone, (I feel like a lot of it is at me actually, because I usually share a lot between us friends). Recently I found the “nofap” subreddit here and joined it. To keep it short, right now I’m a week free from porn and masturbation and I’ve never felt better about my appearance and had more confidence in myself in my life. I feel great. I share this with my friends and everyone is pretty supportive, they all basically said “hey good for you man, but that’s not something I’m gonna do right now” except Ryan. Ryan decides to call me a “fucking idiot” for deciding to quit porn and thinks there’s no benefits, he thinks I’m making stuff up. I never asked him to quit porn I just told them I was on a week free from it and he decided to be an ass about it. 

Is there anything I can do to confront him about being an asshole and constantly judging me and the other friends on certain things? What could I say?

I personally don’t think I’m acting immature at all in any of these situations, and I personally think it’s all him, but I would like some insight into what others think. 

TLDR; friend went behind our groups back and dated someone’s sister, only told a few members in our group expecting no one to say anything. We all found out because we’re all close and he gets mad, asks if we have questions and then basically demands us to forget about it. This friend constantly judges us based on who we think is pretty and try’s to acts like he’s way more mature than everyone when it comes off as him being an ass, then proceeded to call me and another friend immature with no explanation. Want to confront him about it as it’s really running me the wrong way. ",06Mar2019,2

I should also add - I care about my mods, and i do not wish to hurt or jeopardise their positions in the team for any personal gain.

24,"summary: (my BF is now fine) but police officers got involved when looking for my missing Bf who threatened suicide and took off, we find him and officer start mocking him, making fun of him and calling him a chubby chaser. 
 
 So the other night there was a snowstorm here in Connecticut, my boyfriend has been out of work for about a month and was feeling really upset about life and decided to take off (out of the house) at about 10:30 pm. 
An hour later I looked out the window and see his truck was still in my driveway I was surprised but I didn’t think too much about it and assumed he had just gotten picked up by his best friend.  
I text him once, called him once and discover his phone was off. 

Not that this is “typical” behavior, but every once in a while he has the blow off some steam and does that  so I didn’t think too much about it. I go to sleep then at 2:30 am I get a long text message from him saying basically  ‘he’s been up walking in blizzard the whole time, still walking and “ gone too far to walk back tonight “, and if He might just kill himself tonight’ 
 I Immediately try to text him and call him, but he had switched his phone back off. 
I got really worried and imagined him freezing in the snow, he had his truck keys with him- so I grabbed some blankets and jumped in my car ( a rear wheel 2 door mercedes = terrible in the snow. ) 
I started driving toward his friends house on the main roads looking for him thinking he might’ve tried to walk there, it’s almost two towns over but I don’t know what else to do, and I can’t just sit home after getting that message.
 I Made it to a few streets away from his best friends house and my car got stuck in the snow. Not five minutes past and police officer #1 pulls up behind me puts on his lights. It was a young guy and he was really nice to me, I explain to him what I was doing I was worried about my bf and that’s why I was out there in this weather, he pushes my car out of the snowbank. I asked him if he seen anybody matching my BF description walking down the street and says no and he’s going to see what he can do to help.  Officer tells me to leave my car where it is, get in the front of his SUV with him and we will drive around and see if we can spot my BF.  Officer #2  shows up to drive around and look and #3 show up to guard my car because it’s in the road. 
About half hour goes by of us driving around and My BF turned his phone on and text me he was sorry and he was at his best friends house.  Officers said they have to check on him because of the situation so we drive to his best friends house and asked him to come out. Officer #1 &amp; #2 talk to him and told him that they need to have him brought to the hospital to get a Psych check because he mentioned he was gonna kill himself a few times on the phone and earlier that night, so they put him in the back of Officer #1 suv and they tell me to go sit in the front passenger seat of Officer #2 suv while they talk to him and wait for ambulance. 

I guess during this time officer#2 started cracking jokes about how the first officer was helping me And being so nice to me he said “ I see you, I see you dude your a C.C.” Officer#1 was like “ what’s that mean?” and  Officer #2 was like “your a chubby chaser” and cracking jokes about it telling my BF “you really need to get help dude”, in a mocking way and not helpful at all, and making all sort of comments making fun of by BF for this situation. 
 Meanwhile my BF is in the back seat of this car that there talking in and getting really pissed off that they’re cracking jokes, laughing And talking like this right in front of him. (Officers about the 30,  same age as us) 

I found out about this and I think it’s just so wrong, I don’t know what to say.  Is this something that could report officer #2 for his outrageous behavior? It has to be all recorded on their body cams, I just can’t believe that he would be making fun of somebody who is sitting there because he talked about killing himself.. that kind of stuff would could send the wrong person over the edge. I don’t know if he was trying to make him snap so they can arrest him on something? 
*My bf is fine explained at the hospital he was just saying that out of emotion and didn’t mean it, so he’s back home and fine. 

I could let it all go, I just don’t think that’s the sort of thing he should be doing on the job or continue to do. Opinions? Thanks ",06Mar2019,2

Back when I was a Freshman in high school I used one of those stupid “ kik friends “ apps to honestly help discover my sexuality some and talk to some guys. as a baseball player my entire life I ignored every guy before deleting the app except for ONE, who lives half way across the country but is still one of my closest friends and most important people in my life.

This friend is a college junior, I’m a HS senior ( no biggie ), ( for me personally ), and he on the app a few years ago found another guy who he fell in love with. This guy and him talked for years, they face timed every night , helll they even dated for 5 months , but now it’s just crippling him.

This guy ended up getting a boyfriend irl , and he has my friend wrapped around his fingers. My friend isn’t an emotional type but he has called me balling, he’s not feminine either.. 

This guy he loves claims to love him, and the guy he is with irl. My friend has been sending him carepackages , love letters , he truly thinks this guy is the one, and he feels so happy from this guy, who is hurting him so bad.

This guy psychologically hurts my best friend, he is even the cause of my friend to be on a literal Xanax prescription because he gets so depressed thinking about this stupid guy ( no offense random guy ), and It hurts me so bad.

My friend is now suicidal, at a loss, goes to therapy; I have 0 idea how to convince him he needs to separate himself. I don’t know what to tell him anymore - 

Summed up: my friend loves a guy who is essentially mentally tormenting him and has a boyfriend irl, yet he claims to love my friend.

WHAT SHOULD I DO?
I care about my friend so much and I have been in physical pain witnessing this unfold on a daily basis , it’s all I can think about. ",06Mar2019,2

At home its the worst, I don't get any attention, my whole family ignores me unless to yell at me. I get all As and they dont even care. All they care about is my 12 year old brother.

34,"I am a shift manager at a restaurant and my bosses subscribe to the customer is always right. Its killing employee and especially shift managers morale. We get cussed at and screamed at and called awful names, threatened, some of us have been assaulted. And we are always in the wrong when these customers call corporate and complain and lie. 

I have been called a c*nt, a bitch, a fata$$ and other things, screamed at, interrupted, threatened, had a woman try to shove her phone in my face and more. And I'm told to apologize to them, talk calmly and politely and give them whatever they want. Free food? Give as much as they want. Money back? Give it to them. Remake the order? Right away sir or ma'am. 

This leads to the same customers repeatedly scamming, lying about service, and abusing staff. And we just give more and more to the same customers. Then we get yelled at for issuing too many coupons when the customers don't bring them in, too much free food going out, too many manager coupons, too many canceled orders, on an on.

We're not allowed to hang up on screaming cursing customers. We're not allowed to tell violent and threatening people to leave. 
Most of these people won't even listen to us when we TRY to talk to them. I tried giving a woman her money back the other day and she just kept screaming at me and cutting me off and lunging at me. 

Almost all these customers will call corporate and complain about us. They lie and say their deliveries never came, that employees never told them it would be a wait, that employees cussed at them, whatever. And corporate always believes them, gives them MORE free food and us managers and employees get written up. 

I can't afford to quit. I'm the sole provider for my family. Jobs are very hard to get in my area. But I dread going to work, I have started having panic attacks when customers raise their voices, I cry in the bathroom at least once a shift, our store can't keep good employees, and mangers don't care anymore because their is no point.

My name is Max, and I'm a sophomore in highschool. We get out of school May 23rd but it's not coming soon enough. I've been working my ass off day and night trying to get my grades up and I'm stuck with straight C's. The only teacher that gives a fuck and tries to help is retiring this year.

I'm tired of spending my nights doing work that doesn't help my grade. I'd rather be doing things that actually help me, like relaxing, sleeping, talking to my FAMILY.

I don't know, I'm just so frustrated with school. People at school don't like me anyways, and I'm tired of the stress of it all. I'm tempted to drop out with my parent's consent, but I want a second opinion.

42,"I recently tried to make a career switch and left my lead position in cosmetic retail. This time last year I was fired from my cosmetics job at shoppers drugmart. I had applied to another cosmetics job and started a position part time shortly after, and worked my way up to lead in a matter of months. Throughout my time with that company I received little training, worked well over my agreed hours at part time status, and when I moved to lead was my only employee for months. There was no work life balance, and I had to make a move for myself. 

I thought office work would be a more suitable environment; not standing for 9 hour shifts, having regular hours, not selling products I don’t really care for, and having time on my hands to work on skills I wanted to develop. I was hired at a local small business where I not only had several unrelated tasks on-top of admin work, but I had to teach myself how to do all of these tasks. My boss had no idea how to do any of it, and the current admin who was training me came in maybe once a week for a couple of hours even though I was hired under the understanding that I had no previous experience or training in the field. 

This job absolutely sucked, but it gave me one thing that is impossible to find for someone of my age and skill set; a set and regular schedule. After pouring my soul into teaching myself and executing to the very best of my ability I was let go on a Monday morning, conveniently after I did the T4s for all the employees. I had failed at trying to get out of cosmetics and retail. 

I am an esthetician graduate, and that’s probably the hugest mistake I’ve made in my life. I had lost the love for all things esthetics long before I graduated. I had applied to everything and anything consecutively, that wasn’t cosmetic retail. I even applied for esthetics positions and surprise, I got no calls. I applied to a couple cosmetic retail jobs, had an interview within two days and was hired immediately. 

I genuinely feel so depressed to have failed in my attempt to switch careers, and am trapped in cosmetic retail. I had my first day of training today and the entire time all I could think was how much I didn’t want to be in the store, how much I don’t want to be talking about skin care and cosmetics, and how much I hate the position I am about to enter once again. I feel incredibly lost, and honestly scared for my future. I feel as if I have just rinsed and am about to repeat last year again..

Nothing against it, But driving a forklift and being just another lower middle class citizen isn't for me. I want to go to school, get an education that can not only help me, But others as well, and it feels like my dad just doesn't care anymore. I told my manager about it, And he fully supports me, But it just feels like my dad is the complete opposite. We don't talk as much, And when it is, He end the conversation with ""so how much longer"" referring to when I leave. It hurts and maybe I'm just over thinking it, But I don't know. 

I got about another month and a half before the new semester starts, and I don't really want to quit until about the week before, which is also something my manager knows and agrees with.

46,"

I apologize in advance for the format because this may seem like a rant more than anything but I would love to see your opinions and solutions to my problems.

It seems like I’ve been in such a rut lately and I can’t seem to get out of it. I’ve struggled with MDD (major depressive disorder) for over 9 years and it’s really weighing down on me lately. I’m 21M from the Midwest, and I am an introvert which makes everything much worse. Let me start by saying I love being at home because of my introversion but it seems like it’s all that I do now, I have 0 friends in real life to hang out with and I am extremely lonely. I have a ton of acquaintances from work and school but no one ever seems to want to hang out with me outside of these places and I don’t seem to know why, because we have some great conversations in person. Along with that it just seems no one is interested in me, I try to put myself out there and get numbers from women, (I prefer to talk with women because of more meaningful topics, opposed to just sex and vapes from what I’ve gathered from college dudes in my area). I text a few of these women and ask them to hang out but my texts always get ignored so I’ve given up all hope in general, and let me say I want nothing from these people except conversation, and fun. 

Another thing I struggle with heavily is I just hate myself, and I really can’t help it. Every time I look in the mirror I’m truly disgusted with what I see, people say “just try self love” but it’s not that easy. I’m overweight but still have my attractive features, but I guess that isn’t enough. 

I really genuinely try to be as happy as possible but I have no motivation to do anything, and I’m struggling with finding my purpose. Every now and again I’ll catch myself in the moment of exhaustion questioning myself with things like “why the fuck am I doing any of this”. I work 4 days a week Fri-Mon for about 25-30 hours and go to school 5 days a week Mon-Fri taking 16 credit hours and I haven’t had a single day off in over 8 weeks and I really have no idea why I’m doing any of this. I think I choose to overwork myself subconsciously to avoid being at home alone with my thoughts because when I’m busy my depression tends to fade a bit. Although I may have bit off more than I can chew because adding this kind of school/work load is extremely unhealthy. I am completely burnt out all of the time, which leads to little motivation for studies because I would much rather sleep. 

I don’t know what I’m doing anymore guys. I know that every day is a blessing and all of that but my mind won’t let me be happy. 


What can I do to help myself get out of all of this? How do you find friends that actually care? Where do you find motivation? 

It feels good to get this off my chest because I have no one to tell any of this too. 

Thanks in advance people.

I’m a medicine college student and I have/follow a nice routine I have myself of studying/classes etc...

While I was studying cadavers in groups of small people (~5 people) this girl was always around...She stood near me and quietly payed attention to us studying the cadavers. She was so smart, quiet and polite. 

No one in the group knew her, she was new to everyone in the small group. 

I caught her looking at me several times, this just makes things even better because since before I already was amazed by how pretty and smart she was. 

She has lovely short hair, a beautiful smile and a very nice piercing (bull type piercing). 

Idk what it is but, wow I’m dying to know her more damn shes beautiful... but the thing is, she’s in another group of classes with other professors. I’ve never seen her around the campus until today that I changed my routine, meaning, if I stick with my routine and schedule I will never see her again. 

What should I do? Go again to this study session on Tuesday and miss class again to see if I can talk to her again and maybe ask for her #(considering she might not be there because it’s a totally optional study session) or forget about her?

49,"Hi everyone,

So, as it says in the title, my mom got herself wrapped up in a pyramid scheme and I'm trying to think of a way to make her see the light. She just got started with it, but has taken the full plunge, posting all kinds of nonsense on Facebook about it.

Last month, she told me that a relative I've never met (I know who she is, however) set her up, and that she was going to start selling Hempworx CBD oil from home. Immediately, this was a red flag for me, but my mom seemed excited about this ""opportunity"", so I did some research on it as I'd never heard of it. It's a My Daily Choice product. Holy shit. 

Now, my wife takes CBD oil (not this stuff), and according to her, it does seem to help with some things, but the advertising that my mom has been instructed to post on Facebook is incredibly fraudulent, terribly ignorant, and potentially very dangerous. It goes so far as to claim that Hempworx CBD oil will help cure your diabetes, cancer, and multiple sclerosis, that CBD occurs narurally in breast milk, and pictures of people claiming that they stopped taking their prescription meds and replaced them with CBD oil. Not only that, but why do people take pills just because the doctor (who only has YEARS of fucking schooling and medical knowledge btw) said so? CBD oil is totally better, just trust them.

If it's not obvious, it's only been a month or so and I am already well over this nonsense. You only have to have an ounce of common sense within you to know it's all bullshit (sorry, mom). I know my mom has no ill intentions with this and is just trying to make money as she's currently unemployed, but this has the potential to get her into some serious hot water. I want to talk her out of it before it gets to that point, but I'm not sure how to do so without asking if she's out of her fucking mind. Do any of you fine folks have any ideas as to how I can approach this?

I'm going to start putting together some research to shoot down as many of these claims as I can, hoping that she'll read into it. I don't mind alienating my family, we're really not close, but my parents are an exception to that. I don't want to be a dick about it, but I need to get the point across. Then after that is all said and done, I'm gonna have to find this relative I've never met and kick her god damned ass. This hasn't been good for my temper haha.

I was strongly opposed to it and told her that I didn't think it was a good idea so that I wouldn't judge her decision.

So I'm gonna do my best to explain this in detail here.

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years and she is currently pregnant 4 months now that's not a bad thing but to me it's become an issue because the same month she conceived she also went out to meet up with her ex at a bar and told me she kissed him multiple times that night and got a taxi back to his house, now here's the real part where I really want to believe her. 

She said when she got into his house she said reality hit her (mind you she had almost 2 bottles of wine this night) and she wanted to leave straight away so she went to the bathroom and ordered a taxi home he came up while she was leaving the bathroom she went downstairs and I belive waited  for the taxi and him to walk her out I haven't actually asked her what happened inbetween, so she left that night and rang me right after (I was working night shifts) she told me the friday when I actually found out myself through texts to her cousin now I shouldn't have snooped through her phone but I got a hunch and was glad that I did so I go through her phone and her cousin was asking things like who are you going to pick ""me"" or ""ex"" and she said she thinks she's chosen me and all the like now bear in mind I found this out on her phone and still didn't know it was her ex. So I woke her up and confronted her and she lied saying it was at a bus stop and someone tried to kiss her and it lasted 2 seconds, so that was a fucking lie haha so 2 weeks go by and I found out by punching a strange number she texted on her phone into my whatsapp and had seen it was her ex, I confronted her again and she had lied again by telling me that it was her ex that showed up on a work night out and said the same thing about him trying to kiss her and lasting 2 seconds! Another damn lie. I was ready to break up at this point folks but I didn't and I didn't even know she was pregnant at this point too.

So another week goes by and we find out she's pregnant and I am all over the place in mu thoughts and emotionally, 2 weeks go by and after a chat and a vent about this with my brother he tells me to ring the ex so I do, he tells me the night was arranged and it was her and his friends out in a pub not a work night like she told me it was, now I know everyones first thought is a pre-natal paternity test but they're are very costly and I cannot afford them but she can and she is so adamant that the baby is mine that she is offering to pay for them and everything but part of me doesn't want her to, I'd just like to hear everyone elses weigh in on the matter, do you think I can trust her to not cheat on me again after the pregnancy?

- extremely far from family (from Cali)
- no beach
- difficult finding a place because they prefer tours of the rental (basically just want to meet their potential tents first), and committing to a flight with a small chance of approval is not financially smart

**OKLAHOMA**

Pros:
- Cheap cost-of-living
- My sister is here (and she’s due with my first nephew in a couple of months)
- has some city life
- closer to majority of my family than Georgia

Cons:
- very few vegan options
- no beach
- not as cheap as Georgia
- difficult finding a place because they prefer tours of the rental (basically just want to meet their potential tents first), and committing to a flight with a small chance of approval is not financially smart
- my SO does not want to move here

***

Unfortunately, I can’t stay in Cali for financial reasons (plus the somewhat doable rentals are in incredibly small towns, which is a problem for my SO since he doesn’t work from home), but I wouldn’t mind moving back when my income doubles so I won’t live paycheck to paycheck or risk having to take out payday loans.

63,"First off I want to say- first time posting here. Hopefully I do everything right. 

I am a 17 year old male in highschool in South Carolina. I am homeschooled, but go to a homeschool Co-op for my classes where I am taught by teachers who teach classes at the technical college near me. 

I have been looking at a Christian Gap year school I want to go to. I have prayed about it and I think it’s a great option. (It also gives 36 college credits throughout the year). I want to go to a Gap year school because I’m not 100% sure on what I want to do. I have an idea but I truly think this school will help me. I applied and interviewed with the school thinking I could use FASFA with basically a full Pell grant to help pay for it. 

My father has been out of a job since August and we assumed we could probably get a full Pell grant with the financial situation we are in. He has worked for UPS and Uber making some money, but we basically went from making about -$125,000 a year to -$1000 maybe a month. Our church has basically been paying most of our bills helping us where they can. But it has been rough. We have had to get food from food pantries, and we probably wouldn’t have a house if it were not for our church. (Which I am extremely grateful for). So you would think we could get full grant (around $9,000) with it right? Nope, they took our families taxes from 2017 to make their determination on our financial situation, which was the year my family made more money than we ever have, which disqualified us from the Pell grant and many other options. 

Now with this gap year school, they run their credits and course through a university in Philadelphia. Not in SC. So Life scholarship will not count. (I have 4.43 GPA, and a 1180 SAT score). Neither will most in state scholarships. And I also cannot appeal my FASFA because of that. I honestly don’t know what to do now. Any advice?",06Mar2019,1

TL;DR at end

Hi- this particular thing, which I will explain in a second, has been happening to me for years. It has made functioning like a regular human very hard for me in some situations, and leaves me frustrated as to why I cannot simply feel/act normal- and I don't even know why it happens. If it helps in interpreting my situation, I have been diagnosed with the following things: GAD, depression, gender dysphoria (although I doubt this last one has much to do with this particular problem, it certainly could, which is why I'm listing it).

So, if I'm out in public for more than, say, 2 hours (unless I am in school- this is the only exception. There are no others.), I become extremely anxious and tired. I have trouble breathing, focusing, my face begins to flush and get hot (which causes me to feel embarrassed, which only makes the flushing worse), and all those delicious symptoms of anxiety we all love so much. This makes things like getting together with friends (even just to chill at someone's house), spending time with family, going to academic competitions (which I do often, but they never go well for me due to lack of ability to focus), field trips, and going to the mall/anywhere in public to run errands or something very, *very* difficult for me. In situations where I have to interact with others or with my environment more, I may have a good 30 minutes of mental clarity and being in a generally good mood before I begin to feel anxious, tired, and very, very depressed.

What's wrong with me? I've asked my therapist about this and she suggests I may be worried about the expectations set on me by society, but this makes absolutely no sense as I am well aware that when doing things such as going to a friend's house or just to the grocery store, I am not expected to ""perform"" well, and going out in itself does not make me anxious (unless I am anticipating getting anxious and depressed, which is quite embarrassing. I am actually currently writing this post in anticipation of reaching that state tomorrow during a 10-hour academic event).

So, reddit, what I'm asking is three things: one, what exactly is happening with me? I have a friend who experiences the same exact thing so I know it's not just me. Two, do any of you experience anything similar, and if so, how do you deal with it? And three, how would you (either from personal or professional experience) recommend I try to prevent, control, or cope with it?

TL;DR: When out in public for more than a few hours at a time, I become anxious, tired, and depressed. Why?

Will be crossposting this to a few different subreddits for a maximum amount of interaction as I am getting a bit desperate- this is affecting my ability to function like a regular social being and makes me just want to sit on my ass in bed doing nothing but watching youtube and playing video games, because I know that at least that is safe.",06Mar2019,1

This year and last year, I started applications to a free study abroad scholarship, but backlash from my parents and maybe some subconscious fear of leaving kept me from ever finishing them. Now, I’m mid-way through an application to a different, month-long, program in Africa. It looks amazing, but the price tag reflects that - it’s around $10,000. I would pay the cost out of a savings account my parents set aside for me to make a general teenage purchase, like getting a car. I always wanted to just save it for college, but I do have a lot of savings built up for that as well. I thought I was confident in my choice, but now that I have to put down a few hundred dollars for an deposit, I’m starting to second-guess myself. I want to go, but I feel like it might not be worth it. I loved the scholarship program, and this feels like paying infinitely more for something worth far less. Part of me feels like I’m just applying to make up for my regrets, and I don’t want this to be an expensive mistake on my part. On the other hand, it really looks like something I would enjoy, and I feel like the same fears that kept me from applying to the other program might just be stopping me here... how can I decide?

I was getting on the public street car going home after stopping at the store and this older guy (55ish), who was already inside came over, looked at me and sat across from me. He started by saying it smells like asbestos and another guy asked him how he knew and etc. while older guy watched me. He looked at me and said, “you’re looking really cute, snow bunny”. When other guy got off on his stop, that older guy moved over to the seat in front of me, leaning over the back and staring at me while I looked away. After trying to ignore him, he was asking me questions like if I go out much and flirting with me but talking so quiet so I would have to try and listen.

81,"So I’ve lived with a friend for a few years and we get along great. Just keep to ourselves and haven’t had any issues.

Recently, my roommate’s younger brother has started to come over to play video games on his computer. The problem is that he comes over about an hour before my roommate leaves for work (night shift) and then stays over playing video games the entire night even after my roommate leaves for work.

The two initial problems were that the kid screams at the top of his lungs when he plays video games and he drinks all of my beers in the fridge without asking. Those problems, however, were fixed by me just politely asking him to be quieter and to ask before taking beer. 

Now, the problem is that this happens every night like clock work - he comes over, my roommate leaves for work, and his brother is over all night in his room playing video games.

The few hours that I used to have to myself every night are now interrupted by his brother being there constantly.

The big issue with that is that I’m gay and it’s severely affecting my ability to bring guys home at night. While my roommate knows I’m gay (not sure if his brother does), my guy friends get a little uncomfortable cuddling and watching a movie on the couch when my straight roommate’s straight little brother is present. 

I don’t know how to ask my roommate to stop letting his brother hang out in his room while he’s not home without sounding like an asshole. It’s my roommate’s apartment too so I hate to restrict him from having someone at his own apartment, and especially not his family but this is driving me crazy.

For the past few years, my parents have used an app, Life360, that they made me install on my phone to keep track of where I am and when I arrive/leave certain places. I (19M) am now a freshman in college and they still insist I keep the app on my phone. 

The biggest issue is that they’ll track if/when I’m going to church here on campus, which is really the only reason I still go at all. When they see that I haven’t been to the church at all on a Sunday or whatever other days I’m supposed to go they’ll call me and freak out about it. 

For context, my college is less than 40 minutes from home. I live in the dorms here but still come home for breaks. I have an older brother here as well, and they use Life360 to track him too. I’ve never done anything so bad that there would be a real need for me to be tracked 24/7. I’ve got a part time job, I don’t get lost or anything, and I would say I’m pretty independent as far as freshmen in college go. 

What should I do? Whenever I bring this up to my parents they’ll insist that the app is necessary. I don’t want to just suck it up and keep going to church when I really don’t want to (nothing against religion, just not my cup of tea) and I don’t like knowing that they can see where I am at any given time.

She started calling out about once every 2 weeks because her kids were sick. Then the next week she would call out because now she is sick. She worked there for 7 months and called out over 30 times(not exaggerating).  When she was there she was not getting the hang of things like it was taking her 4 hours to open the mail... 

Finally I had to do what I was putting off for so long and let her go. I sat her down and let her know it wasn’t working out anymore due to her schedule.

I had a good position that paid 15/hr, but got demoted to a 10/hr position because of my lates. About 2 weeks ago he gave me a list of rules, and if I broke any I would have to move out in a week. One of the rules was going into work on time, and I broke it by going in late. Tomorrow is the one week mark, and I'm moving in with my sister for a week until I find somewhere to go. My sister and her roommates are expecting an additional roommate soon, so thats why I cant stay there more than a week. My mom cant take me in, she doesn't want to (we have a rocky relationship and shes tried to help me so many times) and even if she did there isn't any space for me at her house. I need some advice on my options. I have no License, but I do have my permit. I'll be able to take the driving test this month, although I wont have a car. This makes it impossible to commute to any job. I applied to online Jobs, but I hear they take upwards of a month to get back to people. Any advice on a job or living situation would help me greatly. I'm a really smart kid, I killed it at my job working for my dad (he fired the guy who took my old job, said I was much better at it) but I just couldn't go in on time. Ive been too comfortable smoking pot and living in my dads basement. I know hes been enabling me by giving me so many chances, and I agree its best I move out and grow up. I have a high school degree, but barely graduated a semester late. College isn't really an option, nor is it something I want to do. I have plans to move out with my friends, but I need a job to save up, and somewhere to live in the mean time. Any advice on jobs and shelter possibilities for someone like me would help greatly. I know this is all my fault and I completely blew it.  ",06Mar2019,1

100,"My college is having some major maintenance problems throughout multiple dorm buildings, so almost all upperclassmen can't live on campus. The school bought some neighboring apartments and luckily after months of not knowing where I was going to live next semester they finally told me that I was taken off the waitlist and I can live in one of their apartments. 

I was so relieved to finally have an answer that I signed the contract online as soon as I was informed of where I was living. Only after the fact did I read my roommate assignments. It is a four bedroom apartment and I will be living with three other people, all of them are men. I'm a woman and I don't think I am very comfortable with this situation. I think what happened is they just quite literally randomly put waitlist people wherever there was room, not taking gender into account, or maybe when I signed up for housing the shortened version of my name was only looked at by the people who worked with assignments (my full name is obviously feminine but the shortened version that I always go by is unisex. Also I would never use the shortened version on official documents, so this wouldn't be my mistake). Now, I am 18 and I understand that my roommates will all be around my age as well, and we all get separate bedrooms, but I still am very iffy about the fact that I will be living with three men. Sorry *New Girl*, I don't think this is for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I need advice, or, a bunch of advice: Should I contact my school and ask for a re-assignment? I already signed my contract. What if they tell me I can't switch into a room with other women, or they just kick me out of the apartment? Also, if I can't switch, how do I tell my parents? I'm not sure about this and would rather room with at least one other woman because (and I know this may sound kind of sexist but hear me out, I only have a sister and have only had like one guy friend) it just seems a little intimidating being outnumbered like this. My mother wouldn't like this situation because of my reasons, but she thinks all men want are sex and loves to warn me not to have sex, so I can't imagine how she'll react if I have to tell her I'm living with three other men (I do have a boyfriend who I'd never cheat on, but I don't think that will be a good answer for her. Sorry this turned into a rant about my mom.)

101,"This may be posted in other subreddits, just cause I want a wide spectrum of answers. (Yes, this is a throwaway account)

Just a little backstory: So for the past couple of months, I had been positive I wanted to pursue a music major in college. I loved singing, it was one of my huge passions! But then, randomly yesterday, I started looking at what other music majors had done in life, and I got scared away almost instantly. They said how little free time they had, how it’s ONLY music, and how they are always stressed out. 

I was reading this all while in school, and I felt like I was going to break down and cry. My stomach felt like it was caving in, and my head was pounding like hell. I don’t think this was a full on anxiety attack, I’ve never been through one of those before and I don’t want to make it seem like I have. But it definitely felt like the symptoms to one, hence why I said it was just a semi-attack. 

So now for the advice part: do I pursue this in college? Obviously this is a huge decision, so I’m not gonna let one thing be the deciding factor for me. I just want some advice to help sway my decision one way or another 

I love music a lot, and I want to be a good and confident singer. But I’m constantly switching between being happy that all my free time could be devoted to music, and freaking out that it’s all going to be music music music and nothing else. ",06Mar2019,1
102,"So as the title states I have been given a great opportunity to move within my company to become a local manager with the starting salary at $150,000, and then after a year moving upwards of 300k. 

Currently my girlfriend of 5 years is living in a state which is about a 14hr car drive, 1:45 hour flight, and will be there for he next four years attending school. She already has a major, but found a new path and has decided to go back to school.

We have been doing the long distance thing for a few months now (8) and things have been fun. Honestly never better. But the talk of me moving up there is always on the table. She says she doesn’t want to live here anymore due to certain aspects of the area... bad drivers, high gas, etc etc.. personally things I can look over and not allow to ruin my day. 

Long story short I have been in my career for nearly 13 years and have worked my way from the lowest position to where I may be headed now. 

I am worried that if I tell her I am going to take this position we may lose our relationship. We have had talks about getting engaged before, and are even in the process of getting a ring made. I just feel like this change may interrupt things. 

I believe it would be foolish of me to miss this opportunity since I do not know when the next time I will get a chance like this. But at the same time I would feel terrible if we broke up and I wasted 5 years of her life.

I love this women, I truly do. But at the same time, I do not know if I have it in me to start over and work my way up at another company in her state.

116,"Long story Short- me and my girlfriend of 2 months have major problems- mostly regarding our personalities 

My girlfriend whose very young (15) has atleast 18 ex boyfriend (some ranging from 18-25ys)
I'm just as young (17) and have now experience whatsoever

She still talks to a recent ex everyday as a bestfriend.
Makes every problem shes causes my fault - even if shes very wrong .And wont let go of the fact I broke up with her once, since she never had a guy break up with her

I broke up with her because she walked with different guys every day and held them closely and never wanted to hang with me or my friends (she only has guy friends)
And one day she walked away from me to be with them so I broke up with her.
Fast forward -  I took her back. Found out she sent my best friend nudes, my bestfriend owned up and told me, broke up with her again (sorta) and then took her back after another 2 weeks of her crying and begging.

 Valentine rolls around - I love her alot and I but her alot of chocolates and a bear and took her out to eat at a expensive restaurant (I live in a low/middle class family that makes 60k a year with 2 benefactors) 
She got me a small flower and a card

She doesnt post me on her insta- still talks to guys that she did things with
She doesnt like it to be known that we are dating and doesnt make it public
Meanwhile I show her off like a queen- and gave her my class ring , which she ""lost"" within 3 days

Fast forward even more. We've gone through alot - she constantly reminds me of the old guys shes done things with and I hate it. I love her soo much but her past makes it hard to move on. And even though she hurted me more than I can ever hurt her -She makes me apologize for it all happening. She makes me apologize for when she gets mad at things for no reason and when she overeacts and even calls me a disappointment or an asshole or an pig sometimes - despite her brother knowing I'm a good guy

And her family hates me because she didnt tell her parents what she did- instead she said I grabbed her and pushed her and all that when we broke up- but our breakup was overtext. But I understand cuz he dad beats the shit out of her for anything. And I dont want to go to the cops cuz if he leaves- she leaves. But she has soo much bruises and scars on her back and head it makes me cry sometimes 

But still- I love her soo much and I dont know what to do- shes driving me insane but shes been through soo much and I dont know what to do.

I felt more at ease around her and I felt like we got along. We went and saw the movie Alita Battle angel, after walking around the local mall. But I'm not sure she's that interested. During the movie she would occasionally text or look at her phone but otherwise was silent and just watched.

128,"Hi guys.  I have abused painkillers off and on for many years.  Sometimes via my own prescription, and sometimes steal them.  Never bought on the street illegally or anything.   I'm generally happy when not on drugs and enjoy being a sober person.  However drugs give me power to focus in life that I can't seem to find when I am not on them.    Not that I can't focus without them, but without them I feel like there's no point to anything.   

When I'm sober I think a lot about why I can't succeed in life and stuff.  I can't focus on the things that I enjoy doing.   I don't see the point in working on any hobbies or anything.  I don't even see the point in working at work either.  So I slack off, fall behind.  Don't care if I get fired.   Eventually I get depressed and suicidal.  This is when I'm *not* on drugs - and it's *not* from drug withdrawal either.  Even before I started abusing painkillers, being sober (no alcohol either) for many months or years, I have had this problem.  My brain is too ""active.""  I have clinically diagnosed OCD but never taken any drugs for it except for the painkillers I found on my own.   I have extreme analysis paralysis often fueled by hate for some stupid little thing.  So bad that sometimes I cannot move, even at work.  My brain goes really fast in every direction and I just hate it.

With painkillers I feel about the same level of energy I have when sober, but I am focused, and driven.  It has an effect on me like what I imagine Ritalin or Adderall would have on someone.  Life has a point all of a sudden.  I finish my hobby projects, or work on a new one and finish it in a day.  I make friends.  I make progress at work.   Perhaps their effect is related to ADD.  I've never taken Ritalin or Adderall, but was prescribed some antidepressents before and hated them - they make me slow, lethargic, unable to think, and I forget everything.   

Obviously I won't ask a doctor about painkillers.  But I would like to try Ritalin, or some focus based drug so that I can focus at work. Is this even a good idea?  I have heard that focus drugs make you lose mental ability at some point, and I don't want that to happen.

Anyway, I have trouble focusing both on personal things, and at work, both on my hobbies, and my life goals.  Using painkillers in the past gave me the ability to focus on things, which made me happy.  Anyone have a similar problem?  How were you able to focus without drugs?  I feel like I am going to develop drug-seeking behavior and my condition is going to get worse.  Just asking for some help or advice!",06Mar2019,1

130," 

Bare with me before you run away because of the cringy title because I genuinely need some help here

First things first, both of us are gay. I first met him in my Freshman year, and I was in a class with him which I actually completely forgot about until the night of this 'incident'. I knew he was into me at the time, but I was already in a good relationship and obviously couldn't pursue anything with him. We talked maybe once or twice a week because we were in the same organization for a short period of time but I left the organization and we lost contact for over a year. I rushed a fraternity during my freshman year, but ended up dropping that fraternity because of some f'ed up shiz that happened during pledging. Fast forward to my sophomore year, I rush again for many different reasons, and my top choice happens to be the house he's in. I had no clue that he was in this house, so I was pretty shocked when I ran into him, but he was really welcoming and ended up introducing me to all of the brothers and pushing for me to get a bid in the house.

Although he was pretty nice about helping me during rush, I notice he's really awkward around me when sober. When we talk he doesn't look me in the eye, for what seems like even a second, and I've had experiences where we're I'm talking to him and someone else and even when I'm the only speaking he'll just keep looking at the other guy. I promise he doesn't hate me. When we're drinking it's a different story. That semester he would come up to me as soon as he gets to parties and talk about how happy he was that I was there and we would have normal conversations where he wasn't doing the thing with the strange eye contact.

The semester ends and it's pretty much like this for the entirety of it. There's something notably awkward between us even at this point where we just cannot talk to each other sober and I can't really explain why.

Now I'm in my junior year, this guy is the president of our fraternity, and i'm at this annual brotherhood 'event' called feast where different pledge classes basically compete to see who can finish a bunch of food and alcohol first. (Writing this I know how stupid this sounds, but before you judge me you're allowed to do as much or as little as you want, you don't even have to participate. We have people who are sober to make sure everyone stays safe.) Anyhow, one of the drinks is a handle of vodka. Nobody in my pledge class is a heavy drinker and since apparently I'm a tool I volunteer to down the vodka in exchange for the pizza and I carry on my way. The drink is supposed to be shared but I'm an idiot and end up drinking most of the bottle with one other person, which I know makes little sense when I just said that we have sober monitors making sure everyone is safe. After the event is over we all sit down to watch a movie, and I am completely wasted by this point. I'd say when the movie started is when I was on the verge of blacking out, and my last memory is literally leaning over to whisper something in this guy's ear.

The next thing I know it's the next morning and I'm sleeping in my big's room with a new set of clothes on. This is the first time in my life I had truly blacked out, because at this point I had no idea what happened the night before. I go downstairs, get some laughs without much detail about the night before and my friend picks me up because we have to get dressed for a formal that's happening at the house that evening. I get dressed and I start talking to her about the night before. I say to her ""I don't know why but I have this feeling that I said something to X last night."" And she immediately laughs and goes, ""Oh are you serious?? You don't know?"". She's friends with the VP's girlfriend, who was of course at the event last night, and told his GF what happened. Apparently I revealed to him that I liked him during my freshman year and was too nervous to talk to him, and that we had a class together and that I was always impressed with how smart he was. I know this is irrelevant, but I had completely forgotten that we even had class together so I was shocked that I had brought that up. It seems like I just went on for 5-10 minutes about how I was attracted to him, and yes i'm physically cringing just thinking about it, until he asked my big to take care of me. To further understand how drunk I was, apparently my big helped me take a shower, and I don't remotely remember that happening. This isn't an excuse for what I said, but to paint a picture of how messy I was being. I'm happy to report that only 2-3 brothers in the house know what happened between us that night, so I really don't care on that front. My friend CLAIMS that I said something sexual to him that I really don't even want to write, and I hope to god that that never happened. I don't think it did because, I promise I'm not creepy and would never do something like that (but then again I never imagined I would drunkenly come on to my fraternity brother so there's that...), and the 2 brothers that witnessed it said the conversation was PG and that they were just laughing at it. My friend and VP's GF fuck with me a lot but to this day they still claim that's what I said, and on that day I believed it is what I had said. When my friend told me all of what happened my first response to was just text him and apologize. I really don't want to look at the text, but it said something along the lines of ""Hey, I think I said some things to you last night that were really inappropriate and I'm so sorry . I drank too much and i'm so embarrassed that I would do something like that, I hope I didn't make you too uncomfortable.""

He responded pretty quickly and I remember the text saying

""No worries, it was actually really funny and endearing! Do you want to know what you said?""

I was curious to know what I said but honestly just wanted to get this off of my mind, so I just told him I didn't want to know and that I was really sorry.

Since then the dynamic has been more awkward then ever, which I understand because I wouldn't want to talk to me either. I have made 0 moves to pursue him or flirt with him I promise, and after that incident I seriously cut back on my drinking.I think I have said maybe 2 words to him in the past two months, which sucks because I obviously like him at least as a drunk friend. At first I tried to play it off, but my attempts even to say hi were what I felt some clear messages that he had no desire to talk to me. So for the past few months I've just stayed out of his way and I figure if he wants to talk to me he'll talk to me. It's gotten to the point that if we're in the same room, one of us will just leave or completely ignore the existence of the other. We'll both say hi to every person in the room except for each other. There's been a couple of inevitable situations where we're physically forced to sit next to each other and there's just this awkward tension where we can't even look in each other's direction. This gets especially awkward when we accidentally make eye contact, say nothing to each other, and then look away as if nothing happened. I volunteered to go on this trip to represent our fraternity and explained to the guy organizing it that It would be so awkward if I had to go with X, so I asked him to make sure X wasn't going. Every week we have these chapter meetings and there's usually a little while of all of the brothers talking to each other before it starts and this past weekend (yesterday) I just noticed him hovering near me like he wanted to say something to me. I know this is the case because he normally won't even look in my direction, but he was standing right next to where I was sitting and basically looking at me. I look up at him, have the most painful couple of seconds of eye contact, say nothing, and look back down at my phone. After that I was talking to someone else and he comes into the conversation and just exclusively talks to the other guy, although i'm still having a conversation with the other guy while X is talking to him he's unresponsive to my inputs in the conversation. We're really mature. I know.

As you might imagine this whole situation sucks and it makes every second I'm at the house painfully awkward, I have NO idea where to go from here especially because I think If I tried to go off of my own intuition, I would just fuck things up even more, if that were even possible.

tl;dr: I came onto the president of my fraternity when I was extremely drunk and have made our already awkward relationship so awkward that we cannot even look in the same direction as each other. This makes my life difficult, especially with him as the president, as we are inevitably around each other constantly. I implore you to read my post if you get the chance tho haha",06Mar2019,1

138,"Hey Reddit.  


I have a tough decision to make and not much time to make it.  Yesterday, two days before I was going to give notice at my job and move back to a city where all of my best friends live, I was given a promotion and a raise of almost $30k.  


I was dead set.  I have been purely focused on work for about 3 years and have few friends where I live.  No one I really keep close.  I've been visiting my friends periodically and was so excited to move back to be with them.  These are people I've known for almost 10 years now, and want to spend a lot of the rest of my life with.  


I'm still young under 30, and don't want kids.  I don't worry that I could make as much if I switched jobs and did a little negotiation, or just waited another year or two.  But the ""bird in the hand"" does have a certain allure over the ""two in the bush"" and on top of that, I do take seriously that this company has chosen to recognize my accomplishments.  


I'd love to hear some stories and advice from people who have chosen one or the other when it came down to ""love or money.""  


Thanks.",06Mar2019,1
139,Well kind of. See she was unhappy in the relationship and started having an affair (no judgement and I don’t want anyone judging her) . This affair was happening with a man who is 42 has 2 kids and was married. The man is a total “chad”. She says he works in mental health and is open minded but she basically told me she had to keep things from him so he didn’t think she was weird. She says she enjoys the sex and kinks they share. She has been with him a lot recently but only met him in January. I’m nervous that she may be getting to close to fast and she really likes him and I don’t want to see her get hurt. The man is in the middle of a divorce now and so is my friend. She kept bringing up their future. Should I tell her that I am nervous about her situation and that I fear he may be using her or should I just keep quiet and be there when she needs me?,06Mar2019,2

141,"I’ll try to keep this short. When I was 14yo I got called into the office of my middle school to talk to a social worker. In that meeting she basically told me that my dad has been molesting my half-sister(his daughter-in-law) and she, 15yo, had just confessed to it. I was traumatized and obviously very upset. It had been happening for 5 years and she never said a thing. It has always been hard for me to stop loving my father but I have always had a terrible hatred for him at the same time.

My younger siblings, my sister and my mom moved down to Florida to avoid the pain of living anywhere close to this monster as soon as I reached 18. Since all of my friends were here and I was already accepted to college, I stayed and the only way for me to not pay rent, was to move into my father’s house. It was a very roommate-esque relationship and I always resented him. I remember he was driving me to therapy one day and he said I didn’t really have depression so I freaked out at him and blamed everything on him to his face. He shut the fuck up and kept driving.

It’s now 5 years later, and my mom’s maximum child support is coming to an end. My mom and younger siblings, 15yo and 11yo(with autism) live in a house they rent in Florida. My mother has been under extreme depression and has gotten quite obese living off of my fathers child support while trying to raise my siblings. In my opinion, she doesn’t deserve the lifestyle she was left with and shouldn’t have to work another day in her life and I’m working as hard as I can to make sure that happens but I’m not there yet.

I’m now moved out with my girlfriend and my father who owns two semi-successful local businesses and has a wife and another daughter, has expressed his relief to me that he won’t have to make these maximum payments anymore. It makes me sick that he even thinks he’s off the hook for supporting my mom and siblings. My plan is to confront him in person (as to not have any evidence) and ask him what his plan is once these maximum payments run out. Then if he says anything other than keeping on paying them, I will make it clear that I will tell everyone he knows what he’s done. Including his own brothers and sisters, wife, commercial landlord, and employees. He doesn’t deserve happiness if it means that my mom has to live a stressful life to make up for his mistakes. I’d like advice on this, maybe even for someone to tell me not to do it... but I’m going to do it, at least until I can make enough to support them, I am willing to ruin his life.

P.s. none of his crimes are public record because my sister testified to reduce his punishment because she wanted to make life easier for me. No one knows except close family friends.",06Mar2019,1

Title says it all. Over the years my friend group has shrunk, but now it looks like I'll be all alone soon and I don't know what to do about it. \*\*I'm the type of person who enjoys as much social interaction as possible (or at least needs to do something social on weekends to feel fulfilled/connected to the world that's outside my head) and the decrease in social interactions via text or physical interactions on weekends is started to make me feel claustrophobic with my lot in life.\*\* Although I'm no stranger to solitude, the ideal frequency of social interactions I prefer to have has diminished greatly due to friends moving away/not being available. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite having hobbies, interests, and goals outside of social interactions, I don't feel fulfilled socially. I feel like I've painted myself in a corner by having a small friend group and now that they're leaving I don't know what do do about it.

144,"The prior home owner was an old man and had died. He had a dog that is over ten years old and was a rescue. The dog has no training at all, and since he relied on neighbors to walk him, he would often pee inside the house. He also snaps at people for various reasons, like taking stuff from him, petting him at the wrong angle, or getting your foot near his head. 

I needed a place to live that I could afford, and this was all I could find. The home is really old and there is a lot wrong with it, not to mention it smelling like dog urine. I've had the carpets professionally done, and been walking him twice a day, only for him to continue to pee inside. I've got some help with my family to trying to fix up the place, but I still get pretty depressed about the place since it's old and kind of shitty. Not to mention the place constantly smells like piss or strong scents to cover up the piss.

I'm about to have to spend a lot of money to have the kitchen remade, and now I'm going to have to go through all my savings to have the carpet ripped up as well. I am having a hard enough time adapting to a home that doesn't meet my expectations, without also having to deal with a dog that doesn't meet my expectations.

When I bought the place I told the sellers that I'd take care of the dog, and the neighbor that walked the dog appreciated it as he has cats and can't keep him. Every neighbor knows the dog and knows that I'm the one that took over for him. 

I know it's not the dogs fault it was abused and not properly trained. He's not completely horrible, he can be sweet and kind. However he has too many issues that I am capable of handling and wasn't aware of all that I was taking on when I agreed to take care of him. Also the dog doesn't really want to spend much time with me, preferring to be with the neighbor.

When I envisioned getting a dog, I thought of getting something older, not a puppy, but not so old that I'd have to bury him sometime soon, and without so many medical and behavioral issues. I wanted a dog that I could have around friends and family without worrying, and a dog that would love me more than my neighbor. I have enough issues with this place without having to deal with all of this with the dog.

There is a person with a very large house and many acres of open outdoor space, that would love to have the dog. Except there are issues with me just letting them take the dog. I'd feel bad because it seems like giving up on the dog, I know it's not his fault. I worry the change of scenery, after just having his owner die, would be difficult for him. Also everyone in my neighborhood including my neighbor would know I gave him up, and the neighbor especially really loves the dog. He just can't keep him because he has cats and can't always walk him.

So if I did decide to give the dog away, everyone would know about it. Then for my neighbors to suddenly see me walking another dog, I feel like they would be scrutinizing me and I'd feel really shitty and stressed about it. I feel like I kind of swore an oath to take care of the dog, and maybe that was part of how cheaply I got the house too. I'd feel like shit for just giving up on the dog and not taking care of it like I said I would. I feel like the decision it would taint my home and my life.

I'm really not sure what to do. Part of me really wants to just get another dog, one that is younger, and a better fit for me. But another part of me would feel shitty for just getting rid of him and not keeping him like I promised. Right now I'm just having to deal with this dog and I take the best care of him I can but I feel like he is more than I am suited for. I'm just getting by trying to make this run down place feel like home without having this poor guy peeing on the floors and biting at my guests.

146,"Here is the relevant background: So I met this guy in high school. Lets call him Daniel. Daniel and I had a decent amount of mutual friends and we were in a small class together, so naturally we were friendly enough with eachother. I'd see him in school and out with friends fairly often, but we were never had a close friendship at all. 

Fast forward a few years and I'm in college. I get a call from a number I don't recognize and I answer it and its Daniel. I ask him why he is calling me and he says he just wants to talk. I found this weird and didn't have any desire to talk with him, so I made up an excuse and hung up with no intention of calling him back or answering any future calls. Unfortunately for me, he wouldn't stop calling me. He started texting me these weird, nonsensical messages that I hardly understand. Eventually, I found out that some of these weird messages were actually lyrics in songs he wrote about me and posted online. I know they are about me, partly because the lyrics actually describe me and also because some of the mutual friends we have (they aren't friends anymore, after realizing the creepy shit hes doing to me) told me that he confirmed the songs are about me. There are a few more I believe are about me, and he also would make posts on twitter that were pretty obviously about me. I won't go into the details, but there were identifiers in the twitter that made it very clear that these were about me.

 He also found out where my parents live and went to their house, with flowers and a letter he was trying to deliver to me. Luckily, I don't live in the same state anymore so I wasn't there. I eventually told him that this is harassment, and if he makes any attempts to contact me or my family again that I would call the police. Sure enough, he kept texting/calling me and I called the police. They told me it would be difficult to do really do anything about this because we lived in different states, she had made it seem like the legal proceedings would be tough because of that. And anyway, what could they really do to help me here? So she tells me she can call him and tell him to knock it off, and essentially bluff and say we would take \*serious\* action if he doesn't cease all contact. She tells me that he said he would stop. He did, for some short amount of time, but he has since resumed. 

You may be wondering, what is he saying in all these texts and tweets? He tells me he loves me, tells me how he got my parents address, asking me to meet up, telling me he wants to visit me, telling me that my bodies produce electromagnetic waves that he can sense. And a lot of nonsense. What worries me is that I know he has done a lot of hard drugs and there are these stories I have heard about him doing other kinds of gross, illegal shit that make me think he has a serious mental illness which makes him delusional, and that has been exacerbated by drug use. He posts about how he is going to come meet up with me, and honestly I'm worried because its not exceedingly difficult to figure out where I work. The guy is obsessed with me and has serious issues. I worry he might come and try to hurt me. 

So what the hell do I do about this?",06Mar2019,0
147,"To understand how I don’t know what to do I have to provide the full story. About a year and a half a ago ( two grades ago in school), I met this girl who was a a friend of my friend, I immediately thought she was cute but not much else. I’m a nice guy so I just said hi and kept my thoughts to myself since I’ve never really just been one to ask out girls. Summer passed and it’s a new school year and this same girl is in one of my classes, still as attractive as ever. I start talking to her in class but it never amounted to more than just a classmate asking or commenting on something. One day on her Snapchat story she says “SnapBack” (to talk obviously) and since I had a good feeling about her I started talking to her. We had a nice conversation where I made some jokes and we talked and at some point I was joking and was like “I’ll kill myself if you want to” (I know I’m an idiot, I was just nervous) so since we were in that joking sense she was like “yea do It”. Some being the genius that I am I thought it would be hilarious to say okay I will then ignore her the rest of the night as if I did (I know now this was a stupid thing to do). At some point she was like wait, is he actually going to kill himself? Then my phone proceeded with texts from her telling me not to and how it was a joke. I eventually called off the joke since I realized it wasn’t really a joke and I told her that and how I was sorry. She was obviously very mad at me and was ready to hate me for the rest of her life. Since I obviously didn’t want that, I tried restarting the conversation as if we just met kinda like stuff you’d see in the movies. It didn’t work and she was really mad. I liked her and didn’t want it to be all gone that fast so I started texting her these “lyrics"" so a “song” I was making up on the spot. It was just a song about her filled with compliments and obvious flirtatious signs. She read it and told me to keep going, so I did. At the end of it she told me how that was actually nice and how I was a nice person. Our conversation then continued and it was obvious to her that I liked her but we never flat out said it. She asked me if I’ve ever done stuff like that with another girl and I haven’t so I was honest with her and we talked in a way ( at least to me ) meant that now she was somewhat interested in being with me. Our conversation ended and I was happy with what I’ve done. The following months her and I would talk constantly, before school, during school, and after school for hours, and not just flirty text stuff, on the phone for hours, real conversations not just both of us being dry and trying to keep the conversation alive. It was very clear to my friends and her friends that I really liked her, but since I technically haven’t told her that I did, I would deny it. I don’t know if I loved her to be honest, but it would’ve been the closest thing. It wasn’t even about me thinking she was cute anymore, I genuinely thought she was an amazing person, incredible sense of humour, generous, kind, smart, beautiful, and just great to talk to. I loved talking to her, it would brighten my day and ( to me at least) it seemed like she did as well. So that was our “relationship”, just clear feelings and no one said a word, until Christmas. We would talk everyday for hours so when Christmas break came and she just suddenly stopped talking to me I found it weird. I initially just thought something may have happened in her family and she wasn’t really in the talking mood so I was kinda fine with that so I made sure to tell her I hope everything was fine. Eventually she gets back to me and tells me she just really wanted to focus on her family this Christmas,. I immediately knew that couldn’t have been the real reason but I had no reason to call her out so I just said that’s fine. A couple of days later I get a text from her friend asking me if I liked her, since I didn’t really want to talk about that I just said that’s between her and I, so she ends up texting me as well. She asked me if I liked her and me confused I didn’t know what to do, she probably could’ve told I did and there’s no way she wouldn’t have noticed it so I figured out that she was hoping that I didn’t. I told her no and it was kind of a big relief for her, I felt terrible. She told me that that would’ve been weird and she’s happy the way we were. We eventually started talking less and I could tell we weren’t the same kind of friends we were. Even though I liked her and wanted to be with her, she turned into one of my best friends and it was horrible to see our “relationship” slowly decrease. Eventually she started talking more with the “popular” kids, and don’t get me wrong, I’m somewhat popular, people know me and I’m friends with everyone, but you know how there’s a different group of kids and they’re just “popular”, well that’s who she would talk with more. I saw her actively change into a different person around these people and I wasn’t really sure how I felt about that. Eventually we stopped texting and talking in the halls (hell sometimes it seems like she doesn’t even want to make eye contact with me) but when we had class together we would talk the same and it was just nice to talk to her. Fast forward to now ( a grade later) and things are the same, we just talk in class and the only times we Text is when I find an excuse to talk to her. She’s different in some ways, she’s more “popular” and is friends with some of the “thots” in my school who I don’t think are the best people to be friends with. She just does different stuff, and it’s not the fact that she changed a bit, everyone does, it’s the fact that I feel like most of if is an act she plays in front of certain people. I also recently found out that she asked out a close friend of mine who’s been in our class all this time, my friend rejected her and she hasn’t (at least from what I know) done more advances. What sort of bums me out though is that she has talked to him kind of in the way we would. I know I’m getting in my own head but i would just not like it at all if she got together with somebody especially with my friend. On that point as well, I know she talks to other guys and I don’t exactly know if she’s going to date someone but it especially sucks when some of the guys she talks to are people from other schools and I just feel like I’m out of the loop since I don’t know who it is and how much they talk. Keeping in mind all of that I still think I may “love” her and I want to be with her but I also really want our friendship back. So to me I don’t know if I should just lay it all out on the like and say what I feel and ask her out, I don’t if I should tell her just the facts and say everything that I think about her and just say that I just wanted to tell her this and if she feels the same way great, if not let’s be friends, and I don’t know if should even risk our friendship. All I know is that I care for this girl very much and I miss our friendship even though I very much want to be more, and I don’t want to bear any more time the way we currently are. If you spent all that time reading this, thank you, honestly writing it all out helped, and if anyone would like to share their thoughts or advice, I would very much appreciate that.",06Mar2019,1

I stupidly took their word for it and we went ahead and signed our lease. Come to find out that there’s 6 upstairs bedrooms, and 1 in the basement. I would say these 6 are closer with each other than I am, so they all decided when I wasn’t there that I am in the basement. This room is smaller than the others, and also no bathroom on this floor. They also want to throw parties in the basement and I don’t really feel comfortable living right next to this, particularly because I’m a kid who needs his sleep and whenever I party with these kids they usually stay up until 4-5 am and I usually go home at like 2 to sleep.

We initially got past the petty bullshit as i had done nothing but exist, and really didnt interact much for the next 12 months outside of training, being civil for the sake of the sporting company.

As of 6 months ago, i started seeing a man who we train with, and he had come out of a relationship shortly before this. R has since told everyone in the company (bar the owner, whom she is good friends with) that i am the reason for breaking them up and am essentially a homewrecker. She has also continually told his ex partner whom i am friends with, that I continually try to sleep with other trainees, in hopes that the ex will tell my partner and result in him ending our relationship. It has caused a massive strain in the way people treat me when we are at training or at events related to the company.

It all seems like petty bullshit but i am having crazy anger and anxiety about the whole deal, and it has stopped me from going to training as much because i can't stand to be around her horrible attitude towards me, and the general smugness and entitlement. 

I am approaching the owner with the information tonight in hopes it can be resolved, but cannot think of how to do so without it seeming like im just being a sook about the whole thing; especially since she is friends with the owner, she expects special treatment and more leeway with the rules.

I don't care if we dont talk, i just want all this disgusting, high school, gossipy bullshit to stop, because i have genuinely done nothing wrong and there is zero reason for it.

Any advice on how to approach this like a rational woman would be so appreciated, as my anxiety about the situation doesn't help when i try to word things and confrontation is not my strong point.

159,"Hey there,

This post is pretty embarrassing to write. I'm 19 years old (female), and I still get super nervous when it comes to talking to people I'm interested in. Even just the generic ""hi, how are you?"" is a terrifying task for me. I end up having people I really like come and go out of my life, just because I was too scared to say anything, and it leaves me feeling depressed.

I know there might be a couple reasons why I do this, so I'll mention them real quick.

For one thing, I'm very introverted. I really don't like talking to people unless I'm friends with them. Because of that, I'm terrified that it will be obvious that I like someone if I talk to them out of the blue.

Secondly, I think I still struggle with my self confidence. My high school environment was very shallow (typical, I guess), and being the chubby, plain-looking person I was, I didn't draw much attention. I think those years convinced me that people will only want me if I'm attractive, but that's something I really don't value in myself, and especially not in others. Still, it might be something that affects this situation.

So, I would really appreciate some advice on how to overcome these anxieties. Thank you!",06Mar2019,3
160,"Hey r/advice

I've been feeling increasingly lost over the last couple years in terms of direction. Currently I have no assets, a decent amount of debt, license is suspended, I'm late on rent with no job and have 100 bucks to my name to feed myself and once that runs out I'm finished. I've burned through all my interests in terms of job fields through my late teens and 20s and I'm just feeling totally adrift. I've been thinking about joining the military or just hopping a train somewhere and just seeing how far I get. I'm fed up with everything. The monotony I guess. I realize those two things are quite different in a lot of ways but I just dont know what to do with myself anymore. I'd seriously rather do either of those things than get another shitty 9-5 or invest money and time into a ""rewarding career"" and just suck the rest of the years out of my life like that. I'm sorry for the rambling but I feel like I've talked my friends ears off about this at this point and realistically all anyone can do is empathize and tell me to suck it up and grab a wage job like everyone else. I dont know what I expect from this post but any kind of perspective would be appreciated.

How do I get him to tell me ? I don't want to embarrass him and he doesnt take hints either.

Then life happened and I defaulted on my loans. After years of fixing my credit I'm at a 720 score (not great but like 2 years ago it was in the low 500's). I still owe 9,500 in loans. 

Anyway I am currently working and making okish money, 17.85/hr. However, I feel like I've hit a wall as far as my career path. I can't go up anywhere without a bachelor's. 

There is a university where I live that offers online bachelor's degree's for people who are working. I've done a lot of research but I'm so hesitant to take out more loans. 

I'm looking at a degree in either human resources management or healthcare administration. I currently work adjacent to those fields as an administrative assistant to the practice administrator at a private practice. Like are either of those degree's worth it?

My girlfriend was/is suicidal. She called me one morning and said she was going to her therapist to seek help and possibly be hospitalized because she almost went through with suicide the night prior. We talked and I let her go to see her therapist. I get a call 5 minutes later, she is sobbing and saying she almost took her life again and barely stopped herself. I called 911 on a different phone at this point. I stayed on the phone with her till the officer came to her door. She spent 5 days in a mental health hospital being watched and doing activities to help her mentally. She is out now and feels like she is stable.

Was I right to call 911? It seems obvious to me, but I dont think she really ever thanked me and has just vented to me about being in the hospital, though she does admit it helped her in some ways.

Well, I've noticed someone in my class has been acting kind of sad/tired/idk what lately when he's usually super happy and laughing all the time. Something's been up and I want to cheer him up with a hug, but the issue is that, since I hardly hug anyone, I'm not sure what to do. Like where do I put my arms?

Eventually Trevor started to catch on to us so Beth and I ended up with no contact because she didn’t want to ruin her relationship.  At one point Trevor accused me of everything but I denied denied denied to protect Beth from him. I went on with my life.

175,"I'm at a loss of what to do with my sister. I go home for spring break in a few days and I just feel heartbroken. My mom and I chat regularly, and she confided in me in passing, because she avoids getting emotional, that she feels like she has failed as a mother. This woman, who gave up her career as a surgeon to be a mother, is the most loving, compassionate, and supportive mother anyone could ask for. She is my role model. Multiple friends of mine have expressed to me how much they wished SHE was their mother and how lucky I am to have her (the joke is that my friends like her more than me once they meet her). I'm thriving, my brother is finding his way, but my sister is just lost, and I'm sincerely worried for both her and my mother, and I don't know how to fix things or even be home without wanting to scream and cry at my sister.

Some backstory: My siblings and I have all had issues with anxiety &amp; depression. My brother is the oldest, and after almost not graduating and a few years as a barista has found his way and is working toward a 'big people job' as we joke. If he wanted to stay a barista forever, my parents would've been fine with it, but he's an amazing writer, incredibly intelligent,  and has been finding his confidence, so my parents are supporting him in his career goals. I'm the youngest, and the most well adjusted. I'm the only one who wasn't suicidal at some point, and currently am triple majoring with honors in University while holding an internship and leadership positions. I struggle, but I manage. My sister is the middle child, and she struggles immensely. She has severe depression, and has for a while. My parents didn't quite understand, but the second they did they tried to get her help. She's always struggled feeling inadequate against my brother and I, though we never have intended that. My parents supported all our endeavors the same, and if anything supported her and my brother more than me. 

The problem is, she's never really accepted the help. We've tried so many medications, so many therapists, but she won't go, or she stops taking them. We went to the same university, and she almost flunked out so many times, but when my parents asked her to take medical leave she'd find some ray of hope and beg to go back, promising to change. They'd let her, and she'd do ok for a few weeks before falling apart again. But she also is a compulsive liar, and hides it all. It's to the point where I truly believe she lies to herself. 

So now she's 24, living at home with my parents and hates them. She blames them for so much. But she doesn't have a job, stays up until 5am and sleeps in until noon, eats shit, doesn't exercise, frequently messes up her meds, won't find or do therapy if they schedule it for her. All she does is talk to her long distance girlfriend and play dnd. I've set up a few things for us to encourage her to get out of the house: drinking at the game board bar, doing an intro circus class, looking at jobs/internships together. But I truly am at a loss of how to do anything with her anymore, because I can barely connect beyond a base level. At anything deeper, she starts blaming my parents and I can't take it. If she went to therapy, or was eating the healthy meals my parents cooked, or anything I could. But the way she makes my parents who have done NOTHING but support her feel makes me so angry I want to cry. They just want her to be happy. I do too. I'm just at a loss.

If anyone has any advice of how I can get through this next week or do something to help her please let me know. If my sis ends up reading this know I love you, I'm just really struggling right now.

I'm 20 years old and living at home. I went to college fresh out of high school and boy was that a mistake. I flunked my first year due to stress/anxiety/laziness whatever you want to call it. I left and worked this past summer doing home security installation in a different state. I was miserable there but was making decent money until my cars transmission went out. All in all I came out of the summer with $1000 and $4000 in credit card debt due to fixing my car so I could drive home.

I now live back at home working full time so I can pay off my debt (of which I have brought down to about $1200). The closer that debt gets to being paid off the more anxious I get. I have no idea what I'm passionate about, where I want to go, or what I want to do. I'd like to move out but have no one I know to go in on an apartment with and there is no way I can afford to move into one on my own.

Original post above. TL;DR: My roommate snores and goes ballistic when I ask her about it. I have tried every solution under the sun and nothing works. She ignored me after I asked about it 3 times until I brought the RA and staged an intervention. She didn't talk to me for 3 days and says I have been targeting her. It is so loud I have spent money trying many solutions and none of them work. At first things were okay and then the snoring started again so I asked her about it. She told me to deal with it and yelled at me for not telling her sooner but I did not tell her sooner because she goes insane whenever I bring it up. 

Today I talked to her again and she keeps talking down to me about how ""frustrated she is"" about the situation. I have been overly nice about the situation and have tried keeping her feelings in consideration (emphasizing how it's not her fault that she snores, I even offered to buy anti-snoring nose strips for her) but she is treating me like absolute shit. She is very spoiled and treats the room like it's hers, not a shared space. I have tried so many solutions and nothing seems to be working.

We haven't spoken for about 3 weeks besides anything absolutely necessary to say to each other. I feel uncomfortable in my room and I hate being in it; I spend as much time as possible outside and spend usually 9+ hours in the library/at class/with friends per day so I can avoid being in the room with her. I am getting desperate. There's seven weeks in the semester but I don't think I can make it that long. My friend said it's not worth it and I should stick it out because we're at the halfway point of the semester. 

I can't do it. I'm at my breaking point. I've been crying from the stress of this situation added on top of midterms because I'm so overwhelmed and tired of losing sleep. I have ADHD and not taking my meds means I can't focus in class. Being in a shoebox sized room with the person I'm constantly fighting with or not speaking to is so stressful for me, especially as an introvert who needs alone time and is now never getting it because she is never leaving the room. I want to move into a single dorm so badly because I cannot do this anymore. I am going crazy from living in the same room as her and I'm going to break if I do it much longer.

My friend is popular, she is social, but from what she told me her anxiety has took a turn for the worse and she just doesn’t want to do anything. The way she said these things, it was like she was saying a joke, so I just laughed along. 
But then she said that she is depressed. Now she usually jokes about these things but this time it was much more apparent and she sounded like she was in a really bad place. She said that she doesn’t feel like doing anything or hang out and I’m beginning to think that’s why we haven’t hung out in so long. I didn’t think it had gotten this bad and now I am so worried for her. 
I know that my friend has some family issues as well, with her family always fighting due to how one of her brothers acts (plus, money is low)and I can tell it is really getting to her. We were walking back from getting coffee and she somehow but into the conversation that she cuts. She  changed the subject but I can’t get it out of my head.

185,"Tomorrow me and my mother are making an emergency flight to Canada (from America) to visit her mum, my gramma. She’s dying and we aren’t even sure if she’ll make it through the night. My mom tends to bottle things up, and doesn’t like affection when sad (which I get).

186,"Please don’t be mean to me or blame me, my heart really can’t handle it right now. 

Long story short, my job has me in a really bad mental place again. In August my good coworkers were out on paid time off/emergency leave and my two awful coworkers ganged up on me and tried to get me fired. Only reason being is that I’m 15 years younger than them and they do not like my work style. Overall it’s just a personality clash, as I have tried to look within to find what I have done wrong and have yet to find a reason. 

Over time I have established with my boss what my boundaries and expectations are because their actions and relentless bullying made me suicidal. Over the past few months I flourished and I was back on track to being successful. I am getting ready to leave for training with my guard unit for a few months and felt confident about leaving for that. Yesterday, my good coworker dropped a massive bomb on me and stated that they are leaving to a competitor and must leave the building immediately. The one person who would defend me and go to bat for me when shit went sideways is now gone. I am absolutely heartbroken. 

Today, I’m back to square one and I feel the hatred and bullying coming back now I don’t have someone to sort of set shit straight. My boss had to assign all of the good coworkers clients I’ve spent the past 2 years servicing to these assholes to prevent damage from our new competitor in the market. It didn’t even take an hour before the bashing about how I handle things is not up to standard. Already being berated for stuff that they have no context on. My coworker who I adored is gone, my clients are being ripped away from me, and now I have 16 working days until I leave for 4 months due to the military. It took every fiber of my being to just not cry with overwhelming amounts of loss today. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m scared I have nobody to help me and I’m scared about the livelihood of my job when I’m gone since all my clients are being reassigned. I feel the dark thoughts coming back. As a survivor of childhood abuse, being bullied by narcissists is not something I can cope with well and this is what I’m faced with. I can’t just look for another job because of the proximity of my leave. I feel trapped, overwhelmed, and depressed. ",06Mar2019,3

189,"So my wife and I recently ended up on different schedules due to a job change. It's been crazy hard because she truly is my best friend in the world, and probably one of the few people in the world that doesn't use me for benefit.  Thing is, we've always had a strong relationship and made each other better.

Since the schedule change though, I find myself relying on her less and less, where I'd turn to her when I had a bad day in the past, now I tend to handle it on my own. I know it isn't her fault, but since I never see her anymore, its hard. When I get home from work she's asleep, and when I wake up she's gone. If I get lucky and get off early, and catch her home and awake, it's only for 2 or 3 hours. So needless to say, our love life has suffered, and what had been an extremely intimate connection has become strained and disconnected. 

Does anyone on here have experience with a similar situation? How do you keep connected? I feel like my best friend is just a roommate who helps take care of our son, not my partner anymore. ",06Mar2019,2

192,"I work for a small non-profit organization as an assistant together with just one other staff. My job covers admin, secretariat, communication and monitoring work. Our boss and all board members work pro bono. 

I have been doing what is asked, but because of personal matters, I haven't been able to report to work consistently but I offset my absences by doing communication work out of office hours. But of course my boss prefers that I work in the office. I consulted the matter in January and offered to split my salary so we can hire a full-time office staff and I can work part-time, primarily on communications.

They offered me leeway to do my errands or take rest days for my mental well-being and I was really grateful for that. However, when it came to the hectic days, I felt so much pressure having to work on a tight schedule and with so many orders coming from above. After pulling-off a demanding event, I felt so empty. I felt so alone during the process and I realized that there must be a psychological factor for why I couldn't bring myself to work most days from then on.

I feel like I have failed myself and my bosses with my inability to perform this job excellently, even though they constantly reassure me that I am of great service to organization.

I told them I want to quit my job because I need flexibility and I am considering freelancing. I gave them one month grace period but they asked me to consider extending for up to three more months.

In my current state, I don't think it's possible for me to become productive and proactive in my job given the negative emotions I have towards the people and the experience. Going to the office is simply too much of an internal conflict for me.

TL;DR: How do I convince my bosses to let me quit my job as early as possible and start planning for the transition right away?",06Mar2019,1

194,"Hey! I’m new to reddit and need some advice.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year and a half now. He lives with his roommate who he considers a close friend.

We’ve always gotten along with the roommate even before we started dating. Flash forward to a couple months ago, his roommate gets a girlfriend.

Naturally, we would all do stuff together (go to restaurants, bars, seasonal crap on the weekends). However, now every time this roommate is around his girlfriend and my boyfriend (his roommate)...he treats my bf like shit. (Treats him like he’s dumb passively aggressively, ignores him, cold shoulder etc). 

 However on Fridays and Saturdays they’re always hitting us up to hang out. When we hang out they’re not a lot of fun (don’t make conversation or have general interest in your life, acts weird, etc). It truly confuses the shit out of me!! 

The girlfriend isn’t any better - she’s a little insecure with herself so she likes to make fun of people and put things down to make herself feel more comfortable (which isn’t ideal but I get it). 

I know that I have to spend time with them at some point but I’ve been avoiding them because it is truly not fun and their personalities do not mesh with mine. I talk to people all day at work and want to enjoy what I’m doing after hours. 

My question is - how do I enjoy more things with them/make the situation better so that I’m not dreading every time it does come up? I can’t avoid it forever and want to make the best of the situation when it does arise.

199,"Hi, I didn't really know where to post this, but this is closest of a place I could think of.

Also I'm sorry if the layout of this is a little messy, I'm typing this up on my phone a bit impulsively because I'm at a loss with what to do.

For background: I'm currently in my early 20s but I was isolated from the world by my legal guardians/grandparents, (dead beat dad, mom used to be an addict but she's cleaned up now and lives out of state) I was homeschooled, never had real friends, never had a job and just recently was able to get my first boyfriend (same age, unemployed by choice). I have about as much real-world experience as a 13 year old.

Onto my current situation, I feel like my grandparents and boyfriend are consistently manipulating me and taking advantage of me.

i.e: myself: ""(Grandmother/boyfriend) wants to spend time with me today! I'm gonna be at their house today""

(Grandmother/boyfriend): ""So, you want to prioritize them over me? That just proves how much you care.""

Or also commonly,

Boyfriend: ""(insert item here) is really cheap but I'm not asking you to buy it for me, though.""

Myself: ""Okay, maybe I'll get it after I save up some money.""

Boyfriend: ""I'm upset with you for not getting me (item), you know how much I wanted it.""

(Keep in mind, I have $100 allowance for pet sitting and cleaning, and it usually all goes to Bf for food or something that he ""wants"" but not ""needs"")

My bio mother has offered to help me move in with her and out of the toxic situation, but I've tried to break up with my boyfriend 3 times and each time he's threatened to kill himself, told me I don't care and promised that he'll change and get a job. On top of that I might not be able to escape my grandparents house with any of my personal items, even ones I used earned money for, they even refuse to give me my birth certificate because it all 'belongs' to them.

I've never dealt with ANYTHING like this before and I have no idea what to do, when I argue with them I can never win and I'm always a villain, so I just shut down and apologize and go back into the cycle.

Is there anything I can do to help push myself to getting into a better situation? Do I have to get legal help in order to get my personal items from my grandparents if I even build the courage to leave? I'm at a loss right now.",06Mar2019,1
200,"When I was younger, I was a fanatic, I memorized the bible, studied to be a future church minister. After delving into so much studying, I realized how fucked this religion really is. The ministers usually answer the questions you give them, but they keep in mind that you're slowly going astray. When I pointed out all the fallacies of the church (keep in mind that I was a god lover and just wanted to get some answers), I was told to stop what i was doing or else i will go to hell. Those bastards were scared, i saw it in their faces. I realized how dangerous and toxic this cult really is. All the members arent well educated about the bible, so they swallow and accept whatever the cult leader says. One cult session, the minister was already spouting nonsense and the entire crown was screaming ""Yes Father!"". Another crazy thing about this cult is that we are not supposed to read the Bible, and we should always swallow and accept what the ministers say. After doing more research, I realized I wasn't t the only one. There were others who found out, but got excommunicated. One of the main points of my cult is that those outside the cult are lower than shit, and will not be saved. Basically non cult member = hell. So a basic cult member will interact with non members, make connections but deep inside their head, they would tell themselves that those pigs will die in hell. They were just pretending. Cult members can interact with non cult, but forming relationships are stricly prohibited and will get you excommunicated. What hurts me the most is when my mother found out that I was having doubts about the cult, she hit me with words that still screw me over today. She said that I was simply a problem given by god, and said it infront of me while smiling. This cult is terrible dangerous and toxic. What makes it worse is that  the only way to be free is to cast away my family. I don't know how to get out, the only way I can see myself out of this cult is by committing suicide. ",06Mar2019,31
201,"I'm a freshman in high school and this is my very first year in a public school. So far everything has been great! I have a wonderful group of friends I hang out with. I'm part of the concert, marching and pep bands. I have almost straight As and my teachers are all really nice. Everything seemed perfect! Then two days ago, I got a text. 

As I said before, I'm in band. Last weekend, our band went to festival where we were judged on our performance. We all left that stage smiling bright and feeling good about ourselves. Then we got a 2 rating. (On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 is the lowest) This really bummed a ton of people out and so we went back on the bus not nearly as happy as before. 

Sunday night, I received a text from one of the band members. This particular band member, who I'm going to call Logan to make things simpler, messaged me on Instagram saying that I did a good job, regardless of the score. Immediately after, he made it clear that he was trying to text everyone and that this was the only way he could contact me. Seems reasonable to me!

Logan and I had only ever talked a few times during marching band and maybe once during concert band. He's a percussionist so he sits way in the back while I play the flute so I sit in the front. So even if we wanted to talk, it just wouldn't happen. We have two other classes together, however. The next two hours I have are with him. In the first class, he again sits in the back while I'm in the front. In the other class he sits right next to me. Even still, we hardly ever talked.

So when Logan texted me, it sort of caught me off guard. I'm not going to go into detail but I got confused and started saying nonsense. I then apologized for being a mess and his response was ""well you're the prettiest mess i've ever seen"" Once again, I was completely caught off guard. I never felt creeped out or anything like that but I started panicking. Surprisingly, I managed to respond with something that made sense. 

We continued to talk for two or three hours and at one point I gave him my phone number so we could just text instead. Our conversation continued and he continued flirting with me, telling me how I was pretty, cute, funny, smart, ect. At one point I said something about how I was going to retire from life because it was too hard and he asked if he could help me. I thought it was adorable in a way and I half turned it into a joke. I said you could if you had a way to get to the island i'm moving to. I asked if he had a boat and he said no. I asked if he could swim across an entire ocean and he said ""for you, I would.""

Now, I had to do something. I didn't know how I felt about Logan. He was sweet and kind and he was just as awkward as me. But I did know how I felt about someone else. There's a guy I like and I had plans to actually ask him out this week. I knew that even if I went out with Logan, I still had feelings for another guy (who i'm now calling NotLogan). That would never have ended well because I'd always have doubts.

Another thing that stopped me was the fact that he was a sophomore. I didn't have a problem with his age or anything like that but I constantly contemplate the future. If we were to date and actually stay together and be happy with our relationship for two years (and maybe more until marriage [which is what I'd want out of a relationship]) he'd still graduate before me. That definitely could cause some problems. The thing with NotLogan is we're in the same grade and we both have a similar university we want to attend. That has a greater chance of working out in the long run. So I decided something. I was going to tell Logan how I felt. 

I told him the truth which is that i'm not sure if it would work out and that i'm not entirely ready to go out (I was second guessing myself about asking NotLogan out). I asked him to find it in his heart to forgive me and that I was so sorry it took me as long as it did to tell him this. He told me that it was fine and that he'd be alright. He said that I shouldn't worry too much about it and that we could still be friends if I wanted that. I said that I would love that a lot. 

The next day we didn't talk like usual but I texted him later after school. No response. He doesn't look at me and he hasn't texted me back. I understand that it must have hurt when I told him what I did but I didn't expect him to avoid me like he is now. I asked a friend of ours and he said that Logan didn't seem to distraught over the whole thing. Upset? Yeah, a little but he was alright. Or, at least that's what I was told. 

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

Now i'm just clueless as to what to do next. Do I try to talk to Logan again or should I just let him be? Should I still go through with my plan to ask out NotLogan? What should I do during my last hour with him? These past two days I've just been pretending to sleep in the beginning and at the end of class when we're allowed to talk but should I not?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated and if you want to know anything, don't be afraid to ask!! Thank you all so much for taking the time to read through this and I hope you all have a wonderful day or night!!!

210,"I’ll try to make this as quick of a read as possible. But it’s a long story. There is this girl I work with on Saturday nights. I just started working this job again during Christmas break and ever since I’ve been back this girl has been all over me imo. She’s constantly dropping sexual innuendos to me, touching my body in a way that I believe is more than friendly because I’ve never seen her touch anybody else that way. Also he always invites me back to her apartment. She just broke up with her bf a few weeks ago and she even told me she was going to do so before hand. She didn’t tell anybody else. 

I’ll start with the sexual innuendos. Saying that she liked my skinny jeans and how they showed her what I was working with. One night in the back of the restaurant where we work she said hey nick it’s dark quiet and it’s just me and you what are you gonna do about it. I said I’m gonna take out this trash. It was raining and I told he jokingly that she could hold my glasses. I came back in and she handed me back my glasses and I said without my glasses I would be bumping into walls, then she replied with saying that I could bump into her vaginal wall. Later that night when I was telling a story about my recent run in with a pot brownie that was too strong for me. I told her what kind of mattress I had. She told me that she’s never rode anybody on that type of mattress before. One day I was putting whip cream away in a back which she insisted helping me with. And while she held the bag and I scooped in the whipped cream she asked if I was going to do this to her later. There are plenty more of these type of stories but I’ll end there. 

She’s invited me back to her place after she told me that I was taking her out on a DATE after work, and nothing sexual happened. She still had a bf at the time. And now she asks if I want to help her take down her Christmas tree or how much her cat misses me. 

She’s also touching me in a very suggestive way. Weather it be running against me like a cat does when they like you. Knocking flour off my t shirt while standing within a 1/4 inch of my body while she literally rubbed me down. Hugging me and refusing to let go. Always touching my arms and holding on to them, paired with an occasional head resting on my shoulder. 

So the other day my sister in law got sick of me over analyzing this situation she wrote her a message on fb as me asking her how her weekend was and if she still needed help taking down her Christmas tree? She replied with a yeahhhhhhhh, I think I’m gonna leave it up forever. She’s normal shirt though texts I guess. 

So I’m asking you is she into me or I’m I just getting played with by the biggest tease of all time. I haven’t worked with her since I sent the text. And btw one of my women coworkers said that I’m still in a good spot. And everybody is telling me it’s that obvious so plz tell me what you think. Sorry it was so long but it had to be.

211,"Basically, I have a sister who has a habit of lying and stealing a ton. (Especially from me.) I live with my grandmother and aunt and am currently watching my grandmother's house while she and my aunt are away. (Before my aunt left, she had bought some alcohol and she had to leave it because she was flying.)
My sister hasn't been around due to us not trusting her, but she has supposedly been a lot better recently, which leads me to the story.

Last night my sister needed a truck to move some stuff of hers, I happen to be the only one in the family who has a truck, so when she asked my grandma for help, my grandma asked me. She wanted to borrow my truck, but for the reasons listed above I didn't trust her, so I instead offered to go with her and help move the stuff. (She gets the stuff moved, I get to see if she's actually doing better and don't have to worry that she'll make off with my vehicle, so I consider it a win/win/win.) Anyway she's in the house and I'm staying with her the whole time to make sure she doesn't steal anything and we talk about the stuff that's been going on, you know small talk and all that. We go get her stuff and she asks if she can come do laundry tomorrow.(Which is today) I say yes, as I plan to watch her. 

Fast forward to about an hour ago and I find out that my sister took some of my aunts alcohol, so I text her and ask her to explain herself, and she says that I offered it to her. Now I'm 98% sure I didn't, because why would I offer her something that doesn't belong to me? But to be 100% honest, I have a crappy memory and as such don't remember much about the night.

213,"Husband wants threesome, but really, what husband doesnt? Anyway. I'm bi, so I'm open to it, but our marriage is on the rocks. I'm also dealing with my own issues at the moment - fear of abandonment from childhood that has followed me and some confidence issues, which all of that mixed together I feel is not a good time to add another person to our marriage bed. 

I've told him I'll remain open to the idea, but we need time to fix some of our issues or I'm afraid adding someone will cause more issues. I've also talked to a poly friend who has had threesomes and she has said if the couple has issues before a threesome it can cause issues as far as even divorce if they arent ready. I dont feel ready. 

He continues to push me and the issue of a threesome. I dont know what to do. It seems top priority to him so I want to take it seriously if it's that important to him, but I worry about my mental health if I do it before I'm ready.

215,"Today I got a phone call from what they said was some kind of legal document processing firm-I don’t even know if there is such a thing- about an old friend that I used to work in the same company with, though in different departments. We did not work together, I met her through a mutual friend. This “friend” used to take out pay day loans and used me as a reference , without my permission. We have been very off and on for many years and I truly don’t know what is happening with her now. I last talked to her 2 years ago. I don’t know her current address, phone number or anything if that nature. I have taken these calls before and have always told them I don’t know where she is, because it was true. We were always more off than on. I told this current call the same thing. I said we were friends once, but I didn’t know what she was doing now. They said they would remove me from their call list and they hung up.
Was I in the wrong to tell them this? I don’t know where she is at. I think it was wrong of her to use me as a reference. I Sam not financially responsible for her. Personally, I have left the city where we both lived.  What is my responsibility towards her? Any advice would be appreciated. ",06Mar2019,1
216,"My best friend and I have known each other since we were infants. We have grown up together and been through so much. She started dating this guy a little shy of a year ago. Their relationship has always been rocky. He is very insecure and controlling and tries to tell her how to dress and who to talk to and what she does. This causes them to fight a lot. And when they fight, he’s very mean to her. He calls her names and tries to hurt her feelings as much as he can while he’s mad. She always confides in me when they fight and asks for advice. Ever since this started happening, I have told her that she deserves better and shouldn’t be with someone who is purposefully trying to make her sad and not uplift her.  She always would say he’s so nice when they’re not fighting so I just blew it off and wanted to be supportive. 
However 
Things are starting to get really bad 
There has been several occasions where he has gotten physical with her now. 
It started a few months ago when they got into a fight over him not wanting to turn his xbox off to hangout with her. They started arguing and he raised his fists at her (but never actually swung) and shattered her phone. 
There also has been another instance where he pushed her off the bed while they argued and she hit the wall very hard 
Then just last week she called me crying because he told her he has been having sex with another woman. She asked me to pick her up from his house so I did. When I get there they were fighting outside and he pushed her to the floor several times. I feel guilty for not calling the police but I didnt know what the right thing to do was since they were both drunk and she was  also pushing him around.  During this incident I also witnessed him saying he wished she would get hit by a car while she crossed the street. Things got crazy and my friend walked away from my car and told me she needed to walk it off. I tried to tell her to get back in but she wouldn’t listen. So I went home. Later, she called me again asking to pick her up, so I did. This time she was all messy looking and several of her acrylic nails had been ripped off. I know she was with him and I’m not sure what happened, but I know it’s something bad and they got physical. 
I also got news from her roommate saying she has confessed that her boyfriend has choked her while fighting. 
I don’t know what to do. I have sent her message after message telling her she needs to get out of that relationship. I’m always there when she needs to be picked up or when she calls me at 2 am crying because they fight. She always makes excuses for him and now she has began to lie to me and her family about dating him and what’s going on between them. I have been there for her the whole time. But I’m worn out. she won’t listen to me or anyone. I am extremely worried about her because her boyfriends abusive behavior keeps escalating. I don’t know what the right thing to do is. I don’t want to push her away and isolate her even more within the relationship, but I also feel like Ive tried everything. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If you have advice on how to deal with this please let me know. ",06Mar2019,2

223,"First i don’t know why I’m throwing this on the internet maybe because i know I’m behind a screen and it’s just easier to vent that way,
Here’s my story 
I’m 20years old i graduated from a trade school back in July (for heating and air conditioning,  aka HVAC) i got a job (my first real career job) within a month later for a company that works with commercial units, i was mainly just a helper doing preventive maintences it wasn’t a bad gig until things started to go a different route for me, my trainer started to call out often after the 3rd week of me working there so i was getting trained by someone different. i would say i was swapping between 2 (sometimes 3) trainers every 3/4 work days. i was being trained different ways juggling different methods and trying to comprehend what everyone was teaching me on top of already being intimidated by the commercial units and how much work there is to be done on them. eventuallly another guy who graduated from the same place as me got a job BUT he was the bosses neighbor,  he was getting taken care of the right way. 1 trainer, the trainer made sure to go over everything with him and just pretty much teach the kid the ropes. I had 3 weeks until i make it into the union, the company decided to part ways with me because they didn’t think i was a good fit (all the trainer had me do was change filters, tighten bolts, check readings, basically the basic stuff and when i ask to do more or to show me more he refused because i didnt have enough experience) i was upset i lost my first career job eventually i got over. it now sometime around fall i found another company (also commercial) but they did installations instead, now in the interview the boss stated that he would prefer someone with actual experience and not someone who’s “green” (or new to the field)  i should of just declined the position and walked out right after he said that but me being stupid  i took the job thinking it’s something i would be able to handle.. boy was i wrong, they stuck me with someone who spoke very broken English to the point where i had to constantly ask him to repeat himself ( he was a good guy to though that is my only complaint about him) i could tell after a while and after many days of me just not understanding him that this wasn’t going to work out, i pretty much did all i could even though in the back of my head i knew i was getting fired or “let go” eventually but i stuck through it, eventually they let me go (a week before thanksgiving to be exact) and honestly i was more disappointed in myself about this one then my first  maybe because in my head i knew i shouldn’t have took the job in the first place but i believed i could do it even though i have a limited skillset because I’m green. Either way this one stung for a while and back on the job hunt i went, luckily i found a retail job that was hiring just so i can make some money pay bills and all that stuff  I’m still at this retail job  but i am just disappointed that things aren’t working out the way i want it to, i know life doesn’t work the way i want it to trust me, i am rushing myself to “grow up” because i want  to start my own life with my girlfriend and i want to do things on my own and not have to rely on others, i want to make more money, i want my career job, i just don’t understand why it’s 1 step foward 2 steps back, I’m hungry to start my life but for some reason I’m getting held back i don’t know if it’s me holding myself back or if it’s just not working out because of coincidence, I’m looking and applying for jobs as this gets posted (no more commercial only jobs) I’m looking at residential company’s because that’s more friendly to newcomers but anyway i can use some wisdom from someone who dealt or still deals with the 1 step foward 2 steps back life situation how did you overcome it because I’m stuck and have no resources to help me get out.

Here is an example:

He still lives with her however and they’re currently in the process of selling their house. I say THEY but I really mean him as he does EVERYTHING to get the house ready for sale, cleaning, house repairs, etc. while she sits on her ass and smokes weed.

So yesterday as both me and him are sanding the garage wall to fill it in, I hear her yelling in the living room apparently he accidentally left the front door open slightly so he calmly says “sorry my bad I guess it didn’t shut all the way” and she yells “UMMM NO NOT JUST “YOUR BAD” WHAT IF MY DOG GOT OUT” (her dog recently just had surgery, can only walk on 3 legs, and whines nonstop if she’s out of sight for more than 3 seconds, the dogs not going anywhere.)

Is it out of place for me to address her on this? I’m tired of standing by watching her yell at my boyfriend.

So as the title suggests, I'm starting high school next year, but I don't feel like I have the skill set required to be successful. Mostly because I find it difficult to focus on doing one thing for long periods of time, and I tend to space out right when somebody's saying something pretty important. I also have a hard time staying organized, but I've gotten better at that in recent years. This has me kind of forgetful.

So, due to all of this, I tend to miss a lot of assignments, leading to bad grades and lots of lectures from my parents. It's all so stressful that I end up cramming all of my missing work in one night and then forgetting to do my current work, and the cycle continues.

Insurance companies are taking their sweet time in alloting comprehensive testing as a worthwhile financial undertaking for men. To ensure comprehensive STD testing, tell your doctor you have had sexual partners who are drug users, or otherwise ""high risk"". This will increase the likelihood that insurance companies will fork out the money necessary for care.

The reason I'm here is seeking advice on my situation. 

Currently im a firefighter with 2 departments one being full time and one being part time. I'll refer to the first as station 1 [full time] and the latter as station 2 [part time]. Currently I'm happy in my position at station 1. I'm still pursing a better paid department but other wise am happy. Station 2 is where the advice is needed. Between the two departments my average hours worked per week is a little over 100

Station 2, in January I was promoted to lieutenant. A position i was working hard towards getting and was finally promoted and i was ecstatic. Prior to my promotion I was averaging 80 hours a week of work.  Now with my promotion it's a little over 100. Since being promoted. Me and my ""fiance"" had a falling out where we are no longer engaged. But are still in a relationship. With my current schedule and hers we see eachother for maybe 24 hours a week. Excluding time sleeping. Time spend with my daughter is even less due to a baby sitter requiring a certain amount of days a week. This has been hitting me hard. I've come to the realization that I'm depressed, haven't been eating correctly and have not been at my utmost best. Which ths proffession requires. 

I have the want and desire to be in the position but do not think that ita currently a healthly point in my life to be in the position. 

With this I'm considering a voluntary self demotion. Along with less hours worked per week. Financially I'm stable enough to support myself and my family without the promotion. But will still require my employment at this station. Calculating it out.

They are both behind in maturity and seriously lack common sense.

The 15yo is currently grounded from using her phone because we found out she's talking to complete strangers and would totally be the type to give out her address if anyone asked. I never realized how gulible she was until I read a message where she believed her mom was going to pass away (this was before she did) in 20 days because a stupid chain message said so. She also has a tendancy to act like a child, she's used to being spoiled and getting her way all the time. She gets a bit obsessive and stalker-ish and I've actually had a talk with her about stalking a boy she liked at school. She's obsessed with My Little Pony and her family would feed this obsession, she's made comments that she's an adult but turns around and acts like a child. My 3yo toddler is more mature than she is sometimes.

The 18yo I swear just has no brain sometimes. He sits on his ass all day and I told him he needs to get a job or I'm gonna make him work in the grape fields in the summer. He has no sense of what he wants to do with his life nor how to get out there in the world. Recently he was applying for a few jobs and I over-heard him giving out his debit card information. I thought he was talking to his bank because he was having issues before but after he hung up he said he was talking to a hiring manager claiming that if he goes to and interview and they don't call him that they'll send him $15 for his time and he completely believed it. After all this his phone started blowing up with spam calls.

They are both grounded from the internet since they clearly don't understand internet safety.

When they moved in I had to teach them how to do laundry, sweep, do dishes, mop the floor, everything because they literally didn't know how to do a single thing. They used to live in filth so I had to tell them to start showering regularly and wash their clothes/bedding each week.
They're worse than babies because they already have all these bad habits and tendancies ingrained in their mind.

I offered my insurance details and address but the guy said not to worry we will do it privately instead of through insurers, i offered to notify police for a ref which he didnt want to do either.

I got his first name and number and he got my first name and number but he didnt want or give any addresses, licence details or insurance details and said he would text me when he goes to a garage over the weekend with a quote, i dont even know if he took my reg as he didnt write it down or take any pictures of my car.

I managed to take the picture of his scrarch but didnt get his reg and he left before i had chance,  this is my first incident and have no idea what to do or how to proceed. Im happy to pay privately if its not a overly ridiculous amount and he signs a contract saying iv paid full settlment for any damages and injuries (there was no injuries as he wasnt in the car when this happned) otherwise i will just let my insurance deal with it.

Any advise would be appreciated.",06Mar2019,1

It came to my attention that in reality he was an abusive, alcoholic asshole. 
I spent the next few years arguing with him constantly and hating his guts. 
He is the definition of a sociopath and there isn’t one shred of a doubt in my mind that he is one. 
What I fear the most is becoming like him, or resembling him in any manner. 
I get told on occasion that I’m just like him or that I’m a dick and whatever and it kills me. 
That is the most hurtful thing I have ever come across and the thought of being like him is disgusting to me. I’m scared I’ll end up like him and I don’t want to.

249,"I (16M) don't feel like myself. And I don't mean being more depressed or anything, I honestly don't think that I could be any more than I already am.

Lately, I always just feel dizzy, nauseous, fatigued, and lightheaded. It sometimes feels like I'm in someone else's body; even just laying down somehow feels different. My thumb brushing against my index finger feels completely alien, like someone else is doing it. I feel like I have no control over myself, and that I'm just experiencing reality through someone else. It's not like, ""I'm a female trapped in a male's body,"" or anything like that. I just feel like I'm experiencing a different life. I know it's me when I look in the mirror, but I don't feel like it is. Sometimes I feel like there's no such thing as reality. What if I'm in a coma and imagining this right now?

And on rare occasion, there are voices in my head that aren't my conscience, or at least I don't think they are. They either prevent me from doing things, like taking chances, or they can encourage me to make risky choices. I think this might be a sign of schizophrenia, but I'm not sure. I hope it isn't, what would I do then?

I'm not motivated to do anything at all, even things I should enjoy. I sleep until four in the afternoon when I can. I feel like everything I do is a mistake. I feel like I'm even more shitty of a person than I used to usually feel like. I keep making worse and worse fuckups. I'm having mental breakdowns on the regular. I'm up at three in the morning or later every night. 

I'm completely emotional, and will break out into tears upon any mild inconvenience. I don't want to talk to anyone face-to-face about my problems (I know it's probably necessary, but I feel as if it will only make things worse). My personality varies daily, though it's never quite a positive attitude. 

If I ever do dream, it's always some obscure nightmare. All of my memories of them are foggy, but none of the nightmares made much sense anyway.

My habits can sometimes be self-destructive. I'll harm myself on occasion, typically by cutting, but sometimes with burning or other methods. Sometimes I don't take my anxiety or seizure medications because I feel like that would just kill me somehow. But I also feel like my body depends on them to survive sometimes. I often have suicidal thoughts. How easy would it be to jump off a building? Stab myself in the gut and bleed out? Overdose on medicine? Drink chemicals? Shoot myself? Hang myself? I already know how to tie a noose, for fuck's sake. 

I feel too awkward to bring this up with anyone. Not with my parents, not with any friends, not with a guidance counselor, health teacher, nurse, or anyone. It will just keep gnawing away at me, and I would rather that than try to end up looking like an idiot, being looked down on, or ending up in some psychward. 

What do I do to get out of this? Can I? What is this? My podunk doesn't really offer much of anything. I don't know if I can even get the help I need within hours of my town. And I can't stand therapy. It will be horrible to end up in it or some psychiatric facility. 

**I know some of this just probably sounds like standard teen shit. But it isn't. I've been through that stuff for a long time. The past 3 or so weeks have just been way worse than I could ever have imagined. Probably ten times worse than what I'm used to, which was already a lot.**

*A shorter version of this post was up on r/teenagers last night at three in the morning, if anyone recognizes it. I recently deleted that post, figuring I'd get more help here. Depersonalization and major depression were named as things I most likely have. I'm scared it's worse.*",06Mar2019,2

252,"I'm a high school senior, and I don't feel like I have anyone. I don't have a friend group or anyone I could really call a ""best friend"". More than anything, I feel invisible and unwanted. 

When I was in junior high, people told me I was annoying, so over the next few years I just kind of stopped talking at all. Now, in my fourth year of high school, I don't normally talk to people. The irony of the situation is that I am a state-winning and nationally-qualifying speaker on my Debate team: I can do that, but I can't even talk to my own peers. 

I graduate from high school in a few months and I don't want to keep being the kid who's - well - awkward and lonely. I want people to see who I am and think I'm worth something. I don't like feeling invisible.

They can insult my family, me, my nationality, and I usually don’t feel a thing. 

One time my mother asked me “Do you not have any blood?” which probably meant if I have any guts or balls to stand up to people

People can insult me face to face and I would have no idea how to react. 

They could call me names such as third world hole shithead, cuck, beta, fag, etc. And I wouldn’t do anything. 

One of my ex friends told me he sees me being a cuckold in the future and he doesn’t know why (I’m not into that tho)

And if I reacted I am guaranteed to get beaten up because I don’t know how to defend myself. 

I am probably a doormat. 

I wasn’t taught well on how to be a man, a respectable one. Everybody just insults me, either face to face or behind my back. 

My own best friend talked shit behind me. I blocked him out of my life. And he wants to contact me again (lol?)

When I see guys reacting immediately to an insult and doing something about it I envy them. They know how to use anger and force somebody to respect them. 

Honestly, if I were a girl I wouldn’t date me because I can’t defend her, have self respect and put a barrier between what’s tolerant or not. ",06Mar2019,2
255,"Long story short - I’ve started, changed, left and rejoined college courses in the past - I was not a fan and I thought I’d prefer something more hands on.

Now I’ve got in on an electrical apprenticeship and I’m on a trail period.
I like some of what we’re doing but 90% of it is shitty dogs work, pulling cables in the pissing rain, climbing on the side of scaffolding to reach over and pull a cable.. 
There’s no respect for tradesmen here (my country).. 
Every qualified guy here is telling me to get out and do something else.. 

I sort of want to, I’m doing this with the intention of going into electrical instrumentation. (But there’s apparently an apprenticeship in that anyway! I can just do an add on)

I could just leave and go work in a factory until something comes up, or find some job maybe in tech support, audio equipment, sound systems etc.

I just know my parents will see this as me dropping out of a good opportunity.

Here electricians earn around €40,000 to €55,000 a year, it’s not bad money but you damn well earn it..
As an apprentice I’m working 45 hrs a week for €6 an hour I don’t mind that but the qualified guys are doing the same work for €20 an hour and the work doesn’t really change, it’s just I can’t terminate now, I can’t work on live services or anything like that while they can.

With all the guys telling me to go do something else I’m wondering if it’s a nice way of saying ‘it’s not for you’  they know I did well in school too so maybe that’s why.

Full: In May of 2016 my mom passed away after a battle with cancer. In truth, my mom and I hadn't gotten along for a very long time, and I never really got the chance to make it up to her, to reconcile with her. The years leading up to her passing, my mom and I had just been really standoffish and distant. She went back to work right after she and my dad got a divorce, this was right around the time I was starting up high-school. The only interaction my mom and I would really have around this time would be when school came up, and I stopped caring about my grades after highschool started, leading my mom and I to just be at each other's throats 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime that summer, I started hanging out with my childhood best friend again. Probably around July I invited him over to watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure with me, and we watched the first season over the course of like two days, the second of which we stayed up until maybe 7 in the morning to finish it before we went to sleep. I'd been a huge weeb for years and this was the first time that anyone in my friend group had shared in that with me. I stared showing him a bunch of anime and he ended up more or less living at my house for a month because of that. We started staying up late, playing games together too, eating fast food and drinking energy drinks. It's really chlidish looking back on it, but it was the first time I'd ever done something like that and it felt *amazing*.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't just shit like that though, I started getting him into politics as well. We spent hours ranting about this and that, stuff that, like anime, I had felt really isolated about up until that point. I won't talk about it at any length here, just because politics are inherently so divisive, but for the first time I had someone who wasn't just taking my stances seriously but was agreeing with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

He'd been going through a break-up with a decently long term girlfriend at the time, while also realizing that he was still in love with his girlfriend from before her, and so while he might not have been in quite the same position I was, he still was in a situation where he was looking for someone to rely on, someone to reach out to. It wasn't just that we were hanging out all the time, but I started emotionally opening up to him. It was the first time in my life that I've really felt like I was just... on the same wavelength as someone else. Like... it was all there. We were having the same hobbies, same serious concerns, and even similar emotional states. For a brief window of time, it felt incredible.

&amp;#x200B;

After that month though, I had to go off to college, and... well, it didn't go great. I ended up rooming with this guy who I won't name here for obvious reasons. Really, *really* nice guy... but just not really on the same page as me. Like I said earlier, I'm a huge weeb, and he... well, he wasn't. At all. And that was just... it felt weird. Like, even in what was supposed to be my new home, I couldn't feel comfortable indulging in my hobbies.

  
While all this shit was happening, my grandmother died, and I just wasn't having it. I couldn't take all the emotional stress while also dealing with this new alien environment where I couldn't indulge my hobbies without feeling judged. It felt like a place with no escape. I couldn't take it, so I dropped out and moved back home after about a month of classes. At first it felt pretty good. I started hanging out with my friend again, we were still having our talks and watching anime together, but pretty quickly this started feeling... less rewarding.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am, about a year and a half later, and things have just gotten... so much worse. In the time since the end of 2016, I've done... well, nothing. I don't just mean nothing productive, I didn't even do things I enjoyed anymore. My hobbies started all feeling just... so wrong to me. Chief among them, anime, I can almost feel myself mentally rejecting. My first thought was maybe I was outgrowing it, anime is associated with teenagers for a good reason, but that doesn't feel right. Even adult oriented stuff just feels... wrong in a way that isn't just boredom. It's like I'm actively rejecting it, and it feels just so strange to me.

&amp;#x200B;

My other hobbies, video games and reading history books, don't feel the same way. Watching anime just makes me feel... emotionally strange, but video games and books just leave me feeling nothing. They just do nothing for me anymore, at all. I can try out new games, stuff that I would have never thought to try before: nothing. I can play old favorites: nothing. Same story with history. I can read through some of my favorites again or read something new, and the whole time... nothing, nothing at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I can remember, when I was younger, I was just... so passionate. I can remember even talking to the friend I mentioned earlier about how I knew some people who just seemed to coast through life and how it didn't make sense to me, like I genuinely didn't understand it. Every day, I woke up and I had something I wanted to do. I had some anime that I had to watch, a new book to read, a new game to pop open. It might've mostly been childish passion, but passion nevertheless. Now... I just got nothing. What I used to not be able to understand is exactly what I am now and I can't stand it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I wanted to do for a living when I was younger, what I wanted to do when I got to college, but I knew I wanted to take some classes on history, on cinema studies. I have a book shelf full of whatever few academic texts exist about anime, I have a huge shelf full of all the books on history and the philosophy of history that I own. I wanted to do something with these passions. History jobs are shit and who's going to read cinema studies on Japanese cartoons, but that didn't matter to me, I wanted to at least do something with those hobbies in my life. Something real, concrete. I didn't just want to passively consume, I wanted to interpret, theorize, etc etc. And so now to just... not even enjoy the base stuff, not even enjoy it as a consumer.... it sucks and I feel lost.

&amp;#x200B;

To get away from my hobbies for a minute, I can barely stand being around my friends and family anymore. My dad annoys the shit out of me and the same goes for all my friends. I still have this urge to be social like I used to be, but every time I go to hang out it just feels... so tiring. What used to feel so cathartic, to be connected to other people, I just don't give a shit anymore. We had a day of playing Axis and Allies a few weeks back and the whole time I just wanted to go home.

&amp;#x200B;

I went on a date a few weeks back with who might as well be my dream girl. I can recognize, consciously, that she's interesting, smart, and easily one of the prettiest people I've ever laid eyes on. And yet... nothing, I feel nothing. And I want to feel something, desperately, but I just don't. I can't.

&amp;#x200B;

This is so longwinded and shit at this point, I just needed to write all this down somewhere, and I guess here is as good as anywhere. I've started seeing a therapist as of maybe two months ago. He thinks I have mild depression and I agree (with the second portion of that diagnosis anyway). He said I ought to look into getting some anti-depressants and I need to get signed up for a PCP first but that sounds fine. The therapy isn't working so far though, and I don't think anti-depressants will be enough. What do I need to be doing? I started school again... online as of a few weeks ago. I'll be going to classroom classes starting this summer. It just all feels... too moderate.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been talking about how much I miss all my hobbies and my friends and shit, but like... maybe I just need to reject all that? Maybe I need to start over. Move somewhere and start anew. How though? Is that even a good idea? I know that r/Advice probably shouldn't be used for something this vague... I'm not even sure what advice I'm asking for other than how do I mentally unfuck myself? How do I get past this?

&amp;#x200B;

I just remember 18 year old me, and for all the other things I felt, I felt... right. I felt like I had purpose, direction... I felt like I had things I could lose myself in. I came out of the theater from watching Your Name with tears running down my face and being  physically unable to control my excitement over how good the film was, I couldn't shut up about Suicide Squad for a week because of how deeply it infuriated me. I loved my friends and had huge crushes I got way too emotionally invested in. I miss just being... so passionate, even if it was about stupid shit. How do I get back to being that person, or at least how do I become a person that 18 year old me wouldn't have been ashamed of turning into? How do I stop being a robot?

Sometimes you meet that number and sometimes you don’t. If you don’t, they’ll send you home and put a mark against you. But it’s hard because my lead/manager of my zone puts me in the back and I get all the books that are too old to be scanned or just don’t have an ISBN and I get in trouble for it. Occasionally, I’ll get bin of books that come off the conveyor, that no one grabbed and majority of the books are not able to be scanned or typed in as well. And there is no limit of books people can grab in front of and I’m left w no work. It’s to the point where I feel I can’t perform my job’s task properly because of this. I try to explain that to the head boss and they’ll compare me to someone else who does better. My boy who got me this job has explained on numerous occasions, that the leads will give people shitty positions to make them quit and there is also daily favoritism being committed supposedly but I kinda don’t see it as much..

I've been with her for four months now and I haven't really had these suspicions until now. He's constantly talking to her whenever he gets the chance, he's always asking when she's coming to town next (she lives in the town over so I only see her on weekends) so that he can see her. Also at a few recent parties I've gone to with them he's always had his eye on her and constantly asking me questions about her and our relationship. He's also at one point ""jokingly"" put his arm around her at a party and at first she leaned into him to just tease me but quickly tried to lean away and he kept his arm around til I told him to fuck off. Now keep in mind he has a girlfriend himself, and she's shown distrust in him being around her even from the start of our relationship. Even though he's constantly reassured her he doesn't have a thing for her, me and her do not believe him. Should I just straight up confront him on this? Or should I just wait this out and see if it resolves itself. I'm so unsure of what to do.

We were talking for about two weeks and then I ask her out because I just wanted to make her happy. She said yes. We took a break over winter break because I had so much going on. She texts me, “can this break be over?”  I reply “sure”. (I know it sounds super unenthusiastic but I was exhausted). I guess that she forgot that we ended the break because she doesn’t really talk to me at all. 

The problem. 

Prom is coming up and I want to ask a different girl but am not sure if this relationship is over. On a bus to a school event I had to sit across the isle from her and she showed me a note that said “Do you miss us?” Does that mean that the relationship is over?

269,"Obligatory ""On mobile, sorry for errors.""

I honestly don't know how to start this. Iźm afraid you'll all think me silly, but here goes. TL;DR is title.

My long-distance boyfriend and I have been going out for almost a year. I know rhat's not a long time, but I don't take very long to fall deeply in love with someone. I've been through a lot of rough patches in my life, and for this most recent rough patch/growing moment (it was intentionally going to be a learning experience from the start), my boyfriend was there. I know you're all thinking ""Idiot girl, falling in love during a rough patch. That's the worst time to get together,"" and yeah, I agree ... but I couldn't help it. It wasn't just about him being nice to me, or us doing cool things together, either. Something he did or was just ... resonated with me. He was gentle and kind and understanding to everyone ... it was a trait I really admired.

I couldn't resist bringing it up one day, that I had a crush on him. He mentioned liking me back, so I panicked and listed off all the reasons he shouldn't date me. Every bad habit, horrible thing I'd done in my past, how broken I was, etc. For the sake of the narrative, I will need to list some here (depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD with a refusal to take meds [but a willingness to go to therapy], an outright worrywart/clingy nature [that I'm constantly working on toning down], and a constant need to apologize for everything [part of my OCD, and something I was working on overcoming when this took place]) Miraculously, he was undaunted. He wanted to try it out, and see where things led.

We considered ourselves and actual couple a few months later, but things started to go downhill. What used to be near-constant messaging, and calling whenever we got the chance became less, and less frequent. I would panic, I didn't know if he was mad or had been hurt or what. I confronted him about it (practicing my communication skills for my program) he'd mentioned that was back in the 'honeymoon phase,' and that he was just tired of people and needed some time to himself every now and again. I accepted this (after all, I knew I was too clingy, and that this would probably be for the best). I did ask for his work schedule, though, so I could know when he was available or not (honestly just wanted to know when to start panicking after not hearing from him. Again, I am clingy/a worrywart) 

Over the course of our relationship, communication has continued to degrade in an ebb and flow, partially in relation to me speaking out. Partially in relation to his cycles of depression. Because he manages a retail location, Christmas and the holiday season were the absolute worst. There came a point he would only really talk at night unless it was playing games with a mutual group of friends. I cried and told him I was scared for him and his wellbeing (both physical and mental, at the time). He promised me he would see a doctor. He never makes promises to me, because he's afraid he won't keep them (or so he says), but the one promise he's made, he hasn't kept.

After these talks, he always seems so incredibly falsely jovial it hurts. I think it's because we both know the reason he doesn't communicate well is his depression, and he wants me to not worry ... but the acting only makes me worry more.

He's also excessively kind and accommodating, it seems, after I bring up my concerns. He doesn't just do the bare minimum I ask for (calling at night and messaging at least a bit during the day, just to see how things are going), he'll message more frequently, oblige me in what I call ""presence calls"" (because we're LD and can't read books together, we get in a Discord call and sit quietly while doing our own thing, just because it feels nice to me) even though he doesn't get why I like them, and will generally spend more time with me than usual. It's not as much as when we first started dating, but it feels nice.

There are also the times where he doesn't feel depressed, or does little things that make me go ""Wow, he loves me."" Like one morning he was getting off the call (we do overnight presence calls, this was one of my ""requirements"", per se). He knows if I wake up early enough I like to see him, but this some I didn't wake up on time. He also knows that I typically wake up after ai hear the Discord disconnect sound. So, what does he do? He disconnects, waits a moment, and reconnects as I'm typing my, ""Sorry I missed you. Love you.
,"" and said hi to me for a few minutes before leaving to get ready for work. He does a lot of those little things. 

Unfortunately, it's the beginning of March now, but I'm already getting Christmas vibes again. He's withdrawing a lot. On Sunday I woke up to no message from him (usually he leaves a message when he leaves the call in the morning) and didn't hear a word from him for six hours. Which doesn't sound like a lot, and definitely isn't unusual for when he works, but he wasn't working that day. I ended up calling his cell number (something we rarely do, as we try to keep to Discord) for him to respond. Even then, he would 't tell me what was up. He just despondent told me he was spending time alone, and proceed to not message me for another two hours.

I don't mind giving him time alone, but I would live to know about it. The thought running through my head the were ""Oh god, he's dead, or someone in his family is dead, or his house burned down, etc."" I mentioned be could have let me know, and he said he wasn't used to communicating things like that, which I get. Not everybody is used to dealing with me. But it still hurt.

As a brief aside, I know my boyfriend has depression because of how he describes himself, and the world around him. He talks about not feeling anything at all, he doesn't know what to do with his life. Everything he tries to think about things other than work or sleep or eating, he says his brain gets clouded and foggy, nothing is clear. He talks about being apathetic to everything, and he's not used to putting so much effort into anything (which, to me, makes the effort he does put in all the more invaluable). 

I've pointed out several times that he has depression, that a doctor or therapy or meds would help, but nothing has been done. I've refrained from waving the ""promise"" card around, because it's the only promise I have, and I don't want to make him regret giving it to me, but I don't know what else to do.

Twice this week, he has mentioned how he doesn't know if he wants to be with me anymore, because he just doesn't know what he wants. I don't know what to do anymore. 

If he wants to just be friends, and tells me so, I'm willing to walk and still be friends, for his sake. Because I love him and if I'm part of his misery, I will happily remove myself. All I want is for him to be happy and content. I will find my peace eventually, if that is the case.

I don't think I can walk out on my own/for my own sake. Right now, I don't even want to. I just want for him to get to the therapist, get his thoughts worked out, get some meds if he needs to, and I'll be here while he figures it out. If he needs me/wants to involve me, great. If not, I'm willing to be patient (agonizing as it is). 

But neither of thise are happening. He won't let me go, but he won't get help, and I'm so scared of the uncertainty of potential future pain I'm withering away. I know it's only been a few days but my mind won't let it rest.

A good summary of how things are right now, from the conversation on Sunday:

Him: I don't know how to feel
i'm not really the type of person to put much effort into something like this

Me: I know, and I think every day about how lucky I am to have someone who's willing to work with me and my silly eccentricities.
You've done a lot more than you give yourself credit for

Him: even still I can't deny lately I've felt less lovey dovey and I don't know why

Me: If you don't like me anymore, I'll understand.
But it may be depression/stress/exhaustion related

Him: I just don't know
because I mostly feel fine otherwise
and actually work went pretty well yesterday and I felt great in most aspects
but i guess that only lasts for so long? idk

Me: It still may be there, latent. It happens all the time.
If you have depression, it doesn't just go away, even if things are going well

Him: it's just really frustrating because like
I know I have it
and I know I should do something about it
and I know you remind me to do something about it every chance you can basically
and I appreciate that
but at the same time I hate it
because I don't have the strength to actually get the help
it's not as easy as just scheduling an appointment
I have a huge mental roadblock

... (conversation progresses)

Me: Will you promise me to tell me if you find you don't love me anymore?

Him: yes, but I don't think it's that... i still care a lot but I'm just having a lot of issues mentally it's like a swarm of a bunch of bullshit at all times...",06Mar2019,1

271,"A few months ago, my parents saw the ""unhealthy"" amount of time that I was spending playing video games, and decided that it was appropriate to make a change, which in their case was the Disney Circle, a form of lazy parenting that allows moderators to control and manage time spent on certain devices, which included my Xbox.  As someone who uses video games as an escape from life and school, this was really hard for me to deal with, as I struggled to deal with my 3 hour time limit for the entire weekend.  My anger and sadness at this new change was evident, and it grew to the point where the Disney circle was causing me to be unhappy and unmotivated.  Every day, as I came home from school, my diminished video game gave me nothing to look forward to, and my grades slowly slipped, despite me still caring about school.  Eventually, I grew tired of their lazy parenting, and I began to grow angry at the sheer way that they disrespected me and my favorite hobby.  Out of boredom, I started smoking weed (a very good choice), but apart from that struggled to find anything else to do that truly interested me (apart from Sports).  At a certain point, I would just come home from school and sit in the dark watching youtube off a hotspot until it was time to go to bed, which happened at earlier and earlier times.  

&amp;#x200B;

All through this, my parents were indifferent.  The circle was their solution to a problem that they identified, one that was never really a problem to begin with.  I started trying to find ways to bypass and override their rules, and was challenged every step of the way, to the point where new devices on our internet were blocked immediately.  I began to have harsh and horrible arguments with them, which often ended with both sides angry and hurt.  From their perspective, I slightly understand it, but I just have no way to approach them and help them understand how much this is affecting my life in a negative way.

272,"My room mate is an angry, self loathing, unconfident, unmotivated, narcissistic, lazy person. Yet he is racist, sexist, and feels like he is better than other people at the same time. And that’s not even the worst of it.

We knew each other in high school but we were just mostly friends through friends. I have tried to help him for years and he just doesn’t change. 

He is almost 30 and now just finally got a permanent job, and is a virgin. He plays video games with nearly all of his free time. And goes on countless 1st and 2nd dates with women and I mean countless like probably hundreds by now. He wants a girl so badly but won’t improve anything about himself, he wonders why he can’t get a woman but it’s all his personality. He has anger issues and I have told him he needs to figure out his anger because even the most insignificant inconvenience in his life will always become an event of rage or bitching and he will often cuss and hit objects. He hates the gay and women’s rights movements and has been in arguments with me about it. He is so racist that he wouldn’t even go to his friends house because he lived near an ETHNIC  food market, claiming he didn’t want his car broken into. He is an ignorant republican ( the kind that thinks trump can do no wrong ) He never gives anything to the group or to me of any value. 

He is incapable of being able to shoot the shit, everything needs to be a serious topic and about him. He sucks the energy out of every room he is in and it’s making my relationships with my friends and girlfriend suffer. I recently found out he is into some really brutal women hating porn where women are beaten. And my girl friend doesn’t want to come to my place anymore now. 

I’m in a lease with him for a while longer. What should I do about him. Should I help him? Or should I just let him figure his own life out and distance myself?
I needed a room mate at the time but have been promoted since and he is just so different from me. He is basically the same person he was in high school and never learned how to act in the adult world.

276,"[tl;dr no sense of closure with ex who is now dating someone new, still ""friends""]

Dated a girl for 2.5 years, enlist in the mil during the relationship to gain skills for financial stability, shes on board then not then is then not and after a year of this ship date comes up. She's bummed from the day it's brought up, moves out eventually after I actually enlist but we stay together until the last second. I sleep over for one last date night, she's a wreck the next morning knowing I'm about to leave. We both hate it but think it's probably best. 

Exchanged letters at boot camp, I finally graduate and come home on boot leave, met up for dinner and that turns into staying at her apartment for 5 days straight. It's not just hooking up like my last ex, she's acting almost like we're a thing again. One of the last days of leave she says ""I love you, I just do, I can't help it"".

I leave for a month of more training and she's sad that time too. Msgs me asking for me to list my negative traits to make her feel better as a joke. 

As soon as I get my phone back she's in my inbox. but says she's been seeing someone for a couple of weeks by this point early in the conversation. 

Still always tagging me in stuff, sending me pics of her cat, etc. and I can't help feeling like there was no real closure. she didn't do anything wrong it's just a weird situation to be in from my end. I miss what we had, it was the best relationship I've ever had, no fighting, no jealousy, fun to be around, flirting well past the honeymoon phase. 

She seemed genuinely excited when I mentioned that I'd be coming home in a couple of weeks, but I don't know if she wants to see me or if that'd even be a good idea.

I know the smart thing is to stop initiating contact and unfollow on social media and move on silently. I know the adult thing is to talk to her not about my feelings right now but the lack of closure, etc. and I know what I'm really tempted to do is some stupid romantic gesture in an attempt to pull her out of her new relationship with me to my next duty station.

First I want you to know nobody is safe from disappearing any day, so be thankful as life can escape in an instant. Enjoy everysingle moment of it.   


3 weeks ago I was diagnosed with Meningite, and unlucky for me the rarest and most violent one, the W type. I had a 1/2 chance of surviving and less than 10% chance of getting out of this with aftereffects. But I made it thanks to my young body and an amazing team of medicals in the resucitation aisle of my hospital.   
The effects of this illness were the following ; septic shock, purpura on both arms and legs, loss of almost all of my brain functions, torturing headaches, 40° fevers, conciousness troubles, loss of sight, deafness, the list goes on and on..   


I'm seeing life from a different angle from now on knowing that I'm a miracle of medecine as cases of people getting out of this without aftereffects are extremely rare.   
I just want to say that a vaccin I did in 2014 againt general Meningite might be the thing that saved my life. **Vaccinate your kids and yourself**, it is life changing in some cases and I didn't think one second I would be struck by something so rare and dangerous once in my life.   


I was suicidal before that and realized life might have been sending me a message. Life is beautiful, love as much as you can, live as much as you can because you never know what tomorrow is made of.

285,"so i’m 19. i’m in college. i don’t have a car on my campus, my parents gave it to my younger brother when i left because he got his license yeah blah blah blah. basically i got an offer from my dad, i stay home and commute to school and in order to commute i’d need a car. room and board is like 10,000 where i go. it would be cheaper for me to get a car and commute then to stay on campus. so my dad offered up that option, stay home and get a car or stay on campus but don’t get a car. 

so at first glance it’s kinda simple, get the car and stay home. duh. but it gets slightly more complicated. so my dad told me to apply for housing anyways, you can get the deposit back until like may and i wanted to see if i could get a single. lo and behold, i got my actual dream room at school. nicest dorms on campus, single, my own bathroom, high ceilings because it’s the top floor, all that fancy shit.  i’m going to be a sophomore but i wanted this room since the day i started looking at my college. plus i have a boyfriend that is staying at the local community college, i’ll explain that a little more in a sec. but basically if we’re both home that means no alone time and that’s just generally annoying, we both have siblings, he has an overbearing mom, it’s just... a lot. i also would be within 5 minutes of all of my good friends!

my argument for staying at home is the car and the boyfriend. easier to spend time with him, i get a car, i get to be home with my cat all the time, home cooked meals instead of microwaved ones. it seems great! (for reference i live about 45-60 minutes away from school but usually am able to get fridays off of classes) i know if i work at home though i’ll also have to have a job. which brings me to my next point that complicates this whole freakin thing.

i just got a job. i’m very happy and lucky and BLESSED to have gotten this job. however, it’s not a lot of hours. it’s like every other weekend on saturdays and sundays for like 5 hours max. but they offer weekday hours, but it’s somewhat of a weekly class thing and u can’t really have substitutes. so i would need 1-2 days a week to be able to teach this class. i’d need to train for it this summer and it runs for the entire school year. it’s kind of difficult to explain. but if i wanted more hours at this job i would need to stay home. commuting once again. but i’m also not sure if i wanna work during the week during the school year, weekends are already a lot. i already take quite a few online classes where the work is due sundays at midnight. 

i don’t know if maybe this is a lot more clear to anyone who may read this, and if you did read the whole thing i appreciate it! i’d love your input!

BOTTOM LINE
i don’t know whether or not to commute or stay at school

Pros of commuting:
•new car
•see boyfriend more often
•more hours at work (?)

Pros of staying at school:
•dream dorm
•alone time with boyfriend
•with all my friends. ",06Mar2019,2

294,"My reasons for wanting to emigrate:

&amp;#x200B;

* Environmental issues. I live on a 21 square kilometer island that is overpopulated and naturally full of cars. Countryside is getting covered with concrete and the smell of car exhaust is everywhere. You can't even escape to the little countryside left because there's construction waste being dumped illegaly.
* Over-population. See above. But to add to those problems, there's being stuck in traffic and a severe lack of parking spaces everywhere you go, and trash dumped everywhere because there's too many people. And those are only SOME of the issues with overpopulation. There's 500 000 people living in my country already, and the government keeps importing thousands of people under the guise of paying for people's future pensions.
* Too much 3rd world immigration. Though there are no statistics, non-natives have to be numbering at about 35% right now. I have seen society change for the worse to the point where I don't recognise my own country anymore. I'm fine with the Polish, and the Italians, and the Spanish, and the Greeks and the English and the Serbians. But for some reason (gee can't imagine what that might be) the government seems to favour 3rd world workers from the Philppines, Pakistan, India, Africa. They have the privilege of being in a kind of trilingual country yet they cannot communicate with natives well because they don't bother to learn any other language. Besides that, their culture is terrible, misogynistic, uneducated, and they'll remain that way for generations to come. And I have seen many examples of this with my very own eyes. 
* I never quite fit in with native Maltese anyway even though I am 100% Maltese. I favoured English since I was very young, and as they say: when you adopt a new language you adopt a new culture. Many Maltese are quite closed minded and have a mentality that everything goes as long as it doesn't affect them. I don't relate to anyone who is not from my generation and educated.
* Corruption on every level of society. Seriously. Google 'Malta corruption'.

300,"So, I'm a college freshman living in an on-campus apartment. There's 6 of us in the apartment and the subject of this post is my roommate. Since President's Day Weekend until now, she has been having sex with her boyfriend in the bathroom... and they are LOUD. And not in the way you think.

What's LOUD is them hitting the wall or tub so hard that it feels like the whole entire building is shaking from my room (which shares a wall with the bathroom). \*Imagine someone stomping on carpet for 30 minutes.\*

I swear, the first time they did it, it woke me up from sleep (because they usually wait until everyone in the apartment is done with the bathroom and **they do their thing around 12 or 1 AM**). I seriously thought they were moving furniture in the living room.

But just now (it's like 1AM rn) they did it AGAIN. IDEK HOW MANY TIMES it has happened, but I haven't let it bother me until now. I've been in bed doing HW, listening to music with earbuds (not AirPods because im brOKe) but I HEAR THE BANGING. So I TURN the music up because I  reALLY don't wANT TO HEAR IT. **BUT THEN, I STARTED HEARING IT THROUGH THE MUSIC BECAUSE I GUESSSS THEY WANTED TO GO EXTRA HARD TODAY OR SMTHNG**. AND I GOT REALLY IRRITATED FOR THE FIRST TIME. Note that I'm a really passive person, but I had the BIGGEST URGE to kick on the door and tell them OFF.

But I'm on the top bunk and didn't feel liked climbing down, so I didn't. So that's that.

Also, knowing me, I would probably write a sticky note telling them to stop. So that's that.

302,"So im experiencing a terrible dilemma. In January my boyfriend and I rescued/adopted a wonderful dog. He was underweight, had fleas, wasn’t spayed, no microchip and had no collar when he was found. The shelter told us they found him in KY (we live in central OH, so not close) and we thought nothing of it. We love this dog. And every so often we just wonder who could have abandoned him on the side of the road and how long he was out there for? Because he’s so sweet and well trained. 

Welp, I couldn’t sleep tonight and I decided to look up “lost dogs in Kentucky” which led me to a flyer of a dog who looks identical to ours with the same general descriptions. I haven’t had a chance to fully inspect the dog to see if the photo matches. But what should we do? Should we contact the people? We’ve had him for 6+ weeks and his name is different. I guess I’m torn because if my little dog went missing I’d want her back. Any advice would be nice. ",06Mar2019,5

It woke me up and so begins my night of hell. It takes me a while to fall back asleep, and while trying to fall asleep, my roommate starts having sex with some guy. I was completely awake and it kept me up and now it’s 4:30am and I have class in 4 hours and running on 2 hours of sleep. They eventually stopped but I can’t fucking fall back asleep. I need to talk to her about this in the morning because it really can’t happen again.

305,"We never had a blow up fight or anything, but about a year and half ago I cut off contact with a very close friend. She wasn't a terrible person or anything, but our friendship was growing very toxic. She had severe anxiety and depression. I tried everything to get her help - dragging her to the psychologist, contacting doctors I knew on her behalf, letting her parents know, trying to arrange meetings with psychologists for her, etc. She was unreceptive to it all, which felt really frustrating. I also felt like I was being controlled. She once threatened suicide because I didn't respond to her texts fast enough. Add to that she was very negative, never listened to me talk about anything in my life, and seemed to resent it whenever I was successful. At that point I gave up. It felt like nothing I did helped her and being around her just made me miserable. Looking back, I think I did make the right decision for myself, but I also know she took it very hard - her greatest fear is being abandoned, and that's basically what I did. 

Fast forward a year and half. I hear that she's been diagnosed with cancer. Despite everything that happened between us, I still do care about her and we shared six and a half years of close friendship. What should I do? I want to reach out to her and there might be something I could do (ex: donating money, being a donor medically). I think deep down she desperately craves care/support and might want someone her age around, since she doesn't have a lot of close friends. And I really don't want her to be alone during this time with no one but her parents (who she has a meh relationship with for understandable reasons, aka they're not the most empathic) and maybe one or two other friends. I honestly feel really horrible and sad for her and I would love to do anything to help her during this time. But I'm afraid she might have a strong emotional reaction to me re-entering her life. And I'm also hearing through the grapevine that she doesn't want anything to do with me/probably doesn't want me to know, which I totally understand. But if there's any way I can help donate money or be a donor medically I'm more than willing and would feel awful if I never contributed or got tested to see if I could fit the profile for donation/make a difference in her life. And I don't want her to feel utterly abandoned during this time. I honestly don't know what to do... Help please :(

307,"I've never been the type of person that has a ""best friend."" I've always had a very small group of friends whom I hang out with but after h.s and with college and my bf, those friendships faded away. I felt I was the only one trying to hang out after we finished h.s and just slowly gave up when my friends grew up and made their own life. Fast forward to about 3 years ago or so I graduated college and got a job in an office. There I met my best friend (Aurora), I'd never met anyone with such similar characteristics as myself. My bf has become my best friend and therefore I've never cared to make my own friends I hang out with him, him and his friends or my sister. 
Aurora started asking to hang out side of work and so we did and then we had out boyfriend's meet and they had so much in common. My bf began to get super close to her bf and so double dates were always super awesome and never a drag. We started doing simple things as going to eat together randomly the four of us, cooking at each other's place, going to do simple groceries together and just driving around town when bored. I got super comfortable with Aurora and her bf and they did with us. When hanging out money was never an issue, we were all so close we'd discuss finances like if we should eat at a cheaper restaurant or sometimes we would pay and they paid the next time. I began to see Aurora as a sister more than a friend and my bf saw her bf as a brother. 
One day we are out eating at our favorite restaurant and me and my bf mention that we came to the restaurant last week with his dad to thank him for helping us pick out a car we had recently purchased. Aurora looked at me pissed and said I can't believe you guys came with out us! So that's how it's going to be! And I laughed it off thinking she must be joking and I defended our side.
 A thing to note about Aurora is that she has a temper she will not stay quiet about anything, which can be hard for many to deal with. At work customers complain she has a heavy attitude but I've learned to deal with her because she can be reasoned with as long as you chill her out first. I'm also a person easily angered but unlike her I think before I speak and don't have outburst like her. 
Anyways her bf joins in and says yeah guys that's messed up in a joking way and we move on. At work the next week she tells me if we ever go to that restaurant to eat, at least invite them even if they say no and I say ok I'll do that next time. After that when we want to go we would message them and invite them, it was almost always a no.
A couple weeks ago we inivte them to a movie and they agreed so I bought the tickets in advance. Me and my bf always go to the movies and invite them and they always come. She texts me last minute that they won't make it and so I cancel their tickets and we still go. Me and her text every day, that day I did not text back after telling her ok no prob, and that's it. I was pissed. Other incidents have happened were they started doing shit like this to us but today just did it for me. 
We're having lunch at work and she tells me they went to the restaurant she made a big deal about me and my bf not going without them, without us! Didn't even think to inivite us. Then they went to me and my bfs favorite store, another thing we all use to do after going to eat there. I was in shock! They are not the type of couple that like to do their own thing they prefer to have other people around so it's not because they wanted to have alone time which I would understand. And she gives us some very stupid rule but it's okay for them to go eat in that restaurant and do what they want. I was super pissed as she was talking and you could tell by her expression she caught herself too late and knew she messed up by telling me. Thing I don't understand is why they are pushing me and my bf away. We are both very hurt because this is one of many things they've done. I said nothing in the moment because I was super mad and wanted to cool down before I confronted her and asked her. Now that a couple hours have passed I'm not sure if I should even talk to her knowing how angry she gets. All I want to know is did we do something wrong? Why are we not hanging out like before? At the same time when stuff like this happened to past friendships i let them go and thought if I meant something to them they would at least talk to me before alienating me. Now with her I love her like a sister and can't see my life without her but I know this confrontation depending on her could end our relationship because I won't be screamed at or made feel less and if she says anything in our talk that I'm not okay with I'll pull the plug and walk away. She on the other hand expects to be able to go off on people and fix it later but I'm not like that. 

What do I do? Do I face her or let more time pass and see how it all plays out?
   
Sorry posting from my phone! 

Tldr; My best friend, her bf, me and my bf hung out every weekend or whenever we were free. Never has there been drama within the four of us.

308,"I apologize for the length of this post and any spelling/grammar errors. I am feeling desperate for advice and need to get this off my chest, because it seems no one understands how I’m feeling. My (22F) parents are in their early 50s and due to self-employment and prior military time, they are now both retired. They are looking for a home to move into over 1,000 miles away from where I live and work. Throughout my 4 years in college (a 90 minute drive from their home), they never once drove out to visit me. I ALWAYS had to travel to my hometown on the weekend in order to see them. I know they were busy with working 40+ hours a week and taking care of my brother (18M), so I understand they couldn’t just drop everything to go visit me. After college, I stayed in the city because I am stuck in a contract with a hospital that gave me a grant for school (I owe them 2 years of service in return). Now, my parents have found a home they want to buy and are planning to move away within the next 6 months to a year. They apparently just assumed I was moving with them (even though I have told them I can’t right now for many reasons they were already aware of). I am dating/living with my boyfriend of almost 2 years. He wants to stay in the city we currently reside and work in, and eventually wants to move near his hometown (4 hour drive in the opposite direction). I am torn between following my parents, leaving my entire life and all my friends (and boyfriend of 2 years) behind, just to be with my parents who never visited me when I was only 90 minutes away. Or I could stay here with my boyfriend, knowing I will basically never see my family again. This is causing me a ton of stress and anxiety, and I have considered both options. I still am not sure what to do. As my parents age I know it will be more difficult as they will need to be cared for but if I stay here, I will likely start my own family which would be unfair to uproot in order to move in and take care of my future elderly parents. Sorry for such a long and unorganized post, I’m stressing so much and need some advice. Thank you",06Mar2019,2
309,"I gave birth at a hospital 1 year ago. Im pregnant again and remembering giving birth the first time and decided I should send a complaint.

I need to know if what I experienced was normal behavior from doctors and nurses so I know how to explain the complaint and be taken seriously.

Key points:

- Epidural was extremely painful. I'm not exaggerating. I felt like it was shoved into my back with no prior numbing.


- the anesthesia doctor made rude comments such as ""If you're in pain well it's your fault you got pregnant this early"" and the nurses agreed. ""you haven't seen nothing yet of what's to come"" ""if your husband was here and saw the needle he'd die"" and the nurses also joined in and I shut up scared if I replied they'd be more mean.


- The epidural didn't work after 2 hours so I felt excruciating pain and got no support from them other than my husband. Is it normal for no nurse to be in the room with you?


- after I gave birth they left me in the labor room for many hours. I believe I gave birth at 4 am and they finay got me to my room at 4 pm. It was a vip room we had booked before. They kept denying it was mine event hough my dad was waiting there for me for 2 hours.


- in the labor room they kept ignoring me if I wanted water, a charger, the remote, simple things while waiting.


- one nurse got really frustrated with me simply because I was unable to urinate and she used the catheter on me but she made comments like ""You didn't pee yet?! Ughhhh!""


- after my sons circumcision we had to see a child surgeon to take the bandage off his genitals because it was wrapped and tied twice on him and kept bleeding. So they had to cut the cloth off which was into his skin.


I don't know if these are all normal things that don't require a complaint. But it made me feel like I never want to give birth there again because I felt like a burden and was bullied. ",06Mar2019,1

I was working on commission and was told I would be paid every second week.

The company I work for is definitely a known company but the office they set up in my city was very new - think it opened September last year. The inappropriate manager got fired and the regional manager took over the office for a few days then left back to the main office. 

I really wanted to quit but didn't want to until after I had been paid. When i pushed the regional manager he found out that my initial manager never filled my bank account paper work. So I refilled it out and sent it in. 

So pretty much my branch is closed and when I call the main office they are friendly and say they'll give my number to someone who deals with pay but no one has actually called me back.

315,"Let's begin with some context first:

I'm a 19 year old undergrad studying Information Technology while working a full-time job at a prestigious international fashion brand as a business analyst making about $3700 a year. I know that sounds way below the poverty line, however in my country of residence - Georgia - it's actually considered an average income. For scale, a 1 bedroom apartment in the middle of a city is about $150 a month and a dinner in a fancy restaurant will set you back about $60. Considering the fact that I live with my parents, the money is all mine to spend and I'm quite well-off. 

Now, the reason I'm considering downgrading is because this is a dead-end job with no more room for self-improvement or salary increase. One of my professors has offered me a 6-month internship in a data warehouse of a major bank with a promise of a full-time employment after.  The salary would be nearly half of what I'm making during the internship but more after 6 months. So, that would be a big con as I wouldn't be able to save as much anymore and I'd have to pull back on some of my expensive hobbies such as robotics.

I dont know what to do.

Where i go to school there are these two guys who always just generally fuck around and stuff.

They dont give a fuck about anything and they're the type to laugh at anything that would offend the next guy. Last year they were pretty fine i guess because i just played handball with them. not directly, theres a somewhat large group of people that i play handball with and they just lurk around there. they'd jokingly say stuff like that im 'target practice' and laugh, but thats fine because its whatever and i dont really care but then they just keep doing it and targeting me for fun. Its still just teasing, or at least thats what i thought/think of it because thats the way that they acted. They just refer to each other for approval on whatever dumb shit they're doing and just agree with themselves. Like they'd do something to annoy me and then when i act annoyed they'd make some bullshit excuse like: what? or something like im being a baby. I dont know if im taking it too seriously but ive found it hard to stop thinking about it and i dont want them to tell me what my feelings are. Ive got pretty angry at them before and then they just acted so annoyed and hurt because i shouted at them and i practically threw a tantrum. Its the start of the school year and they dont play handball with us anymore but they'll just wander over to lurk there for a while and laugh and then tease me or not. I dont feel like im getting bullied because they're not directly assaulting me verbally or physically. or its just that they make it seem so casual. example is that about 2 days ago one of them apparently forgot their lunch and asked for my hot cross bun and i said no. and then they just said some bullshit like: ""come on"" and then they talked to each other and one of them came up next to me and then said something about his dick while putting his arms out and then took it and then they laughed like it was the funniest joke ever and then they threw it at my back and said ""catch"" as it hit the ground. They and a lot of other kids in my class who aren't as bad id say, they'd sometimes jokingly slap my ass because they knew it annoyed me and id get pissed but that was it. The two of them kind of do the same thing by like stroking my leg jokingly for a second because they know it annoys me. and they sat next to me while i was eating my lunch and i stood up. took the guy who did its(and took the bun thing before) school cap and walked to a bin and threw it in. Then he got So fucking pissed and started saying: ""What the fuck!"" and started pushing me. I dont know why but i kind of just took it until he walked away and then as i walked somewhere nearby but not there, to eat my lunch (which i didn't) they started teasing or something about how they're 'bullying me'. and as i walked to one of my classes later that day i heard one of them say something so i could hear it like: ""oH Noo im gItTing buLLied"" or something. but whenever i say what the heck they just say that i got the details wrong and it was something else. or it wasnt that bad.

Well we hung out and that went well I thought(I never tried to make a move because I'm not an asshole and we were getting to know eachother) fast forward a couple weeks of her going back and forth between I want to go out on a real date, but I'm just so busy(which was bs because she had previously told me multiple times she blows of social things just to watch movies) 

So I told her either she stops trying to lead me on or we go on a real date. 

Well I was in the middle of getting a tattoo and she decided she was in town so she wanted to have a quick date to get it out of the way, so she stopped by. We finished up the session and we went to sonic and to drive around(previously decided) in the middle of the date she said she felt sort of sick and wanted to go back to her car so she could go home. At this point we were near my house and I felt sick too, so I stopped at the house to vomit, didnt vomit. Just felt nauseous. Took her back to her car. She jumps me and tries making out (too aggressively and it felt like she was eating my face) and I lightly push her off me and end the this terrible excuse for a ""date"".

She never said anything straightforward, just a kind of 'ehh I wanna go home I'm not feeling well' I took that as her just complaining. Because I asked her if she wanted the date to be over and she said no, I asked if she felt uncomfortable she said no. 

After all this all I can assume is that she was upset because she got rejected and told everyone I was a creep. 

Advice needed to get out of this slump. 

Tl;dr. Girl at work(no longer works there) told everyone i was a creep after a crap date, so now they think I'm a psychopath. I also pretty much stick to my work til I clock out and pretty much ignore everyone. But I dont want people to think I'm a psychopath, what to do? ",06Mar2019,11

Hey.

I am in final year of university, I'd only have a couple of months left until I graduate. I've been working on my final year project for a couple of months now and while it is interesting it is super difficult since it's a research project. Also, its pretty unconventional, so not really what companies in my field would expect. I've been trying to work on a specific issue for a couple of months now that I don't seem able to figure out. It's extremely hard and there is no one I could ask. I need progress to work on my dissertation and if I can't figure it out my dissertation will lack content. To get my desired overall grade, I'd just need to pass my project and my dissertation but I am not sure if I am able to since there's not a lot I can write in my dissertation because I can't figure that one issue out. I talked to my supervisor but he said he couldn't tell me where I stand. He doesn't seem particularly worried though. I'd just need to do well in my two other modules and pass my project to get my desired grade but I've got no idea where I stand with my project and I fear if I can't figure that one issue out I won't pass because there's nothing to write about. And I wouldn't get my desired overall grade then, which I would need.

I could take a year out, work on a different project next year, maybe do an internship in my desired field in summer and then graduate next year. I am just really unsure what to do since a part of me really wants to graduate this year. 

Do I keep trying to figure that one issue out I was working on, even though it seems kind of hopeless, or do I just defer.

I've got about 8 weeks left until the deadline where I'd need to hand everything in. Do I keep trying? And how do I bring up the motivation? Part of me just wants to call it quits as well since it's extremely tiresome and frustrating.

351,"I recently moved from a coastal tourist town to the city in order to continue my studies and am currently living rent-free at relative's place. It's only me and a housemate who's been renting here for a couple of years.

Since she's been here longer and actually pays to live here, I do my best to stay out of her way and keep everything except my toiletries and kitchen-y stuff in my room. I even bought my own cooking oils and containers for leftovers so I wouldn't use hers.

But I guess she must not feel the same, coz she keeps using my stuff. She used up my conditioner and other shower junk, nicked my containers, and eats my food.

This one is a minor nitpick, but she will often have people over and play music fairly loudly, which is to be expected since one of her jobs is DJing. It's really awkward not really being able to walk around my house without having to worry about a stranger being there.

A not so minor nitpick is that she's been putting off getting someone to fix the hot water. I'm mute and living off of youth allowance so I can't sort that out. I also have nowhere else I CAN shower while she has a car and stays away from home for several days at the drop of a hat.

I also learnt from the relative who's place I'm staying at that she is behind on rent. Like, five figures behind. She has two jobs and has several wardrobes and hall cupboards full of expensive shoes and clothing that are definitively new.

Long story short. I brought a baton to school because a [17M] student threatened me saying that he will come and suprise me with his mates at a train station. Someone snitched I got caught. Problem solved. Teachers just gave me suspension and finished.
Few weeks later he yelled out at my name to annoy me with his friends. 
I confronted him. He puts his hands around my tie and starts pushing me towards a wall in school. Teachers saw and asked him to tell the head school teacher. Head school teacher told me to not get into any fights or arguments or else I will get expelled. 
WHEN I DIDNT DO ANYTHING!! I DIDNT TOUCH HIM ONCE!! HE EVEN THREATENED ME SAYINFG HE’ll SLIT MY THROAT!!
Teachers didn’t even want to hear my side so they reported to police that I had a baton. When that problem was over....

359,"throwaway because throwaway
also I’m on mobile so formatting blah blah
Ok so basically I want to know if I’m being overdramatic or if my mother really is treating me unfairly.
I love my mother a lot, obviously, she’s my mother, but I’m also pretty sure she’s the cause of a lot of my anxiety and self-loathing issues.
These are the things she does the most that really upset me;
First of all, she’s really strict. She often goes through my phone, reading text messages, checking all my friends Instagram from my account, she even used to log into my Facebook and not only read my messages but then talk to me about things that had been sent. I’m 17 as of right now. I’ve never been allowed any technology in my bedroom because “she can’t see what I’m doing” but now that I have left high school I am allowed my phone in my room (I graduated last November). 
I’ve always felt this was really intrusive and like I couldn’t have honest, fun conversations with my friends over texts or anything like that because she would read them and confront me about them. One of my subject marks upon graduation was lower than I expected and I was really upset when she forced me to look at everyone at my school’s results that were better than mine. She then asked me, while I was crying, “is it because you watched TV during exam period? I read your text to [friend] and I saw what TV you told her you saw and it was a lot.” (For the record I watched a few seasons of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, only in the evenings after a day of study, over a 4-week period) I felt betrayed that she had read my texts and confronted me.
Another smaller thing she does is she won’t let me wear a lot of things that are my style, even things she bought for me, because she decides she doesn’t like them that much. She never tells me to change, but she whines about how bad it looks and comments on my look until I feel self-conscious and ugly and go change myself.
Something else she does is she refuses to let me stand up for myself. If she’s doing something that upsets me, say making me feel bad about my clothing even though I was excited to wear it, she’ll stop me half-way through and yell at me for disrespecting her, because “I am the parent and you are the child and you do not get to speak to me like that!” even if she has really made me feel horrible.
She also has told me multiple times that I am not allowed to move out once I turn 18, because she likes my company and doesn’t want me to move out. However, when I’m at home I often feel suffocated and trapped and I want nothing more than freedom and independence. Hell, she’s so much of a helicopter parent I can’t even make myself a salad without her standing half an inch from me, watching me do it. I just want to be able to do things myself. I get that she loves me and wants to spend time with me, but a lot of the time I just feel horrible when I’m around her.
Whenever I’m excited she makes a negative comment about something. I made profiteroles recently and the first thing she said was that they were a bit too crunchy on the outside. I had spent HOURS toiling over choux pastry and that’s what she wanted to say?
My first day of university she commented on how I was wearing way too much makeup. I had on foundation, a little bit of highlighter, and false eyelashes because I wear false eyelashes every day. Makeup makes me happy. I felt stupid the rest of the day.
Often times when she adds an unnecessary negative comment I ask her why she had to something negative when I was obviously proud or excited and she just shrugs it off or gets pissed at me for not being happy about what rude thing she said.
She also told me that if I ever wanted to do something once I’m 18 that she didn’t want me to, and I try to tell her that I’m an adult and should be allowed to do what I choose as I’m not a child, I shouldn’t bother ever coming back home.
She’s both the reason why I overeat unhealthy food and feel horrible about my weight despite being a healthy weight for my height and age.
She has multiple times tried to invalidate the way I feel simply because she doesn’t believe that’s how I really feel.
My dad is barely home as he’s always working (my mother doesn’t work), so he’s pretty much out of the picture, though I know she gets to him too (once he gave her flower’s for mother’s day but it wasn’t what she wanted so she screamed at him and left the house and I found him crying in the kitchen because he didn’t understand what to do), and my sister is just a whole other mess- a 14 year old bag of lies and drama I can’t hope to deal with.
All I want is to move out and away from my mother because she makes me feel insignificant and awful about myself all the time, but she won’t let me and I couldn’t afford it anyway due to my shitty job never giving me shifts. (I literally work approximately 3 hours a week and usually leave work in tears but that’s a whole different story for another time)
Basically, I don’t know what to do, and I’m not familiar with many family dynamics so I can’t even tell if this is abnormal, though my close friends certainly don’t feel the way I do.
What can I do about my situation, if I can even do anything? And am I being unreasonable?",06Mar2019,1

I have every character developed properly with complex backstory and good, strong driving motives. I have many ideas in my head of scenes and plot points I would like to include in the story, and a rough idea of the order I want them to go in, but every time I try writing it out the plot points just feel like loosely related events, as if the story is just pulling the characters along rather than the characters determining the story, which I feel is how it should be. 

The whole thing just feels messy even though I feel like the characters are strong enough to create a good story, and I’m not sure where I’m going wrong.

Yesterday, they asked me to fill in at the smaller school. Three of the five staff have a stomach bug. I’m flexible and like a change of pace so I agreed with no issues. The day was amazing. My two co-workers made the day effortless. There was no stress at all (which can not be said for my current location). 

Because of the staffing issues, my co-teacher in the room was the site director. She was quick to teach me the routines and gave me more responsibilities which I gladly took on. The site director at my current location barely goes to the classrooms and has an attitude that I have difficulty working with. 

It was mentioned to me that they were looking for a second preschool teacher at the smaller location and I quickly asked if I could apply. The director said yes. She told me that she had a netting scheduled at my location on Friday and would ask my director about a transfer. 

**the problem**

There are two directors at my current location. Site Director which runs this location and the Executive Director who is responsible for both location. Both of these directors have been patient with me and given me a second chance at working for this agency. 

I’m worried that if I express interest in this other position: 

1. I’ll be taking staff away from our larger school 

2. The directors at my current school will feel that I was just using my time here as a place holder until I found a better job. I’ve spent a lot of time trying to show them that I want the job I have. It feels like a dick move to prove all that then ask about transferring.

 I constantly got A's and everything was easy af. I never did any work or studied since my grades were not only the same regardless but everything was easy. So, all I ever did was play video games and go out with friends. I finished the year with a 4.0 GPA. 

Now nearing the end of sophomore year, I realise that I can't keep having that kind of life style, that I need to work and make efforts. I however HAVE tried to make efforts and to adapt to the new difficulty of things, but I never see any results. My grades are almost always the same so I gave up early on in the year. 

Since then I have tried to study more to no avail and have since lost all hope: my GPA has dropped to a 3.0 and I'm starting to panic. 
I know it's not bad per se, but its average and that doesn't stand well with my mom and teachers. 

Regarding my mom and teachers:
They think I have a problem or that I'm doing drugs or something which I completely dumb as fuck!

Regarding solely the teachers:
 I already fucking hated them since the first day I've ever met them, they are lying assholes (that's a whole other story) and it looks like they're trying to ruin my life by faking concerns, having meetings with my mom and just targeting me in every way! They purposely place me in a seat away from everyone in almost every class despite the fact that I rarely speak in class and always reprimand me for absolutely no reason! Someone at the side of class can talk for example and I'm the one that would get in trouble! 
I'm actually starting to think that they're racists or something, I'm the only black person in the class and one of the 3 in the entire grade. This theory is reinforced by the fact that my math teacher was suspended for Islamophobic comments towards a student last year. She's ironically one of the nicests to me, probably in fear of repeating the incident. 

All of this has just made me more stressed than ever, I frankly think I partly get bad grades because the teachers I have this year are so unlike last year's who were great. 

Anyways, Is it still possible to get into a good college if I fuck up this year but have good junior and senior years?
Is it even more unbelievably, possible to raise my GPA back up during these last few months before junior year?

I'm really perplexed and really don't know if I can make it or even have the will power to study. I really hate school now because of my demon teachers and find that it's a waste of time when I never understand anything they teach us.

Thanks for replying in advance. ",06Mar2019,2

377,"Hello Reddit! I'm a 22(almost) y.o (M) and I'm kinda lost at the moment. I never actually wanted to ""be something when I grow up"" since I was a kid, though I finished a cooking school since I liked cooking. 

Turned out that being a cook is not the job for me, especially in Greece (I don't know about conditions in other countries). I like cooking, I just don't want to have a 8-10 hour job where I'm constantly stressed (tho I haven't completely turned the job down of course).

I started thinking that maybe I could start learning foreign languages (thought of Asian languages at first, cause Asia intrigues me the most), cause it's something I actually like and think I'm good at. I speak native Greek and have a proficiency degree in English.

I'm wondering though, is speaking multiple languages enough to get me a job/living? How should I approach this? Any advice is highly appreciated.

I talked to her about breakouts and we're on the same page. She assured me she would communicate that to me. Now I'm just asking others what I should do because I realize I might have a blind side here... Considering she's my first and all yadayada...

One more little side note. We have had unprotected once before during our one night stand (smart man I know). Just some extra info just in case someone happens to be a doctor lol. 

She didn't tell me beforehand but here is why. Her reasoning is that she got retested and it came back negative so she didn't feel like it was lying. She did show me proof of the negative but I'm sure its just a false negative because this virus doesn't cure. She told me after I communicated it to her that STD were massive fear for me. She said I deserved to know her history.

The dog walking started out great this fall, as well, but I've made two major mistakes within the past three weeks and I'm terrified of making another. 

The issue is that they're not mistakes I'm even aware of. The first was a specific dog owner apparently kept coming home to find the front door unlocked - I've had trouble closing it before, so I'm always really careful and turn the knob before leaving to check that it's locked fully. I had absolutely no idea why the door was unlocked (and so many times, apparently?) because of that action I always took, but now, I don't have that dog anymore. 

And yesterday, another owner got home and the dog had been out of its crate. He only chewed a sock but my boss was rightfully upset about it. It's just that something like locking a crate is second nature at this point, and I \*know\* the crate was closed when I left... I wouldn't have left if something was amiss. I realize if things are out of place and fix them before leaving. If the door was open, it would've been clear as day and I'd have fixed it before walking out. 

I know two mistakes don't seem huge, but they're big ones and especially within such a short timeframe, I'm terrified I'll make something else - especially because these are things I'm already double checking. 

I'm just so confused and stressed and scared. Can anyone help me identify what this issue might be?

388,"Hi everyone! 



Hope you can give me your thoughts and honest opinion.



So here how it goes:



I uploaded a picture of a guy. My friend told me  that I kinda look like him. On the picture you can only see half of the guy's face.



Stupid enough, I uploaded it to find out if anyone would notice, and then delete if someone will. Keep in mind that I have like 3 photos prior to that one, photos where you can see my whole face and body. 



Then one day, a guy shoot me a message, a direct message because of that photo. Days after, we're chatting almost every day and had a video call twice. 



I was actually planning on deleting that photo once he asked me to send him some x rated pictures which he never did. I was so invested in our conversation, because this guy is nice, funny, smart, and not a pervert. I was so invested with our conversation that I forgot about it.



Until one day I received a notice from a moderator saying that I'm using someone else's photo (which was true). So I deleted it right away. A day after I tried to upload another photo, this time another photo of me, I received a message saying I'm banned from that sub.



Moving forward, me and this guy continued on chatting. Until today, he found out about it. I tried to explain it to him the best I could, but I don't think he'll ever forgive me. He's a nice guy, but I think that maybe too much for him. I obviously screwed up two main factors of building friendship, connection or whatever it was we had. 



Swear to God I was planning on telling him about it, was thinking for days about how I can explain it to him in a way he'd understand, but he got to me first.



But I've been thinking, if that ""photo"" was the only reason we were talking. If that was the very foundation of our friendship or whatever that was. I mean he saw my other photos and saw me in motion on a video call. 


My question to you guys is that what would your reaction be and what would you say to me if you are in his shoes? 



Brutal honesty is very much appreciated 🙏

389,"I’m the manager of a health club. 

One of my staff members is 21 and from a very low income family with, frankly, terrible parents. She’s an incredibly hard worker and was moved to the full time opening position (m-f 4 am to noon) which is awesome for her - but shortly thereafter her tornado of a mother convinced her to move across town, making my employee’s walk to work almost an hour. Mother promised she would give employee a ride to work every morning - then in december, she traveled to florida to visit family and never came back. 

Employee’s father won’t speak to her because his new girlfriend doesn’t like her and is jealous. 

This poor girl walks to work at 3 am in literal blizzards and has been almost mugged. i’ve tried to help her find another job but the huge thing she’s missing is a license - neither of her parents will help her or put her on insurance. She also loves this job and is heartbroken at the idea of leaving. i’ve begun giving her rides but it’s exhausting me and is not a good long term solution (we live on opposite sides of town). 

I had a very supportive family and never had to figure out any of this for myself, so i’m at a complete and total loss as to how to proceed. We found a local driving company that she can take lessons from and I promised to give her rides to the driving hour appointments, but what now? 

How can she get an insurance policy as a 21 year old with no credit? How can we get her a car without a large down payment or a co-signer? Are there any kind of programs to help adults get their licenses?

392,"Hi, I know this is a very common question, but I really suck at picking up on signs. I first thought he was hitting on me but then I've now convinced myself that he is just being nice. But I'm just so confused. 

First things first, he is my professor in an adult education course for learning computer programming. I'm a 24F, and I don't know how old he is but I know he has a 20 year old daughter. (I like older men so this isn't out of the norm for me.) Here are some of the things that have happened.

- On the first week back after Xmas, he asked me out to get something to drink. I said sometime in the future. 

- There have been numerous times when I have caught him staring at me. 

- He offers me food. 

- One time when I went to buy something from the vending machine and he came out of the classroom and stood next to me at the machine (like his whole side pressed to mine) and asked what I was going to buy, I'm intolerant to gluten so I took a while to find something but when I did, he stayed outside of class to be able to talk to me. During that time he: showed me pictures of all of his family including telling me names and ages etc, asked where I have traveled to, asked me about my family, when I told him I had to move flats he grabbed my hand and shook it and said we were in the same boat, when I told him I played video games he grabbed my hand and looked at it before saying that I am not that bad and don't play too much. 

- He made me promise to do an exercise which included to me shaking on it. 

- He has to pass me when he wants to leave the classroom, and always finds an excuse to touch my arm when he does. 

- He says he doesn't like tattoos but I have one on the back of my neck that he moved my hair out of the way to see when he saw it on his way to his desk. 

- He always asks me how my week has been and what my plans are. 

I've noticed that he never pays this much attention to the other students, but like I said before, I've convinced myself that he is doing this to get me to open up more in class. I also recognise that it is an intellectual attraction that I have towards him.

Also I think that it may be cultural. I'm English but live in Spain, he's obviously Spanish. I recognise that touches don't mean as much in Spain as they do in England, so I don't know.

Has anyone been in this situation before? Am I reading too far into this or is he hitting on me? ",06Mar2019,0

Roughly 2 months ago we were on a new year's eve party, and her best friend asked me if I'm interested in her, I said that ""it depends if she wants something more, if she does I may give it a try, if she doesn't than I'll have no problem staying friends"" thanks to the fact that I was drunk my curiosity took over and I have asked this friend of hers about 2 other guys that she knows just for the sake of curiosity. And then her friend told her about that and she got really mad at me, not for what I said but for the fact that ""I asked questions about her behind her back"". Next couple of days were really tense, she did everything to get on my nerves, spammed our group chat like never before, got close to the guys she never really was close with and other things like once she said she is in a relationship with a guy that she was never interested in. Later she cooled down and things went back to normal for a couple of days, when suddenly she told me to ""stop following her"" when I was just looking for a place to sit down to in college. She apologized to me a day later but form this point situation got a little bit tense, she rarely spoke to me in person and usually tried to avoid me, yet she still was texting me. After some time I've decided it's time to talk about that, I've asked if I somehow got her angry again and she only responded that she got hurt and still needs more time, than I asked if I can do something to fix this and she said she doesn't know, than I admitted that propably we'll never go back to the state of things that were before and than she told that ""maybe some day"", than she added that she still thinks I want something more with her, so to smooth out situation I told her that I don't want anything more than friendship. And past this point everything went nuts. She stopped texting me completely, got even more distant and suddenly started talking about this boyfriend even more. Yet there are times when she still wants to do projects with me, sometimes talks to me but only after a while being among common friends. Later we didn't see each other for 3 weeks because of winter holidays, and after that time I noticed something strange, for example for a person that supposedly got a boyfriend recently she looks very sad, she stopped coming to college even more frequently, I noticed that she started observing me from the distance, sometimes she tries to come near me but in the end she escapes somewhere else, and one day she talks to me a little bit but usually tries to avoid me. My close friends told me that she's overreacting this a lot, and noone including myself can't figure out what the hell is going on.

Finally got the chance to hangout with crush, and a mutual friend. I was dating another girl at the time though, but I still went, I should have broken up with the girlfriend before any of this, I clearly was not interested in her. I arrive at crush's house and am talking to the crush and friend. About 20 minutes later the mutual friend says he has to leave. We are alone... in her room, no one else is home. Internally I'm freaking out. We are just chilling watching tv. on her bed. Then we just look at each other and go for it. we made out. and some other things. Later we went for a walk and talked. She asked me what about my girlfriend. I didn't know what to do or say, I think I just said I don't know. Then I didn't do anything cause I was stupid. We hung out a few more times for a birthday. Talked to her once or twice more, but nothing else, just talking. Years have passed, haven't talked / seen in person in well over 7 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I just can't forget her and the emotions I have. Tried to reach out twice to ""catch up"", no replies. so I get the picture, that it is never going to happen. I was a jerk, a shitty/scummy person, I did the wrong thing. She has a guy now too. I should move on. Now I just want to be happy for her, and for myself to be happy.  It wasn't hard to be happy for her. It has been hard to make myself happy. Every time I think of her, it plays back in flashes, my heart rate goes up, and then I'm left alone again with my thoughts and feelings. If I see a girl who looks similar to her, my mind jumps to her and I almost get excited and begin thinking it might be her. I try not to, but often I compare other girls on if I get this feeling around them, this rush of emotion I had when I would see her. I probably think of her once every 2 weeks. 

I've dated 3 girls since. Who all were really great, dated each for \~1-2 years. one ended poorly, the other two just sort of we both realized it wasn't going anywhere and we split. I moved on from them though, and I'm just not hung up on them at all.

But she is still there, in the grubby, broke down movie theatre that is my memories.

Questions:

Why can't I just forget her / move on, when she clearly doesn't want me in her life, or want to reply to me.

Why can't I get off the drug of what could have been?

Will I ever find someone that makes me feel that way again?

How do I let this go?

I shared it and left my own comment, on my post, (Along the lines of how antivaxxers aren’t mentally capable of making the right choice for their kid, it was relevant to the post itself) and then visited the page. I scrolled and laugh reacted at a few of the ridiculous posts they shared, then left it and forgot about it. 

Then I started getting comments on my shared post about how I’m an idiot, fuck myself, a lot of other insults. And people start spamming my page with laugh reacts. I notice that the post I shared said “content not available” so I logged into my other account to go see. I went to the page, which I originally thought was an antivax propaganda page and not an actual profile, and they had a post that was a screenshot of the laugh reacts and a caption saying “watch out, this stupid bitch is trolling hard”. I don’t see how laugh reactions are trolling.. it’s another version of a like,heart,sad, or angry react.. It wasn’t intended to “troll”. It’s just giving my opinion on it. 

The comments on the post were talking about how I’m a cunt, fuck me, stupid bitch, I hope she dies, ___is a dirty hoe.. and more. The OP said “I wish I could get my hands around her throat”. And someone else said “I’ll make the choice to put my 9mm in her skull”. Keep in mind I had NOT made one comment or said one word to ANY of these people.

402,"So I’ve decided to put in my 2 weeks notice this Friday. Gathering up the courage to bite the bullet and do it is one issue, but my bosses are hard to get a hold of and don’t work regular office hours with us. 

They live far from the office, so they work from home a couple of days a week. They do not tell me explicitly which days they will be coming in. They just kind of show up. When they are in the office, they leave at 3:00. Their time is very limited in the office. When they are in the office, it’s so hectic and they’re always so insanely busy that it’s hard to even have a 5 minute conversation with them without interruptions. 

I’m worried that they won’t come in on Friday, or that they’ll be so busy that I won’t have an opportunity to have the conversation with them. I expect to be very busy too, so I just don’t know if there will be a window of opportunity to do it. I don’t even know if they’ll actually come into the office on Friday!

With the friend in question who is pretty stubborn, I can’t really do what is aforementioned as there isn’t really any reciprocation of admitting a fault or two and I’m left feeling a bit dissatisfied even after making peace. If I do otherwise, such as continue to contend with my argument, the argument seemingly never ends and gets ugly. An example of the first case would be me admitting “Hey I’m sorry, I think I could’ve said this better” or “I just feel this way when you do this” but ultimately results in getting a reply like “That’s ok, I know you can be like this”. 

So going back to the root of the question, I was wondering if it’s a healthy thing to do to just write down what I wanted to say but found myself unable to. I ask cause I find myself thinking about the argument a lot and thinking about what I should’ve said, but also getting frustrated with how much I personally dislike how stubborn this individual is. 

And please, I am open to alternative suggestions and hearing similar stories or even a critique against my thought process. ",06Mar2019,3
405,"Hello guys. I'm about to drop out from a course I've been doing for two years. Two years of my life wasted. Because I just can't put up with it. The first year was okay'ish in some subjects with the exception of one subject that I didn't like at all. But the second there is pure torture for me, psychologically. There are two subjects that I'm really not good at and I also don't like them at all. The other subjects are relatively easy. But anyways, the course itself just isn't for me. I'm more into biology/botany sort of thing and the course I'm doing is Telecommunication Systems.

But anyways, back to what I was saying. I can currently speak and write in three different languages. I'm thinking about learning another language. Just for fun and to see how fast I can learn. Deep down I know I can, but it requires some time.

So, just for knowing a couple languages more than the native language, can that alone help me get a job?

Thank you",06Mar2019,7

407,"Okay so...I moved schools several months back, and it hasn’t been easy (socially) I don’t have a lot of friends which makes me think people don’t wanna be around me. 

A group of people from my previous school planned a surprise birthday thing for one of my previously close friends. 
Key word: previously 
They say he’d want me there but I doubt it. 

WHY I SHOULDN’T GO: 

- technical reasons such as time, since I have school and if I wanna be on time I’ve gotta hurry 

- I’m afraid things are going to be awkward with them 
(these used to be my best friends and it kinda sucks that this is now a problem lol) 

- there’s going to be a few people I don’t know, and it’s going to be difficult to open up and have fun. And seriously what’s the point of going if I can’t have fun? 

- they want me to spend money, which wouldn’t be problem if it wasn’t for all the books I wanna buy. 

- I’m anxious about them questioning me about my new school, and I don’t want them to know that I’m lonely, it’s demeaning. 

WHY I SHOULD GO:

- it’d be a chance to get out of my house and have fun (possibly), for a change 

- it’d be nice to see my old friends since we’ve had a good friendship previously and I don’t  wanna lose that. 

- the guy whose bday it is, used to be pretty close to me as well so.. 

- my friends would be mad at me if I don’t go.

But sometimes I feel like I disappoint them on purpose so I can be alone and feel sorry for myself because I’m a pathetic human. 

PLS help me the decision needs to be made soon ^_^

In second grade, there was this other kid in my class who constantly bragged about himself, it annoyed the hell out of me. I think he's Indian/South Asian. One day I got fed up and said something to the effect of ""if this was a different time you would be a slave"" Obviously, I did not know entirely what this meant, but knew it implied inferiority and wanted to knock him down a peg. He told on me but nothing really came of it...

Fast forward to high school, a couple of his friends confronted me about it and i was horrified, i wonder if it would be on my mind today if i didnt get that reminder more recently

I am now 22 and soon graduating college for anthropology and media studies, i am interested in community and activist anthropology, and have spent years studying colonialism, institutional racism etc. I want to make a career out of collaborative advocacy for/with marginalized groups in my community but feel hypocritical bc i still think about what i said in 2nd grade sometimes and feel disgusted and ashamed.

 The advice im asking for is should I reach out on fb or something and apologize (with nothing about me/my education just a simple ""sorry for saying such a shitty thing and having a negative impact on you"") or is even that just a manifestation of white guilt that i should not bother the other person with since it happened so long ago?

Tldr: said a shitty, racist thing as a kid, wondering if i should apologize like 15 years later or if the only purpose that would serve is soothing my own guilt",06Mar2019,2
410,"As the title says, I think she has a lot of issues, maybe including personality disorders.

She is deeply insecure, she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 14 years a free months ago and now she is complaing about never being able to find a partner again (she is 56). There are even some evenings on which she cries because she feels so ugly.

It's getting really exhausting to talk to her because she is highly manipulative. It's always the same.

Fishing for compliments by insulting herself. Guilt tripping. Gas lighting.

She is completely unable to admit that she is to blame for something. For example our internet provider called last year and talked with my mother and they told her that they now have a new flat rate for only 49,99€. (Until then we had one for 9,99€ which was completely enough).

My mother took the bait, signed a contract for 2 years and now she wants to change the provider (which is a lot of paper work), because they ""scammed"" her. I showed her the contract with her signature. She got mad at me and just told me that they tricked her.

She also thinks of herself as some kind of martyr. She did a lot for me an my sister, that's true. We were high maintenance kids until we were like 16 or 17. But in the last 3 or 4 years we are doing a lot of work and we try to help her where we can. But she still has this picture of herself as a self-sacrificing mother. She always tells us how much she buys us. But the last time she bought us something was 9 or 8 years ago. She also pretends that she never buys something for herself, even though she uses a complete room in the house (that's bigger than my room) as her wardrobe.

And every new years eve when we ask her what she plans for the new year she says ""That she will try to learn how to care more about herself than other people.""

It's just.. She is a mix of insecurities, manipulation tactics and a distorted worldview, based on things that happened 10 years ago. Is there any way how I can help her ?",06Mar2019,1
411,"Good morning Reddit! First time poster, so I apologize if formatting isn’t correct or anything. I put the TLDR at the bottom. 


So sometime last year my spouse and I decided to relocate to a bigger city not to far from our hometown. We wanted to start fresh and experience new things, etc. So after a few months of job hunting I finally received an interview in January for what I’ll call Company A. I really liked this place and really wanted the job. After interviewing, Comp.A stated it would take some time to hear back, as things move slowly there. Fast forward a few weeks, I receive a phone call for an interview with another business, who I’ll call Company B. I wasn’t too excited about this place, but out of necessity and not wanting to put all my eggs in one basket with Comp. A I took the interview. A couple weeks after my interview with Company B, they reached out and made an offer (mind you I still hadn’t heard from Company A, and it has been roughly 5-6 weeks at this point). So after thinking about it, I took their offer, since it was the only one I had at the time, and started working there last week. Well, yesterday Company A finally reaches out and gives me an offer, to which I want to take. (Being a sort of dream job, and added benefit it would put me and my spouse close by so we can commute together as a bonus). They want me to start in 3 weeks. (03/25)

With all of this information, should I put in a full 2 week notice to Company B? Despite the fact I’ve only been here a week, so I don’t have really any responsibilities to hand off yet. My thought process is that they’ll let me go on the spot and I’ll be out of work for the 2 week or so duration, which I don't particularly like. Or do I just leave at least a one week notice, that way I get a paycheck and only have a week without work? I already feel guilty for Company B, but the offer from C.A was too good for me to pass up. 

TLDR; What kind of notice do I give a company that I just started working at a week ago, bc I received an offer from my essential dream job. ",06Mar2019,2
412,"So basically I joined this all female Fortnite discord a few months back (I was looking for some more girls to play with) and I met a lot a people from that discord that I’ll usually play regularly with, but there’s was always this two girls that I’ll almost always play with lets call them Carly and Scarlet 

Now we have know Each other for like 6 months now one day one of our mutual friends V asked us to do this big free for all map with us a couple of her guys friends (guys vs girls) and there was this one guy (Matt)who was very good I I mean he killed me all the time so I just kept Targeting him, after that was over he sent me a friend request I accepted because half the people in my friend list I don’t even play with anyway 

Ohh boy was that a mistake so would always join my game (to the point I started to put it on private) but I never kicked him because I didn’t want to be rude but really the reason I didn’t like playing with alone is because he’s a guys and I’m really only comfortable playing with girls but one day he joined my game we played together and that’s when I found out he’s a Transphobic homophonic pos I mean he even said he likes Ben Shapiro now I 

So anyway I saw that scarlet and Carly were playing together I joined and they invited to this server Carly’s friend made i joined and a few days later matt joined my game with Carly and scar now I was hesitant to send him an invite but I didn’t anyway so we can communicate with him, big mistake.


Now fast forward couple months Matt has become friends with everyone in the server but recently I feel like everyone in the server has Turned on me I mean no one ever respond to my message asking to play but when Matt asks that same person they respond instantly like for Example this one girl Mia in the server asked Matt if wants to play he said he was playing with someone else so I asked her if she wants to play with me instead she goes “oh I’m too laggy rn I’ll just play alone” 

And some of the stuff Matt says to me outrageous like I told everyone in a group call I was going to a woman’s march he started saying some really sexist stuff just making fun of it and stuff or he always gets on me for being a “console player” and that I'm only getting kills because I have aim asset and just frankly I’m over it 

Now I met a girl from a different server named lily and we immediately hit it off I mean we like the same tv show same music same everything we even made our own server she really makes me feel more confident in myself, so I sent her a invite to the server Matt’s in and one day we were making jokes about how we are bff and everything and Matt got all on me say that we are annoying and we just met a week ago so how can we be bffs and everyone in the server was like “Ohh tea” I can just tell that they agreed and what hurts the most about that is I knew them longer and I know it seems all of them love Matt more than me even though they Wouldn’t even know he’s Existed

I don’t have any real life friends (I tried to make some it’s just hard for me) Now I’m realizing that the only reason I put up with all of there bs is that they were my only friends but now I have lily

The person in charge of us last programmed using visual basic for a Windows XP computer. Sadly, this is not a joke. For people who are not technical, visual basic is one of the oldest software development tool and is not used when someone starts writing new software now anymore. This person is the architect of our team.  
As I have put in the headline, my salary is really good. However my ideas are never considered and there is absolutely no scope for innovation. We are creating a product which is available in the market for internal usage and this is all we will ever do.

My problem is that I want to be part of a company which provides me with a little more opportunity to innovate. This company I am working in is not in my own country. My savings in this country after expenses is higher than what the CEOs of companies make in my country, which means at the end of the day I save handsomely when I transfer money to my home country. This is not me bragging, I include this because this is the source of my mental conflict. I can look for another job, but my payment will probably go down quite a lot because of the old technologies I am currently using.  
I am really confused as to what option I should take.

On the other hand I know that the experience of going out west would be pretty rad again with just being around nature and the mountains.  Also there is a lot of potential to essentially double my earning from last year if I can keep up the motivation all summer long. (High potential to still make more serving).

For about two-three weeks, my mom has suddenly started seeing Kaleidoscopes in her eyes, and her peripheral vision and depth perception have gone completely out of whack. She's been to emergency care, and they ruled out a stroke, which she has had a minor stroke in the past (about two years ago). They found that she has a 3 millimeter tumor in her pituitary gland, benign. She isn't having any headaches, but is feeling far more fatigued and cannot drive her car any longer or barely do anything around the house because her vision is getting worse and worse. She can hardly read anything, even with her reading glasses. These Kaleidoscopes come and go, but when they are there in her eyes she can't even walk right it's so debilitating. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've been to an Optical Neurologist, who didn't see anything wrong with her eyes, minus a small cataract in her right eye. He said for her to go to a neurologist, and that she could see (which isn't true at all). He told the Neurologist that we're trying to get in touch with that she could see, and the neurologist won't want to see us, until my mother is able to get a work-up from an Endocrinologist, which doesn't have an opening for another two months. I'm afraid that she's actually going to go blind, before she's even able to see one. I don't know what to do, please help.

Why do I say 'designated'? Rather a cynical term to use, you'd think. I want to get some significant points out of the way that you'd do well to keep in mind. We're *not* particularly close with C. I, A, and B all went to university together, are more or less best friends and C did his own thing at another school. Throughout the undergrad years we'd see him maybe once a month tops and for typical guy-friend-group casual hangouts (movies, dinner, mini-golf).   There are many, **many** issues happening as of recent that are considerably straining our at-best mild relationship with this guy:  

\--

1) **He is in love with Friend B.** 

C came out to us as bisexual in October. Long-and-short of it, he confessed to B thinking something was there, and there really wasn't. Since then, C has committed many a faux-pas that would distance the two heavily: being caught *smelling B's gym clothing*, blatantly trying to flirt with and initiate physical contact in an enclosed space (a car), and generally vocalizing awkward remarks that would make B uncomfortable with spending any sort of personal time with him. As of current, B has neglected to agree to any one-on-ones with C regardless of his depression/anxiety and I can't blame him in the least.   

2) **C is obsessed with us.** 

As mentioned previously, it's not like we're tight with this guy. B has had many a row with him over the years, and I've found him to be hypersensitive and occasionally condescending. He's a friend, and that's it. But C has over-inflated the intimacy of our friendships, a symptom likely resulting from his loneliness. He reminisces wistfully of former years as the 'good ol' days', constantly refers to us as his ""BFFs"" - but here's the worst part: he asks us about our *friendship rankings* on a more-than-seldom basis. ""Where do I place in your top 5?"" followed swiftly by a ""am I not one of your best friends?"" to which I can barely handle the ensuing awkwardness by derailing the conversation. When C sees our respective social media posts on Instagram, Snapchat with other friend groups, he'll express his bitterness in hardly a discreet manner. He's asked to join our other friend groups uninvited, *messaged our friends in said groups privately* to set up a one-on-one in a misguided attempt to integrate himself unprompted, and even spoken of *psychotic, bloodthirsty thoughts of violently assaulting one of our closest university friends* as we simply spend way more time with the latter than C.  

That last one seemed to escalate? It was as alarming to us as it is to you.   

3) **He overwhelms us with his issues.**

 We've been working with him to get himself back on his feet for months and months on end. We spend a disproportionate amount of time for someone we're not extraordinarily close with. These one-on-one hangouts front as three-hour therapy sessions where C unloads of all of the day and life's problems sprinking a whole bunch of unrestrained sobbing with zero room for enjoyable or casual discussion. It's *exhausting*. Following B's rejection and rightful nixing of any one-on-one contribution on his end, C has now turned to A as his most dependable sponge. In a certain week, A saw him no less than *five times* with a full-time job, a girlfriend and other friends to manage because C would call, bawl, and beg for his attention.  

We can't handle his issues. To put it bluntly, none of us are trained professionals equipped to properly advise someone with mental illness. Thankfully, we've communicated  as such to him and he's accepted taking back the responsibility he's put onto us, albeit reluctantly. Instead, he's seeing a counselor on a regular basis and is setting up a schedule with a psychiatrist.  

\--

Truthfully? I don't like this guy anymore. He's selfish, paranoid, manipulative, and overly concerned with the most minute, childish hangups one can possibly ponder over in their 20s. At any moment we disagree with him and object to a proposal he's made, he'll immediately make following remarks implying he ""needs"" to have his way or he'll spiral into a rut again. 

He has on many occasions openly contemplated suicide in our group chat, oftentimes when we cancel plans on account of emergencies or don't respond to texts quick enough for his liking. He's shown up *at my house* for a 'talk' after being told **repeatedly** that I was not available. He's parked outside A's apartment building and called for a face-to-face chat until A was forced to entertain him to get him to leave. It's ridiculous and I'm at my breaking point. I, like B, have also done away with one-on-ones.   

As of recent, he is planning a group road trip and none of us three genuinely want to attend. I'm not sure how to break it to him because if i do, in all likelihood he will go through with tying the noose in response. I feel as if we're being coerced to go along with his demands and plans for fear of something worse happening on our account. We're all he has, and so we have to layer everything we express with a coat of sugar or he'll take it as a sign that we 'hate' him. It's annoying as fuck and I'm tired of dealing with it.  

I've *barely* scratched the surface, so much of what's missing you'll see in the comment section replies. What should I do? ",06Mar2019,0
439,"Hey everyone. I need a little help deciding which should be my major and minor in university.

 I graduated from a community college with an associate degree in Library Science. Now im going over to be a bachelors at a major university here in the caribbean but im having trouble assigning a major/minor. 
I currently work as a library assistant in a Media Specialist capacity for a primary school. In my associate's the majority were technical courses like cataloguing, user service, technology in libraries, etc. My electives were web design, operating systems and instructional design. 
I love literature and wanted to major in it but i feel like it'll be better to have IT as my major and lit as my minor as its more marketable. But i also feel like i have an entire associate's thats technical and IT related and i eventually want to do a masters in educational technology so it could take the back burner this time.
Any advice?",06Mar2019,1

442,"This is going to be terribly written, extremely long and probably scatterbrained, sorry in advance.  I’m just looking for advice to help break down emotional walls.. I’ve been through a somewhat traumatic childhood and life.. but I want to be happy, but I don’t know how.. 


I’ve never just written out my childhood and life for anyone to read.. and tbh it’s not the worst I’ve ever read, but I’m currently 25 years old and still struggling with everything that’s happened in my life. It’s caused me to push away everyone that I care about, including my kids. I know this isn’t the best place to seek help or advice but I thought that it might be a start. 
I guess I’ll start at the beginning... 

I had always grown up pretty poor, we didn’t have a whole lot growing up but my mom did her best to make sure we had everything we needed and some extras ... When I was about 6 months old my mom left my dad for my “step-dad” (But keep in mind I was raised my whole life believing he was my real dad) , my real-dad was emotionally and mentally unstable and tbh so was my mom. But I guess she thought she was doing the best thing and trying to get away from him (little did she know that it wasn’t going to be any better at all) .. anyways .. not long after she left him my real- dad showed up at her apartment with a shot gun threatening to shot all three of us. My “step dad” wrestled the gun from him and I guess beat the shit out of him  and he left.. he continued to see me on supervised visits until I was two (Idk why)... but around the age of two I guess my real-dad thought life was too much and he hung himself... fast forward a little and now I have a little sister and we are a “happy family”... well as happy as I’ve ever known... my mom and “step dad” constantly fought, they would get into physical altercations daily. There was constant screaming, crying and police presence. From a very young age I took it upon myself to be responsible for my sister, whenever they were fighting (which was most of the time) I would take her up to the top shelf in the linen closet and hide in the sheets and play games with her to keep her calm. He had always been abusive to my sister as well, she had some medical problems with her bladder and as a result would pee to bed and also sometimes in her pants uncontrollably, he didn’t believe it was a medical issue and he believed she did it on purpose out of spite... he would force her to sit in cold bath water in her pee covered clothes for an hour. She would cry so much and I would sneak in to talk to her and try and make her laugh. I had also watched him pick her up by her clothes and hold her against a wall and scream in her face. (To this day she has PTSD from this)  My step dad was addicted to multiple drugs and was always out at his friends houses drinking, doing drugs and cheating on my mom. Now dispite all of this , he had still always been a superhero to me though. I never let myself see the monsterous side of his life, and believed everything to be normal in my life because he never abused me the way he abused my sister. 
when I was 8 years old my mom asked me to go up the street to his friends house to get him for supper. (I didnt know he did drugs and just thought he liked to hang out with his friends).. well he was actually cheating on my mom and doing drugs (she knew it and sent me there anyways) well anyways.. I knocked on the door and some random woman answers and I ask for my dad.. he comes cussing down the stairs and starts screaming at me, tells me to get the fuck out of here, to go the fuck home and tell my psychotic mother to fuck off and leave him alone. He tells me to never come here again and that I’m not even his real kid..... I was 8 years old, I had always known him to be my father... I never even knew I had another dad... all I remember is running home and the tears just streaming down my face. I remember wanting to crawl into a hole and never come out again. I was confused, embarrassed and tbh scared. My whole life had just been shattered at 8 years old. My mom ended up freaking out, going up the road and I believe the police came because they got into a fight. I just hid with my sister and cried. 
He stayed living with us even after that, but in secret..  it was always a secret he was living with  us, if anyone ever asked I was suppose to say no and lie. I lied to teachers to strangers who would come to my school and ask me questions about my life. (I later learned they were social workers)  .. lying about my life became normal.. I never understood the reasons why I had to lie all the time until the age of 10. When I was 10 years old my life flipped upside again.. I was playing in the back yard with my sister when the police showed up with one of the ladies who had always been questioning me at school... they had come to take me to foster care.. I ran and dragged my sister with me, we ran through the woods behind my house for what felt like hours (it was probably only an hour max) and the police found us and put us in their car.. they drove us across town to an area that, at this point in my life I had never been too. They introduced us to our foster parents and left. These foster parents were terrible, they were alcoholics, and were absusive toward my sister as well. (She also had adhd and was a handful at times, I had learned how to manipulate people very well at this age though, and got my sister out of a lot of shit).. anyways we eventually got moved to another foster home, and then another. The third one we lived in for 2.5 years, they were alright. My foster dad was emotionally abusive towards my sister and I. But they weren’t the worst we had ever had. I took care of my sister myself though, I made it my responsibility to be her care giver , even though I was only 1.5 years older then her. But it was just natural for me to be that person for her anyways. At this point w e finally found out the reason we were placed in foster care and why we had to be so secretive my whole life about my step dad living with us... he was a convicted pedofile.. my mom had known this but continued to allow him to live with us, I believe she did it out of fear and the years of emotional and physical abuse she suffered from him. She didn’t know what else to do. The fear of being one of his victims has stayed with me to this day. (I don’t recall him ever sexually abusing me, but the social workers believe he was grooming me) I was very angry  my mother for a very very long time, even to this day I don’t fully forgive her. (Apparently when we ran from the police he had also gone on the run and moved across the country to evade them, ive only ever seen him twice in my life after this and refused to look to or even speak to him) .. anyways while we were in foster care for 3 years my mom was doing everything the court ordered her to do in order to try and get us back.. she eventually met all of their requirements and got us back in the summer before I was to start grade 8 ( I was 14) this summer was also a pinnacle of my life, this is the summer I started smoking weed, drinking and partying every night. I started skipping school,  became depressed and stopped caring about everything and everyone. And this same summer I met my now boyfriend. (I was 14 and he was 16) when we started dating we partied and had sex every night, by the time I was 16 I had dropped out of school., but I didn’t care because I was finally in love with someone and had someone who loved me. He loved me so much, and I tbh put up so many walls, I was so afraid to let anyone in, but he always pushed to be there for me. It was amazing to me that someone could possibly love me. Too amazing in fact that I couldn’t believe it to be true. And I constantly accused him of cheating on me, even when he wasn’t, I pushed him away so much he eventually started to text one of our mutual friends a lot , which ended up leading to him sending explicit pictures to her.. it shattered my already broken heart into a million more pieces. But he cried and apologized and we vowed to work it out,. When I was 17 I got pregnant with my oldest.. and Tbh this was the best thing to ever happen to me in my life, I stopped partying every night, I quit smoking weed and started going back to school. We both turned our lives around and vowed to be the best for our baby we got an apartment of our own and I continued to go to school, he got a job and finished his grade twelve year of school. But pregnancy turned my already very bad teenage hormones and depression to spiral out of control. We started fighting more and more, I pushed him away and he again started texting the same mutual friend again.. I found out about it when our baby was 2 weeks old. I was shattered again. I had extreme post partum depression and just sunk deeper... again he promised to be better.. so I stayed, our baby was only 2 weeks old, never even had a chance at a family, I wanted to give her that chance. We completely stopped talking to our mutual friend  and slowly moved on.. His parents wanted nothing but for us to work out, and they were always there for me. They decided to help us find a new place to live because we lived in a pretty shady part of town. So when I was 18, They helped us buy our first home, which we lived in for 5 years, we had another baby and things were going alright as far as I was concerned ... I knew I was still distant, still struggling with the depression I had always struggled with, but trying to be the best mom I could be. But because of this I didn’t have much time for him anymore.. I pushed him away again. I still had so many walls up from all the previous heartbreaks from him and my childhood, he still tried to do everything for me though, he told me he loved me and was always trying to be close but he stopped trying after so many years and he began sleeping on the couch and we barely spoke...!and then he did it again... she was always hanging out with me, pretending to be my friend, always bragging about all the guys she was talking to at once, literally bragging about talking to a guy who already had a gf.. little did I know she was talking to my bf too.... her friend caught them kissing one night and told me. I was shattered again.. I mean how many times does it take for someone to learn right? But we were so young when all the other ones happened, I didn’t think he’d do it again. Now I was alone with 2 kids and had no idea what to do with my life. I was in school trying to get my grade 12, and trying to be a good mom for my kids.. we split for 2 months and we got back together again. We bought another bigger house for our growing family and It’s now been 2.5 years since then and I still love him so much, and he swears he loves me more then anything in the world, but he struggles so much to love me because I’ve only ever pushed him away.. and he’s right... I do.. I only ever wanted my kids to have a family. I wanted them to grow up and have an amazing loving family, like I never had. But here we are now today, still together , but still in a void... he pushes and pushes and pushes to break down my walls, he does everything he possibly can for me to make me happy to be a good dad and boyfriend ... but I push and push and push him away. I don’t know how to trust anymore. I don’t know how to love anymore.. it’s so bad that I now push my own kids away. Idk what to do anymore. I don’t want to hurt my kids, I don’t want to hurt him, and I don’t want to be hurt. I still love him so much. He’s been there for me through so much depressive episodes, so much anxiety and so much bullshit. He coped the only way he knew how and I’m still coping the only way I know how... I know everyone would say based on this that we shouldn’t be together ... but it’s been 10 years, I love him still so much, I want nothing more than to be with him, to be happy like I know we can be.. we’ve been happy before, we’ve had  periods in time where we were amazing, but it’s like my depression takes over and for months even years I become so hostile and mean, and I push everyone away. I want to just conquer all this emotional and mental bullshit with him and come out on top triumphant.  I mean throughout the years we’ve had so many good times, that definitely outweigh the bad, we’ve travelled much of the world together, we’ve danced, laughed, sang, and grew together. But it always comes back to me unable to take control of my emotional barriers to allow myself to be happy. To allow myself the privilege of happiness, deep down I believe I don’t deserve it. And I’m ruining my children’s lives as well as mine and his. How do I break down all these walls I have up, so I can be happy for once in my life ? ",06Mar2019,0

444," So I’m leaving my current company, for sure, as I’ve been there for a couple of years, I’ve hit a ceiling there, and I’ll never get a pay rise.

I’ve interviewed at several places, and got down to an offer plus a bunch more final stages, and I’m not sure what to do. Let’s break it down into Companies A, B, C and D.

Company A have offered me a job. They are my favourite company, they always were and I’m actually really excited to potentially go work for them. They have a structure for me to advance my career and they’ve even offered me a bonus to hand in my notice earlier and join them next week (I work in a commission job so the bonus is needed to cover the loss I would incur if I left my current role ASAP).

Company B I haven’t seen yet, they would potentially pay a 10% higher salary, but they’re a bigger, more strict company. Hard to judge them as I haven’t interviewed there. I’m meant to meet them tonight but it would only be the 1st stage out of 2 so this process would take a lot of time I’m not sure I have.

Company C is the most likely to offer also. I’ve seen them twice and I’m going in one last time to meet the team, which is almost certainly an offer. They would offer about 20% more salary wise and are very well known in what they do, but I didn’t like the Director I met on the 2nd stage, he just seemed cold and the kind of boss I’m looking to get away from.

Company D are a direct competitor to A, and are also well known, although probably not as much as A. They would offer 15% higher salary, but they have had a really rocky last couple years, with a lot of people leaving/being fired and Directors being replaced. Kind of a risk going into somewhere like that I feel.

Should I take Company A, hand in my notice and start? Should I tell A I’m completing my interviews and potentially miss out on the bonus A are offering, or worse, them getting cold feet and pulling the offer?

Any advice appreciated and happy to add more detail if you need it to make a judgement.",06Mar2019,2

About 5 years ago I was in a very controlling and abusive relationship. One of the stupid things I did was sign for a loan so my ex could get a motorcycle. We break up and they move away, taking the bike and all loan paperwork. At the time I didn't care because I just wanted out and to be away from them. 
During springtime 2 years ago I receive a message from them about the bike and was told the plates were stolen and it was put in storage. The plates were reported stolen at the DMV. 
Yesterday the bank who the loan was with called stating payment has not been made for months and they want the bike back.
Ok I reach out again asking for the keys and a way to get it out of storage. I receive this ""Wasn't ever in storage. I just parked it on the street and it was gone one day"". 
So now what. My ex will not say when this happened or where they were living when this happened. Do I go to the police but if so how do I prove my name is on the registration if I don't have any of the paperwork? How could I find out if it was impounded? 
I feel so lost right now and I was doing better mentally but now I'm back to feeling scared, stupid and hopeless.

449,"Me: 24/F; brother: 27M; sister-in-law: 26?F

My brother and SIL have been together for about ten years. I don't know exactly why, but at some point in their relationship I started to really dislike her. Objectively, she's a nice &amp; pleasant person; most people that meet her think she's great. Personally, I find her obnoxious, attention-seeking, and untrustworthy. It's gotten to the point where I actively avoid her at family gatherings because I just find it so uncomfortable to talk to her- and she's relentless. She doesn't ever take the hint that I don't want to make conversation with her- she'll keep pushing and pushing a conversation despite me giving clear signals that I want it to end. I don't even remember the initial events that made me dislike her (we used to be kinda close). 

I also strongly dislike children, and have NOT been looking forward to their inevitable pregnancies. Partly because I simply don't like kids, and partly because it will be ALL she talks about for nine months non-stop. Today my mother told me that my SIL is pregnant, but it's ectopic, and their doctor will likely induce a miscarriage. I know it's awful, but I don't really care? At all 

How do I stop being a piece of shit? I know my feelings are silly and cold. But I just really don't care for my SIL, and I'm not at all close to my brother. We've never had a relationship, and he's never really shown any interest in acting like a big brother. I know I should be feeling sympathy for them right now, but like I said, I feel nothing. I don't know how to stop feeling this way; I recognize that a miscarriage is horribly traumatic. But somehow I can't extend that sympathy to my SIL. And she didn't even do anything catastrophically bad to me. What's wrong with me",06Mar2019,1
450,"Unfortunately this is long and complicated but here goes.

Around Christmas my mum became extremely depressed, losses her appetite and didn’t want to go out anymore. This was due to her thinking that I (18f) was losing my hair. She believes that a small section of my hair has become a lot thinner to the point where she wants to take me to the Doctors to find out what the issue is. To clarify I do not see an issue with my hair, I’ve not noticed any difference or hair loss and neither has my immediate family.

Anyway I went to the doctors appointment in the hopes that it would reassure my mum that there is nothing wrong and it worked for a while, the doctor didn’t she a problem and my mum felt better. However this didn’t last long and sure enough she saw believed there to be more hair loss/ no improvement which has meant I’ve been to around 6 or 7 GP appointments with blood tests. Going to the GP used to calm her for a while; however, now she has lost faith in the doctors completely.

Whilst this was all happening my family and I encouraged my mum to go to the GP herself due to her inability to cope with the issue of my hair and this is when she was diagnosed as depressed and she takes medication for it. The medicine has helped for a while but now she’s at an extremely low point and I’m stuck as to what to do.  I try to talk through everything with my mum but whilst I’m trying to help her with her depression she’s still trying to help me with the problem she sees with my hair, we’re at opposite ends and my attempts to try and make her focus more on getting herself better fall on deaf ears. I can see where she’s coming from, she’s my mum and when she sees a problem she wants to sort it out, but at the moment it’s at the expense of her own health.

TL/DR: My mum is depressed due to thinking I have hair loss which I do not think is happening myself. Countless of GP’s also do not see an issue with my hair; however, she continues to focus on it rather than trying to help herself get better.",06Mar2019,10

Hi Reddit,

I have bottled up so many thoughts and emotions that I figured it’d be best to pour it all out here. So here it goes:

Here’s my current love-life situation: I have been dating my boyfriend for about four years now (I’m F by the way). We started dating in our third year of high school. By the time we reached the end of senior year, we had decided to go to different universities that are approximately 3 hours apart. I stay at home with my parents and commute to save money while he currently attends a different university that’s 2 hours away due to a scholarship. 

Our relationship has many constraints due to my parents. My parents are Asian and made very rash decisions at a young age. They have good intentions (despite us butting heads here and there) and want me live a better life, but it really sucks having to be told “you can’t do/have \_\_\_\_\_ until you finish college.” One of those things being “boyfriend.” My parents know of my boyfriend, but they don’t want to give me that “blessing” until I have everything set for myself. I basically can’t live a “normal” life until I’m fully independent. I’m trying to take advantage of what I have now so I can make my situation better beyond college.

So with the constraints, I rarely get to see my boyfriend. I must sneak my way around to be able to see him sometimes. The only time I get to really see him is when he comes back home. Although I’m thankful to have some time with him, it doesn’t seem like enough because I always have classes and other responsibilities in the way. When he’s away, a majority of our interactions are through text because I know he’s busy with school and his recreational activities. I don’t really get the chance to talk to him on the phone. I try to be as patient and understanding as possible, but what gets me is the thought of the possible outcomes from our current situation. 

Let’s backtrack to me seeing him when he comes home to visit. When we have a disagreement or something goes wrong, his flaws strike me. I’m scared that when we fully commit to each other, I won’t be able to know how to talk to him or cope. My boyfriend is very assertive and stubborn, which has mostly been a good thing, but sometimes he goes beyond that threshold to the point where he wants things to happen the way he wants them to and I basically have no say in it. I know I need to talk to him about it, but I wanted to let all my anger here instead of my boyfriend. It makes me so angry when I don’t have a voice. It makes me feel like the lesser individual. It makes me feel like my thoughts are invalid. 

I’m upset that he has to live somewhere that I can’t commute to myself because of my parents’ constraints on me. I’m worried that this long distance thing might not work out because I feel like the longer we are without each other, the more distant I feel from him. We lost a lot of time to grow together physically. He has about two years left of college (while I have 3 years left, thanks Engineering!) so who knows what’ll change in that time. 

I love my boyfriend and he loves me. He’s everything I look for in a person I plan to commit to. He’s sweet, respectful, caring, smart, but sometimes the “too much” gene kicks in and brings out his poor traits/habits. I know I should talk to him, and I will. I’m also kinda lost as to what I should do for myself. How can I express my feelings to him without blowing up? What steps can I take to push myself forward and make progress in my relationship?

Thanks,

TL;DR I’m not able to spend a lot of time with my boyfriend because of my parents, school, distance, etc. I’m afraid that our relationship will fall apart.",06Mar2019,3
452,"So I'm in college now (moved out) but this is still a problem when I visit my parents. Growing up, my dad always seemed to talk down to me and sometimes even treat me like I'm incompetent or straight up call me stupid. He also tends to be very quick to anger when talking to me. Understandably, this has affected my self-esteem over the years. Even though I'm 23 and doing well in college now, he still treats me this way when I visit. It might be my dyslexia that make him think I need extra help, but I'm conversationally fluent in German, how does that not prove that I've overcome it!? It honestly feels like his ego is more important to him than his relationship with me. Does anyone know how I can prove to him than I'm not unintelligent or a little kid anymore?

The dates are the cheapest we can find for airfare &amp; hotel. Everyone is on a very strict budget. 

One of my friends, ""Bob"" that's going just told me he probably cant take off work for the dates. And suggested dates in the following month.

The thing is, the entire following month is more expensive ($200+ difference for flight alone) and the weather will be worse. 

Nobody else in the group is happy about this. But we all want this friend to go. He'd be devastated if we left him behind. Bob is on the strictest budget of everyone going, he can barely afford to go in the first place. 

Plus there's a special event during the dates I picked that I really want to go to.

Bob is working a crappy retail job, it's not like it's his career or anything. And he should be finding a new job since he just graduated college, but he's being lazy about it.

He consistently chooses his parents over me, always. No matter what it is, he always defends them and never me. For instance, if we go to a family gathering, it isn’t him defending me from questioning by his parents, regarding my political views, or job, or hair color, or make up, or whatever else it may be. He just says “Always agree with them. Don’t do anything to make them dislike you.” I hold my tongue. Or another instance, today, he is having a minor surgery. His parents wanted to come, totally understand, but you can only have one person back at a time, I assumed he would pick his fiancé- the person he’s supposed to spend the rest of his life with, through sickness and health and all that. But, his dad stood up to go with him when I had stood, and looked at me and said, “Only one person- me.” And literally took my spot from my fiancé. My fiancé said nothing, did nothing, period. I was absolutely humiliated. We are both in our 20’s and his parents have an iron grip on him, but he allows it. I’m seriously considering terminating our relationship, because I shouldn’t be his second place.

The landlord has his own house and so does the son, while my husband and I are living in a mobile home on the land. We bear not relation to the landlord, just a family friendship. 
So we live in a town which I will call hometown. My husband's aunt is getting ready to move the same time that our lease is up, she lives a couple towns away in which I will call newtown. All of our close immediate family and friends are in hometown, and newtown is about 25 minutes away.

 My husband's aunt's townhome is on a historic part of newtown with parks nearby, has more space for us, less yard, and more shopping. Newtown is also closer to both of our jobs. 

If we moved there it would be $900 a month including utilities. Where we live now, we pay 650 a month and pay for propane which is around 400-500 each refill. Now in the winter the refills only last us about 2 months, in the summer they last 4-5 months. My husband and I also have 4 cats, 3 of which are mostly indoor cats, and one demands to be let outside every day. If we move to my husband's aunt's house we would also need to buy a new refrigerator.

I'm the youngest of a large family, the only men being my dad and one brother. We lived in a large house on a large piece of land, conservative and secluded from the rest of the world. My memories from childhood are choppy at best - I've always been confused when people say ""when I was in 3rd grade I"" or 5th or kindergarten or whatever, because my memories are just randomly sprinkled through a haze. 

From as young as I can remember, I've been very sexual. I used to pretend with my ""invisible friends"" (for lack of a better term) that they were so obsessed with me that they would just take me. I remember this one time (maybe I was 8? 9? Tbh I have no idea) when everyone else was outside, I snuck into the play jewelry box and started shoving the jewelry into my crotch while role playing that I had been abducted and someone else was doing it to me. I didn't know what sex was, I might not even have known what a penis was (again, VERY conservative, VERY sheltered upbringing), and I certainly had no idea what an orgasm was, but here I was, shoving painful jewelry into my vajayjay because I was compelled to.

I had really severe nightmares growing up and into adulthood, almost always of being chased by an overbearing evil, frequently at my house or in my bedroom. I also remember a really really vivid dream about my dad taking me into the bathroom and teaching me what sex was, by having sex with me. That dream has always stuck out to me weirdly, because I remember there wasn't any weird dream warp about it. You know how dreams often distort the environment some way? This was just normal - my normal bathroom, my normal dad, etc. I'd guess I was somewhere between 5-10 when I had this dream. Definitely before puberty. The thing is, until today, I always remembered it as a dream. But what if it was actually a memory.......?

I also have weird daddy/Oedipus issues with my brother (five years older than me). Throughout childhood, I either loved him desperately or hated him intensely. I hungered for his approval, and resented him any time he rejected me. I wanted to always play with him, I would always back his opinion in family arguments, even if I didn't agree, and I would be so grateful anytime he gave me positive attention. As I grew up, I found myself most strongly attracted to men with his name and appearance. I even fell deeply in love with a guy in college who looked almost exactly like my brother, AND has his name. 

I've done a bit of research, and I seem to present some of the typical symptoms of someone who's been sexually abused: anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies, both an adversion to yet also an obsession with sex, etc etc etc. 

I'm also a serial flirt, intentionally (almost uncontrollably) flirting with guys who seem interested in me, wanting them to want me, purposefully getting them to fall in love with me, because I want to confirm over and over again that I'm desirable. That I'm attractive. That I'm fun and playful. That I'm worthy of lusting over. 

Since I was twelve, I've fantasized about being abducted and/or raped almost every night before going to sleep. Always with whomever I'm currently crushing on. Because if they take me, I can still enjoy it without it being my fault that I'm doing something wrong (relations outside of marriage). 

I've been married for seven years and yet I continue to do these things. It took 6 years of marriage to start enjoying sex with my husband, though I still don't typically like it when he touches me. I tend to recoil. Yet I then masterbate to the idea of being raped. I am very lost.

I don't know what to do. I know I need to get back into therapy, but I'm at a loss. Someone please help. Does this sound like repressed memories of sexual abuse? Or just like I was a sexual kid for some reason? Please help.

465,"Hey friends, so two weekends ago it was my birthday. I gathered a group of people to go to a concert, including one of my good friends from out of town who would be staying the night with me and my boyfriend who live together. We all went out and had a great time, and drank quit a bit. We got back to my apartment and I remember all of us laughing and laying on our bed. The next morning we woke up and everything was fine and she hung out with us till like 3pm the next day. 

She decides to text me 5 days later and say “Hey there’s something that’s been bothering me, can I call you on Sunday? (Another 5 days later). I was like yeah for sure but now I’ve been building up what she could possibly be freaking out about in my head. 

Yesterday, I explained this to my sister (who also went out with us) who told me the situation as my friend had told it to her. My friend was upset because my boyfriend had brushed her leg once while we were all laying in bed together, at 3am, while we were all drunk. I think any normal person wouldn’t think this is a big deal since we were all cuddling. She now is on a war path to basically tell me that my boyfriend of 3 years was trying to cheat on me (in front of me?) and that it made her super uncomfortable. She also apparently told her husband that my boyfriend was trying to make moves and now she’s “worried my husband won’t let me hangout with you anymore”. 

I have no idea how to respond to this since I’m pretty sure she’s just being incredibly egotistical in thinking that my boyfriend would ever want to sleep with her. I’m super offended that she would make it into this big of a deal and I’m not sure how to proceed. This friend is kind of a ridiculous person but I put up with it bc I love her but this feels like she’s trying to cross a line. I trust my boyfriend more than anything and I think the situation is kind of stupid. And now I have to defend my integrity to someone who always take a “holier than thou” approach to arguments.

472,"This is a crazy story, but it’s worth it. (TL;DR at bottom, but I definitely suggest reading) 

I (18F) have caught my coworker (19F) in more than a handful of lies. This coworker, we’ll call her Bonnie, is in my friend group, and everyone else believes every word that comes out of her mouth. 

We all work the night shift in a warehouse-type of place.

The first lie I caught Bonnie in was an apparent feud between her and the person who did her job on AM shift. She claimed that this person was leaving her notes.. I believed her because she showed me the first note. But then she claimed they escalated. 

The first time, the AM employee simply left a list of things that needed done before the end of our shift. To that, Bonnie wrote back that she was condescending, but spelled the word wrong. So the AM employee fixed her spelling. I saw all of that, but after that, Bonnie started saying that she was getting death threats everyday and was told to kill herself. I believed her at the time because she claimed that the AM employee was mentally ill. Bonnie even told me that she had gotten the girl written up. 

After a while, I told a friend of mine who also worked on AM shift. They were confused, as the employee in question isn’t mentally ill at all. And also hadn’t been written up because of it. The whole thing had stopped after the condescending note. 

The second lie was with another person in the friend group. Said friend has a wife who asked the person to unfriend Bonnie on Facebook, under the means that they were crazy. This friend and I have known each other outside of work, and I know his wife. So I know that this was true, as I witnessed her ask him to do so. However, after Bonnie realized. She said that the guy’s wife was jealous because she is “too pretty to be his friend”. 

Then, she made a sexual assault claim against a guy she was talking to in a way she shouldn’t have (Bonnie is in a long term relationship with the father of her three year old son). The guy started telling people he and Bonnie were dating, so she went to the supervisors and started this big deal. But she sent me screenshots of their conversation in Facebook. The conversation was weird because I could tell she had deleted messages before sending me screenshots. Also, on Facebook messenger you can set emojis for your conversation. Theirs was a heart. Also, anytime Bonnie interacted with said coworker, she seemed flirty and also seemed to enjoy their conversations. After everything had died down, I overheard her talking to him (even though to our friend group, she said she was going to quit if he wasn’t fired.. well, he wasn’t fired and she hasn’t quit even though it’s been about a month and a half since that whole thing happened). He also left two monsters in her spot in the break room for her, which she seemed giddy about and drank without questioning it. 

There have been more lies.. like, she cut her leg on something in the warehouse. Bonnie apparently has diabetes (even though her way of “combatting” it is to starve herself), so she said the injury was taking a huge toll on her. She claimed that she had a 90% chance of losing her leg. I’ll admit, the cut looked pretty gross. But not bad enough to get the entire leg removed. A few days after telling us there was a 90% chance she’d lose it, the number suddenly dropped to 10% (she claimed it was a miracle and the doctors were stunned). Then, she stopped mentioning it. 

Then, she said she was having heart palpitations at work and left to go the ER supposedly. She said she needed her heart shocked and had a catheter in her heart. Yet, she came into work the next day. She left early though, and said she was in the hospital. She also said she died three times that weekend, so she was missing two days of work to recover. But that story quickly changed and she said she was missing work because her dad died. Which was strange because she was using PTO instead of bereavement leave (you have to show proof of someone dying in order to get paid betterment leave). The last reason for her extended absence was that the coworker she filed the assault claim against was giving her panic attacks. 

Those weren’t relevant to the last story, but hopefully you understand the type of person I’m dealing with. This is kind of the final straw for me. 

Our bathroom at work has two stalls. The handicap stall, and a normal one. I was in the handicap stall today. The door to that one kind of shuts itself sometimes, and because it’s bigger, you can’t tell whether or not someone is actually in there. Well, while I was in there, I heard someone come in and go into the other stall. Immediately, I heard them flinging a rubber band (we use them a lot at work) against their wrist. After they did it, they would literally grimace/inhale in pain. They continued doing it four to five more times. Eventually, I was like “Who the heck would do that” so I looked at their shoes under the stall to see if I could recognize them, but I did not. So I just kind of say there confused. They left without flushing or washing their hands, like their sole purpose was to do that. 

Either way, I finished my business and left. As I’m leaving, I see Bonnie walking by with our supervisor. I noticed that her wrist was red and some spots were almost bleeding. I didn’t put the two situations together in my head yet, so I was just like “Dude, are you okay?” And she claimed something in the bag got her (we deal with donation bags of clothing at work. Quality heckling then is her least favorite job in the warehouse). I then realized something.. I didn’t really believe she’d lie about it, but I looked at her shoes anyway. They were the same ones from the bathroom. The bottom of her pants were the same as Rubber Band person, too. I just bit my lip and walked away. 

Now, I don’t know what to do. Everyone believes everything she says. Bonnie is a very vindictive person who will get you fired over the smallest shit. Our work is very negative about drama, so I’m scared to inform a supervisor that she is making false assault and incident claims. I don’t want them to think I’m just starting drama. What should I do?

474,"For context this is in Canada, and University in question is in our hometown,

My girlfriend applied to several universities for her masters program, two out of the five require on campus interviews. That's fine -- She can make it to them, and they sent out emails to her 2 weeks ago. However, one of them sent an email to her yesterday (a Tuesday) informing her of a compulsory language competency test (on the following Monday) and requiring payment immediately.

She planned a weekend out of town but now has to scramble to cancel to make it to this last minute additional criteria this university threw at her. 

I understand that they have all the bargaining chips, being the ones to offer her the masters program, and I also understand her feelings (she's sucking it up and cancelling previous plans to attend it) I'm concerned because:

1) It's unprofessional on their part -- Why couldn't they have included that information in the email they sent out two weeks ago?

2) What about students who don't live in our town and now have to rearrange distant travel arrangements/flights?

I feel it's unfair and I offered to write a complaint letter to the dean of the department myself; I wonder if publicizing might put pressure for them to change it for future applicants too.

475,"hi all. 

lately i’ve (24f) been feeling a bit stressed. most of my stress comes from having 3 children under the age of 3. i have a set of 2.5 year old twins and a 7 month old infant. i consider that stress to be normal though. tantrums, the twins waking up the baby, the baby refusing to nap, lack of sleep etc. it’s just the current phase of life that shall pass. 

i’m currently dealing with a lot of things that i feel is completely out of my control though. currently, my husband and i are in the process of buying a home. between our realtor, who (in my opinion) isn’t cutting it for me, and just the drop of a hat home tours, trying to get ahold of her, putting in offers, miscommunication, gathering the money needed and our lender, who gives us conflicting information, i have just completely detached myself from the home buying process. at this point, i’m like *“pick a house, any house PLEASE”*

many will say “well don’t buy a home then” but it’s important that we get out of our living situation. we currently live with my 61 year old grandmother. she is retired and have 3 extra rooms. this has allowed us to move from md to ga, save for a house while paying off debt, and get our feet on the ground. it’s a blessing and a curse. it’s like trying to teach an old dog new tricks. constantly having to remind her not to leave knives on counters (because 3 kids running around) or to not pull into the garage with the music blasting with the engine on because the twins bedroom is right up against it is very tiring. also, her idea of the AC on is 80° and meanwhile it feel like the bottom pits of hell. it’s just weird adjusting to living with your spouse and kids, with your own rules and privacy, to living under someone else’s rules. i don’t really want to rant about this more because i don’t want to come off ungrateful because i am extremely grateful for the opportunity of living here almost rent free while we get our shit together. it’s just this has become a stressor. to my marriage and to my parenting. 

to add, the IRS intercepted our refund and they haven’t really told us why. each time we call, they can’t see why it was intercepted. we both have paid our taxes, have no child support or anything else. that in itself is my main stressor. we’ve taken proper steps to get it back with the right paperwork but it’s just a waiting game now.

i have this habit of feeling like i *have* to figure out a way to fix/solve things. also, my husband seems to think i have all the answers and will figure everything out. just something i’ve always done so he’s used to it. this has really put a big weight on my shoulders and i’ve been having really bad migraines (for days straight), neck tensions, and sometimes get bad dizzy spells. i’m a mom, i can’t have these things happening to me when so many people depend on me. i was raised to be a strong woman but i feel like it’s all overwhelming and i can’t do it all. i’m hoping and praying that this is just a phase but in the meantime... help? 

what are some ways you guys manage stress? i want to deal with my stress better than letting it build up, shutting down, and eventually lashing out. i’m open to any ideas of how other individuals cope!

I’ve been doing odd jobs to stay out of that field but have been working in the background on being a raft guide.

I have a job opportunity in Moab this summer to guide. Doing this will set me up for better opportunities in seasons to come in many different places.

It sucks because we will be 5.5 hours away.

I just want some people to weigh in. She’s really supportive of me but I do also want to be with her for the most fun part of the year (summer! Camping, road trips, etc etc.) This would allow me happiness in my day to day though and get me into the outdoor industry where I want to end up. I will miss coming home to her to have fun and enjoy :/.

What would y’all do? Is it worth it to be a little far apart and just make time on weekends etc.?

We’re going to keep our apartment and I will simply pay for it from UT.",06Mar2019,1

Most of this was in the last 4 or 5 months
Im 13 and in first year (7/8 grade) and CK means creepy kid
So this CK tried to grope me
What happened was i was walking down the hall to the bathroom as i needed to go. so CK and his friend ran toward me and CK tried to grab my dick while his friend kept hold off me i managed to escape and ran toward a corner and behind me he screams ""KARL (me) CAN I FEEL YOUR PENIS"" i felt VERY uncomfortable after that but it still goes on. after lunch we had religion class and he says he wants to fuck his baby sister which made me feel fucking pissed and i just wanted to go home.
he keeps going
He sits beside me and says these exact words
""Karl if you dont sit beside me in this class i will drag you into the bathroom and RAPE you""
i forcingly did this out of fear as he tried to grope me earlier that day.
he did this for 3 weeks in every religion on tuesdays, he says ""Karl if you dont come over here i will drag you into the bathroom and rape you""
he also kept pushing his believes onto me aswell
one tuesday he wasnt in and i sat beside someone else and the next week he starts to try to make a scene like ""OMG KARL CANT BELIEVE YOU BETRAYED ME"" luckly the teacher came in so he shut his ass up cause he is a goody to shoes and that is the main problem.
he is a goody to shoes and idk if my tutor would believe me. he always says that ""it was only a joke"" or ""i was joking"" even though he is fully serious
recently he has threatened my friends aswell saying he'll punch the head off them.

I loved her with all my heart and when we broke up I messaged her three days later and she said I'm with my ex (she took it further by saying I always had feelings for him). 

She practically got over me in 3 days! And I'm still hung over it and it's been a month. She insisted on being friends but I guess she said that so she either isnt alone(she hasn't got no friends) or she was just letting me off the hook easy. I said no and we blocked each other out. 

She seems super happy about her relationship with her ex and I'm just lost without her.c

But basically, my biological Dad who I only found out about almost 2 years ago said to my Mum that if I wanted to get to know him I could. I took the advice of the replies from the original post and sent him a friends request on Facebook. He denied it in about 20 minutes. I was genuinely really shocked about this, and I asked my mums and she says it was probably his wife. 

Said ‘wife’ is the same lady who constantly comes into my place of work, makes me serve her and constantly stares at me when she’s doing her shopping. I’m always polite to her face as I don’t want her thinking my mum (who she hates for no reason) raised me to be rude.

I enjoy the sport in itself but I don’t particularly get along with my team. Part of it is probably because I have social anxiety so I don’t really talk to anyone on the team much. Track is much different for me because I actually have friends on the team that I’ve known so they’re easier to work with. Also since I have anxiety in general, I’m always worried about my performance on the field as opposed to track where I don’t have to worry about letting other people down but just focusing on myself.

489,"Hello all. I am struggling to wrap my head around this, so please forgive me if I ramble or seem otherwise incoherent. 

I have been friends with P for about 12 years, but I’ve been friends with her sister, G, for 27 years. P is older than us and lived in another state when we were younger. P moved here to be closer to family and we were friends the first time we met. Our families are close and our kids are growing up together. We celebrate every birthday, holiday, and life event together as a large rowdy group. 

P has recently been diagnosed with a primary high-grade brain tumor. It’s a terminal diagnosis even with treatment, and she’s refusing treatment. Because of the location of the tumor she will become paralyzed over the next several months until she passes. Around 25% of patients live to 12 months with treatment. These are the facts, and I feel like it’s a narration from a tv show when I say it or think about it. 

Since the event that led to the diagnosis, P moved in with G, so she has a full time care giver.  While she was in the hospital they started her disability paperwork and got her started on some other services. She has mostly just cleaned houses and looked after everyone’s kids since she moved here, so she has no employer benefits. P seems very calm about everything. She has made her decisions and is putting them in writing. Her grown daughter supports her decision to refuse treatment, and G is going to be her agent/executor. 

This family lost their father 8 years ago because of a terrible car wreck. He survived the wreck but succumbed to his injuries a few days later. Their mother passed 6 years ago. G and P cared for their mother through a series of illnesses until the end of her life. When G was a young mother (about 20 years ago) she cared for her terminally ill MIL until she passed. She broke up with that man many years ago and remarried about 12 years ago. 3 years ago she cared for her new MIL through the end of her life.  

The other day, G broke down to me saying how she doesn’t know how she’s going to survive this. P is one of her favorite people in the world. She said she feels like death follows her and she doesn’t know if she can watch anyone else die. I told her that she’s the strongest woman that I know...the rock of her family...and I’m so sorry she got handed this role. 

I’m so sad for P, but I’m scared for G. Im so afraid I’m going to watch my friend break under this weight and not know what to do, or not see it in time to help. 

What do I do? How do I help? Besides dropping off meals to relieve that chore...I just feel like I need to do something.

492,"A partner is a lot like money imo. It is a source of happiness. When that source of happiness is threatened, or you perceive a loss of control over it, you develop anxiety. With money though it is quite predictable. Yes you can never achieve absolute certaintly, I mean..tomorrow a depression could start, I get laid off, and my bank goes under and I lose every cent I have. But I perceive myself as having a level of control over it that I don't spend every waking second worrying about it.

But for a partner this seems really hard. I sometimes ask myself ""well what if she said sex was better with her ex"" and observe my reaction as an increase in anxiety. A feeling off loss over control over my future with her, but to be honest she could meet some random dude tomorrow who is drop dead stunning, brilliant, and has the best sex of her life. I just don't know...

It's tough to achieve that same level of perceived sense of control with a relationship, so I wanted to ask a couple things:

1. How do you know when something is insecurity or real, which cause you to obsess about your perceived lack of control in a relationship?

2. Is it possible to free yourself from the need for control over a relationship entirely?(kinda seems like saying that no happiness would derive from the relationship..so doubtful)

3. What are some relationship lines which are drawn not as an imposition of control on your partner, but a mental block to prevent increases of anxiety?(ex. I don't wanna know if the sex was better with her ex)",06Mar2019,1
494,"Hi! Guys I need a lawyer advise. I took a car with my boyfriend one year ago. Relationship didn't worked out for long having car together. We split after a month or so. He keep the car and promise to do the payments on time. I need to add he was doing all the payments and only he is using the car from the beggining. Things complicated when we split bc now he is not paying on time and it's effects my credit score but he doesn't care as much as I'm. What can I do? I try get agreement with him about the car but he want to destroy my life right now. He was trying to get me back but I'm not interested.  This mess is continuing since march 2018. I'm done, and I'm afraid of him a little. He is this kind of person which you don't wanna meet in your life never again. Reason why we spit was that he was aggressive after alcohol and liked to control my life and me. 
You can ask why the hell I took a car with a guy who behaved like this. He played it really good. I knew him for 9months before taking car together and he was the best person in the world, but since car should be our first thing to start our life together it was the last one. When we took car together more things popped up. I found out he is lying all the time about everything, he had issues after drinking alcohol, he became aggressive verbal and not only, he was jelous about everybody around me. Really toxic! At the end he told me I can't leave him bc we have a car together.
My question is:
How I can get out of this mess?
I'm tired all the time picking up the phone from the bank and hearing he is not paying. 
Any advice?

495,"Last week, I attended a club for an event my friend was putting together. When I arrived fairly early, I wanted to put my coat away. The person that was there at coat check told me it wasn't open. It would be open at 10:00pm. So at 10:00pm, I went back, and I got the same answer from before. 10:30pm, still the same thing. For my friend, he was getting ready in the back and using a bit of the coat check room as a prep room. I found him, and I asked, ""may I put this with you"". He accepted my jacket and put it under his care. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the night was dwindling down, I was ready to leave. At 1:00am, there was a coat check attendant there. I told her that my friend was having the event and my coat was somewhere in the back. She let me know to an area where most of the people that were under his wing put there coats.

&amp;#x200B;

My coat is no where to be found.

&amp;#x200B;

I find my friend and I ask him where he put my coat. Unfortunately, he was very intoxicated and didn't know where. So, I did a once over until either the owner, or some kind of management told me to leave the area where the coats where. I explained my situation to him and he said he couldn't help me. Mind you, this club is packed to the nines.

&amp;#x200B;

I go over to him again at this booth and told me what happened, he said that it ""might"" be in his car. Since I don't live in the same city as the club, my friend drove me home. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the morning, I asked him did he seen my coat in his car. He told me no, It's not in my car. He said he would go back to the club the next day cause he forgot his stuff. He said he'd look for it then.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I live, it's -13 and I work outside. I don't have another winter coat.

&amp;#x200B;

So, taking my own initiative, I called the club about my situation. They said they are only open on Fridays and Saturdays and they would call me back if they did or didn't find the jacket. No one called me. I called them 3 times and it went to voicemail (I forgot to mention the event was on a Friday, and I called on Saturday afternoon and evening. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where things get fishy.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my friend on Saturday evening about going back to the club and getting his stuff and looking for my jacket, he said he didn't get the stuff. He was sleeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this week I called, email and direct messaged the club on Instagram about the coat. Ghosted, no reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my friend if he went again or knew anyone that I could get in contact with. Ghosted. Nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called him several times, texted him and tried going to his house. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

497,"I (22F) just moved 2 states away to live with my boyfriend (23M) and his mom and got a pretty decent job working from home. I REALLY didn’t want to move in with him and his mom but the idea of living rent-free for a few months while we saved up for our first home together was enticing. 

On a slower work day for me, I made the bed, ran the dishwasher and had dinner ready by the time my bf came home and he and his mom loved it. He thought it was the best thing in the world and I definitely loved the ‘Mom Approves of Son’s Girlfriend’ look she had. So I’ve started doing things like this daily, they don’t really distract from my work and I like seeing him come home in a good mood.

Maybe I had a strong reaction to the positive reinforcement, but the “little things” have evolved. I started doing the household laundry, doing his moms shopping, running his lunch, having dinner ready for them, alphabetizing the pantry, vacuuming, dusting, mopping, Marie Kondo-ing the basement, you name it. Basically, my 9 hour work day turns into a 15 hour day trying to make a happy home because I feel like I owe him and his mom for living there for free. 

I’ve had busy days where maybe I had to travel and dishes didn’t get done...or their dog didn’t get an afternoon walk...or I forgot to sort the recycling. They’re both fine with it, but I can always hear the tinge of disappointment when they talk about what’s going to be done for dinner when they find out I didn’t make a meal that night.  I feel  it’s expected of me to do these things because I work from home and live there for free. I’ve been here in this cycle for about 6 weeks and I am getting so frustrated with myself. I want to enjoy myself and explore my new city and make new friends have a good work-life balance but feel tethered to this unrealistic expectation of being a hard working home maker with a full time job. 

Has anyone else experienced expectations like this from family members or roommates or themselves that just because you work from home you should contribute more to household chores? 
Alternatively, has anyone experienced the feeling of having to earn your keep or like you owe someone something even if those expectations have never been verbalized? 

Could my solution be to just rent out a remote office space?

I’m committed to my career and want to do my part in household chores, but I’m overwhelming myself. Plus, my sister (completely coincidentally) moved to my new city last week and I told her I couldn’t get dinner on her first night here because I had to put together his moms new exercise equipment. My sister was so understandably mad but my rent-free guilt kept me from caring. It’s starting to affect my personal life.

The exes family has no money to put towards the funeral, but they feel she deserves a good send-off. They have been contacting my husband to ask him to contribute.

So, I've been waffling on what to do with it.  Should I just sell it cheap on craigslist?  Keep it as a replacement in case I tear the sidewall out of one of the tires?  Or, buy a new rim and use it as a full-size spare.  

It won't fit my spare wheel so I'd need to find a rim.  Online, I found a steel rim for $65.  On craigslist, I found a wheel for $35, but that would mean an hour-long drive; nothing I can find is closer.    In 35 years of driving, I've used my spare tire twice.  So, it's not very likely I'll ever really need the spare, and if I do, I still have the donut.  So, it's $65 for something I will likely never need.

If I keep it as a replacement, it's just laying around my house somewhere taking up space.  Worried if I stick it  in the attic above the garage, the heat will wreck it.  Also, this is an all wheel drive car, so if the treads ultimately get worn down 50%, for instance, I can't really use this tire as a permanent replacement.

One possible point of interest is that my son and I have the same car, with the same tires.  So, whatever applies to me might also apply to him.  He doesn't care one way or the other, though.

During the interview she said that the teacher was fantastic she just needs help with some organizing but that was far from the truth. She has no control over her classroom and doesn’t even seem to have a basic sense of what she should be doing, she send home weekly progress reports for all the kids that are just copy and paste and it has thing the kids need to work on that we didn’t even talk about in class. The kids don’t respond to any sort of discipline, because they haven’t had any in 6 months they don’t even have a behavior plan for any of the classes even though they claim they do! The teacher I work with now even shook a kid. Even the assistant director was surprised at my credentials because I only have my BA in Psychology’s nothing specifically related to childcare or preschool. There is no communication and I didn’t even realized until after I was hired that the teacher left at 3:30 and I’m alone with kids until 5:30.  They are somehow a 5 star facility but it doesn’t look like it. They are supposed to serve the underserved population (black, brown, etc) which is why I took the job, but I feel like their taking advantage of them because they are just so unorganized and they just offer an idea.

School is currently pushing college onto me (15M) like crazy. I've only got two more years (after this year, of course) and then it's the adult world. I'm aware I can wait and go to college when I'm older, but I reeeeaally don't want to do that. And as for what I want to be, I've wanted to be a YouTuber since I was, like, 8, and I know for a fact that YouTube doesn't require any degrees. It's a fickle bitch, though, and I have, like, a 1/1,000,000% chance of actually getting somewhere with YouTube, so I obviously need some fall backs. My other fall back is being an author, but again, very slim chance. 

I'd like a degree to help kickstart me somewhere. 

I want to major in something with technology, since I'm absolutely fascinated by it all. IT, computer science, etc.

It's hard to explain how I feel, but basically...

I'm a teenage boy having a mid-life crisis. Woohoo.

TL;DR I don't know what I want to major in/strive for a career in. I love technology hardware, and being able to know how to fix my own issues with tech, but I also love software and being able to give people advice on things such as cybersecurity, malware protection, etc. ",06Mar2019,3

My girlfriend has struggled with eating disorders for awhile and because of this I’ve learned about the eating disorder section of tumblr. It’s a really dark disturbing part of the internet consisting of people with eating disorders trying to help each other fast. My girlfriend thankfully doesn’t go on it anymore but I occasionally go on tumblr just for memes and stuff. Anyways, I follow this girl in my grade (junior in high school) on tumblr , and we’re kinda friends, like we say hi to each other in the halls and stuff, but don’t have time to talk otherwise. My girlfriend is definitely friends with her and they’ve hung out a few times. Anyways, I think she forgot that I followed her tumblr because yesterday I saw her start using her account again after being inactive for awhile. She reblogged some memes that were normal but I also saw her reblog two things from an eating disorder related account. One was a “losing weight spell” and the other was a meme about gaining weight when eating only 900 calories.  Although these might seem tame (especially in comparison to some of the insane stuff that goes on in there), the accounts the memes are reblogged from are classic, hardcore ed accounts (with goal weights and all). 

My girlfriend has told me that when she started going on tumblr and looking at “thinspo” she got into it very quickly and found herself unable to get out. Is it in our places to mention anything?",06Mar2019,2

I am of course worried that this self-harm mentality will lead them to commit more serious acts of harm upon themselves and would like to know how exactly to handle the situation.

They've also told me that in the past people have committed them to various therapists or psychiatric institutions and that it hasn't worked to solve anything.

I want to move again, for the last time (hopefully) but I recently purchased a very nice set of cast iron skillets, new pots and pans, dishes etc. that I don’t want to sell. This means I’ll have approximately 4 large boxes of very heavy items and I’m not sure the best way to ship them. 

I’m considering renting a car to drive but that’s about $800 if I do a one way trip (they charge for having to return the car to the originating state, fairly so). Or it’s about $200 if I rent and return in the same state - but I’d still have to add gas, food and hotel for whomever would be driving to me and then returning back with me which will end up still being $700-$800.

530,"I've watched a video about shame by teal swan and Until that point I wasn't aware of how much shame I feel for myself. It maybe be the core to my shyness and social anxiety.
Like I'm ashamed for my beliefs and values, my opinions, therefor I don't express them much in public bc I'm so scared someone disagrees and I embarrass myself, bc they be right and wrong. I'm embarrassed of my music taste bc I don't wanna seem pretentious, I'm embarrassed to the way I look, my face, my hair, especially my body. I just don't like anything about myself. I have a couple hobbies but I can't find myself to stick to it, I always go back to old patterns, addicted to the internet and my phone. 

she said the only way to overcome shame is to know and question your social standards and either change or accept them.
What if I don't know my standards? What if I don't know where my shame stems from? I know that since I was little I was afraid of socializing, I don't know when it started but when I remember one time in kindergarten I didn't wanted to go, I cried and screamed and the nanny said ""why can't u be more like her?"". I was always made feel bad about myself for being too quiet, with no social skills and not capable of socializing, not knowing how to behave around people, so I decided it's best to just be quiet, be as invisible as possible, I was ashamed of myself. I didn't like the way my voice sound, the way I look, how I stand and behave, I just always expect people to reject me anyways. I don't know who I am. And it sounds so cliche to say but I just don't know. I don't know what I WANT only what MY PARENTS or SOCIETY wants. For example, I don't drink alcohol. As a child, being a grumpy loner I've never been invited to a party so I never had the opportunity. On top of that is my mom who told me how alcohol is bad etc so it's kinda like a lucky thing that I have social anxiety, it came just right for her, not trying to shame my mom honestly, but me suffering from social anxiety made her think that I was ""different"" and ""innocent"" and separated from the bad people, she didn't know what I was scared of people, sucked and making friends (no one really talked to me school) therefore I couldn't do anything ""bad"" In the eyes of my mother like drinking, it's like, there was not the possibility, it was a sure thing. Then there's the peer pressure side: everyone or mostly everyone drinks. I feel ashamed for not drinking. I don't want people to find that out about me. They will mock and laugh and question me. Commenting ""you're too young to not have fun"" or saying that I'm boring bc I don't drink. Bc I'm so indecisive I decided to not drink.
I don't know what to do, it's like I'm in a conflicted state constantly, not just alcohol but everything in life. Everything I life is not really my own desire or believe, it's only the expectations of others. It's not my standards its theirs. I don't know what I want, only what they want. To not drink means to cease into what my mother wants and to drink means to give into social pressure. BUT WHAT DO I WANT? How do I find out?﻿
I find myself always with ambivalent and conflicting feelings, I'm always so confused making me come off insecure and indecisive.
And I guess partly, I'm in this conflicted states bc I'm torn between wanting pleasing my mom and pleasing other people. Maybe that's why I'm so shy, I don't take charge and assume myself. I'm scared of social consequence.
Maybe this it the reason I feel anxiety, social anxiety and not overcome it. I'm a people pleaser, I'm a kiss ass, im scared of being my authentic self because one might not approve. I'm so scared to risk myself, especially socially, bc I don't want to embarrass myself in front of others, or what I perceive of being embarassing (like there's nothing wrong about asking if they have a vegan option at a cafe right?) I don't have an identity. I have my moms identity and societies identity, or what I believe is societies Identity.
Then there's my fear of intimacy. It's ironic, I have social anxiety bc I'm scared to do something perceived as ""wrong"" and yet social connection is the thing I want the most. I used to tell myself I don't need anyone, I love being alone but the truth is, I'm incredibly needy and sometimes I exaggerate when I approach my friend about a certain problem of mine, wanting to find a solution and ending up being annoying.
For example there's this guy at university I know for HS. We never really talked but he was always nice to me. When I saw him again I blushed and was in a shock mode, seeing him again. Since then I was thinking about him, more than I should, and then I thought I should approach him if I see him again. When I saw him, my anxiety was 10/10 unbearable. My muscles were so tense and like jelly, my heart beating so fast I thought it's going to drop or so. I decided to avoid him. I thought it wouldn't be self loving to force by self when I'm feeling so bad anxiety.
Yet That's another thing I'm confused about. Should i be avoiding situations that give me extremely bad anxiety or should I push myself and do it anyways? It's like I can't win: if I chose to avoid, I lose a social interaction, if I confront, I feel very bad, when the anxiety is intense, I end up having belly aches and migraine as a sort of anxiety hangover.",06Mar2019,1

I feel like I’m constantly proving myself over and over, and it hasn’t gotten me very far. 

I was a walk on (paying all tuition) and I received a scholarship (tuition paid, and ~4000 a semester). The money is nice, and I have ~$15,000 worth of debt already. I’ll hopefully get my MBA, our program is one year. So I have 2 seasons, 3 school years. 

Schedule: We show up at 6AM, get done at 11 and I have class a half hour later; no shower, no eating, straight to class. 

Studying: I have to spend my time studying the playbook or I’ll get yelled at in football. While I study my playbook, I obviously can’t study for school (two exams tomorrow)

Playing time: I’m currently hurt. I will be out for the majority, if not the entire spring season.

They seem like they have no time to care for it, and besides that, the dog is medium/large with a lot of energy being housed in an apartment.  The dog is in his crate all day while my friend is at school, work, or club activities.  It wouldn’t be as bad of a situation if his roommates were able + willing to take the dog out, but they are not.  The dog is very skittish and doesn’t trust very many people.  He can be intimidating, and he’s still an untrained young dog.  As a result of this, I have been taking care of the dog almost every day.  Taking him out to go to the bathroom, on walks, etc.  The dog has a ton of long hair, so you can’t really see his physical state, but he is severely underweight.  I can pick him up with ease, and a dog of this breed should not be able to be picked up that easily.  I can feel each of his ribs and his spine protruding.  It makes me sick to even type this.  I really enjoy taking care of this dog, and I’m very worried about him.  He needs exercise, to be taken to the vet, and to be fed and groomed properly.  He doesn’t even have any toys to play with in his crate.  I’m not really sure how to bring everything up to my friend, but I’ve already told them that they need to feed the dog much more than they have been.  At this point, I’m not even worried about the friendship—just the dog.  My friend is a good person, and I don’t think that they knew how much effort they would need to put into a dog.  I’m also worried that if the dog isn’t socialized properly, he will become dangerous.  He’s a big dog, and he’s never been taught that play-biting hurts or not to jump on people.  It’s frustrating because I want to discipline and socialize the dog, but he isn’t my dog and I’m not sure if that’s my place.  I would gladly take the dog if I could because I love the breed and know that this dog has the potential to be a really great dog.  What should I do, and how can I get the dog out of the bad situation that it’s in without making my friend feel awful?

540,"I'm a 22-year-old woman living in Sonoma County in CA. I've been with my boyfriend for a little over 3 years and we have been living together in an apartment for 2 of those years. My boyfriend recently got accepted in a grad school program in Boston. From the very beginning, we decided that if he was accepted I would come with him. It was something we have been talking about for several months and were both getting excited. We knew it was going to be stressful because we both dont really have connections in Boston but we were going to do it together. My family loves him and totally supported us going, things were going pretty well in general. Last week he reminded me that I should take time off work so we could go visit (we wouldn't have been moving there until late August giving us like 5 or 6 months to prepare more). Then 2 days later, completing out of the blue, we sit down to talk and he starts tearing up and tells me he doesnt want me to go to Boston with him anymore and we need to break up. I've had issues with my mental health in the past and we have an age gap where I'm 22 and he is 28 so he pretty much chalked it up to me being too needy and dependent. I talked for a bit and he didnt really respond, just packed up and left the apartment. I gave him a few days to think shit out and he agreed we could talk but it's been a week since seeing each other and he told me he doesnt think we should talk at all and I need to move out so he can move back into our apartment without me. This really isnt like him, things were going pretty well with us and it left me shocked and confused especially cause he wont let us talk about it face to face.

So now I am looking for a new place to live. I've found a few places I could go in the area but obviously rent would be more expensive since I wouldnt be sharing a room with someone (but still have roommates). 

To make matters worse, my hours at work are going to be considerably cut making me think I just need to leave and find another place to work because it would be find to balance two part time jobs.

Another issue for me is that I dont have my drivers license. I have my learners permit and I've been practicing for like 6 months here and there and I am going to try to take the test this month but it has been raining like crazy here and I'm still so nervous. I feel like I'm so close to getting it over with but it's been a long process for me. Right now I have my own car but I cant drive it alone.

My family has been super supportive and both my aunts and uncles offered for me to stay with them, at least for a bit. They both have nice houses but I'm worried about moving in with family and not having to grow as a person or be more independent. If I did I'd be choosing between living with my aunt and uncle in LA. Or my aunt, uncle, cousins, and grandparents in the bay area. There are pros and cons to both. Maybe a few months with them will let me get my head on straight and figure out what I want to do, like maybe prepare for going to grad school myself. But I also worry that I will get ""stuck"" and not fully live my own life. I'm at a weird age because I feel like I'm young enough to get some help from family and have some time to plan my future, but I feel like I also need a kick in the ass to be more independent.

I also still have that voice in the back of my head hoping that my boyfriend will change his mind and we can work this out. It's probably not healthy to hold on to that, but we had such a good relationship and I feel like if he could put some of his fears aside we could make this work.

But, a good 98 percent of them don't like to say good morning, afternoon, etc. Honestly, it kind of bothers me, because I grew up learning to speak to someone when you pass them, whether you know them or not. I understand everyone didn't grow up the way I did and no one is entitled to exchange pleasantries. I don't want this to effect the way I deal with others outside of work, but I don't want to continue to be friendly to people who don't share the same tendencies and just walk past me and ignore me.

549,"Hello!

My cat has recently gone missing. He has not been seen since last Friday. He is a 10 month old silver-grey moggy. He is microchipped, and I have a tag with his name, and my phone number on it. 

I let him out while I'm at work, since I live alone, he's alone in a very small London apartment all day. His routine has been to come home around 5-6pm, and chill with me at that time. He's never broken out of this routine, we've lived here for 3.5 months now. I wasn't too concerned for the first couple of days, but now it's become worrying to me. 

I've left him out his favourite wet food and water every day. On two days, I came home to an empty bowl, so there's some cat (or other creature) eating the food. I'm inclined to believe it's him, the entry point to my house is a small, and high-up bathroom window, which I feel like only he would try to jump through. I can't be sure of this though. I've seen two other cats in this area, both black, both with white legs. 

Cycling home tonight, I saw a cat that was the same colour and size as mine. It was on the opposite road to my house (0.1mi). It darted across the road, and up to a closed door. I instantly turned in to the road to see if it was him. As I was turning, the door opened a crack, and the cat ran in. The door then closed. I was about 10 meters away, and couldn't say for certainty it was him, but I've yet to see any moggies in the area, and none the colour of my cat. 

I've thought about knocking on the door, but there are 16 flats in this building, it seems a bit futile. Does anyone have any advice on how I could approach this? I'd really appreciate some perspective. Am I being too suspicious about this cat I saw? Is there anything more I can be doing to try and get him back? 

Thanks for reading!

552,"I work at a corporate office in downtown Baltimore.  I have worked here for almost 15 years and there has been the occasional day-time roach spotting.  These guys are HUGE and gross, but I could probably count on my hands the number of sightings in the first decade that I worked here.  Fast forward (or rewind?) to the past 2-3 years and the number of daytime sightings have increased significantly.  There is at least 1 reported roach sighting per day, and I can recall **two separate occasions** where roaches fell from the ceiling onto people's desks.  I saw one that occupied our bathroom for a week that, I swear to god, was as big as a mouse.  One employee was on a conference call when she felt something on her foot - and there was a huge cockroach climbing on her legs.  My sister, at one point, saw an open pipe (like the access panel was off/wide open) in the parking garage that literally had a writhing ball of roaches.  I'm no roach expert, but this sounds like a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a fear of bugs, specifically crunchy, disgusting bugs like roaches.  It's literally giving me anxiety at work where I am constantly scanning my office looking for bugs.  I'm afraid to open boxes and files that have been sitting around.  I'm afraid they'll get into my belongings and be transported home.  I don't think I would be able to return to my office if I found one in there... but I've seen them enough to know that they are somewhere in here!

&amp;#x200B;

We regularly report the sightings to the building maintenance and managers who tell us that they spray 1x per year, and that the building will never be bug free.  They more or less blow it off and roll their eyes when we report it.   There was previously a kitchen/cafe in the building (which also had roaches), but it closed when a major tenant moved out and most floors are currently vacant.  They just started some construction in the building, as well.  With most floors vacant it sure seems like a good time to ramp up pest control, but they're not doing anything about it.  What, if anything, can be done to motivate the building to take action?",06Mar2019,2
553,"Hello,

this is the fist time ever I post on reddit, so apologies if this is a wrong sub.   
I am about to graduate med school (this is my undergraduate degree) in a few months. Thing is, for the last 3,4 years I knew I did not want to become a doctor. Because of various life reasons, I could not change my degree (despite trying, twice - I was declined because I did not take higher maths in high school). In the end, partly due to financial reasons, I decided to finish the degree, rather than drop out of Uni with nothing. 

The problem is, I do not know what to do now, after I graduate. I need to go to work to support my living (so another degree right now is not an option as I cannot afford it) but the idea of working in the hospital is absolutely dreadful. I do not want to pursue a career in a field which is so competitive and draining (especially that I know I just do not want to work as a doctor). I am planning to try and work as a medic for a while to see if it is as bad as I think it is and to save some money, which would allow me to e.g. pursue a different career path.

My biggest problem is, however, that I do not know what to do instead. I do not know what other career I could pursue. My interests include art and Russian but I am not exceptionally good in either of them - these are my hobbies but I do not feel I am competent in either to realistically have a career in these. And, frankly, throughout my med school I did not have time to foster these hobbies too much. I am afraid that if I leave medicine without a formed alternative career path (or at least a decent idea of it) I will just end up feeling more miserable. On the other hand, I know that if I stay it will do nothing to improve the way I feel currently. I obviously cannot change my past mistakes so there is no point ruminating about them. I just want to make the presence and the future a bit more bearable for me and the only person who can cause the change is myself. I do not mind earning less than a doctor.

I do not know what opportunities, other than a career in medicine, my diploma gives me. As far as I understand, if I would like to be a scientist I would need a masters degree in a given field (I am based in the UK)?

If someone was in a similar situation, I would be very happy if they shared their thoughts.   
I am just fed up with feeling so lost in my life and it takes a huge toll on me and people around me as everyone is so helpless. 

Thank you",06Mar2019,1
554,"hey guys,

perhaps this is the absolutely worst thing I could do in this situation but I’ll just carry on writing this.
It wouldn’t be the first time that people ik irl find threads of mine and talk to me about it, because they’re worried, so I’ll just tray to stay as anonymous as possible, although it could be hard here.

I’m just having all these thoughts in my mind and I just need to get this off my chest.

Perhaps, before battling the actual problem or even finding out what it actually is, I can tell you a bit about myself to give you some bg information.
I’m an 18 year old, female college student from germany.
I’m single since I was 16 or so which in actual isn’t a big problem to me... or was atleast, I’m not sure.
My last 2 relationships weren’t long and yknow, kind of trashy, typical teenage garbage. 
Both lasted around 6 months with the first having cheated on me because I didn’t want to sleep with him and the second coming from an conservative household, thus we could only see each other in secret and at the end he preferred to spend time with his friends rather than with me.
But nvm that, it’s not about that.

I’ll just start typing out my thoughts.

My friends are either in happy long-lasting relationships or single like me.
Roughly 10% might be in relationships.
Most of my friends are single.
I’d say 70% of the singles are (sorry to say this) desperate and have no hesistance to show it, which -to be honest- kind of started to disgust me after a while.
Desperate for me means crying every goddamn time anything relationshiprelated is being said or crying about being single every time they’re drunk.
Also having instant crushes on someone that was just nice to them, although I could be guilty of that sometimes too.
But its still kind of uncomfortable to me.... idk if that’s unnormal but hm.
I feel bad for saying this of course too, I mean, they’re still my friends. (But the feeling of being anonymous (kind of) really saves it.)
I always try to cheer them up after they come to me (probably half-drunk on parties) crying and talking about all they things they would do and risk to actually get into a relationship (with Person xy) and whining about why they’re not loved romantically by somebody.
I always tried to stay positive though and reminded them of the other people that love them platonically in their life.
But that wasn’t always the best advice and I understand that, but reminding them that someday in future they MIGHT meet their S/O although they’re single for now and an unknown time isn’t really uplifting too, is it?
Their Attitudes towards this made me think myself too though.
Being rejected by my last crush (who was also the first guy to reject me) and having rejected some guys in the past, I started thinking about my single-life.
I certainly feel lonely at times too.
But in no way I want to seem desperate (like them).
A while ago i tried to convince myself as to why I don’t need a man to be happy and that I’ve already got everything to lead a happy life and surprisingly, it worked for a good amount of time.
I tried to convince my single friends of this too but it didn’t really help long for most of them, really, they would just fall back into their old whining scheme after a  week or so.(this sounds meaner than it should but hm)
Sometimes, even for me, the feeling of wanting to have somebody beside me in certain situations comes back.
I just wish I could have somebody to share certain special moments with to make them even sweeter, you know?
And somehow every time I felt that way, my positive attitude about being happy as a single has shrunken a little.

I realized this today even more.
I was out with two of my friends , after seeing that we had a class together today and talking with them there, after college.
They’re both boys, pretty handsome and nice. One of them lives in my dorm whilst the other lives in the neighbor city.
I used to crush on the one from the neighbor city  because I thought he was really pretty(and he certainly is really handsome!) but after hearing his ""girl-""stories from my dorm-friend, I was really grossed out and shocked.
-I will just continue to call them city friend and dorm friend-
In short, after his last 2 year relationship, the city friend fucked around with over 30 girls and also had a list of what he wanted to ""do"" next. (He for example already had something with a mother, a milf, etc.)
He all met them through clubbing and tinder mostly.
My dorm friend also showed me pics of some girls the city friend had send to him in the past and I’ve really got to say, that they were really pretty, understandably.
I used to be really selfconcious in my early teen years, so I’m kind of proud to say that I gained my confidence back over time, but seeing these girls made me really sick for some unknown reason? I don’t know.
Might be the fact that they were in lingerie or that i was lowkey still crushing on him without realizing it.
But I felt bad.
Maybe also Bad because I didn’t look like that somehow and I really hate to admit that. But yeah.
Some time ago when we actually first met I thought that I might’ve had a chance with the cityfriend because he was kind of flirtatious the first times we talked but I guess it’s just his personality. And this got kind of proven today.
I really don’t want to compare myself to other girls because I think there are several types of beauties out there but thinking about what he might’ve liked and what other or most guys(sorry for generalizing) probably still like made me kind I’d sick.
I don’t want to sound like ""im not like other girls""-type of girls, but... let me just show explain.
These girls looked like Instagram baddies, the latest pic I remember is probably an Asian and a white girl he had a threesome with.
Both glam-makeup, young faces, skinny slender bodies and minimal curves and overall this cute but also baddie aesthetic.
I in no way look like that.
Many people told me that I look very much a like to segovia amil, most even thought it was me after showing a pic of her to ask what they think, so you might have a pic of that in your head rn, because I don’t want to share pics of me here to stay anonymous.
My fashion style kind of shrunk since I am in college, in the past I used to wear some more body defining tops and jackets.
(I’ve got a normal weight with big curves, which everyone online seems to admire but irl not so much I guess? Atleast the people in my generation, idk.)
((To note is that I used to have a goth phase a while ago until I got here to college so wearing fishnets tops and siouxsie Sioux kind of clothing was also a big part of my old aesthetic but almost nobody knows here, gladly )
But having alittle bit of stomach made me really selfconcious over time, it’s not big but... it’s there.
So I went over to hoodies rq - and now oversized hoodies from several popular brands to make it atleast  seem not so hobo-ish is what I wear like... always.
One of my male friends told me it’s cute and I actually got flirted with in college more after starting to dress like this... I feel like people don’t look at me as much anymore as they used to. Which might maybe even a good thing because they could’ve judged me before.
But about the stomach thing:
I’m probably getting a lipo on my stomach and upper arms in a few weeks because I finally got my father convinced to do it.
I hope it will turn out well.

Anyways, the thing why I realized that this thing between us could never happen is because he talked with me about his friendzone today and how he has this crush on that girl he went on 6 dates with (without to do anything sexual to add!!!) and how she seems to ignore him after he rejected her initiated kiss(because he wants to stay single until my dormfriend is old enough to go clubbing with him, which is in around 3 months.).
I just told him that he should just talk with her about it and tell her how he feels and the dorm friend also said that if it’s making him so sad he should just be honest.
So, uh, yeah.
I am happy I am friends with both of them but I feel like...
God this will make me sound so stupid.
But
they perhaps don’t perceive me as attractive and that that somehow might be a bad thing?
I am used to guys talking to me and adding comments about my looks sometimes.
i actually like that kind of flirtatious friendship, which are like most of mine, but I feel like they treat me kind of differently, they’re being super nice to me and all but... idk, I feel like there should be an intention behind that.
Perhaps they really just want to be friends... but does that mean that I might be too unattractive?

I also looked really messy today, wore glasses, no foundation and my lipstick was a little smeared, but I tried to not care.
Although I thought to myself at some points what they might think... if I look ugly at that point in the convo? And all that stuff.
I am the type of person who’s also always checking mirrors to see how I look and always try to look flawless although it doesn’t always work like that.

My kind of flawless might be different of what the other people perceive as such and that should actually be okay but...
...I don’t know why I have this stigma about wanting to be one of the prettiest people, but I do.
I am realizing whilst typing this right now but... gosh.
This is all too complicated and I am so sorry for everybody who has to read this.
Perhaps you can give me any tips on how to... even do life because I feel like my thoughts are so weird sometimes?
I don’t understand myself and feelings at times too so perhaps somebody else could understand me a little better... or atleast I hope so.

And to that city guy-
He wasn’t my first crush here.
The other one was a guy who’s in a class with one of my friends and i have my english and PE classes with him.
He always greets me and says goodbye and we hold longer eye contact sometimes but I feel like even his friend who immediately followed me on IG after one PE class when he talked and flirted a little with me shows more action than him.(with flirting I mean making racy comments but perhaps this was also just him being normal to me because I heard he’s a womanizer) 
Today we didn’t even talk because I didn’t see him in the morning  but I heard him saying goodbye when passing me by and I immediately responded to that.
...Perhaps he’s just being nice but it doesn’t help that he has such a sympathetic aura and even better looks and also greeting me only when seeing me, lmao.
I actually looked up his IG in the past but it completely changed my views on him. It was... kind of what I expected but also kind of what I feared to be, tbh.
We actually found out that he and his other friend are fucking around too, even talked loudly about a girl they both fucked at different times once in class (where I was not present) and well, mh yeah.

Perhaps Highschool is running by late but I still have this image of myself in the head where I am perceived as a huge nerd and weirdo, although I don’t feel like that’s the case here in college as they didn’t know me any prior and met me as that ""hoodie-girl"".
But I feel like I might be over analyzing so much and tbh I might not even worth it considering that somebody like that city boy or the other boy in class I have might even be slightly interested in me, relationship wise.
Perhaps I am just seen as some unattractive bag for the city boy and just another classmate for the other guy and not even being seen as something female, but atleast not treated as abnormally as in Highschool.
But...
Every time they do something remotely nice I feel like for a moment they could really be interested in me, or atleast I thought that about the city friend before I knew his story and the boy from my classes aswell.
Goodness.

Every time somebody seems remotely more attractive than what I am used to be with the boys around me I get all giddy and nervous and I just feel like it’s not worth even trying... i dont feel ugly when I see myself in the mirror but perhaps they might perceive me as such and I’m not realizing it.
As an ugly-nice girl they can befriend.


Please don’t write any offensive comment towards me i was trying to be really open about my feelings as I had never discussed them like that before and I will read everything, if anybody even dares to read this huge text and even comment afterwards...

Please just give me tips.
And advice
On everything you might’ve spotted fixable.

I had most of my sexual experiences during housepartys when I was drunk.
Also I lost my virginity sadly to a guy who used my drunken at his house party and this was ultimately the reason I don’t drink anymore.
He promised me the world an all that relationship trash and I was so dumb, young and naive to believe him.

556,"My wife and I bought a house last year and I've taken on a few home improvement projects such as replacing the floor, trim, and repainting. My father—who is a 75 year old swiss army knife who likely has asperger and is a perfectionist—is helping with the basement remodel. He's currently been working on the basement bathroom while I'm at work during the day, but he'll occasionally goes upstairs to see what I've been up to and make mental notes of what I've done wrong.

Today I'm WFH and he came to work on the basement. He comes upstairs and says he needs to talk to me and I could tell he was already frustrated with something else. When he's in that mode there is no compromising, he speaks, I listen, I agree, or else we get into a big argument. However, I didn't want to listen. 

He goes on to criticize the family room priming job and how the primer wasn't mixed properly and that's why the walls looked like they did (my friend mixed the primer and we'll need to do a second coat anyway). Then he went on to criticize the zero-VOC 5 gallon jugs we bought at 50% off even though I kept reiterating the point that my wife is 14-weeks *PREGNANT,* which he knows. We have to have zero-VOC paint so she's not breathing in toxic fumes! And despite that he went on a rant about how cheaper isn't always better. What we got isn't even low quality paint either, but somehow is to him:

[https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-Premium-Plus-5-gal-57-Frost-Eggshell-Enamel-Low-Odor-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-205005/204383429](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-Premium-Plus-5-gal-57-Frost-Eggshell-Enamel-Low-Odor-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-205005/204383429)

At that point I didn't want to talk and as usual he got offended since I didn't want his opinion. I should mention I suffer from anxiety and depression and the fact that I sanded 600 sq ft of family room walls and then later primed it with a friend is a feat in itself for me. Last night I had taken the ceiling and wall paint 5 gallon jugs, stirred them with an electric drill and paint mixer attachment, dumped them into 1 gallon jugs for future work, and sealed them up.

I was proud of myself for not letting the procrastination take me last night, and I managed to get something done. However, I can always count on him to come along and tell me I'm doing something wrong. Air is getting into the paint so I'll likely have bad paint next time according to him.

I don't know why I need his approval so badly. Maybe it's because it almost never arises, unless I get a raise or graduate school. I'm starved for that approval. 

The longer I'm away from him, the more I heal. However, when he starts getting in my business I feel weak, suffocated, and powerless. Like I'll burn myself on the stove with any action. I've tried to explain this to him multiple ways but he doesn't get it. He thinks he's helping by warning me about future frustrations, when in my eyes he's causing frustration with his perfectionistic nature since *nothing is ever good enough* and I don't want to work afterwards since it's alway wrong.

My wife is a third of the way through her pregnancy and rather than getting a pat on the back from him for taking action, I get shit on. *I need to get work done, not obsess over the nuances of it.* What am I supposed to do? I want to ignore him but I can't. He always hits a nerve with this stuff.

557,"Hello r/Advice! After months of career debate for my future I have finally made a decision that makes me happy, but will be difficult. I currently work in information systems and plan to become a personal trainer instead. 30F if that makes a difference.

Here is my dilemma: My current job offers decent pay (42k), amazing health insurance and dental, a retirement plan I cannot beat, stability, and sending me on a worktrip this summer/fall. Since I am currently paying down debt and require health insurance (cptsd/depression/anxiety) it's pretty great. The downside is the commute is awful, not only do I lose 2.5hrs, sometimes more, daily but the stress of the bumper to bumper commute which is through a major city takes its toll. For reasons I cannot disclose, this job is also incredibly triggering for my cptsd and so my mental health is starting to really take a hit, so much so that I setup an appointnent to discuss adding medication. This also means I'm usually so mentally drained by the time I leave that working on my new career doesn't always happen or doesn't happen as much/well as it should.

My living situation is I moved home recently to help with ill family. My plan during this time was aggressively pay down debt and theoretically be back out in the fall, depending how things go with my family. Plus I had an upcoming surgery so win-win situation despite the madness of being back home lol.

The way I see it there are 3 options:
1. Tough it out at new job until I move back out, which would reduce commute and allow me more time to put towards my new career.
2. Look for a job closer to home, likely with less pay and benefits, but allowing more and better time towards my new career. Downside would be less money towards debt and possibly more expensive health coverage.
3. Since I also had a recent surgery and have to get back in shape first and foremost for this new career anyway, focus on that for right now while studying when I can and then in a few months after my work trip, switch jobs closer to home. I can then also look for one specifically fitness related that would help me along my journey.

""I want to be a veterinarian"", ""I want to be a surgeon"", ""I want to be a game designer"", they were all just thoughts that seemed nice at the moment, easy ways to do assignment then immediately go on with my life. I never actually had any interest in programming or medicine. 

Fast forward to now, I chose English because I had fun writing fanfic, and just writing in general, plus I didn't want to go undecided. Four semesters in, and I hate the days I have English class while enjoying the ones I have my Gen Ed and Japanese (my on a whim minor) on. I can't stand listening to the professors drone on about Victorian society and women's oppression for ninety minutes. I don't even try to read the books, and even now I'm struggling to answer a forum post about I book I haven't read, and likewise writing an essay based on just Sparknotes is a nightmare. I spend most of the lecture farming on a phone game while passively listening.

I don't have a job, and little to no qualifications for one. I can't even drive; I depend on my sister to take me. In my spare time, all I do is play video games and watch stuff online at my parents house. My life is at a complete stand still that will take a steep nose dive if I actually manage to graduate. I stew in self loathing all the time, thinking how much of a burden I am to my parents who have given literally everything I could've wanted, only asking me to deliver good grades.

Basically, I don't have an ability to enjoy nice things because I am worried about my ""image"". Let me illustrate it with an example.

I am a car fan. I like different driving machines. In a couple of years - I hope - I will be able to afford a new or newer car. Of course, I ""shop"" all the time - you know, the same way a lot of people shop for designer clothes and such. Every now and then I see a car that I kind of like. But then...
It's a BMW? Well people will think I am an asshole.
It's a Merc? I am a badge whore
It's a Buick? Here is my Senior Citizen association membership.

Even body styles. I like SUVs. But SUVs are mommy mobiles and I am not a mommy (I'm a dad:D)

I've always had bad social skills all my life, and im 14, about to graduate from middle school. When I came to my current school I snitched on people and annoyed them. Now high school is a totally different ball game. There are only 12 kids at my high school im going to next fall. I've gone up to the school about 3 times and went to two events w/the school. Now the first event was my first dance! and I danced with **three** girls that were all so pretty :D.

568,"How to boost an anxious kids self esteem? 

Hello. I am a part-time reading tutor at an elementary school. I have one student who reminds me of myself at her age. I don’t want her to be how I was in school. After elementary school, I was a very anxious, depressed, and antisocial kid. 

The school is aware of her emotional breakdowns. I was told it’s “her way of getting out of work” but I personally think there’s more to her then that. I work one-on-one with her and she occasionally will tell me something about her family that reminds me so much of my own. For example, she told me that she’s not very smart and her brother said so. I told her that’s not nice or true and that she should tell her parents. She said they would say the same thing. I make sure to tell her she’s really smart everyday after I heard this from her. I have started encouraging her to use her words instead of getting upset and crying when something goes wrong (exactly what I used to do). Today, she was upset and afraid to ask if she could borrow another students scissors. An assistant teacher actually told me this. When she is in a good mood she’s bubbly and not afraid to ask for anything. 

Is there anything else I can do? Any encouraging phrases and sayings I can repeat to her? Any helpful/encouraging stories or books I can read with and give to her?

The reason I’m asking here is I’m hoping to find a recommendation for a book or something that will stick with this kid for life and hopefully help her through some rough times later. Please let me know if you had a similar experience and what helped you. 

Thank you!!",06Mar2019,1

577,"I find it hard to start, it feels like I'm losing my friends over something that shouldn't feel so difficult. 

It all came to a breaking point; I shared a video talking about privilege, I honestly thought it was a mindful thoughtful and interesting video with straight up simple, fact.

One friend decided to shit on it, with him I'm used to being shat on because as I'm growing up I'm getting more into politics, some dots were connected this last year ;). I'm more comfortable in taking a standpoint instead of accepting that some people just over shout and say dumb or hurful stuff (the kind of thing that you know you're right so it's good). 

It snapped when he (no joke) ;"" you can't deny that, Caucasian, asians and jews are just a more hard working culture"". 

It just shocked me... 

Another instance was one of those anecdotes where you rate people based on the story told, and discuss why you ranked a character as such. One of my friends interrupted the discussions bellowing, 'she's just a slut, she deserves this' with his poor girlfriend uncomfortable next to him. 

Besides that, I'm noticing small racist vibes just in social occasions and sometimes I blame my self for being to serious. But I honestly think it's done for me to be chill about racism even if it's just a joke. I'm seeing more and more of the international world and my (Dutch) world is clashing. It makes me feel uncomfortable to be with my best friends that I known for years. Because if a racist/sexist joke is made they will probably all laugh. 

From my point of view it's almost impossible to find friends/people who won't make fun of a race and I think that it's kinda sad that in the Holland that I've grew up in I always thought racism wasn't a thing. But it's so integrated and socially accepted that it's actually extra painful. 

I still have of good memories with these friends and we've been through a lot. But I keep seeing a side of them that I've always accepted but now it keeps triggering me to bite down and get angry and eventually push them away. 

I am honestly afraid to lose my (childhood) friends over this so please respond in a fit matter, really stuck in avoiding and not knowing how to deal with this.

I'm currently nearing the end of my country's version of highschool, which means that my final exams are coming up and I'll have to choose what I'm going to do next year. I decided I wanted to try to get into med-school but because so many people want that we all have to make a really hard test which will decide who'll get into this school and who won't. I've been meaning to study for this test but it just won't work, I can't get myself to start or study any longer than half an hour. The school I go to is quite prestigious which means there were times where I had to study quite hard before and I've always had problems with my concentration, but never as severe as of right now.

Most people would describe me as lazy, I have never practiced a sport for longer than six months because I get bored or picked up a real hobby and actually did something with it. Untill now I was fine with learning very little and still passing my classes, but now I'm not even able to sit down and study for any longer than 30 minutes, maybe less and I'm starting to fail on tests more and more. I am stressing out right now while watching GoT and I just don't know how to get myself to work.

584,"So i had a thought... I dont think my boyfriend is over his first girlfriend ( his first love). Hes projecting what she did to him on to other girls because he still loves her but resents her. He never got over her? He tried and the two gfs after her never worked(i dont remeber their names) because he did to them what she did to him.
 He wants me to stay loyal to him(physically, mentally and emotionally) but he doesnt want to be loyal to me(mentally, and emotionally) hes only loyal to me physically because he thinks hes small and is insecure and he views that as a negative thing.So hes doing to me what he did to his last to two gfs which is what his first gf did to him. because she didnt want him in any of the three ways except as a bank and thats why hes afraid of putting in effort into our relationship because hes afraid of not being loved and getting used again because she never loved him? 
He resents his first ""love"" so much and hasnt been able to get over that anger so he projects what she did?
 Like that happend with me. it wasnt until i got over my first boyfriend, also my first ""love,""  that i knew what i want in a relationship. Patience, honesty, trust, loyalty. So like ( my exs after my first bf) got the shit end of the stick just like the the gfs he had after his first love.
 Im just trying to understand why he the way he is. I cant make him get over her, he has to do it himself. Im an understanding person but im tired of being treated crappy because i dont deserve it. 
Yes im an over thinker and emotional but those are also big strengths of mine, at least i think?
 I think love is about finding someone who understands you. I understand him but he doesnt understand me.
 I wish he smoked weed because maybe he would. Its opened my eyes so much more as to how to be a better me. I overthink every thing but when i smoke i feel like i understand me better
 So i wish he could experience that because then maybe he could understand not only me but humself as well and we could grow together and just understand each other. He really does have good qualities about him, because i have seen that side of him and i like that side of him but hes letting his insecurities take prioity of his(our) relationship. And thats not fair to me. Im patient but im running out of it. I feel crazy for staying with him but i just wanna love his little insecure heart so bad.

Last year, some of my jokes were taken out of context and principals thought me and my friend were planning an attack on the school. Long story short, i ended up getting suspended for almost 3 months and my friends got expelled. I have a group of friends who are basically my only friends. Let’s give them names to make this easy
Friend 1 : B
Friend 2 : A
Friend 3 : P
Not so Friend 4 : S
Friend 5 : D
So my group of good friends are B, A, and P. P was the one who got expelled. B and A now are basically the only people that talk to me (i’m kind of a loner) and they were really saddened that P was expelled and they don’t know. I told them that i wasn’t suspended and i went to another country for a funeral and wedding. As far as they know, I wasn’t involved with P getting expelled and it was a coincidence that the day he got expelled was the day i went to another country. I’ve always wanted to tell them the truth but i’m afraid that they might stop hanging out with me because i was involved with P getting expelled (again, they’re the only ones that talk to me). I’ve told two of my more distant friends D and S about it because i don’t have much to lose if they think poorly about me since somehow the school knew but i brushed it off. Whatever the school said wasn’t close to what actually happened and was what a serial killer would do. I thought people wouldn’t believe me if i told them the truth.
S has recently become aggressive toward me for no apparent reason. He has sexually assaulted me and talks trash about B to his face and behind his back. So, i’ve cut connections with him and he recently told me to stop being an ass or i’ll reveal your secret. This obviously scared me but i don’t want to have anything to do with S because he’s like an animal where he would scream in class and kick and punch people randomly (I was one of these people he punched). S told somebody my secret and said that i was planning a bomb attack on my school and i was going to do it until the police caught me or whatever so ik he’ll tell it worse if he tells everyone. I want to tell my A and B before he tells everyone so they know the truth but i’m afraid if they’ll leave me. What do i do?

I'm in my second year of university now and I'm trying to get through it, whilst working at the same time. But to be honest, while I absolutely love my job, that provides some pressure as I have to deal with a lot of rubbish from people. 

But most significantly, it has been my emotions that have played up a lot in the past two years. Most of it stems from the fear of being alone.

I haven't been with anyone other than a girl I saw briefly two years ago, and that took me forever to get over. Eventually when I finally got there, someone else came along.

Long story short: she asked me and we went out, scheduled a second time but it's never happened. We still talk but I don't know what her thoughts are, but I like her a lot I just haven't been able to convey that to her. 

At this point, me and her aren't going anywhere as I've accepted nothing will happen. It's upset me and quite frankly I just want to hide from everyone and everything.

My mom and dad broke up when i was 3, when she left us to leave back to her home country. She's been an alcoholic for all her life, and has mental issues like depression, anxiety and something else that i don't know the diagnosis of (she believes that she's talking to my dad's dead mother on a daily basis, and sees little elves in forests. Also she and my dad adopted her sister's grandkid when he was 3 and took him around the world with them for 3 months. Then she got a "" strong feeling"" that this toddler is actually possessed by demons and returned him to the orphanage.) When my oldest brother was a kid she used to drink in the kitchen the whole day, wait until he got home and then run after him and the cat with a butcher's knife. When he'd managed to block her entrance to his room she'd break plates against his door until my dad came home. 

Obviously she doesn't see an alcohol problem or any problems with her personality anyways. She's guilt tripping my brother to send her money for food which she uses to buy alcohol and cigs, or goes to some expensive restaurant etc. She has threatened to kill herself many times and I got my first ""suicide"" phonecall when I was 13.

We live on different sides of Europe so I don't really go visit her,because it really is a waste of time and money.

She's been nothing but a horrible person to my dad and my siblings. I decide every three months to cut all communication with her but fail every time when I start getting a natural craving for mothers love and attention.

I don't know what to do. My brothers dont seem to want to do any radical decisions and they talk to her maybe twice to five times a year. I thought about doing the same but i find it very difficult to ignore a persons calls (or blocking them) for months and then calling them on Christmas time like everythings fine. It's impossible to talk with her about the pain she's caused or anything else but mundaine stuff, because she refuses to see herself as anything else but the victim and everyone else as attackers.

I'm scared that if i cut her out of my life (as toxic as she is) it'll come back to bite me when she manages so hurt herself so badly that she does die. I know that she's lonely but she's done this to herself and I really can't help someone who refuses to admit that there is a problem.

I'm not gonna lie, it hurts. It hurts a hell of a lot. Especially since she always sits next to me on the bus. (It's usually very full)

Any advice for how to figure this out? I don’t want the “do what you love” thing because I don’t love anything. I don’t have anything I’m passionate about except playing Xbox and sleeping. I just need to figure out how to power through this semester and find something I won’t hate. Any advice or tips? ",06Mar2019,1

I have no idea what to do, or what I want to do with my life. I don't have time to be creative as I can barely make ends meet. 

I owe my landlord $216 from last months rent, and couldn't afford to pay this months. Heat and hydro bills stacking up as well. I literally have like 20 cents in my bank account, no exaggeration. Cannot get credit. No friends to help. 

I left an abusive family so they can't help me... every last one cut out of my life. Basically I told my landlord I can't afford to pay ( i got like nothing in student loans) and that I could find a lease take over so he doesn't get burned. I don't feel so so bad about this because he was abusive and belligerent to me in the past, the place gave me bad vibes and i had to get away from my mom, but this fear based decision from my toxic mom landed me in an even worse situation. I went to school for the wrong reasons and I took the first apartment I was offered. He lied about it being non smoking. Bad. But I still feel shallow and losery on my end. 

I had to drop out of university because I have to commit all my time to finding a job. I wasn't enjoying my program or the particular school; dropping it gave me so much relief. It was not for me whatsoever. The people were awful, the profs were passive aggressive and i saw a few insult students, admin not helpful, and it was small cliquey and disorganized. Balancing school and work is hard.

I have a bf of a month and a bit. I sleep over at his place a lot, and he has no idea about me being in this crisis. I don't want to dump this all on him, but If I don't figure something out I will likely be evicted and have nowhere to go. What should I do?

It's possible he would accomodate me for a bit but it seems soo soon in a relationship to do this,

**Context:** I'm kind of a victim of abuse, my family (Dad and I) immigrated from eastern europe but prior to arriving here he molested me several times, most of the time he was studying/working abroad and this would occur while he visited us, I used to live with my grandparents then.

Things changed for the better when i moved with him, but the memories never dissapeared, I really love my dad, I respect him for all he has done for me and for who he is, but i feel like I can't just brush off the past, there are moments when we are sitting together and I just cringe, does he remembers all of that? We never discuss it, and I honestly don't want to, I feel ashamed, disgusted, annoyed...

**The problem:** Because of this I can't really focus anymore, is this what they call depression? it's funny because I really didn't care much when this actually happened, I guess I was confused at most but that was it, this unpleasant feeling is only growing as of late and I'm afraid it will get worse.

608,"I don’t know if this is appropriate to post here or if I should go to another subreddit, but anyways here’s my problem. (Also weird formatting because I’m on mobile) To understand this story correctly, I need to give you guys a LOT of backstory. 
Fair warning: This backstory contains some elements that might be NSFW of some sort, and is not for the faint of heart. Now let’s get to the actual story.

 I am a 15 year old boy from Sweden who used to live quite a normal life. You know, living a normal house with two married parents and a nice car etc. But suddenly when I was about 4-5 years old, my parents got a divorce and quickly moved away from our old house, which broke my heart because i had to change school and move cities. I wanted to stay with my mom when my parents split up, but Swedish law is like really weird, so they thought my mom manipulated me to say I wanted to stay with her. After almost one year of trials and meetings, my parents agreed to have split custody of me and my siblings.

It was after this my life took a sudden turn downwards.

After three months of split custody, my dad found his current wife, but she lived 140km away. After this my dad and his new wife moved away from the city I lived in, which meant I couldn’t see him as often because of school.

Skip forward a few years and my mom meets her current husband, who lived fairly close to us, in one of the neighboring cities. My mom wanted to move there but I said I would kill myself if we ever moved away again. We didn’t move away from the city, but we rented a new apartment and moved to one side of the city to another.

After living approximately one year in the new apartment, we moved to a house outside of the city, making me change school anyway. In this new house that we still live in, we had 14 rooms(we’re quite a large family). This is were things started getting really bad at home. I was 13 when we moved here, and i got the tiniest room, clocking in at 5 square meters plus a tiny wardrobe. I can barely fit my bed and my desk in my room and I do not have any space to move around. After we moved, I was a bit emotionally stirred up and depressed. This made me hate my parents so much. 

After a few weeks, my birthday came and i got my usual presents, 5 dollars and a computer.
After a couple weeks of having my new computer, my stepdad took it for no apparent reason and sold it off to someone. He sold my computer, WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME. This pissed me off so bad, I started punching shit and crying, because playing games with my friends was the only thing I was really good at ever. After I cried for a while he came up the stairs screaming at me to shut up, which scared me so I started crying even more. Then he ran into my room, took me and held me up against the wall and started screaming in my face to shut up. After about thirty seconds, I’m starting to feel I can’t breathe, but I can’t do anything to push him away from me, because I am really weakly built and had almost no muscles at the time. I felt like i was going to pass out, but then he let me go. He ran downstairs and I started crying even more. After I got up and tried to call the police, I realized he had taken my phone as well. 

This cycle of abuse has been kept going ever since and I’m almost 15 now. I tried calling CPS on my phone, but they never show up or try to help me. About a month ago the worst thing ever happened. I was on my room casually scrolling through my social media in my bed, when I hear my parents come home. I didn’t really think of it since they were out shopping earlier. But then I hear someone going up the stairs, and I’m immediately scared. My stepdad walked into my room and just started beating me. Out of nowhere. I tried to defend myself but I couldn’t do it. Eventually i just gave up. After a while he left my room and I felt like I was going to die. My mom called and ambulance for me. I survived, but my stepdad broke one of my ribs.
The worst part about this is that when I woke up in the hospital, i was greeted by a cop asking me about “the robbery”. I said”what robbery?”
He said that I was robbed and my stepdad found me on the street on his way home. My memory was a bit blurry from what had happened so I told him I didn’t remember that much. My parents came up with a fake story so they wouldn’t be in trouble for beating me. 

I want to take legal action, but it would just end up with more beatings, and the CPS is really slow with picking up kids who are in a bad family. I could wait until I’m 15 and move out from my parents, but then they wouldn’t get what they deserve. People of Reddit, what do I do?

611,"Hi guys, so I’ll try to make my story really short but also try to cover the main points.

So I finished school (Year 12/ high school diploma) when I was 17 years old in year 12. I always struggled during school because I had ADHD which I didn’t know of as well as anxiety &amp; panic disorders. I was very troubled during my school years, combine that with the adhd and you have a young kid with a very messy unstable life.  

I kinda took a very bad path from the early age of 17, I started to self medicate with opioids and benzodiazepines and that Later turned into a full blown addiction which lasted around 4 years. I was a functional drug addict those 4 years until I eventually just broke down and couldn’t take it anymore, I quit my job, shit myself out from the world and things got worse and worse. I was also hospitalised a couple times for failed suicide attempts. 

Fast forward to now, I’m 23 years old. I’ve been sober for over 2 years. I quit smoking cigarettes. I gained around 12kg /26 pounds of muscle. I work out 
4-5 days a week. I’m working and making pretty good money (worked my ass off this week and made around $950 AUD) to save up so I can put myself through University and have some financial comfort while I’ll be studying. I also take great care of my health. My diet is very good and I’m just in a much better place mentally. I’m also in the process of seeing a psychiatrist for my adhd so I can focus when I go back to studying. I’m not bragging or anything but I’d say I’ve always been a very smart person, it’s just always kind of been hard to focus. (Best way I’d describe adhd is imagine you have 100 different tv’s playing all at the same time and each tv has a different channel and your mind is processing information from all of those channels at the same time where as a normal person only has 1 tv playing 1 channel. It can be very over stimulating) I’ve just really been trying to get my life back on track, I know I made some really bad choices but that was when I was very young and equiped to deal with my problems in a healthy way. 

Anyways, I’ll get to the point with what I need advice on. I’m looking to enrol mid year this year. But I’m nervous that I won’t be allowed in. Why would they let me in when there are thousands of other people who are better candidates?

I’m nervous and worried. All I could think about is being asked questions like “ why should we accept you?” and so on.  I just don’t want to be seen as some fuck up. So basically, reddit, can you give me some advice on how to go about something like this. Should I be open about my troubled past? Or would that come off as me making up excuses? What’s the process like of getting accepted as a mature aged student (23 years old)

Thanks guys, any feedback would be appreciated. I really want this. And without bragging or anything, I like to think that I’m genuinely proud of myself for just being able to turn my life around while I’m still young. 
I just want to be given a shot, you know? It feels amazing to have goals and dreams again and to be working towards those goals. Although I feel nervous, I also feel very alive and that’s something I didn’t feel around 18 months ago. 
Thanks guys for any advice. :) ",06Mar2019,1

613,"I went to my boyfriend's place to eat dinner and sleep over. We went grocery shopping for dinner and also bought some snacks. When we got home, we went to the shared kitchen to get dinner ready. While we made dinner, we were eating these kind of chips made from rye bread as snacks because we both were very hungry. This is not an unimportant detail. 

I was chatting with some of his dorm-mates, meeting them for the first time, everything was good, though I was really hungry. We got dinner ready, went to his room and put on a movie to watch while we ate. I need to make a note about how we were both very hungry - and hangry. I was annoyed for him getting up and going from the bed (where we sat and ate) and to his desk, putting away stuff, because I couldn't concentrate on the movie we just started. When he finally sat down, he couldn't get comfortable and ended up getting a chair (which I had recommended earlier, but he rejected the idea at that time). When we were both finally sitting, I started to take some food on my plate. I realised he had put the rye-bread-snacks on his table, and went up to get some for my plate (remember, they were open - we had been snacking them while we made dinner). I took some, put them on my plate and sat down. He scuffed at me, and I said ""What?"". He said ""I was kind of thinking those were for AFTER dinner""

I sighed loudly, and took them off my plate to return them to the bag on the table - but this is were things got out of hand. He said ""no, no, DON'T!"", clearly annoyed with me, but before I could even react, and WHILE saying this, he grabbed my arm, really fast and really hard (he works out a lot and there is NO doubt that I could never overpower him).

Then he shook my arm, thereby shaking my hand, so hard and fast that I let go of the snacks and they fell to the plate. I was shocked, and just sat down quietly. After some time, he said he was sorry. I said that it was not okay for him to use his power like that, and he said he knew.

I don't know if I would have gotten more angry if the circumstances were different, but I felt *really* scared in that moment. Also, I felt like we couldn't have a big fight that day, because his birthday was in 5 days, and I was throwing him a surprise-party. But maybe this is the reason why I haven't processed this properly.

Ever since, I have had a really bad feeling in my stomach when we're together. Especially if he wants sex. I feel kind of afraid of him, in an unexplainable way.

I have never felt like this before. Surely, like all relationships, we've had fights; loud ones, big ones, a lot of small ones, but we've grown from every one of them. I have been through some rough emotions, and he has always been my rock. I can tell him everything, he is the best listener. Up until that day, I have seen him as the man of my future, and I couldn't (and still can't, really) think of anyone better suited for me. I have been thinking about marriage, children and we were actually going to move in together (on a try-basis for 5 months) in August. But now, I don't know, because of this feeling of - insecurity? not feeling safe? Feeling betrayed? I don't know.

I've also had dreams lately in which he abuses me, and all of my friends are telling me to break up, leave, run away, but I'm just staying like an idiot.

I have brought the issue of my feelings up with him two times now. He just says he's really sorry. I don't want to tell anyone I know about this, because they might see him in a different light - but i obviously can't shake this feeling or work it out by myself. I don't know what to do - I really don't want to lose him, I love him. So damn much. What can I do to move on from this?

Sorry for the long post. Thank you so much for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My boyfriend used his force to grab my arm and shake my hand from snacks because he was annoyed at me. He apologized shortly after. I have confronted him several times afterwards, he says he is sorry, but I can't shake the feeling of betrayal and not feeling safe. What can I do to move on?",06Mar2019,1
614,"I [23 F] have a fear of dating white men, if my hair is not flat-ironed and straight. I grew up in a city that was incredibly diverse. In a group of ten friends, seven of them would be of a different ethnicity. As children, we recognized diversity amongst each other and embraced each other’s cultures—language, clothing, food, religion, lifestyle—celebrating each other’s birthdays would always be a unique cultural experience. 

When I was 13, I moved, with my family to a different state, to a city predominantly white. The nickname of the high school I attended was “Rich Kid Vanilla Valley.” On the first day of school, I found myself in the counselor’s office, crying, because I was one of three black kids in my school (a large school) and I was intimidated by that. Being a minority was something I never ‘experienced’ until I moved to this new place. 

I wanted to fit-in, so I bought Hollister clothes, straightened my hair, and tried to fit-in with the rest of the girls. I never dated in high school, guys were not interested in me...at one point, my friends were trying to get me to date the only other black guy in our class...

However, I had a great childhood and this realization didn’t depress me, it was just something I was aware of...I was also very busy with my modeling career, that allowed me to get out of that town and travel to big cities. 

I worked as a professional model for many years. My last year and a half of high school, I had to finish and graduate from online school because I was always traveling. I’m 5’10, 125 lbs, I’m a light-skinned mixed girl (Caucasian dad and African-American mom), I have green/hazel eyes...I modeled for Sears, Kohl’s, JCPennys...and much more...

I decided that I wanted to go to college and model part-time. I made good money, traveling was fun, the work was hard, but it had many fun moments, but I never liked the industry...I knew I would be happier going to school. I’m an INTJ personality type. 

After a couple years of going to school in different cities, I’ve ended up being back in the same town, that’s primarily white, with my family. What was previously an uncomfortable realization that I’m one of few people ‘like me,’ has now become an obsessive fear as I’m an adult, trying to date. 

The fear came from multiple instances of racism I’ve experienced and my mom has experienced since we’ve lived here, and it especially comes from the phrase, “you’re pretty for a black girl,” that I’ve heard a couple times from white guys. It’s not a compliment, it’s an insult. What they’re saying is, usually black girls are unattractive to them, but I look better than most, but still not attractive enough to want to date. 

I refuse to let white guys see my natural, curly, Afro hair; they can only see it when I straighten it. My hair has become very damaged from straightening it all the time, so I decided to stop straightening it, and I started to wear curly hair extensions.  I didn’t mind the look, but it made me feel insecure that guys would not find it attractive for a girl to wear hair that wasn’t their own. 

The process of putting on extensions made me late for everything, so I decided to wear long box braids that nearly go down to my butt. It’s a very ‘ethnic’ look, and while I don’t mind the look, I refuse to go on dates with this hairstyle. 

My friends think I’m crazy. I understand there’s some stupidity around my rationale. But are there people that can relate to this? It’s a legitimate fear and insecurity and in many ways, it prevents me from loving myself and going out and feeling good about the way I look.

619,"\*For context\* 

\-Im 20M and Tanya is 21F. 

\-Dating at my job is not advised but is allowed. 

\-A manager is not allowed to have any relationship with employees at all. So grabbing a coffee after work is prohibited and can possibly result in termination.

So me and 6 other friends drove to Miami to celebrate my birthday. We all got super messed up that night and me and this friend named Tanya ended up kissing multiple times throughout the night. After that night we thought it was crazy that we both did that but ultimately ended up catching feelings for one another as days pasted. We never went out on a date, that is just the two of us, and we didn't really have a thing going other than the fact that we were just talking to one another a lot as if we were seeing one another. We kissed again on different occasions one of which we were damn near making out. She said from pretty much the start that she wasn't ready for a relationship cause of her personal life (which i wont discuss on her for her privacy) which I totally understood and respected. But we continued to talk, again as if we were in a relationship, so I was getting confused at what we were as to which she responded ""idk"" then went on to say its complicated, which in her defense it is. You see she's a manager at my job and not only that but she is also the manager of the department I work in so yeaaa it makes sense honestly. She has also had bad experiences with relationships in the past cause she feels like she rushed into them. So I end up telling a close friend (the only thing this friend knows is that I liked Tanya, nothing about the kissing and etc.) at work that I think that me and Tanya will just remain friends for now. After that he types in a group chat that we are all in that she ""broke me"". She the type of person to over analyze things so I believe she took this to heart  and even after telling her that he was joking about the whole thing she starts getting distant and doesn't really answer my messages unless its though a group chat that we are both in. The thing is is that our friendship just seems fake and forced and I'm wondering what I should do.

628,"What’s the worst advice you’ve received from a mental health professional ? 
In the midst of nursing a loved one during a terminal illness, I was having severe marriage and financial problems. Plus suffering from severe anxiety and depression. 

My counselor suggested something which seems like bit of a scorched earth approach. 

-Divorce my husband 
-Liquidate my only assets 
-Move someplace cheap I could afford as a single mom (which as a single mom of two boys would not be anyplace near our current home or anyplace safe, given the hot housing market in my state. And, away from my dying loved one. )
-Go back to work after 7 years at home. 

Gee...why not just throw virtually every single major life stressor into the pot at once? Divorce, moving, new job, etc etc ?

629,"I have two friends, we will call them Susan and Karen. I’ve known Susan since freshman year and I’ve only gotten to know Karen this year. 

Two days ago we were sitting at lunch and Karen says something very racist. Susan laughs and I tell Karen that I’m very offended by what she said. She goes on and invalidates the reason why I’m offended. I remove myself from the situation and I report it to our principal, to which she gives Karen ISS (in school suspension). 

The day after that, Susan tells me that Karen is very upset and that she will no longer be sitting at our table. Which is no big deal. The next day she is back in class and those two are laughing and talking like nothing ever happened. This made me feel weird because if someone disrespected Susan, I would not talk to that person anymore. I’m not trying to control who Susan talks to but it just left a bad feeling in me.

I want to know if I’m overreacting before I go and talk with Susan.

630,"And yes I had a sheltered childhood where I had no chores and had everything handed to me, and am pursuing an unrealistic career as a sportscaster, and have flopped out of each internship and job I’ve been in. 

I hate the actual job of sports announcing (like being part of the team, wheras I like being “above the fray”) but I spend all day practicing because at this point it’s basically a compulsion (I practiced announcing every day for 8-10 years prior to college) to announce either a current or a past sporting event for practice, at this point it basically keeps my head strait by letting me escape.

I also am losing my hair and have no self confidence and am not particularly tall or good looking enough for tv since my hairline started receding in college.

I also quit my recent temp customer service email job without telling anyone and I have still not returned my computer because I don’t know how to tell them that I just needed to disappear and get my life back on track before pursuing my sportscasting career instead of postponing that til after the job. The downside is that now I have limited funds even though I’m living with my parents, I still have bills

631,"Long story short due to some circumstances i do not have ANY grades not a single one, but now that I've found something I want to do with myself I need the grades. I went to a school I was previously enrolled in and said ""I already have the required knowledge of these subject to get grades sufficent to do what I want, please give me just the tests so I dont have to waste multiple years of time that I don't have""

They then tried to put me in a class for mentally disabled people and people with disorders, none of which I have. They even had me take a cognitive test where I performed superbly(sorry if that sounds like bragging, but It's relevant). They have no basis for trying to put me in such a class.

And then I called their superiors to get them to shapen up and actually help, they(the school not their superiors) proceeded to tell me that I""ll have to pay for taking the tests(I won't have to pay if I just go there normally and spend 3 years doing stuff I've already learnt) and it takes a few months to prepare one test. I really don't have the time for this.

633,"I am a sophomore in college pursuing a degree in economics. My goal is to attend law school after college.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have encountered this semester is I am struggling in my business classes quite a bit and have an extremely difficult time paying attention in them. My overall GPA is high, but I am expecting it to drop this semester and I am frantically studying for my upcoming exams and I am constantly stressing out about school each day. It worries me that if I receive a lower GPA, I won't be able to attend good law schools. My economics classes have not been the cause of stress in school, it's mostly been accounting and business statistics classes which have hurt me recently. I have been putting in more effort into my classes, and I expected a high score on one of my political science exams and I received a lower grade than expected. This has caused me to extremely question what I want to do in life and what major I should pursue. 

&amp;#x200B;

It hasn't helped much that when I have asked for help during office hours from the teachers, they put little effort into helping me out. They have only given broad advice and told me to review the notes, read the textbook, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I am seeking is how should I improve my grades and perform well on exams? I typically put in 4-5 hours of studying per exam but I have noticed the multiple choice has been my struggle this semester. Is there any techniques you used in college to receive excellent grades?

&amp;#x200B;

I am also seeking advice about finding a career path. I applied for a law clerk internship this summer and made it very far in the application process only to receive a call that I didn't make the last cut. I understand that this is only a small obstacle and I can move past it and pursue different opportunities, but I am losing lots of confidence in myself because of my GPA dropping lower due to tests this semester and it's put me into a state of confusion. I will appreciate any advice. ",06Mar2019,2
634,"23(M) I really am trying to figure out where I stand on this. 23(F) My wife and I will probably plan to have kids in the nest 2 or 3 years. My original plan in life was to have ""my own"" kids and once they move out open up a foster home. But after I thought about it, it sounded like I was thinking passing on my genes is more important than helping a kid find a home.

After some thought I think it was more so I wanted to go the ""traditional"" parent route and get my experience of parenting that way and enjoy the miracle of child birth for myself. But when I think that I feel like an asshole. I actually want to think the other way but it's like a voice in the back of my head.

If I were to adopt, at least for my first kid I'd want them to be young (toddler years) so I wouldn't be missing out on the young years at least and then thereafter adopt kids that are a bit older. But again I feel selfish for thinking like this.

These thoughts are brand new to me, or rather they were probably always there and I just now gave attention to them. It'd help to talk about it to better understand where I am with it, before bringing it up with my wife.

tldr; I am struggling with knowing if I want to adopt first or conceive first. A voice says conceive but I feel like the right answer is adopt.",06Mar2019,1
635,"This guy and I have been best friends for years. he always has liked me and eventually he fell in love with me. However, I did not reciprocate these feelings. He spent a year chasing after me and being such an amazing friend to me. And even though he knew that he had no chance with dating me he never gave up because to him I was his dream girl that he was going to marry someday. I always saw him as my best friend and I never thought that I would ever date him or even like him in that way. But, one day he was over at my house and he was being all cute (he was always flirty with me and we acted like a couple so everyone thought we were dating but that's just how close we were) and we kissed, but it was only a pop kiss. After that happened I started to feel something for him but I didn't want to so I pushed him out of my life ,but not fully, I just distanced myself from him. but then I really missed him, I really missed my best friend. so I told him that I was sorry for distancing and that I want to be close again so we became close again and it was like nothing ever happened. But his feelings only grew stronger for me. That was in early September, then on November 9 I went over to his house to meet his family for the first time. While I was over at his house we were in his room and we were watching a movie. we were cuddled up in his bed under a blanket and those feelings came rushing at me again. And just to try it, we kissed but this time we made out. That was when I realized I had always been in love with him. After that day we continued to be the same but I told him that I liked him. And of course he got very happy because he was chasing me for about a year. but I tried to force my feelings away because I didnt want to accept that I had liked him. Then on December 8 he came over to my house and I remember that day, we had missed each other so much. I think we didn't see each other for a while and i  was really excited to see him and as soon as I opened my front door, we kissed.  I don't know if when people say ""I felt sparks "", it's true but in that moment I truly felt sparks between us. That was when I realized that I wanted to spend the rest my life with him. It felt so great to be with him, so that's when I told him I wanted to be with him and so we started dating. I had gone on vacation for about two weeks but he was also grounded so I hadn't seen him for a week and so when I got back from vacation I hadn't seen him for three weeks. But first I would like to explain what happened to us while I was on vacation. so, about a week into my vacation we had some problems. And I don't know if it was because I missed him so much, but I just made fights out of everything. I remember one fight, he brought up that a girl called him cute and I took it out of proportion completely. But we always made up after the fights and we would be all good. but one night I told him that I wasn't happy because we were always fighting. So we talked it out and decided that we should just break up. We stayed broken up for about a day and I just missed him so much that I told him I don't want to be without him so we got back together. that was a week before I came back from vacation. So fast forward to when I'm back from my vacation. We were dating but we told everyone that we broke up because when we first started dating we had a lot of problems with people judging our relationship. also, I forgot to add this in, but in the first week that we were dating I took his phone and was just using it when I saw some texts between him and one of my close friends and they were flirting with each other. Obviously that made me really mad and hurt by I forgave him for it and we moved on with our relationship. I also kept in mind that this was his first relationship. Anyways, moving forward, we were telling anyone that we werent dating but we were and everything was perfect between us.  we were hanging out one day, he came over to my house and we were doing homework. and that was a Wednesday and we had no school on Friday so he planned to come over again on that friday. We were perfectly fine on that Wednesday and when Friday came he texted me one hour before he was supposed to come over and said that he had already started helping his dad move out of the house and that he was tired so he didn't want to come anymore. I completely understood and I told him it was fine. That Friday, we didn't talk much at all. It was a few texts every hour. And this was strange because we usually are on FaceTime or texting each other 24/7.  So at night I asked him how his day was and he told me that he hung out with a couple of friends that don't like me by the way, and suddenly out of the blue he texted me saying all that he didn't want to hurt me anymore and that he wanted to break up. I didn't understand what he was doing this. We fought about it a little then i eventually left him on read, hoping that the next day he would change his mind. so the next day i text him and he's being such a dick to me and it hurt so bad. the next day was the same thing. he told me he never wanted to be with me again. and that hurt so bad because he chased me for over a year and now he just wanted to give up on our relationship. i didn't understand. i talked to my mom about it and she said maybe it had something to do with his parents getting divorced, but i don't think it does. anyways, after that last fight, he completely cut me off. i asked him why he did and he said he was mad at me. i didn't know why. he distanced himself from me for a month. and that was absolute hell. i missed him so much. then one day he texted me and said that he was ready to be friends with me. and so i let him back into my life. and we were good for about 4 days. we acted like best friends again. then one day he just started being super dry and i asked him if he wanted to even talk to me and he said he didn't care if he did so i just let him be. (a few weeks before this he told me he lost feelings for me, i don't understand how he could in just a couple of weeks if he had been in love with me for so long) that was 4 days ago. he hasn't talked to me since then. but i texted him two days ago and asked him if we could meet up just to talk and he said he didn't want to. i told him i just want to be on good terms with him but he told me that he wasn't sure that we could be. i asked him why and he told me it was bc i still had feelings for him and that our friendship was different bc i still had feelings. i told him that it was him who was different. not our friendship (he was a really sweet guy that would never hurt anybody) i haven't talked to him at all since then. now i don't know what to do. i miss him so much and i want to be friends with him. but he's giving up on our friendship. and it's different bc we're starting over from the beginning and he has to give it time for it to be the same again. i just don't know if i should give him more space or talk to him about how i feel. (i'll ask him not to give up on our friendship and to give it a shot) it hurts a lot and i don't know what to do. i know that i'm only high school but i feel like he and i were literally made for each other. can someone please help me?",06Mar2019,0
636,"Context: I'm a 19 year old college junior. I do not have family. I have close friends but they are limited in their scope and ability to aid. I currently have a savings of around $2900, which should be closer to $4000 by the time of necessity.

Problem: Come the end of the current academic semester, I'm going to be left homeless as I rely on campus housing. I've spoken to friends and any other forms of outreach I had, and unfortunately they are unable to help. The area rent per month in my area is around $700 a month for a 1 bdrm apartment. However, due to the nature of my area, landlords/renters are typically very uptight about having multiple references, high credit, and the rent not breaking 50% of monthly income. Also, a 1 year lease is always required (based off the 25 or so locations I looked at, which is a lot since my area is very rural). My monthly income is around $800. I do not have a car or licence, but these could be obtainable if it's viable. I'm locked to my area because I will need to continue working most likely throughout the summer. As a result, at least to what I can see given my inexperience and lack of knowledge, I am going to be stuck as homeless for the summer with no viable options. 

Questions: What are my options for making it through, at the very least, the summer with what I have available? What are some options I'm not considering and have looked over? Would attempting to go to another area (for the summer) that is much cheaper benefit me provided I could get a job quick enough?

But now, he has begun hanging around with them and it’s clear they don’t like him, and are getting frustrated with me for they believe I invited him. 

Not only that, but he is constantly distracting me from them, whenever I try to talk with them he cuts in and tries to change the conversation to be just between me and him. Not only that, but I find it that in general he has become a lot more annoying, as his form of ‘comedy’ is solely reliant on being loud.

643,"For the past 15 years I have worked in kitchens. I have worked my way from a basic commie chef to now being the head chef of a busy restaurant at a holiday resort that caters for up to 800 people per day.

During my appraisal today I spoke with the head of catering about my development and how I can make the leap from the head chef to becoming an operations manager. He said that my lack of FOH (Front of House) experience is what's holding me back. 

I've never had an interest in FOH but if this is something that would help me to develop my skills then I have no issue with this. The only thing that's holding me back is that I would have to make 2 large sacrifices to do this. Firstly I would have to take a rather large pay cut to move from Head Chef to a restaurant manager. Secondly my hours would change to the point that I would see less of my family. Since I have 2 young children this could put a strain on my wife and myself both financially and onto our relationship if I start asking her to look after the kids more whilst I finish work later.

So, my question is, what would you do? Take a pay cut, and risk the strain on my relationship, to allow me to gain more experience and open more doors in the long term future, or stay where I am. To be clear, I enjoy my job and I'm very good at what I do so staying where I am is not an issue for the short term.

647,"I have a month to month lease in a house that has been on the market for 4 years. He finally got an offer today. I do not know if he is going to accept the offer or not. If he does, I will have to move out. 

A year ago I quit my job, broke up with my boyfriend, and moved 1000 miles to come here. My landlord told me he was taking the house off the market and I was going to manage this property through Airbnb. I thought I'd live here for years. However, he kept stalling the Airbnb stuff, and never took the house off the market. Because he was stalling the Airbnb stuff, I finally went out and got a different job, which I started last week. 

The new job pays well but has very few hours right now. In about 6 months it will be a sustainable job with sustainable pay and hours, but for the next few months I'm still living off savings. I have about $6000 left. 

I love this rural area and want to live in this town the rest of my life. The problem is there are only 3 units for rent right now. One of them is a 4 bedroom house at $3000/month. One of them is a single open room with a toilet and sink, but no kitchen, for $1000/month. The other is a reasonably priced 3 bedroom. 

I may be able to rent the 3 bedroom with a roommate. Unfortunately roommates terrify me, as I've had 6 horrible nightmare roommates and told myself I'd never do it again (I've also had 4 amazing wonderful roommates, and a few fine nothing special roommates). 

I have a lot of intense camping gear. I could maybe rent space on somebody's property to set up a long term campsite until a better rental house becomes available. It's very very good here, but if I can plug into electricity, then I could get a heater. 

I could take out a loan and buy a camper trailer and rent trailer space. 

I could move away from the area and sign a year long lease in a different town, and commute two hours a day to my job, and hate my life in the other town which I don't like. 

I can also see if anybody has a room they'd rent to me in exchange for my helping around the property.

651,"I saw an antivax post shared from a friend. I shared it off of her share and made a comment on my post about how antivaxxers are mentally incapable of making the right choices for their kids. It was relevant to the post itself. I visited the page and laugh reacted at a few of the posts that I thought were ridiculous and funny. I left the page and forgot about it. 

Then I started receiving hate comments. About how I’m an idiot, a stupid bitch, and people start spamming my profile with laugh reacts. I noticed the post said “content not available” so I went into my other Facebook page to see what was going on. On the page, which I originally thought was an antivax propaganda page, and not an actual person, she had posted a screenshot of my laugh reactions with the caption “watch out, this stupid bitch is trolling hard”. It was only laugh reacts? It wasn’t meant to troll, it’s just my opinion on whatever it was. 

There was 40-50 comments on the post, all talking about how I’m a cunt, a bitch, a hoe, saying I need to die in my sleep, the OP said she “wants to get her hands around my throat” and someone else said they want to put a 9mm gun to my skull. I never said one word to these people. And I couldn’t comment on the post to defend myself because she had blocked my other profile and Facebook wouldn’t let me comment. I have screenshots of all of the death threats and most of the bullying comments. I deleted the ones that were left on my posts instantly after they were commented and changed my setting to friends only for my entire page. They were going through my profile and finding posts they didn’t agree with and talking shit about me in the comments. I have over 7 messages that Facebook will not display probably because they’re so vulgar and threatening. 

Now, here’s where it gets messy. I messaged her husband who I found through a tagged post and asked him to ask her to take the post down as I was getting death threats and being bullied. He defends her actions. Typical. I ask again that he remove the post. He said “no one threatened you” and that he won’t ask her to remove it. So I looked up their names on google to see if I could find something, anything, that could help me get them to take the post down. Whether it was church groups that I could report them to (they claimed to be devout Christians) and whatnot. and it pulled up a home address. I screenshot the Zillow listing that had the address, NO photo of the house itself. And sent it to him and asked again that he ask her to remove the post. Never had any intentions of doing anything with the address, I just wanted to let them know I have their info and I can report them to the police and give them their address. 

The lady then made a post saying that I’m sending out photos of their house and that they’re filing a police report against me for cyber bullying, Harassment, and stalking. Am I missing something? She started bullying and harassing me over laugh reacts, people were saying they want to shoot me and put their hands around my throat. All while I said not one word to them. They were rallying to get people to report my page. Asking if they could share the photo so they could get even more people to report my page. Over laugh reacts... 

They said “I hope she gets in big trouble” “she’s gonna be in so much trouble” like please tell me if I missing something important here? If anything I would think this would bite them in the ass more as I have screenshots of them saying they want to shoot me and choke me. What would they even tell the police? “Yeah so I was bullying and harassing this girl and she sent my husband a photo of our address”? I have a screenshot of the OP, on that post, saying “I think she’s trying to scare him into getting me to delete the post. No significance. It seems like a threat”. Is this her admitting that she doesn’t feel threatened by it at all? I mean they are saying they’re using the message I sent of their address to file the report as a “threat”. All I said in the message was “are you going to ask her to remove the post” after the screenshot. No threat. Are these people psycho crazy or is it me? Can I counter file a report against THEM? For defamation of character, harassment, and bullying?

652,"Hi i need advice really bad because i swear i CANNOT talk it anymore.

I'm a senior in high school i'm gonna tell my story in phases
So here we go

Phase1 left out: 
I was in a group, i was in this group for 2 years, i was so involved in this group, they caused me to be anxious, they were fake friends only acted like friends in school but even in school they would turn on me as if i was an intruder, you don't need to know more for the story except that i left them by ghosting them, one day i just had enough left them without a word why.


Phase2 alone?: 
at this point i'm alone no friends no one, i had someone who is less than friend more than a college (at least he was), because i was shattered from being alone and my inability to talk to anyone i decided i would stay with him and his friend(lets call them c&amp;d), a few days pass with me being mostly silent and trying to recover and i notice that both of them trying to avoid me, now i didn't expect that but maybe that was because i'm silent most of the time, however with time i started to get some of my energy back it felt greaaat, my life was getting back together finally i'm moving on.

Phase3 the absolute fuck over:
My god what i was thinking life finally being good why? There must be something cooking, aha look at this c&amp;d want to know why i left my ex-group, ok i was recovering but i was feeling like crying when i want to talk about what happened, i was vague in my answers, now see i'm good at reading people being alone taught a lot more than you think, i knew they were trying to get rid of me because c&amp;d got to a group of other friends so they can ask me, idk what to do at this point i was shocked they never said anything directly but i overheard them saying they succeeded i wad angry and felt defeated, however that's not everything remember what was cooking now i see it and this is the most terrifying scenario i could think of ( in phase 4)

Phase4 alone again the nightmare: 
So there was i guy, i liked him so much, i really wanted to be his friend and as i mentioned i'm good at reading people so i was sure that he likes me back, i always wanted to be his friend but i get super anxious around as if he is a crush, i guess most of you guessed what happens next, c&amp;d liked him to and now they are trying to be his friends, he..he was down, i mean it's perfect i saw that coming and here its the thing that i had nightmares about like actual nightmares HAPPENED, i feel more than defeated i feel drained fucked betrayed, sometimes i cry in my head tears rise up to my eyes in the classroom when i hear them talk, a thing i should've mentioned is one of c&amp;d used to be the same type of guy to my group in the past, the worst part is i treated him well.

The only guy i wanted to be friends with ever is taken by someone who betrayed my trust.

Like why life i'm only 16
I've never had a best friend who didn't abandon/betray me

Please help

I will still like the guy, i feel this will haunt me till the day i die.

When i was 19 i started studying civil engineering and all the expenses were paid from my parents till now. For the past 4 years i have lied to them and have spent the money on bs stuff and havent really done anything worth in my life. Now im stuck and im reflecting about the mistake i have done wasting like 3 years of my life ( i passed 1 year at my university). Now i dont know what to do and am really scared. Should i go on and start studying again civil engineering? Like i never tried to pass exams.i think with effort everything is possible. If i study enough im gonna get my bachelor degree when im 25, is it to late? After my BA I need also to start my Msc so another 2 year, meaning ill be 27 when all the studies are done. Is it worth it? Should i tell my parents or just go on studying for now and lets see how things go? The university expenses are not a lot and i can manage them by getting some money from my brothers. Also now im feeling like shit, like worthless and nothing to live for. Im scared of my future, like is it late at 27 start working a good job and have some debts to pay? Will i enjoy life this 3 years ill study hard? Have i ruined my life and this cant be undone?  I badly eed your advices on how to turn things around. Thanks",06Mar2019,1
658,"About 7-8 years ago I met this girl and we grew close and had a great time but it never really became a relationship. We've never been really talkative during that time, being the awkward silent teenagers that we then were. Unfortunately lives changed and we didn't really get any chance to see each other again. We were however connected through social media so I we stayed connected in that way a bit but never had much 'real' contact. However for some reason she never left my head in the following years. Even when I was in a relationship I found myself often thinking of her.

 Now fast forward to last week. I've been out of a relationship for about a year now and I was having a real bad day of thinking about the pasts and any regrets I had. I ended up sending her a text asking how she felt at the time. I was expecting a bit of a weirded out reaction but she was really sweet and we ended up catching up a bit. What study she was doing, work etc.

What ended up happening was that all the feelings I had back then rushed back to me. So that left me feeling the happiest I've felt in a while with both the sadness that we'd probably never get together again (she's been in a relationship for about a year now as well).

I would like to hear some advice of what to do here.

I can't seem to get her out of my head, no matter how long I wait. I would like to hook up with here again but with what I've seen online I really don't want to mess up her current relationship in any way. I would like to tell here that I'm still interested in her but don't want to make things weird.

663,"I took a medical leave around October because I had a bad relapse with my depression and I was generally unhappy at the university I was at. Turns out the university never processed my medical leave, put me on probation instead, and posted my grades for the fall semester even though I haven’t been going to classes (because I thought my medical leave was approved).

Long story short, I failed that semester, have a really low gpa and don’t see the point of returning to an expensive uni I am unhappy at so I withdrew completely from the school.

The problem is that I haven’t told my parents any of this yet. Not the medical leave, not the withdrawal, nothing. For the past few years I tried talking to them about my depression. My dad has always been supportive but my mom is a completely different story. I think she feels like she failed as a parent or that I have everything I ever need in life that I shouldn’t be feeling this way. I understand that mental health isn’t widely accepted in my culture but I didn’t expect my mom to completely shut me out every time I try to bring up the subject so I tend to avoid telling my mom things now.

I feel the responsibility to tell my parents, especially my mom, because they took out loans in my moms name to pay for the two years I’ve been in college. They have spent a significant amount of money on my education in Taiwan for the sole purpose of sending me to an American Uni.

I have a full time job right now and have a comfortable/sustainable living situation. I was recently promoted and plan on helping pay for some of the loans my mom took out. 

I don’t know. I doesn’t sound like a big deal when I type this all out but I’m just not sure how to bring this all up and have an adult conversation about it without my mom completely losing it, making me doubt myself.

TLDR/ Need advice on how to tell my parents I dropped out of college without them freaking out.

I'm walking to my bus with my friend and this tranny dickhead wants to grab my hood, essentially cutting off my air and wants to ask me some shit about kissing this girl without permission recently. When I haven't spoken to her in a week or so, let alone kiss her! I told the girl, and I quote:

“Get your fucking friends. I'm sick and tired of this shit. Do you know what Dylan just did? She fucking grabbed my good and proceeded to question me while cutting off my air about kissing you recently. Which I haven't done in about a week or so. I'm sick and fucking tired of your friends not minding their business and coming for me about random shit! Tell your white knights to cool their fucking jets, or I'll cool them myself.”

She gets angry at ME and says she didn’t know anything. I say okay, just reign in your friends, I don’t need or want an explanation. She says, and I quote:

“Did I fucking ask what you need or what you wanted? You act like I was aware of this shit.”

Now mind you, I didn’t say she sent her after me; I just said to reign her in because this is happening due to something she supposedly told her. She has a problem with telling people shit that’s none of their business as soon as they ask.

So, r/advice. What’s the move? I don’t want to fight, but I am unsure if I’ll be beating the shit out of a woman or a man should they approach me so aggressively again.

667,"So, my life is looking more hopeful and like it's going somewhere more than it has in two years. Without getting into too many personal details, I feel like I have the next few years of my life planned out. I might as well say that, I'm finally about to graduate high school...but I was supposed to two years ago. I'm 20, I was supposed to of graduated in 2017, but that didn't work out. I've spent the past two years working on online classes, and now I'm on the verge of finally finishing and getting a diploma. Which is great, right? That's great! Also, I used to have barley any social life besides one best friend, now, I have two best friends that hang out with me all the time and they both adore me. Which is awesome! Also, I have a lot of cool stuff planned for this year. I'm going to Star Wars Celebration (the big annual Star Wars con) in April, which I am stoked for. That's awesome, right? Also, I've always wanted to go Disney World or Disney Land or Universal Studios or one of those three big parks, but never have, and my parents mentioned trying to have all of us go to one of those three this year when I finish my online classes and finally get a diploma. And, I think since I'll finally be getting a diploma this year, I think I'll probably start college next year. So as you can tell, my life seems like it's so much better and more hopeful than it ever has before. 

And yet...I still feel so empty, and life still feels meaningless. I know it's not, but it feels like it is. I know my life is going places, but it feels like it's not. Like, it feels like nothing matters. I don't know. I know I have no reason to feel like this, I know that everything I do matters, I know that me finally about to graduate matters, I know all these fun things I'm gonna do this year matter, I know my friends matter, I know the fact that I'll finally be able to go to college next year matters, but it feels like none of it does. I don't fully know why. I do have a couple theories:

1. My two best friends and one other friend that I have, they all graduated back in 2017 when they were supposed to, they all have cars and drive, I don't, one of them already has his own apartment, I don't, another is already in college, I'm not for obvious reasons. I feel like all of my friends are better than me. 
2. I recently had a falling out with one of my best friends of three years, who was my only friend during the last two years of high school. For three years, me and this friend were extremely close for three years, but we recently had a falling out and now we're not on speaking terms. And...it sucks. I hate it. Just a few months ago in October for my 20th birthday, he was here, and we were hanging out, and he was awesome, and before he left he hugged me and said we were ""best friends forever"". And now he doesn't want to see or talk to me ever again. I won't get into the story of what happened, but...it sucks. I think that is a large part of why I feel so depressed. Another thing is, I feel like everyone is telling me to ""get over it."" Both of my parents have straight up told me they don't understand why I'm so upset about it, and my two best friends seem to be the same way. My two best friends were also close with this particular person, and he was apart of our ""group"". And now that he's gone, they act like he never existed. I get it, they want to move on, but, I don't get why it's so hard for everyone to understand why I'm upset about it. He was my best friend for three years, the second to last time I saw him he told me we were ""best friends forever"", and now he hates me. I don't get why it's so hard to understand why I feel upset about it. 

I think those two things, the fact that I feel like all my friends are better than me, and the fact that I lost one of my best friends and nobody seems to understand why I'm so upset about it, is why I feel like this. Any tips on how to feel better?

671,"This is going to be a long one sorry in advance. 

Let me give some backstory. I go to college out of state, where I met my boyfriend (well call him Mac) whom I’ve been dating for 2.5 years. We have a great relationship and I see myself with him forever. I am an only child to two controlling parents. My dad suffers from anxiety and tends to be awkward. He also suffered from depression when I left for college and constantly feels as though he is “losing” me. He is also one of those dads who wants my boyfriend to be “afraid” of him. My mother is a feisty Italian. Her ideal world would be me texting her throughout the day and calling her at least once a day. I regularly get guilted because I only call her twice a week currently (even though I communicate with her everyday through text and snap).

Over winter break my parents took my boyfriend and I on a two week vacation to a tropical island. I was slightly worried because my dad seems to be jealous of my bf (though he denies it) because the young daddy’s girl I once was now has a boyfriend and spends majority of my time with him. In addition, my dad doesn’t think my bf likes him and vise versa. The result of this is my dad being awkward and my bf being awkward. 

 BUT the trip was amazing. I had a great time, my boyfriend had a great time, I thought my parents had a great time. 

That is, until the last day. (Note: my boyfriend was sick for the first 3-4 days of the trip with fever,chills, etc. and unfortunately my dad got sick for the last few days). My mom, bf and I were chilling on cabanas reading by the beach. My dad came to join us and not even 2 minutes of him sitting he says “have I done something to offend you Mac?” 

My boyfriend was confused. “No you haven’t! Why would you think that?” My dad replied in a harsh tone “it just seems like every time I’m around you don’t seem to be having a good time.” 

Obviously my boyfriend was shocked (he was SO grateful for being brought and really had a great time) and tried to continue reading his book for a little while but was too shaken up so he went for a walk. This prompted my mom to scold my dad for making such remarks to my boyfriend who already feels like he’s a fourth wheel on this trip. 

My boyfriend eventually came back and settled it with my dad. I thought all was good. My mom went back up to the room. From there she started sending ME passive aggressive texts about how I don’t communicate with her and other stuff, that I must admit I don’t fully remember but really irritated me.  

Now all this has been an ongoing argument with my mom since I started college 4 years ago.  I just wanted to talk it out with her. NOT over text. 

I head up to the room with my bf and dad. This is where it all goes downhill. 

Of course my mom starts yelling and brings up past arguments. I try to tell my parents that it’s hard to communicate with him. I feel like I have to hide things they don’t want to hear, and if I tell them something they don’t like I am berated for making such decisions. At the same time when I don’t tell them things they feel as though I don’t communicate with them and they are not involved in my life. They hold financial control over my head. They look at me as a child and do not respect any opinions I have. They constantly guilt me for actions of my own discord. 

Naturally my parents had comments for everything I was saying to them. my dad talks very condescendingly to me. And my mom just yells. They’ve done this since I was a kid and and naturally I just shut down, stay quiet, and take the abuse. 

My boyfriend couldn’t stand to see my parents talking to me the way they did, and it was hard for him to see me shut down. He joins in too saying things that have been bothering him. 

He said hurtful things to my dad. Including “maybe we should just keep a superficial relationship” (my dad talked to him weeks prior and told him since he doesn’t have a good relationship with his FIL he hope my bf and him can) and “actions speak louder than words” (regarding my parents saying they do not control my life). My bf apologized that night a few minutes after he said it, crying because he felt bad and knew it was wrong. My boyfriend apologized AGAIN later to my dad in private and told him he still wants an open relationship, he was just emotional and did not mean the things he said. 

I thought everything was done. Everyone was better so I thought. When we got back home my boyfriend spent a week at my parents house (me and him sleeping in separate rooms). Since my dad was “sick” from vacation he spent the ENTIRE week my bf was visiting locked in his room. My boyfriend did not see my dad once in the entire week except when he left for the airport and my dad came out to say goodbye. After he left the rest of my winter break was spent trying to explain to my parents what my bf and I were trying to explain during the argument on vacation. This entailed so much screaming from my mother, I can easily say it was the worst week of my life. My dad thinks we see him as an “asshole” and a “bad guy” even though I’ve explained multiple times we DONT. 

That was 3 months ago. My parents still make comments about the trip including “we think about that trip everyday,” “we are so hurt,” “we are always the bad guys in your eyes and you guys do nothing wrong.” I could on forever but I’ll spare you. 

I try to not bring it up the best I can. I want to squash it. I want my old life back. I’ve tried talking to my parents multiple times to clear the air but they refuse to see my side. My boyfriend has apologized multiple times yet they refuse to see it. 

My boyfriend texted my dad for Christmas and for his birthday yet only received one word answers. 

We are going down to their house this weekend to visit, the first time everyone has gotten back together since winter break. My parents for the past few days have been expressing how nervous they are for it because we see them as terrible people (not true). My bf’s mother is also coming down for other (happy) reasons I won’t go into. 

My parents keep bringing up the vacation. How hurt they still are. I feel as though there is nothing more I can say or do to them. I don’t know what to do. I need advice. My boyfriend is also worried naturally. 

[here](https://imgur.com/gallery/G3v3bps)  is an example from this morning  and my [response](https://imgur.com/gallery/5zYxTfL)

Next year i need to do an internship in order to graduate, basically it takes a whole year.

I've been anxious about from the moment i knew i needed to do an internship in order to graduate, because i'm afraid i won't like it/ won't be good at it. Last year i almost decided to change my studies to let's call it Study B but decided to stick to Study A, because I am able to do study B in one year if I finnish study A. so last semester I started looking for an internship but i went about it all wrong (i didn't know it then). I finally landed an internship but didn't feel really happy about it (because i'm afraid i wont like it/ be bad at it). Now i know i went about looking for the internship the wrong way and i'm afraid i actually could have gotten an internship that's better suited for me. But it's too late know to change my internship.

Am I lazy? Idk man, i want to be able to sit and read a book for an hour without worrying about checking my work email. Is this even possible anymore? 

On top if this I have PTSD from an abusive relationship, which brings on bouts of depression and  anxiety..

686,"Hello! Im very new to reddit so i hope im posting in the right place. Im trying to keep this as short as possible. 

Im a 18 year old female. I started struggling with depression since i was 11 from being heavily bullied at school. I started self harming at 12, drinking at 13 and made multiple suicide attempts by the time i was 14. I finally got a psychiatrist after that and was admitted to a mental hospital to start my treatment. I was diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and PTSD. By that time i had switched schools and didn't experience any bullying. Still, it was nearly impossible to get myself to actually go to school. I had very bad panic attacks every morning and even if i got on the school bus, i would immediately leave after arriving at school. It got to a point where the school staff would do anything to get me there, allowing me to leave the class any time i felt like i was gonna have a panic attack to have a nap at the nurses office. When that still didn't work and i was fully prepared to drop out, they let me have an empty classroom where i could study alone. After a few months of doing enough assignments to get by i actually managed to graduate 9th grade.

 That summer i got my first job and moved out. I wanted to go to a night school, in hopes  I could manage fewer school days better, and maybe being around adults would distract me from the idea that it was a school. I had amazing grades for a month until the first time i skipped class again. Immediately, all the anxiety and panic attacks were back. I felt like i ruined everything and i will never achieve anything. I tried going back a few more times but failed, also lied to my mom because i didn't want to disappoint her (on a side note when i finally told her the truth she was still very supportive, the fear was just all in my head). 

At the start of next year something amazing happened. After having another suicide attempt i decided to try shrooms. They actually helped me come out of my depression and the day after that i met my now life partner. It seemed like everything was going great and i haven't gotten nearly as depressed since then, I've even been completely alcohol free. But for the next 2 years, I've tried going back to school again and i just.. Cant. It is still a huge trigger for me and i get extreme anxiety and panic attacks. 

I used to be a good student, with good grades and dreams of going into college, and now I feel like i can never go back to school. Im always looking for ways to grow and improve myself. I've constantly tried to get the best job available, and for some time it seemed like the only thing stopping me was my age. But now that im officially an adult, I feel like my lack of education is stoooing me from getting a better job. I've currently worked myself up to a sales position, but i have been looking for a new job for months now. Im really afraid about my future and can't see the next step. Is it even possible to find a good job without education? Or should i keep trying to go back to school? Im so lost.. ",06Mar2019,1
687,"So I have a problem, a jealousy problem.
Half a year ago, I began to be able to learn to get over it. Recently though, I discovered something that put more strength behind the jealousy and since I've been struggling more to deal with it. 

When I have this jealousy, I find it very hard to focus on anything else at all. As a result I am constantly attached to the thing at the route of my jealousy, even when I'm not currently having an episode.

I know I'm being vague but in a way it's to keep things simple. How can I Try to help myself deal with this problem which is bringing me a lot of anxiety and discomfort?

688,"I have a friend let’s call “Greg” and another friend we’ll call “K”. I’ve been close friends with Greg and K for awhile now and they were pretty ok friends, they both had a lot of mutual friends so they hung out a lot. K’s  boyfriend had just recently asked K to go onto a break since he wanted some time away from her, this was fine but K’s boyfriend was “talking” to other people and K wasn’t it all. K really wanted to get her boyfriend back and at this point it was obviously was just using her for sex. K would still spend a lot of time with her boyfriend but they would only be having sex and he’d ignore her the rest of the time. Well, K’s birthday was having a sort of party with K and a bunch of friends (including Greg). At the part K and Greg both got incredibly drunk and K and Greg had sex. They both were drunk so it wasn’t as if Greg was sober and every person who was there said K was the one who was on top, leading it, and could’ve easily left the situation if she felt needed.  K told me everything the day after and all she said is she only remembers a few details and that she and Greg had sex. The next day at school she talked to me and told me she told a class mate and said they think she should talk to someone since it sounds like she was raped. Of course I was there for her and she told me again all that happened, they both got drunk and she only remembers having sex and throwing up. The classmate then later told her that if she didn’t talk to the school about getting raped they were, so the next day she talked to her counselor. I told her to tell them all the details even that they were drinking and that she would get in trouble. I didn’t take a side but I was there for her. When she did talk to someone she had me there and when she explained what happened she all the sudden remembered a lot more details than what she told me. She said he was on top of her, and forced her down and that she couldn’t do anything since she was too intoxicated. The counselor gave us some alone time while she talked to an officer and I asked her how come she told me she didn’t remember anything else. She said that she was able to remember more details later through out the day. I would’ve believed it but the thing that made me really question it was the fact that she seemed fine, when talking to the counselor about what happened she would often talk stray to different topics and would joke around. She seemed fine which was really strange to me,  I would’ve expected a rape victim to struggle to talk about it and try to get it over. She seemed to wanted to stay there longer and just talk, even if it wasn’t about the topic. It was time for her to talk to an officer and I had to go back to class, she wanted me to stay really bad and I felt bad for leaving her side. 

————About Greg————
Greg has always been a good friend. He jokes around a lot and they’re usually sexually jokes but not directly at someone, just funny things. He started getting involved in the wrong things and was getting in trouble with the law around this time. When all of this happened Greg was having what sort of punishment he’ll have for a few things he did. It ended up being 3 months in DH (detention hall). 
————————————-
K got a rape kit done and she hasn’t gotten her results back yet, but a lot of people heard about what happened and both sides of the story. Greg’s side of the story is a lot more believable since everyone there has told it the same way.  A lot of people are bullying K at this time and her and her mom decide that it’s best for her to switch out. She switches to a school in the district it’s basically just like a second option for troubled kids and it’s really nice. 3 months later and Greg is back at school with me and I’m really excited to see Greg. Greg doesn’t talk much about what happened because he’s trying not to spur up drama and bring it up again and he’s still friends with a lot of K’s friends. K doesn’t want me or any of her friends to hang around Greg. I don’t hang out with him since he’s currently not aloud out for awhile but Greg is interested in me. He’s a really nice guy and I trust him, I’ve been around him intoxicated and he’s never done anything to me and I’ve never seen him do anything to anyone without consent. I just don’t know what to do, I’d like to give Greg a chance but I know K would never talk to me again. There’s still a chance Greg raped her but it seems unlikely. What do you even say to a friend who says something like? She isn’t trying to press charges or anything onto him. I just don’t know what to do about the situation. K has been a good friend to me but she’s always seemed to be more about her boyfriend than me.",06Mar2019,1
689,"So. I'm 18. Still in highschool. Don't have an ID or a job. I live off the child support from my dad (he's behind, so it'll last a while) When I was seventeen I ran away from my mother's house (it was an abusive situation) and took the child support with me. Now, you can probably imagine how difficult it was to find an apartment 18 years old, without a job, credit, or an ID, but I found one.

My teachers got worried and called my mom, my mom told the police I was a missing person.

When I get back from the hospital, still depressed, I'm told that I'm to leave my apartment at the end of the month because the apartment managers believe I don't have the skills to live alone.

I was unaware of them being under 16 (she was 15 age of consent is 16 here) and since they flirted with me a lot I did return the favor when drunk. (this was all online)

now I felt uncomfortable after finding out they were younger and stopped talking to them on good terms, but yesterday they tried contacting me again and I kind of shut her off. then she proceeded to get mad and call me a pedo. now today a thread 'exposing' me is posted and hundreds of people are agreeing with them and reporting me. this thread has no screenshots as there are none and its badly written

I made a response thread highlighting that the flirting was mutual and that I stopped talking to them when I found out their age.

695,"So I need some advice as to whether I'm about to handle a situation in a good or bad way.

I am a manager in a department of me, myself and one other co-worker. Recently a co-worker who is not part of my department (or anyone's department) has decided to set up shop in our office with a laptop at a spare desk and chair (there for meetings). 

Now initially we didn't mind as his old spot was taken by a new employee. But Christ it's been 6 months and two of the three of us are losing our nerve. He is a total chatter box and does feck all work.

Worse still he's had an influence over one of my co-workers who is now also taking breaks in the day to have long chats with this colleague during work hours. He has also taken to using his phone and browsing on the internet when he thinks I'm unaware (I am very much aware and have called him out when I've noticed).

Am I right to go to HR about getting this staff member removed from our office? I'm not in a position to manage the co-worker at the spare desk as he's been with the company 30 years and me only 3. I'm also going to get really strict with my subordinate on being a lazy bastard just because the other guy can get away with it.

Any advice on how to deal with the obvious fallout that will ensue once the guy realises I've kicked him out?

My middle school was a place that gave kids a chance to get into a private high school with scholarships. This was a school with strict rules and a rigorous learning program. You had to attend there all your middle school years in order to get a scholarship, which was paid for by donors. This school was for lower income families, but my family makes good money. I always knew I was more fortunate than my middle school classmates, but I tried not to show it. A couple of kids from my old school also got scholarships to my current high school. My parents recently asked me if I still hung out with my some of my middle school classmates. I said yes and she started to tell me that I needed to hang out with the richer kids. She also made it look like them being poor was a bad thing. One time one of my friends told me his single mom wasn’t able to pay the electricity bill. I felt so bad for him, I couldn’t even imagine what I would’ve done. My mom is also telling me to stop hanging out with my old friends and called them “hood rats”.  How do I explain to my parents that they are my friends and their income isn’t something they can control?

701,"I'm going to give a little bit of backstory because this is quite a complicated situation and might benefit from some context.

I'm 20 and my brother is 19. We have always got along and I actually love him! We don't live with our parents any more. I moved in with my boyfriend a couple of years ago and my brother moved out to live with my gran when home life got very stressful following my dad's medical problems. 

My brother has always been the hermit type, especially when he was in school, staying at home and playing on his devices rather than going out. His friends would occasionally drop round and they would chill in his room, no big deal. He would never really go outside other than to go to school.

My dad was hospitalised in 2016 with a severe stroke and it was very hard on all of us. It was around this time that my brother began to get very secretive with his personal life. He seemed to not want to let us in. He used to go 'to the shop' on his bike of a late evening and would return an hour later with nothing of note, and he would always have money. We found out later that (surprise!) he had been dropping drugs to people for his friend.

These are the type of people I believe he assocaited himself with. He's told me before that he paid one of his friends to steal a phone for him to buy at a lower price. 

So, back to the story. He got a job back in October and has been working there for a while. Recently, he's told me that he was being messed around with at work and that they weren't giving him enough hours. Having been through the same thing, I believed him.

However, I've just recieved a call from my cousin. Turns out he hasn't had the job for a couple of weeks. Last week my gran couldn't find her debit card and £300 had been withdrawn from it. They had been questioning everyone that had been in and out of the house on that day if they had seen it. They called my brother (who was out at the time) and he said he hadn't. 

She has CCTV in her living room and upon looking back through it they clearly saw my brother take her card out of her bag and leave. On seeing this they called my brother back home and he admitted to taking it and withdrawing the money. When questioned as to why, he gave the answer that he had killed someone, and was being blackmailed for money. 

I have always thought that there was something going on in his life that he wasn't telling me. He carries a knife around with him, and a Zippo too (even though he has never smoked). Every now and then he will make a dark joke, and a few months ago he said in passing that he thought he killed someone. I originally thought that he was taking the piss, but now I can't help but think there is some element of truth to it. However, I really doubt that he would kill or injure anyone, which is a stance me and my cousins share.

As a result, I am seriously worried for his welfare. If this is the truth, then he is involved in dangerous things and he's way out of his depth. If he's lying, then he has some serious problems that need addressing.

Also, he doesn't know that I have been told. It was also a mutual decision between me and my cousins to not tell my parents until we actually realise what is going on. It's possible their reaction would be extremely severe and might complicate things.

I'm unsure what to do in this situation. We are rather close and I feel extremely helpless. I'm incredibly disappointed that he would do this to my gran, but at the same time I'm very concerned about the stuff he's tangled up in. I just really want to know what's going on so I can best help him/get him to a place where he can get help.

How do I approach this?

Naturally, I’m really concerned, and want to do something. My problem is that I can come off as pushy and overbearing.

Whenever we hang out and we are just watching tv or something we usually smoke a little weed no big deal, but every once in a while she will lay her head on my shoulder and like I know for sure she has no interest in me in that way, we considered each other basically siblings, but then sometimes ill lay my head on her shoulder like not a huge deal we are both fine with it, but I love her, i've never really loved anyone to this extent, she's my motivation to get out of bed, she's my motivation to do good in school, she's everything for me. I know I sound weird for it but I just don't know what to do. I don't want to tell her how I feel due to it probably ruining the friendship but I also cant see her dating anyone, everyone that she has either dated or has had interest in would just use her. I don't know what to do and i'm over reacting but i've just ran out of ideas to not have feelings for her in that way",06Mar2019,1
716,I recently have gotten the choice to go to a high school that none of my close friends or friends at all for that matter are going to it’s a really good high school and would be great educational on the other hand there is an average school that all of my friends are going to and I know if I work hard in that school and take all the opportunities I can there I’ll do just as well as if I was in the other high school I don’t know which one I should go to,06Mar2019,1

718,She got into the habit of smoking cigs this year. At first I didn’t pay much attention to it because it was the occasional cig. She smoked more weed back then but her parents found out and she swapped to cigs and it kinda went downhill from there. She got busted once on a school trip for having cigs with her and she can’t go a day without smoking. I don’t even know how many packs she goes through. I think I saw her smoke 4 cigs within the span of a few hours once. She just turned 18 and that’s when you become legal to buy cigs and I’m worried she’s just gonna smoke even more now. She smokes to cope with her depression I think and I don’t feel like it’s my place to tell her how to cope with depression but I don’t want her to regret it or get to a point where she can’t get off them if she wants to. Her philosophy behind cigs is that they kill you in a slow manner and that’s kinda why she does it. I honestly don’t know what to do. I want to get her to stop smoking but I don’t want to overstep or piss her off,06Mar2019,1

721,"TL; DR: My boyfriend is stuck in a job he hates and doesn't know where to go from here. Is there anyone here who got their lives together a little later in life? If so, how did you do it? 


Hi, I'll give a little back story. My (24 F) boyfriend (26 M) and I have been together for about 4 1/2 years now. He met me when I was just starting out in nursing school and he was jobless and taking care of his youngest brother.

 Fast forward to this past summer, we both simultaneously got career- jobs. I got a position as a floor nurse and he is now working as a train conductor (I probably shouldn't say where).  We both still live with our parents and are saving up to move out by the fall. 

My boyfriend tried going to school, but he took a while to grow up and mature. He attempted to go back to school after flunking out his first try, but never really finished. 

Well, for the past 6-8 months, my boyfriend has been absolutely miserable. He works 6 days a week, sometimes working 14 hours a shift. They don't tell him when he's working until the day before he is due to go in. On top of that, the schedule is all over the place. He sometimes goes into work at 1am, comes home at noon, and is expected to come back in at 11 that night or some crazy shit like that. And to top it off, the commute is long. 

He'll get one day off, but technically have to work into his day off. He makes a decent living and we love in a state where it's very expensive to live on your own. He makes enough where he could have a very comfortable living, but I have never seen him so miserable in my entire life. He is just devoid of energy, joy, and motivation. And I know some people will joke and say ""Haha same me too"", but this is too the point that I am genuinely concerned for his well- being. 

He hasn't seen his friends in months and we sometimes go weeks without seeing each other. 

His father works in the same field of work and is trying to convince him to stick it out a little longer because once he has some seniority, he will be able to get a more steady schedule. However, it's not certain when this will happen. He wants to leave to have more of a... y'know... a life? At least a full 24 hours away from his job? He actually sometimes will get up in the middle of the night and try to open the doors of the train in his sleep. 

He also keeps comparing himself to me, someone who knew what she wanted to do from a very young age, and now has a career. But it's an unfair comparison because I know I'm not in the majority. 

So my question to you, Reddit, is if there is anyone who got their shit together a little later in life? I simply want to show my boyfriend that he is not alone and that it can be done and that it isn't too late for him. 

He's depressed and truly believes his life is over.

722,"OK so idk if this fits here, I'm sorry if this doesn't. I couldn't find any other subs for This. Also I'm using an alt account, so yeah. Also also, I'm on Mobile and I'm generally not good at grammer and stuff so. And this isn't as serious as some of the stuff on here. 

OK so here's the problem. There's a seller on Ebay who is selling a set of 7 books. These books are my favorite series of books. The whole thing is under forty dollars. That's a deal. Each book usually sells for about ten dollars and they're in New condition. Also, for some reason, one of the volumes Is usually sold for hundreds of dollars. Every other copy I've found of this book is sold for hundreds and most are used. One copy was going for over a thousand dollars. This one is just included in the set. My thinking was get the set and read them for a while and then sell that expensive copy and make some money. This is also the last set the seller has. This could be my only chance to get all 7 books, not just at this price, but in general because of how expensive a physical copy of one of the volumes is.

Here's the thing tho, I only have eighty dollars. The set is around forty. Of course that's affordable but I only have eighty. I don't have a job, I've been looking but I don't have a job. I don't know when I'll have this kind of money again. I know that this money could go towards something good like food or something. My mom has told me many times that she only wants me to spend the money on myself and things I want. She only gave me this much because of her tax return things. Usually money is super tight and if I save my money then I could buy like groceries and stuff someday I'm the future. Forty dollars my be a good deal when it comes to the set of books but that's still alot for me.

As if all that wasn't enough I've got depression do I've started losing interest in the series. I know I still like the series. I know that without depression if be all over. So I know that normally I'd love getting the whole series like this, My depression can go suck on a corn cob. But this is still a problem. Should I really spend forty dollars on something I, currently, only half-heartedly want?

So what do you think? This is probably my only chance to get the entire series. I've search every online book store and every website of every nearby book store I could find. I contacted the seller the books are the real deal. But they're a whole forty dollars, money that could to something else and I only kind want them right now. I love these books and I don't like the my depression is Making me lose interest in stuff I like. I was asking my sister about this and she asked me ""why do you want the books"" and that kind hit me, like do I really have a reason? Do I actually want to books? Do I actually want them but I've lost Interest cus. Depression? Idk. Idk what the right move here so I'd appreciate any thoughts you have.

Thanks. ",06Mar2019,2
723,"Obligatory excuse the formatting/bad english/rant. Also I’m a fuckup (i know that)

So I’ll try to keep this brief.

Education (non american):
Did 4 years of highschool and passed the first year essentially, dropped out. Started learning a trade (8 months), quit, started next trade (6 months), quit, worked retail successfully 1 year, became disatisfied with life... and finally i started a trade (4year education with work combined) and stuck with it for 2.5 years... and as of now I’m sick of my life (not suicidal) just really disappointed with what i have achieved/done with it. 

Note: just to be safe, i won’t specify the Jobs I’ve done, but the curious among you can message me and I’ll let you know. Also the job I’m doing right now isn’t considered a trade in most countries (afaik only 2)

Now i know I’ll have to stick with the “trade” i am doing right now and get a diploma, however i need to find a way to get through the workday and to supress the naseous feeling i get from working at that company and that job. I thought about starting to learn coding (already know HTML, CSS, Very little php and js) but I’d want a diploma for it and that doesn’t come cheap...

I have to pay rent, so i don’t have a lot of disposable income i could use to better my situation, i already started doing some oddjobs for friends and aquaintaces in my freetime to raise some but I’m really starting to be drained mentally. 

Any general advice to this mess of an existence?

Anyway, Thank you to everyone reading until this point. A big thanks in anticipation for everyone that considers and or is going to leave a comment with advice. For further questions, please message me directly.",06Mar2019,1

729,"I work for a fairly large company &amp; there are about 200 people in my department. I used to be an admin &amp; I would assist with tons of different tasks. I was promoted in August of 2018 and am no longer an admin, yet people still expect me to do the same shit and help them out all the time. No one has filled the admin position, because it really isn't necessary for our department.

Most of these tasks people ask me to do they could EASILY do themselves, they just got used to me doing everything for them. I didn't mind at first because I understood it was a transition for them and there would obviously be an adjustment period, but at this point I feel like people are just being lazy and taking advantage of me. All of them are still higher up in the company and have been around longer than I have, so it feels super awkward to tell them no. It's causing me to be resentful though and I have responded in a rude or sarcastic way a few times because I feel like I'm doing two jobs now and I don't have the energy for that (and also I am not getting paid to do 2 jobs).

730,"Totally fed up with lack of sex. I have tried everything I can do, from buying sexy lingerie from Victoria's secret, to even doing a naked photo shoot to give him a photo album to help get him in the mood. I have exercised and lost weight. I have tried talking. I do everything in my power to reduce his stress, asked him to see a doctor, Then we have sex and that is it for the month. This has been going on 7 months now. We are both 30 and been married for nearly 9 years. After he looked at the photo album, and put it up without a second thought, I asked a friend (who is a guy) if I was attractive at all, and was told yes. I have asked if there is anything wrong with me and my husband says no. I have asked if there is anything I can do to help and he says no.

he can be horny with a few dick pics and he always jokes about wanting sex if we ever met but because of that i'm not sure if i wanna meet him lol, i never met a guy from the net before buf i have met lesbians from online and they were fine. from my past with guys has made me a bit scared (been sexually abused by ex boyfriends) and that i find it hard to trust a guy he said he would never force himself on me or do anything  that i don't want to do,

734,I'm 21 she's 19 (if that matters). So I've known this girl for about 4 years and we started talking again a few weeks back. We used to be good friends and see each other a lot but she moved to the other side of the city and we just lost contact. Since we've started talking again it's like we never stopped and I cannot stop smiling when talking to her I'm relatively confident that the feeling is mutual. The only issue is she has a month old child and I've never been huge on having kids anyway (It's not that I don't want them it's more that I've never really thought about it) I was hoping someone had been in a similar situation and could give me some advice as to how it worked out and how to approach the situation. ,06Mar2019,0
