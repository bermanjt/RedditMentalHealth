0,"My mom spend all her free time on her phone, mostly watching YouTube. She spends more than half her day looking at her phone, and my dad hates it. He's talking to me about divorcing her, and I'm not sure what to do! What can I do, Reddit?",13Nov2019,1
1,"So I live with 3 other girls. One of them I consider my best friend. When we first started living together, I didn’t know any of them. I had suspected that two of them (including the girl I consider my best friend) were gossiping about me and talking about me in the beginning, but I just kinda brushed it off. Basically a long time ago I had to go to the ER and my one roommate who is a bitch was annoyed she had to stay in the ER with me until 1 am and then complained to my other roommate (my now “best” friend) how I was overreacting and an attention seeker (even though I was genuinely literally dying) and they said horrible terrible things about me. I know all this because I was going through my friend’s phone today and I read messages she had with the bitchy roommate from way back when I was in the ER and my friend had said in the messages that she hates me and wants to smack me, and my other bitch of a roommate said “lmao go right ahead I’m done with her shit” and they would go back and forth like this and also tell each other about things I would do throughout the day that would annoy them. I had suspected they didn’t like me for some odd reason back when this was happening but didn’t really understand why as I had genuinely always been nice to them, and now that I have read these messages I am hurt and disappointed. I always knew that one girl was a stupid little bitch and just ignored her. But I am really hurt that my “best friend” thought this way about me and said these horrible things about me, especially during a time when I was very sick (I had sepsis, became malnourished, would faint a lot, and had stomach issues that continued long after this whole ER thing). Instead of them being compassionate human beings they said awful things about me for the stupidest reasons. They didn’t even ask how I was feeling or how I was doing back when this was happening. Honestly I know that stupid bitch is jealous of me and that’s why she started saying those things about me, but I am just sad that literally my best friend followed along with it. Even if we weren’t really friends back then I am still very hurt and baffled by it, especially since she said she HATED me. I don’t know what to feel and don’t know if I should continue being friends with her. I had no idea she was this cruel and mean, especially towards a sick person who can’t help being sick even if it’s an inconvenience to her and the other roommates.",13Nov2019,1

7,"This past year has been extremely trying, it’s to the point where I just don’t want to be here anymore. I look in the mirror and don’t recognize myself, I’ve been doing toxic things, and sometimes it’s hard to even get out of bed. About a year ago I was in a relationship that I thought was forever. When in fact I was just getting played. I was completely manipulated by a narcissist and it has really fucked with my head. Fast forward 3 months later and I felt like things were getting better, I ended up hanging out with a guy and had consensual sex. The next day he said that we just weren’t a good match. In any other situation it wouldn’t have bothered me but lately it just seems like I’m not good enough, I’m just searching for validation or some sort of intimacy. For a little back story one of my parents is bipolar and an alcoholic which I think had left this void in my life. I never truly feel like I’m good enough and I’m starting to now recognize the real issues at hand. I just really feel like for once in my life things aren’t going to get better and I have no one to talk to about this. From the outside looking in I’m confident, pretty, smart, a workaholic and no one would ever understand if I explained how I’m feeling.


I just want to give up, I really do. I feel like something is wrong with me and it would be so much easier to just sleep.",13Nov2019,1
8,"So, growing up I had a lot of issues with my dad. I've vented about him in the past on other posts. Basically he has disowned me and one of my sister at a couple different points. He chose his soon to be ex wife over us, and when he had custody of me growing up he convinced me my mom didn't love me.


Long story short, last year he told me that he and his wife were getting a divorce. He told me he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Since he was getting a divorce and was going to be alone I told him he should look for a house closer to me so if things get bad I can help take care of him. He lived 3 hours away from me before he started house hunting (he's retired). 


Instead of moving closer to me, he got a new girlfriend (his twin daughters' mom, whom he had kids with before he married my mom. He disowned the twins before they were born because he ""doesn't have twins in his family"". The twins look just like me. It's weird) and he moved in the opposite direction of me, closer to 4 hours. I told him I can't drop things to take care of him if he gets bad and he's 4 hours away from me. I already was on the fence about things from our history. He told me ""Don't worry *girlfriend* said she will take care of me until I'm bad. And then I can probably make her take care of me after that.""


The sister that he is still close to (I have 4 sisters) has been trying to guilt me into staying in contact with him when he can't even send a text to tell me ""Happy birthday"" (""I lost your phone number."" ""Dad, your birthday is 3 days before mine and I texted you on your birthday. Did you get that?"" ""Oh yeah I got that."") That sister lives two states over now and she says since she doesn't live nearby I'm the only one that can take care of him. 


I honestly don't know what to do. I'm pissed that he doesn't make things easier on me. Its stressing me out and I have PCOS and I'm already struggling to get pregnant without this on top of it. My husband says that I should just stay out of it... But he is my dad. A lot of my resentment comes from me wanting to have a father-daughter relationship and he just won't put forth any effort. 


Does anyone have any advice?",13Nov2019,1
9,"I'm a 15 year old male and I'm currently learning C# programming for game development and taking animation and 3D modeling classes at my local community college, where my professor basically guaranteed us a job. I'm failing almost every class at my high school because instead of doing work I just program on my laptop. I know it sounds irresponsible but I can't bring myself to focus and do the work either way, because of how pointless it is, so I might as well do something productive.

The problem is my mother. She claims she's going to take away my laptop if I don't get better grades but when I try telling her that I know what I do to do and nothing school is teaching me is relevant to that, she doesn't seem to listen. I also want to take the CHSPE (I live in California) so that I can graduate early and have more time to focus on my career. I can't seem to get my point across to her that I should be in control of my future, and her interference is only going to make things worse. Also this laptop that I'm doing work on, I've been saving up for around 6 months for and just got it last week.

Anyone have any ideas on what I might be able to do to get my point across of even just stay a bit more low-key?

&amp;#x200B;

Extra notes if anyone cares enough to read them:

1. She's anti-vax, so that should give you an idea of just how stubborn and know-it-all she is.
2. I had a doctor's appointment recently where the doctor asked me about my grades and when I told him they sucked he asked what I wanted to be, I told him a programmer. He then nodded his head a smiled, looking my mother dead in the eyes, he said, ""Ahh, well if you want to be a programmer, don't worry about your grades. They will do nothing but drag you down and programming is a competitive industry. You need to put in your 110% effort"" I kid you not the man who went to college for 4+ years to become a doctor told me not to worry about my grades. Yet my mother still wants to argue with me.
3. I'm considering posting a resume on Indeed, even though I'm only 15 I feel like it's worth a shot and I have a little experience.
4. My mother claims that if I don't keep my grades up she won't let me take the CHSPE to get my high school equivalency diploma, which, is the most downright backwards and retarded thing I have ever heard in my life.

I'm done ranting. If anyone has any ideas please let me know, if not then thanks for at least taking the time to read this far.",13Nov2019,1
10,"For the past year and a half I've experienced a lot of trauma. I'm by myself miles away from home in a work environment I cannot leave. I am often immensely sad, still grieving over a relationship long since gone. I have a constant sense of paranoia and I feel like I always have to watch my back. I have no motivation to get up and do anything or help myself. I drown in my own sadness every day.

The strangest part about all of this is that nothing feels real sometimes. It's almost like I feel detached from reality and it's a feeling really hard to describe. When I think about all of the hard things that have happened to me the past year and a half, they almost seem fake and pretend. Yet I know they are very real. Idk where to go or who to talk to.",13Nov2019,1
11,"I’m in my mid 20s working full time for a company the past 3 years and i started doing a degree part time (4 hours after work, 2 days a week, i don’t get home until 11pm those days) and i don’t know whether i should quit or what i should do really. 

On one hand i’ll need some further qualification to move up in my workplace and work put about 25% towards the college fees for this first year. I’ve tried college before and dropped out because i was homesick and genuinely didn’t enjoy it and nothing clicked. Again this time i’m not enjoying it and nothing is clicking and i’m so tired and unhappy those days around college at the start of the week.

On the other hand i’m going through the most painful breakup right now and for the past year or so my mental health has been awful. I have bad anxiety, depression and panic attacks. College has only made all of these things worse. 

I know i’ll be disappointing my parents and work won’t be happy if i drop out but I just can’t see myself finishing 3 years of this and i’m not sure if that’s because my mental health is at its worst now and i want the easy way out and less stress.

I’ve had some family tell me to get over things quickly, buck up and keep going with college and then others tell me to do what i think is best for me but i honestly don’t know what’s best for me now and what’s best for future me.

12,"So this weekend I (19F) received a Snapchat from a guy (21M) who I've known for years but have never been friends with in any capacity. I never really use Snapchat so I opened it nearly a day after receiving it, at which point I'd already been either blocked or unfriended by the sender, so his name disappeared and only his Snapchat username was left. I opened it and it was a several-clip-long video of him jacking off. I was with friends and sort of laughed it off—who hasn't gotten a dick pic before? But later I googled his Snapchat username in quotes because I was concerned that maybe I misremembered that the Snapchat was from him after all since he blocked me and his name disappeared. Of course I didn't misremember, but I saw some *super* concerning reddit posts from an account of the same username (which was also used on other sites and tied to his real name, so there's no doubt in my mind that he made the posts). He seems to be active on r/ bipolar and has posted about being suicidal. Those posts are semi-old (\~1 year) but are the only ones from the account and made me concerned that perhaps he is not doing well and that's why he was compelled to send a dick video and blocked me before I even opened it? We have many sort of mutual friends but there's no one that I know he is close to. I know he's had at least some minor attraction to me for \~4 years despite us seeing each other 1-2 times per year and never living on the same coast. Am I being ridiculous for being concerned for this dude? Perhaps it's naive to think that only someone who isn't doing well would send that video/block me before I opened it, but that's where I'm at. Should I try do anything (contact him, reach out to someone he *might* be friends with to check in on him) or conclude he's just a creep and just forget about this?",13Nov2019,1
13,"I (19 F) am completely burnt out of school.

TL;DR at the end

Ok, so there's a ton to unpack here. I'm going to split it into three sections for convenience. Most of it is context or leading up to the last straw.

1. Growing apart (backstory, not super necessary to the story)

So about four years ago, I met my best friend. Let's call them Alex (they're non-binary, female to nb). They're one of the kindest people I've ever met, but they're brutally honest about everything. We first connected by talking about art, which we both REALLY enjoy. We also had a mutual friend (let's call her Carly). The three of us grew super close and hung out every day. eventually, though, we started arguing more. Alex has severe mental issues (depression, anxiety, and OCD from having an abusive mother and father and growing up without their father because he was a drug addict) and me and Carly do too (me: social/general anxiety from an abusive mother. Carly: Severe OCD and noise sensitivity). This is where the first (major) problem started.

2. Bobby

In one of our classes, there was this guy named Bobby (fake name). He would harass us and ""flirt"" with us (basically just constantly asking us out until we said we would report him if he didn't stop. After a while of this, he gave us this excuse that he was this way because his dad died when he was a little kid and that scarred him. I was talking to Alex and I said something that really upset them. ""Well yeah it's sad that his dad died, but that's not an excuse to be a dick."" Alex got really mad and started saying things like ""It's really hard growing up without a dad, but it's not like YOU would know that"" and other things that actually really hurt. Afterward, we made up but it was never really the same. There's also another thing you should know about Alex: they love to talk about their problems but get annoyed and pushy when someone else tries to vent.

3. The last straw

Alex and Carly started dating a few months ago. Alex started getting colder towards me and stopped talking to me altogether about a week ago. I'm pretty mad and am considering ending our friendship.

Now for the big question: Should I repair our friendship or leave it?

TL;DR: My friend and I got in a few big arguments and they started dating my other friend. Eventually, they stopped talking to me. Should I repair our friendship or leave it?",13Nov2019,1
18,"When I was born, my parents chose to give me the surname that my father's side of the family has (parents aren't married and are no longer together). I'll call it surname A. 

Over the years, I've grown further and further away from that side, they don't even really like me, and I am so much closer and to my mother's side who all share surname B. 

I feel like surname B is just far more who I am than surname A, it's a fantastic name and I'd be proud to share it with them. It's also a much more unique surname than A which I know has helped other family members get jobs/opportunities because it stands out on a CV, not that that is my main motivation for changing it.

I just want to love my name and feel closer to the family who actually love and care about me, but I know changing my name would lead to major drama if A family found out. They would see it as a betrayal for sure as they aren't the type of people to understand, although I can of course see why it could hurt them.

I just want to know what people think, as I'm feeling really stuck. This is something I've been thinking about for years, I'm 22 now just for reference.",13Nov2019,1
19,"I've been living on my own for a few months, moved states and am starting to get into school. My parents recently offered to help me with school and allowed me to stay with them while doing so. I'm not making a lot of money here and honestly living with my family would make things a lot easier.

Should I admit defeat and leave my friends, or tough it out and stay here? I don't know if I'm being an idiot.",13Nov2019,1
20,"A little over a week ago, on Halloween, some friends and I (29M) were hanging out at the local brewery. We all had a few before deciding to head to the hostel across the street (where most of them are staying) and cook some meat. We left one friend (45M) behind who was engaged with other brewery goers. I'll call him Don. (Age will become relevant further down)

A bit later, Don showed up at the hostel, having clearly had a few more drinks than us. He invited a few of us back to his room. When we got there, he had crushed up an unknown number of valium tablets and made 4 lines (one for each of us) plus an extras pile. He also kept mentioning that he was super bummed-out. 

I didn't want my line but my other two friends did so they took their lines and passed the straw to Don. In one go Don snorted his line, my line, and the extras pile. 

Things got really bad after that, with him laying bare all his issues and sobbing over them. We tried to get him to go out to the local bar with us so we could watch over him while continuing to have fun. About 5 minutes after we got there he completely broke down in tears and I took him back to the hostel. 

He was talking suicide by OD when we got back to his room, so for the next four hours I talked him down, found and confiscated his meds, put him to bed, and watched him sleep for a while. Once I thought he was safe I went home, taking his meds with me. 

The next day he texted me, saying he had blacked-out, didn't remember what had happened, and asked me if I knew where his meds were. I told him what happened, that I had them, that he could have them back after we talked about it. 

We ran into a each other a few days later, but when I tried to bring the topic up he got super pissed-off, told me I didn't understand, ""everybody has bad days,"" and stormed away before I was able to say my piece. That has been the result every time I've tried to talk to him about it since. 

About half of the friends supported my decision to take his meds. The other half say it's none of my business: that I'm too young to understand, and that old guys have problems that they must sort out themselves. 

But then yesterday one of my closer friends (who was on my side) flip-flopped. He told me that he knew my intentions were good, but that I was too young to understand (he's an older guy, himself), that Don needed the meds back to work, and that Don was starting to say things about me behind my back. 

Should I cave and give the meds back minus the conversation? Am I truly too young to understand what Don is going through? At this point the majority of our mutual friends are on his side, although none of them witnessed the full of his breakdown; only I saw it all. Is the majority right?

Or is my path righteous and one I should continue down? Should I keep Don's meds until we can have our conversation and I can make sure he's safe? Should I go against majority and continue to follow my own morals?",13Nov2019,1
21,"The jobs aren't related at all either. It ranges from pay, from the actual work they do, and the environment. I've looked into being a teacher to being an MRI tech to even a web developer and yet anytime I try to research more about the job satisfaction, all anyone has to say is how horrible it is. For some it's horrible hours and others it's not being able to find a place to work. I just don't even know what to do anymore. All I want out of a career is a job where I can go in, and go out, and live on a comfortable salary. I think that's what everyone dreams of. It just seems so difficult. I don't want to put myself in debt for a career that won't work out the way I hoped it would. I also want to know that I can land a job in that field. I don't want to have the anxiety of knowing I'll have financial issues in the future. I'm honestly lost, what do I even choose as a career if everyone hates being in the careers I look into?",13Nov2019,1
22,"Hi reddit. 

Usually don’t post but need some advice. 


Background: I am a high level figure skater who has spent 10+ years training for an Olympic Dream, got started skating to have a space to get away from family, 
(Abusive) and skating has been my primary focus/happiness since. 
Long distance relationship 


Ok here goes. I have been dating this lovely woman for quite some time and would love to propose. Marriage is important to us for religious reasons and personal ones. However I feel I cannot have a wife move in with me and continue to compete at my best. The lack of time to commit to both. That being said she has made me happier than skating has ever made me, and I feel that my passion for skating is waining. However I have so much invested in it, and lots of expectations on me etc. in quitting skating I would also have to rebuild my future idea for career. Skaters make little money until they retire to become professional coaches and showmen, but in competition there isn’t much. I had always planned to become a coach, but if I stop I would switch career tracks entirely, as I don’t have the best credentials for coaching yet. I would love to start my married life with her sooner than later, as we have been 200+ miles long distance for our dating life. 

My current thoughts: 

Retire early from skating (was planning on 2026 olympics, If I qualified then retire)   and switch careers. Skating was/is used as a happiness tool to get my life back on track, but with her in my life skating doesn’t have to be the primary source of my happiness anymore. I have other fields of interest for careers and the drive to succeed. I feel personally like it’s time for me to close this chapter of my life, and start fresh with her by my side. 


Sorry if this post is slightly scattered, I may not be writing this in proper order. 
Thank you for thoughts/advice on this post. If you would like more info/specifics just ask.

23,"I'm 27 and I live with my divorced dad who is a 62 year old alcoholic. He's not physically abusive, but when he gets drunk he yells, bangs the walls, falls down and gets hurt and says the most hurtful things imaginable about me, my mother, and everybody else really. Him falling around the house injuring himself and hearing the wall banging has given me ptsd every time I am somewhere when I here a loud bang above me. He had almost died last winter from slipping outside and barely made it back in the house in the middle of the night when I was asleep because he went out for a smoke all drunk as hell. This shit keeps me up at night worrying about him because he will never listen to me or take any advise that I give him because he is the most stubborn person I have met.

 I was living on my own a few years back and then my brother died and I had to move back into my fathers house to take care of him because he was suicide and just completely out of his mind after losing his son which is understandable. But almost 4 years later nothing has changed. He has his good days and bad days, but every month or two he goes on a bender. He can't drive because he can't feel the bottom of his feet. He won't go to the doctors to get it checked out and just thinks he can drive himself without being able to physically feel the gas and brake pedals and hes drinks every day so i took his keys. This makes it so I have to get him his beer every day. He used to drink vodka straight, but I eventually got him down to a 30pk of bud heavies every two days and this past year I got him down to a 12 pack a day. Kind of sucks picking that much beer up around town and I feel like all the cashiers think I'm the alcoholic. He refuses to drink less than and 12 pack though. If I don't get him the beer, he will get a taxi or just call someone to get his beer and he will get wasted. I sometimes get a couple twelve packs at a time so i don't have to go to the store every single day, but if he finds the extra one while I am at work, he drinks both and demands more when I get home from work because he is shitfaced.

 My life was going really great before moving back in with him. I had my own place, a nice job, a good girlfriend and I lost it all putting him before everything in my life. I finally got a new job and planning on signing a lease for a house down the road, but now I just don't know what to do. The place is about 10 minutes away and he is losing his mind about it and trying to guilt me into staying. He just doesn't want to live alone and feels like hes losing me which I can understand, but I've explained I need my own place. I accidentally told him it was because of his alcoholism when  I was upset which is partially true, and he just said everything hurtful a parent could tell their child. Blames me for my brothers death sometimes and that messes me up. I don't hold it against him because I know hes just drunk, but I have had to really strengthen myself to the abusive side of his alcoholism.

 I don't want people thinking he is a bad person though, because when he is sober, he is really awesome and an amazing caring father. It's just when he starts drinking he turns into an unrecognizable monster. He doesn't understand basic things though like me wanting to get my own place again and takes it as If I don't want to live with him which is true, but I really just like living on my own. He is not able to drive which means I have to do everything for him that's not at the house which I don't mind. Luckily grocery stores now deliver groceries around us so I feel like i can finally move out and him and I both can get our independence. 

I know he struggles with abandonment because my mother left him without really giving him a chance to clean his act up and the only problem he really had was drinking. He sobered up before the split, but the damage was already done I guess or my mother already made up her mind. After she took everything in the divorce he just became an alcoholic again. Then 15 years later my brother died and my sister moved across the world and doesn't call or text him or talk to him at all so I am the last person around that is here for him. My sister has her reasons to not talk to him, but my father really didn't do anything to hurt her which kind of sucks. I think she blames him for my brothers death because he died in the house in the bathroom from an asthma attack and we assume my father was passed out drunk on the couch and wasn't able to do anything. My brother also refused to go to the hospital that night but it could have also been because my dad was drunk and my brother didn't want him to drive him. I really don't know because it was such a fucked up time. 

I have gone to multiple therapists and they all tell me to cut him off of the alcohol. I don't think they understand that it can literally kill a person when they have that much of an addiction if they just quit cold turkey. He will not go to rehab because he did that at a very popular Florida rehabilitation center that I will not name and said it was the worse experience he has ever gone through even though it sobered him up for a while. But rehab and doctors are out of the option. I don't think I can legally just leave him at the house without assisting him because I don't want to get in trouble for neglect or anything, but all of this is holding me back from furthering my own life.

I have a good job and great friends, but i keep all of my home problems to myself. They all kind of know the situation and are amazing at helping my well being, but I just don't know what to do with my father. I think he's losing his brain from drinking his whole life and it's really hard to watch. If he is getting dementia or something, I will have to live here and take care of him to the end and I really can't do that. He has always been there for me, but I just can't take care of someone who chose to ruin their mind and body with alcohol their whole life while their wife, kids, coworkers, family, and friends have all pleaded him to get sober. 

I am sorry for anybody reading this as it's just all over the place. I don't really know what I'm asking for but I just need advice because I'm losing my mind and having breakdowns every day. I have had so many therapists and social workers the last three years and they just do not help me so please don't ask me to get one. Any other advise is very much appreciated as I feel like running away like my sister did and just forget about everything, but i know things would just get worse for him.",13Nov2019,1
25,"So Im asking this centered around what I’m about to describe, but general tips are appreciated too. Thx for taking your time to help :).

I can’t seem to really get myself in the nice state of mind and relax often. I all just stiff, sharp, nervous... even when I’m at home, playing video games and listening to music it’s not relax and chill. Can’t get to the state. I rarely get to it and I enjoy that state hell of a lot. I’m happier, more open and relaxed. 

Why I want to change this is, that I have currently crush on this girl and when I’m completely relaxed and chilled out we click great. Problem? I can’t get myself to that state, and a lot of times I just fuck up, because I feel under pressure all the time. Sure, I loosen up a lot after a drink or two, but I can’t drink all the time and everywhere. And as a bonus, I don’t like being drunk that much... 

So what are your tips? I would love to get in this state as often as I can and stay that way. It helps my mental health a ton.

Thx for your tips people. Appreciate it &lt;3!",13Nov2019,1
26,So for past 3-4 months I've been having wheezing whistling cough that makes it hard to breathe especially after sports that have a lot of cardio. My physician thought it was allergies at first but after taking the medicine for 3 months I still wheeze and cough after exercise and sometimes just randomly and it's hard to breathe. I told my parents it might be more serious than allergies like asthma or exercise induced asthma and they won't listen and think its fine. Idk what do because it's about to be 5 months of this constant wheezing coughing that im pretty sure now might be asthma but my parents just gobbling antibiotics is enough even though after 3 months theres no change. Any advice on what to do?,13Nov2019,1
27,"So I’ve recently restarted my first year at university on a different course (because I didn’t like the course last year and I basically failed first year) but I feel like nothing has changed this year, and if anything I’m failing worse than last year:( I also live in a house with people who I thought were my friends but it turns out they hate me. I’m miserable at uni but I’m scared if I drop out now and move back home I’ll never get degree. I know it’s possible to get a good job without a degree but I’ve always seen myself as the academic type and I’m disappointed in myself that I can’t even handle first year.

33,"My two best friends have basically third wheeled me.

Allow me to provide a bit of background. One friend, who we’ll call A, has been friends with me for five years (since we were in 7th grade). She and I texted for hours on end on most days. We’ve become pretty close in those 5 years, and I consider her to be one of my two best friends. The other friend, who we’ll call B, has been my (best) friend for three years. I consider myself and him to be closer than I am with A, although recently things have changed. We’re all in marching band, which is where we do most of our interaction because myself and A go to a separate school for six out of seven periods during the day, and B is also in the grade above us.

I first noticed that they liked each other while we were cleaning up after finishing an annual marching band competition that our high school hosts. They were acting oddly close, almost like they were a couple. I made a comment about it, and for a while we joked around about it. B promised me that night that if they liked each other or if they started dating, that I, as their best friend, would be the first to know. Soon after, the two became even closer, almost to the point where they were attached at the hip. I tried to convince myself that there wasn’t anything there. I believed that if I ignored what was so obvious to me (and everyone else, as I would later discover), then maybe their feelings for each other would go away and then we could get back to me not feeling like a third wheel all the time.

Around three weeks ago, A, B, and myself went to the county fair. We decided to go on the Ferris wheel, but as we got closer to the front of the line, we realized that it was a two-person ride. They chose to ride with each other, leaving me to ride by myself. Needless to say, I was a little but upset about this, but I tried not to let that show. This wasn’t the first time that I had been left out by them, and it would not be the last, either.

Three days later, I confronted A about the whole thing. She admitted to me that she “instinctively” grabbed B’s hand while they were on the Ferris wheel, and that neither of them had really admitted that to each other or discussed it. We kept talking, and eventually she realized that she did, in fact, like B. Soon after, she promised me that they wouldn’t drift away from me or not include me whenever we hung out together because I was afraid of that happening. She assured me that things would stay the same. She’d still text me all the time, and they’d both want to hang out with me still.

About two weeks ago, A comes to me with this story: A finally admitted to B that she likes him. At first, B laughed it off, but then he told her that he liked her as well, and that he was waiting for marching season to end before he told me or her. I told A that I would try to be supportive of this revelation, and I’ve been trying my best, despite what this post may lead you to believe. I haven’t vocalized my dislike for their relationship to anyone but one person that I know for a fact that I can trust to keep that a secret.

It took three more days for B to admit to me that he likes A, despite his prior promise that “I would be the first to know.” And he only told me because A prompted him to. I understand that maybe he just wasn’t ready to tell me, but I find that hard to believe considering how readily he admits more tightly-held secrets to me. Afterwards, he too promised that they wouldn’t drift away or purposefully not include me when we hang out.

Since they admitted to each other that they like each other, they’ve begun to include me less and less than they previously did. Conversations in the bleachers at football games have turned from A, B, and Venteuxx to A and B conservations with me jumping in whenever I see the opportunity, because otherwise I’d have no one else to talk to. Whenever we go to restaurants together, the same thing happens. I know they aren’t doing it intentionally, but it still hurts to see. On top of that, they’ve both stopped texting me except for when they need something from me (e.g. homework help) or when the other hasn’t responded in a while. As of right now, I haven’t texted A in six days, and I haven’t texted B in three days. They hardly talk to me anymore, either. I have to drive to my “home” high school from the school I go to every day, and I have about a 30 minute period to do so.  I’ve been trying to get there earlier and earlier every day so I can actually talk to them for more than a minute every day, but they seem to leave earlier each day, as well. They both don’t have a 7th period, and A’s 6th period is at our home high school. As a result, I haven’t been able to talk to them in person for days.

They keep inviting me to go places with them, though. And every time, I feel like a third wheel. Like I’m just there because otherwise A’s mom wouldn’t let her go places with just B because A’s mom is afraid of what the two might do alone with each other. Of course, her mother doesn’t know about the fact that they like each other. Did I forget to mention that they’re not officially a couple yet?

I don’t want to bring this back up again with them, though. I feel like I’ve brought it up enough. But the whole situation has taken quite a toll on my mental health, and I’m beginning to wonder if I did something wrong to make them upset with me. It’s caused me to think that maybe they don’t want to be friends anymore, or maybe they only continue to speak to me in person out of obligation or because I’m the first person to say hi.

So I need advice about what I should do. I don’t want to stop being friends with them because they’re easily the best friends I’ve ever had, but I also don’t want to put any more time into a friendship that’s dwindling. Perhaps I’m just being overdramatic, and if so feel free to tell me that.",13Nov2019,1
34,"Alright, this might be a bit too much information here but fuck it it’s a throwaway account. 

TL;DR 
There’s a contest with a pornstar to win a cam session and a, shall we say, rumoured not cam session with her. It’s $100 to enter. I’m really considering paying. Is this a bad idea?

For the rest of you-

I’m recently out of hospital with a long recovery time ahead so moral’s a bit low. And with that, I’ve been finding myself paying for porn a lot more of late so I’ve cut down on that to a near zero. But with this new contest I don’t know I can’t get it out of my head.

Like I know I seem like a loser for having this stick with me so much but here we are. Just some extra details for context I’ve got money stored up so while I’m not currently working and 100 is nothing to sneeze at it’s not life changing for me right now. The contest is about a 200 to 1 chance and upon entry you do also get some videos as a bonus. Also I’m a virgin irl (no prizes for guessing that). 

Sorry if this is too much for this sub. I think I just want to put this out there so I don’t have to think about it as much. Really thanks for reading it though. Hope you’ve a good night.",13Nov2019,1

37,"I just started my first semester of college this year and I not being able to sit down, focus, and do my work has started to affect my grades. I've truly always had this problem since I was a little kid and my parents know it, I have so much difficulty sitting down and doing my homework. Every teacher I've had in K - 12 knows this because I do amazing on my tests, quizzes, and class work, but when it comes to homework, well I just can't do it. It not a problem of procrastination, I've set time apart everyday to do my work and I sit down wanting to do it but I can't bring myself to. It's extremely frustrating because I know I have to do it or my grade will suffer and I know I know the material and what to put on the paper but I just don't do it. I'm not bored by the subject matter, it just ... happens. This happens in all my classes, the ones I'm super interested in and the ones I'm not.

 In school I can mostly focus on what I'm doing. If I wanted to, I could sit down and read a chapter a head in the material because if I found fairly interesting. But at home I can't study or do my work, seriously, even if it's in a quiet room by myself. Ive tried every place in my house at every time of the day I'm there and at the park and at my local and college library

I've held off on going to the doctor for a while because ... well, it wasn't something I'm proud of to admit, I guess. That and I feel like they wont believe me. They probably will think I'm lying so I can get some adderall to pass my finals so they wont give me anything. I would've tried to get them sooner but I barely learned about it about a year ago and I was managing my last year at highschool pretty fine by doing all my work for a class in the class before it. That and they didn't assign much work. But know Im taking 5 classes this semester and I seriously need help. Is this the right course of action?",13Nov2019,1
38,"I'm 20 and my brother (we'll call him Alex) is 18. He's my favorite person in the world, and I admit I can get protective of him. Our parents divorced when he was 16, after which my dad moved to Michigan to live with his side of the family.

My dad's side can be fun, but I get nervous around them sometimes because a lot of them still party like teenagers and use alcohol as a coping mechanism. Because we grew up around this, both Alex and I have hesitant, restrained relationships with alcohol. I drink like once a month, and my brother hasn't drank at all. My dad knows this.

I'm working one night when I get a text from Alex that he needs to vent. He went to visit my dad, and during that visit he, my dad, and my grandpa went to a kids party with other members of the family. Before long people started drinking, and the rest of the night unfolded. My dad offered to let Alex drink, and he refused. I guess a grown ass drunk woman tried to have sex with my brother, my dad and grandpa got wasted and Alex drove them home. He helped my grandad to bed, and my dad ""jokingly"" tried to choke him out. My even younger cousin had to stop him. 

I was furious. I found it extremely disrespectful and selfish that my dad would leave my brother behind at a party like that, when he knows that's not Alex's idea of a good time at all, and when my brother still looks to him for guidance. I get that guys horse around with each other, but the choking crossed a line for me. I told my dad as much, and at first he tried to completely ignore me. When I brought it up again after he tried pretending like nothing happened, he got really defensive and blew me off, saying that he didn't have to apologize to me and that it wasn't a big deal. He asked when I started acting like my mom and said that he missed when I was his friend.

It all felt really manipulative. I told him that I didn't appreciate his influence over our lives and basically that we shouldn't talk until it changes.

I get that he sees my brother as an adult man and a friend, so it shouldn't be a big deal. But I think that Alex is still a teenager, and his actions were irresponsible and inexcusable.",13Nov2019,1

41,"I tried posting this elsewhere but it got deleted.

Just wanting some advice of what to do. My fiance and I got engaged in the summer and I've realized over the years he has some anger issues. We've dealt with mild abuse throughout our relationship. Nothing physical but more emotional and verbal. He is very respectable most of the time.

I'm outspoken with my opinions and he asks for my opinions regularly. However, if I am feeling down or a bit snippy, he sometimes calls me a bitch or cunt for being rude when talking to him when he feels I am attacking him. He tends to be domineering and I've learned ways to cope and ask him to tone down. I've learned to give him space because there is no reason to talk to a frustrated angry man. We are both not afraid to talk things out so I'm wondering what would help us more. Therapy? Counseling? Nothing very abusive has happened and he knows I will leave him if that happens. I think he has mild bipolar but it is difficult to know. I just love him very much and just want him to be better.",13Nov2019,1

We still have a lot to discuss between us but happy anniversary, I care about you and love you""

I woke up late in day and saw the text and didn't know what to say so I simply replied with ""i cant really mirror a essay response equivalent of what you wrote but i love you 2, happy 2nd year.""

58,"I've always felt like I've had a calling to the military and intelligence services. I'm sure it may seem trite or misguided to many, but service and sacrifice in the name of my country is something that I feel resonates on a very basic level with me. To the point it's an inextricable part of my personhood. 

However, my parents and my wider family are more or less against it, which I understand and respect. Their objection is less of a moral qualm and more of a practical one. They just really don't want to see me get hurt, which they've voiced explicitly at different times. I think that it worries them that because I'm a small, slight female, I may get into a situation that I can't control or get out of. (Which I understand, but I've done and been in far more obviously dangerous situations while working on the family business, so I feel unfortunately they've conditioned me to be accustomed to physically dangerous situations anyway.) 

Being around my family is important to me; after a couple decades of working the family business, my parents have just retired and we're finally doing the things as a family we didn't get to do when I was a child. We were all working on the family business and that didn't give us time to be a family. Small trips, family time, enjoying each others' company. It's just been really nice, and I also know that a job in military or intelligence services would lessen the time I have with them.

Their approval and happiness means a lot to me, and so far I've satisficed my need to do something meaningful by getting a PhD, getting published in academia, learning languages, and so on. But that bone deep calling to service remains. Being a researcher is interesting, but it doesn't call to me the way service does. I spent most of my time in undergrad shaping myself to be fit for that kind of job, and a good portion of my Masters degree as well. 

I'm approaching the age where joining any kind of service is going to be limited, and I'm getting the sense that if I don't do it now or soon, I'll always regret never having done it.

I don't know how to reconcile the love for my family with the need to serve. I hear a lot from people ""oh there's lots of ways to serve"", and I tried going that route with my academic research, and it just doesn't quite address calling to be the kind of person who I want to be. 

How did you all weigh these kinds of situations?",13Nov2019,1
59,"I had an insanely difficult job. I was left largely alone to launch something quite important to a company, working 12-14 hour days, with a boss who was a terrible manager, very critical and no real support. I was extremely successful with regard to fulfilling my goals and achieved everything they asked and more - but felt unhappy and unsupported. I got a new offer that would have made a huge impact to my wl balance and took it; after serving out 6 weeks notice. My boss was disappointed but did not try to retain me and since then has gone silent. The new job did not work out at all as advertised and turned out to be a huge mistake and I've since been unemployed for 5 months. I have no idea how my old boss feels about me (I was also confused when I worked for him about how he felt) but am guessing anything from 'has forgotten who I am' to 'indifferent' to 'eh' given I left. I'm considering just swallowing all my pride, eating all the sh\*t and straight up asking if there is a role there for me.

I have a problem being any kind of fake with people. When I worked fast food I had no problem being nice to customers in my role as a taco slinger, because it was my job to smile and let them shit on me, but if someone talks to me at the grocery store or something I'll just nod and smile or say something like ""yeah, totally."" I never saw a problem with it because these are random people I won't see again. I'm not mean or rude but I don't see why I would put in the extra effort to be friendly when A) I'm not good at it and B) it doesn't matter.  
  
Today my best friend asked me what to reply to her boss's text. I said ""Okay, thank you."" She said ""omg I can't say that you're like autistic"" and then sent a reply that was basically k thx but with an lol and some extra words and got another reply back and said ""see this is why you say more than okay thanks"" but the reply had 0 additional information and just necessitated another reply to end the conversation.
  
Also today, my boyfriend said it was embarrassing when we went out to eat and the waitress/waiter would be friendly and I wouldn't make small talk back because it's rude. I was a waitress and I never actually wanted to know about people's day. I'm not mean to them, I say please and thank you and smile, but I have nothing more to say to them than that. I don't want to tell them about my day or anything about my life, I just want food.  
  
Basically everyone I know except my friend who has actual autism thinks I need to be more outgoing. I've always had friends, I played sports in school, and I've always gotten along with my coworkers whether they be lawyers, heroin addicts, or teenagers, whatever. I'm just not outgoing and it doesn't occur to me to put a lot of effort into making random small talk with people I don't have any connection to. Apparently this is a problem and making meaningless small talk is a very important life skill.

When I was younger, my home environment was extremely chaotic and violent. My father was very abusive and my bipolar brother was constantly having rage outbursts that often resulted in me getting hurt. My mom NEVER made an effort to do ANYTHING about it. I became depressed when I was in middle school and became suicidal not long after and she had me hospitalized for it (I've spent nearly six months in various psychiatric facilities). She thinks my depression is just a character flaw and not the result of her abuse and neglect as a mother. 

Now, I have crippling self-esteem issues because my mother has made me feel like the most worthless piece of shit in the world. She has made very clear that she doesn't care about me or my feelings. I truly believe that cutting her out of my life is what's best for me, but I can't help but feel like it would be immoral. Despite her emotional neglect, she has been very financially supportive of me (although she once said in front of my therapist that she does this to try to make up for the things she does wrong). A part of me just feels like it would be wrong after the financial support she's provided for me. I really don't know what to do. I want to be happy and healthy, but I also want to be a good person.

66,I moved into my apartment approximately a year ago today for a new job right out of college.  I figured i'd stay at the job for a year or two.  I subleased a 2b2b place which i got for a really good deal and figured id bring a coworker in.  One of my coworkers moved in shortly later.  I renewed the lease with them in March.  I got let go in May as i would not give up my morals for the job.  They did some pretty unethical things and i could not deal with them anymore.  I worked during the summer and decided to go back to school.  I'm attending a campus an hour away from my apartment.  I initially planned on moving out in September but opted to stay as my roommates were not in the best financial place.  I have barely spent any time there in the last few months and just decided yesterday that it was best to move on.  Spending almost a grand a month was not worth it anymore.  My roommates both have steady jobs now and all is well.  I let them know my intentions and they said they would take over the lease.  I pay half the rent for the smaller room and climate controlled parking space.  We had 4 months left on the lease.  When i moved in i paid half the months rent as a security deposit and they did not have to pay anything as they moved in after the fact.  They paid me half the security deposit after i brought it up (liability reasons).  I have taken really good care of the place and we will get our full deposit back.  Should i just not mention anything and see if they return my half of the deposit or just let them have it?  I am not sure of how this works.,13Nov2019,1
67,"So I’ve dated my wife for almost 9 years, been married for 3, we have a 1+y/o child. Ever since the birth of the baby, I’ve been slightly anxious and found parts of normal life to be difficult. As a result, I started taking some anxiety meds. 

At the same time, our sex life started going drastically downhill. At first, I blamed it on the meds, but even after trying like 4 different types, I’m still having the same problem. I can get aroused, but cannot orgasm during sex with her. She will often finish &amp; I’ll pump away; hoping, but ultimately giving up. 

As a terrible husband, I started looking elsewhere. I met a woman I was attracted to, talked with her for around a month, then we finally met &amp; fucked like rabbits. So I know it’s not necessarily the meds keeping me from orgasm.

In college I’m taking Japanese 3 (took two semesters before taking a full load) Biology for non-science majors, college math and of course English composition 1 and I’m doing well in pretty much all of my classes except English comp.

To pass the class I need to take the departmental exam which I need at least a D for but I don’t get credit unless I get a C, currently my grad is a D and today I got back an essay which depending on the grade I was gonna either stay or withdraw, but when I got it back it didn’t have a grade and the prof wrote ‘see me in my office’ as far as I can tell she just wants to clarify something before she grades it or maybe not, honestly I’m not sure anymore, there was only one glaring problem on the paper and a few minor ones.

I’ve discussed with my parents and admitted I dropped the ball in a lot of places, but now thinking about it I’m debating dropping the class no matter what my grade is.

I’m taking a full load at college plus an outside class and while I technically have the time I don’t have the mental energy to handle all of them and I’m worried that as finals approach the workload will become too much and either everything will give or English comp will give and Ill get a failing grade.

I’m wondering if it’s better to just withdraw now instead of doing poorly later like I’m pretty sure I will, I don’t know how much more of the stress I can take from this class (anxiety doesn’t like being helpful) but I’m worried that I’m just taking the easy way out and I should be putting in more effort, I just don’t feel capable of putting in that effort without losing my mind.

78,"My boyfriend is a TA( Teachers assistant) for two classes in his college of the university we both attend. Occasionally, I will go with his during his office hours and study while he helps other students. His office hours are in a work lab area with tables and computers. 

Today during his office hours we were sitting at a table when a younger professor (mid thirties) approached a sophomore girl sitting next to me who had a question regarding homework. It was a professor my boyfriend knew fairly well as he was his TA last semster. About 5 minutes into him helping her I heard him say and I quote ""I hope you don't think this is inappropriate or anything, but I've noticed when you laugh your dimples really come out and its the cutest thing"". She was kind of thrown off because she didn't really have much to say other than "" oh uh thank you"" and dropped the compliment. After that he talked for about a minute about his personal life and dropped some comment about his wife. She packed up her stuff and went to the other side of the room to study with a friend. 

Long story short I was absolutely shocked to here this and haven't been able to get it out of my mind. I mentioned it to my boyfriend later and he said he was shocked too especially since ""its his job on the line"" but didn't have much to say other than that.

Bottom line: The comment really bothered me and I feel like maybe I should say something to the school about what I heard. If he is saying this to students in a crowded room, what is he saying to them in private?

At the same time he is not my professor and those comments were not directed at me personally. I feel I don't necessarily have a right to report him. I also do not know the girls name and am not sure she would want her business being spread.

81,"I'm a female, 29 years old. When I was four, two huge events happened in my life: my mother got diagnosed with breast cancer, and my younger sister was born. Within maybe 6 months I developed an intense sibling rivalry, the reasoning behind which I cannot remember, but needless to say I started to become violent with my baby sister, trying to hit and push her. One day I admitted that I wasn't sure if I would be able to control myself from taking her and throwing her off the upstairs balcony (I have no memory of this but my aunt told me about it). As a result my parents put me in a psychiatric hospital for a while when I was five (I don't remember the time frame but I'm guessing it was maybe a week), and I was absolutely terrified. I thought they were abandoning me and trying their life out without me to see if it was better. I believe I stopped the violent behavior towards my sister after that, probably out of fear of being hospitalized again, but the trauma from that hospitalization stayed with me, and I think I decided I needed to bottle things up inside me and that apparently I was a bad child, a bad person.  


My mom's cancer got worse, metastasized, spread throughout her body and into her brain. Thirteen months after her diagnosis, she died, just a few weeks after I turned six. I remember many hospital visits, seeing my mom barely understanding who anyone was or where she was, watching her physical and mental state degrade. One day at home her hair started falling out in clumps from the chemo and she asked me to help her remove her head hair. I said yes, and did it with her, but the whole time I also felt somewhere deep inside that this was scary and upsetting, but it was my mom, and she was asking me to do something (She had a traumatic brain injury before I was born and it affected her reasoning, I believe that is the only reason she would have done such a thing), so I did it. My aunt also told me about a time where my mom, aunt, dad, myself, and doctors were in a hospital and my mom was talking to me about her cancer and the chemo and how it would affect her and I went and hid under a chair and covered my ears and told everyone in the room I wouldn't come out until we stopped talking about it.  


Losing my mom was devastating, obviously. I remember the moment my dad told me she died, especially vividly remember the numbness, emptiness, and bit of dissociation that spread over me, a little six-year-old girl, once I heard the news, as well as at her funeral. I did know deep down that she had a high chance of dying because of the cancer, but it was still soul-shattering when it happened. I felt extremely alone, permanently different from all of my peers and pretty much anyone I'd ever met, and just... scared. Scared and alone. My dad was going through his grief and he's never been cold or unloving but I think he just didn't know how to process it all either, and I feel like I sort of pushed most of the grief processing aside.  


Here's the part that will be upsetting to people, but I want to be honest as possible and give details, so proceed with caution if you are sensitive.

At about seven years old I started pulling the wings off of small skipper butterflies I would catch in my backyard. I then started pulling their heads off. I would watch and be fascinated by it. I think I was fascinated by death, trying to understand it. It made me feel gross and very bad, but also gave me some sort of release and part of me was just curious about what would happen. Then I sadly moved on to the litter of kittens that one of our cats just had. I would pick the maybe week-old kittens up and hold them a few feet in the air and then drop them onto the carpet. I did it repeatedly until one of them slowly died over days because of internal injuries. I felt HORRIBLE when it died. I admitted to my dad, sobbing, that I did it and it was my fault the kitten died. I know I got put into some sort of therapy for this, but obviously it did not help, because I continued doing this for another couple of years. There was apparently a rabbit that I killed that I don't remember hurting at all (my aunt told me about it many years later), there was also another older kitten I suffocated by cutting a slit in small rubber ball then putting the ball over the kitten's head, leaving it there for minutes watching the kitten squirm and trying to get it off, then pulling the ball off and seeing the kitten out of breath and panting. I know that kitten died but I can't remember what the exact cause was. Finally, this is different but also I feel related so I will include it: my dad made friends with a couple of parents down the street and their kids and myself would have play dates. One of their kids was a three-year-old girl, and one day when I was about 9 years old, the urge came over me to just tell her that her mother had died. No-one else heard me say this to her. She got scared and upset and denied it and I just told her ""yes, it's true, she died"". I remember some sort of feeling of satisfaction knowing she was hurting the way I was hurting. I feel like shit for that, too, obviously.  


At the same time I was doing this, I was also genuinely (and still am) a huge animal-lover. I always have loved animals. I loved our multiple cats and dog we had at the time, I had ""my own"" cat when I was nine, I was crazy about cuddling with her every day after school and treated her like she was my baby. I was a good kid in school, followed rules, never wanted to get in trouble, never really ever got in trouble (not until 8th grade and that was because of poor grades and absences because of depression). I've always thought of myself as highly sensitive, caring, and compassionate. By the time I was a teenager the self-disgust I had was through the roof and much of it focused on what I did to those animals and I guess also what I said to that girl.  


So, I'm 29 now, have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety (diagnosed at 13), and borderline personality disorder (diagnosed this year). I have made some improvements in living with these conditions but sometimes the self-hatred really kicks in and those things I did as a child are always one of the main things my brain pulverizes me over. Please understand I would NEVER, EVER hurt any animal or person. I love helping animals and helping people. I adore my pets and turn into complete baby-talking nonsense whenever I interact with an animal like a cat, dog, bird, heck even snakes and lizards! I went to school for wildlife conservation and management and am looking for work with animals.  


I can't shake the thought that I'm somehow evil or bad because of what I did, even if I wouldn't do it anymore. I can't shake the thought that everyone in the world will think I'm a monster if they knew what I did. I can't seem to get it to sink in that I was a little girl that was traumatized, lost, terrified, and felt alone from a very early age and didn't know how to cope or find help or manage my emotions. So, if you've read this and if anyone has any idea how to get myself to forgive myself and understand myself, I'd love to hear it. Or maybe I actually am a monster and shouldn't be forgiven at all? I don't know anymore.

90,"Hi um i'm 13 and I was diagnosed with an optical glioma a bit ago. The only people in my school who know are my best friends. I like one of my distant-ish friends (she knows I have it) I have no confidence in myself because I have very thin hair because of the chemo and I  have been bullied by people because of it. Earlier in the year I felt like crap because of chemo was in its most intense part (I'm on a 3 week break right now before chemo is back) and I also have a specific 504.

I am kinda depressed because she is into popular guys who are athletic and I can't do a lap without collapsing for breath.

Also the thinning hair keeps me from talking to her because people sometimes look at my hair when I am talking to them. I feel like even though she says she's sorry this happened to me she thing I look disgusting (Btw I didn't tell her i have cancer someone else did)",13Nov2019,1

93,"To make a long story short, I had a very painful falling out with my best friends 6 months ago. It was a very unhealthy group, and we lived together for a few years. It wasn’t until I got engaged that I saw many things that were hurtful in these friendships. I tried to bring them up, but nothing ever came of the conversations. They were often turned back on me, and I was accused of being defensive any time I tried to stand up for myself. Like any relationship, there were there that were my fault, but I owned up to them and did my best to be better. They on the other hand, never took any responsibility along the way. 

After a lot of confusion, asking myself if it was my fault, and a good amount of therapy, I decided to distance myself from them unless/until something changed. However, there was no hard break. No conversation saying, “I can’t be friends with you anymore”. We just haven’t spoken. I wish I had the courage and tools to have that conversation then, for I think it would have saved me much anxiety in the present. However, I simply didn’t know how. I felt confused and manipulated. I’ve dealt with a lot of loneliness, anxiety, and guilt over the past few months as I’ve processed, but feel SO much more free and like myself away from them.

Tonight, one of the girls just texted me saying, “Hi! I miss you!” 

While I by no means hate her, and am on the road to forgiveness, I have no intention of rekindling this friendship at present. I want to be kind while sticking to what I know is good for my wellbeing.

98,"Hey all, I'm hoping someone can help me think through which option would be better out of two job offers I received. To give everyone some background...

I'm currently halfway through an accelerated degree program to obtain my bachelor's in accounting. I was *strongly* urged by a former professor to pursue accounting as a career and do find it genuinely interesting. My work history is mainly sales and project management in the pharmaceutical industry. I left pharma a year ago for a PM role in another industry because I wasn't sure how much time I would need to dedicate to school. I've gotten into a really good rhythm with it now so I feel comfortable jumping into a new company. I realize now that I'm not a good fit for my current company. I haven't been able to connect with any of my coworkers like I did at my old job. That's not the main reason I'm leaving, but certainly one of the reasons. From what I've gathered over the last year, the PM work I was doing at my old job wasn't really ""true"" project management, just heavily related to it. I started applying to accounting and PM positions to see what was out there. Over the last week I received 2 job offers that I'm having a really hard time deciding between. Both companies are really interested in hiring me and have made awesome offers which I'm extremely grateful for, but having to choose between them is killing me!

Job option 1 - entry level accounting position. I was able to negotiate a higher salary than what they originally offered, but it's still a pretty decent pay cut from what I'm making now. I was preparing myself for this by applying for an entry level role, but seeing it in writing made me realize how much different the pay would be. This position would start my accounting career off so I can at least start gaining some experience if I decide this company isn't right for me long-term. It's not much further than my current job, their reporting hours are reasonable/flexible, and while the health benefits aren't the best, they're something. The company is public and is a merger between 2 giant companies that have been around for decades. It seems like a relaxed atmosphere and the hiring managers assured me the job would be easy to pick up. The people in upper management are a little older, but it seems like they're relaxed, and there are some people my age there.

Job option 2 - project management position in pharma. This is more related to my past work history and the same kind of PM work I was used to doing. I used to feel really fulfilled doing PM/pharma work so this would be a bit of nostalgia for me and the pay is comparable to my current job. It would be about 20 minutes longer of a drive than my current 15 min commute minimum depending on traffic. The health benefits are pricey but the other benefits are awesome - loads of PTO, WFH, super casual dress code, etc. This is a private company that's been around for a little over a decade but has been growing consistently the whole time. The entire workforce seems a little younger which is nice, and through my interviews it seemed like everyone there was pretty chill and understanding. I know a drawback with pharma is that everything is fast-paced so I would need to work at maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

TL;DR HALP! Should I take the job that's lower pay, meh benefits, and closer to home that's related to my education, or one that I've done historically, for no change in pay, awesome benefits, and a slightly longer commute?",13Nov2019,1

He is chronically depressed. I've tried to support him with finding therapists and medications. He is not super dedicated to either. When he is on antidepressants, he is MUCH better. When off, he is next to intolerable. I do not mean to sound insensitive. It's just that it's been a few rounds of quitting and I am feeling very run down. I'm honestly tempted to have an affair. I love my husband, deeply. But when he isn't healthy, which is often. He doesn't love me back. He says terribly demeaning things to me and withholds affection. 

Last time he quit his antidepressants (he felt they caused anxiety). He called me an ""empty vessle waiting for him to fill me up."" He said that I ""didn't deserve his attention,"" and me ""bothering"" him made him ""not want me more."" I am scared as he's recently quit his medication again (citing insomnia and anxiety). I begged him not to. I recognize that insomnia and anxiety are real issues. I felt that it would be best to taper off and taper on to something else at the same time. 

We have children and a home together. I do love him. I also feel like this is not a juncture in our lives where we can part ways (extenuating circumstances with kids and finances). I have tried SO hard to get through to him. I have tried talking. I don't know what to do. I exercise, I go to therapy for myself. I feel like I need medication just to deal with his coldness.

My father essentially doesn't talk to me if we aren't in the same room and this has been the case since my brother was diagnosed. People (friends and husband) say it's because he had to focus on helping my brother while my mom helped me (though my mom does lots of things for my brother). He never texts me or calls me except one time he thought my brother might be having a meltdown when my mom was home alone with him.

Mom wouldn't allow me to see friends outside of school because she ""didn't know what their parents and they could be bad people who could hurt me."" Then when I was in college she all of a sudden wanted me to go to live in a dorm because she never had that experience and she wanted me to have that.

110,"So this is a little long due to some needed back story. 

My family like many doesn’t always have the greatest relationships all the time. Mostly my dad and little sister, granted she and I don’t get along well because she feels intellectually superior but has no real world experience. I don’t care about her intellect I care that she has no real world experience and what you read in a book doesn’t always transfer or translate well in the real world. 

I digress, I found out back in April I was pregnant. We then found out two or three weeks later it was mono di twins. Which means they are in the same placenta but have there own sac, which is better than mono mono. I’m a high risk pregnancy due to this and am in my last week of actually being pregnant. I’m 36 weeks Friday and full term for twins is 37. To be safe they want to induce me between 36 and 37. My girls are healthy and growing. They are large twins according to my high risk doctor. They might be 7lbs a piece by the time I deliver. Right now they are both about 6.5lbs. 

I go Thursday to discuss my induction date, however in June or July my little sister got told her white coat ceremony for physician assistant school was to be November 22 at 2:30pm in downtown Atlanta at her school we are all located the greater Orlando area except her. Also this is her first semester in physicians assistant school, not her graduation. We are not sure why she is getting her white coat in her first of three years but anyway. When this was texted in our family group text I informed everyone back in June or July that my twins tentative due date was, you guessed it November 22. It was discussed that my dad would go and film it and we would watch it as a family the next week at thanksgiving dinner with everyone there. My older sister is building her house and her closing date was the 22nd as well but now she got the title company to move it to the 23rd so she and her husband are flying up and back.

My mom back in June or July told me and my older sister that my little sister would have to understand but that she would be with me at the hospital. I figured that was it. However this past month it’s been up and down as to which event my mom was planning on attending. Due to my dad pretty much saying oh she’s going to little sis’s but then when it was just her and I or her, my older sis, and me she would say she was going to be at the hospital. 

My dad and little sister have had a difficult and strenuous relationship. They are two peas in a pod but are too stubborn to admit this that they fight about everything. It’s their way or the highway so she really cut him out of her life until this past year. They speak at least once a week and it’s gotten a lot better. 

Now my dad has been pressuring my mom to go to the ceremony instead of being there when my twins are born. I need my mom, I have communicated to her that I need her and she told me she will be there. My father can’t seem to wrap his head around this and has been guilt tripping her into trying to make her go. To which she has told him repeatedly no. 

I think he thinks if she stays with me it will ruin the progress he has made with my little sister. I think he thinks my little sis will blame him for her not going because they used to fight about their decisions on what she could and couldn’t do. I don’t even know if this is what he thinks but whenever older sis and I try to bring it up he just says she is going to little sis’s event, she has too. He has been trying to get me to tell my mom to just go be with my little sis and I’ll be fine. I won’t be fine, I need her. Tonight once again after I got off the phone with her about little details regarding the birth he sent me a text again saying tell your mother to go you will be fine. 

I finally responded and told him basically I’m proud of my little sis, and I am proud of her.  But that him telling me to let her go even when I needed her made me feel as though I’m not important. That my feelings don’t matter. That I planned on asking my doctors if they can induce me by or on Monday so she can have a shot at going Thursday but that I can’t make any promises. 

I know this isn’t the end of this debate with him and it really hurts me. Idk what else to say to him other than to lose my shit and be like wtf!!!! But that will only end in a bigger fight and issues and isn’t the way to handle this as an adult. How would you go about plainly asking him what is your deal? Why are you acting like the birth of my twins aren’t important?! These are your grandchildren and for a lot of this pregnancy it feels like you don’t really care. You throw your money at me and them and while I appreciate your help and have said thank you a million times what I need is emotional support and being there for me. This isn’t going to be easy, this will be the toughest thing I ever do and why can’t you accept that and validate my feelings that you are being an asshole.

112,"So, I'm nineteen years old, and my mother still controls nearly every aspect of my life. She studied psychology and works with disabilities and disorders for a living. I have autism. Unfortunately, she controls nearly every single aspect of my life because of my need for help with independence (my biggest struggle is doing things and remembering them on my own-- but I'm beginning to suspect it's because she's never taught me how).

More recently, she's been trying to 'ground' me and threatening to take away my stuff, which would be normal for a child but this is stuff I've paid for and I am a legal adult. My partner of at least six years now is offering to let me live with them and leave this house behind.

I cannot drive. My mother never taught me how, so it's impossible for me to go out and do anything without me relying on her to take me where I need or want to be. If I ask for help from the disability center that I get help from, she will know because she works there. The last time I asked my sister for help and to let me stay with her, she called my mother and told her.

For context, my datemate lives pretty much across the country and I live in the USA.

First of all... what are some things I need to know before I go through with this? I'm planning on leaving after this semester ends in December. What sort of things should I bring? How and when do I tell her that I'm booking it? Even though she's controlling, I still love her and I still feel like she deserves to hear it from me rather than in a letter after I've already booked it...

I'm afraid I'll miss them. I'm afraid that my leaving will leave a scar, but I'm also afraid that if I stay, I won't have the desire to keep going. And more importantly, I'm terrified.

116,"* \*warning this is basically a shitty post about a few events in my life, sorry in advance \* 
* \*please don't be mean I had a mental break down before writing this and I am suffering from the post cry migraine\*           

I am (newly) 20 years old and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to be one of those annoying people who are constantly self pitying and thinking that everything that happens to them is other peoples fault, but after so much suffering and loneliness I decided why not type up “my story” and let others be the judge of it and give me whatever advice they may have. 

I grew up living in Riverside with my mom, siblings and cousins and I visited my dad and other siblings in Anaheim during the weekends. My moms house was always hectic, my grandma convinced my mom to adopt my 4 cousins who where in foster care due to their mom being a drug addict. Someone was always doing something wrong whether it be stealing money/ prescription pills from my moms purse, stealing the family van while under the influence, getting into fights with the principals son, etc. 

In 2010 my mom lost our house and married a man I never met, so we (my mom, me and my older brother) up and left California to move into his house in Washington State. Washington was a shit show for many reason, the main one being that my brother once again hung out with the wrong people but instead of smoking weed in skate parks in California, he became addicted to meth, and later on heroin. After a while we ended up moving back to CA.

Im not really sure if it was the pain of seeing her son go through addiction with the same drug that ruined her sisters life but my mom has since lost all sense of being a mother. Don’t get me wrong, she still bends over backwards for my brother; she makes sure he’s clean and always has clothes and money and she lets him do drugs in the bathroom because “at least I know he’s safe.” 

I know that it’s ridiculous for me to be in a sense, jealous of him. But I never had that. Growing up the attention was always on whoever was doing bad things, I started to resent them because it seemed as though they had no punishment for it; if one of my brothers or cousins got arrested then my mom would wake up at 4 am and pay money for lawyers and go to the ends of the earth to make sure they didn’t have to deal with the consequences. Meanwhile, I would be waiting outside of my elementary school alone because my mom never filled out the paperwork for after school program but she also never managed to pick me up before 5pm. 

Fast foward a few years, when I was 16 I moved into my sisters house in Arizona because she needed a babysitter while she had class and I couldn’t stand being around my mom anymore. One time my mom found out I had drank one of her bottles of wine with a friend and planned to stage it as though we had knocked it over on accident but my mom was getting my texts sent to her phone and next time she saw me she slapped me a few times and yelled at me for hours until I cried. After living with my sister for a while my mom made me come back home, I don’t remember the reason why but one day she just showed up and said that living there wasn’t doing me any good and that I should go back to California with her. 

After living with her for a while, my mom decided to up and leave (again) to Northern California and I was in the middle of the semester so she convinced my oldest brother to let me stay with him as long as I pay for my own shit and clean up after myself. A week before the semester was supposed to end I got a call from my brother letting me know that my sister from my dads side, the person I would call every single time my mom kicked me out of the house or hit me or made me feel like shit, died in a motorcycle accident. The most ironic thing is that my sister was the only person in my family that made me feel proud and hopeful in a way. Our father came here from Cuba when he was 15 and her mother had killed herself when she was 4 but she achieved so much in her short life. She did incredible in high school and ran track all while managing 2 part time jobs in order to pay for everything she needed to make our dads life easier. She was accepted into UCLA and graduated in 2015 with a degree in statistics, and she died in 2017 at 26 years old on her way home from work. 

Ever since the death of my sister, I feel like any hope or excitement I had disappeared. I don’t know what I should do and I don’t know what I want to do. Every relationship that I have with my family is so entirely toxic and whenever I try to share these feelings with someone from my family all they do is call me an ingrate. 

After the death of my sister I did struggle with mental health. I was severely depressed and self depreciating, I was living with my oldest sister for free in return for getting my nieces up and ready for school, doing chores, etc. Until one day I had work the night before until 10:30 pm and I had to wake up at 5 to get my nieces ready for school. I ended up texting her that I agreed to get them ready for school 3 times a week not 5 and she just messaged me to get the eff out of her house and I did even though I was in the middle of my school semester. I understand that she’s not my mom and she doesn’t owe me anything, in fact I owe her for allowing me to stay at her house when I had no where else to go. However, I was, and still am young; I have and will continue to make mistakes and it didn't help that at the time I was severely depressed and sooooo tired from feeling like nobody wanted me around; to this day my sister is always bringing up that she tried to help me but I just wanted to be an ingrate and no matter how I word it she doesn’t understand that yeah having somewhere to live is something I will eternally be grateful for but life is so much harder when I had her holding me living with her over my head the entire time. 

My oldest sister is weird, like I know she wants me to live a good life and not be a loser but she constantly belittles me when she’s giving advice to the point where I get super discouraged from doing anything really. She’s always saying stuff like “how does it feel that you are 20 years old and working in retail while your 19 year old nephew is in school for nursing” and how everything wrong in my life is because I’m an ingrate and couldn’t see that living with her was the best chance I had at becoming successful.

After my oldest sister kicked me out, I didn’t really have anywhere else to go and my other sister was just moving from Arizona back to California. After living with her for about 2 months, she convinced me to quit my job to babysit her (now) 2 kids. This ended up being a shit show because I was lending HER money while I babysat 6 hours a day for free, after a while I just left because I couldn’t deal with her making me feel like shit + constantly owing me money so she could go to the casino + having me babysit for hours every damn day.

So now I am kinda living with my mom except she’s up north again for a different job, I told her I didn’t want to move there because she’s just gonna quit in a few months and move down here again, to which she told me good luck and to fuck off. I told my oldest sister how I only have $40 in my bank account because my mom owes me $3,000 and my other sister owes me $800 and my brother owes me $400 (after my sister died she left me all her money + the insurance money so I became the family bank I guess) and all she told me was that she told me so and then went on a rant to say how ungrateful I am (again) that I had it good at her house but I thought I knew better and how I hand out money to everyone but the person helping her. 

Thats my story. Kinda. Im sure I left out a shit ton of information.

So my current situation is I am 20 years old with no job because I had to quit my last one after my mom moved up north because I had no where to live and now I don’t even have any money to survive off of until I get a new job. I don’t know where I am going to live really and I really wish I had a therapist.",13Nov2019,1

I know I did have trouble with loud noises as a kid, but I thought it was because something was wrong with my ear and that age/surgery fixed it. the autism does explain why I always talk about the same kinds of things. it also explains how when I get into something, I really get into it and it explains why I've never gotten a girlfriend.

119,"I have a friend who meant everything to me growing up and into adulthood. She is one of the few people who really understands me and can offer great advice using insight about my life. Most of the time I don't even understand my own damn self. I really can't imagine life without her. The thought of living without her is like living without a limb. Anyway, now that we're grown up and live far apart, I'm the only one who has been attempting to keep our friendship alive over the years. I've gotten the vibe that she doesn't want to be friends, so I've told her more than once that if she's grown apart and doesn't want to be friends anymore, I'll understand, but I'm very confused because her actions and words aren't adding up (and I'm not good at reading people, social cues, etc) and if this isn't what she wants then she needs to not waste my time or her time. She's always responded that she does of course want to be friends and that the situations in the past weren't what they seemed. 

Maybe I should have given up long ago, but like I said I can't imagine life without her, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions. So the most recent time I saw her, things went really well. She said she had been worried about seeing me because it had been so long, but things were just like old times and we need to see each other more. I again brought up that I'm still not sure if she actually wants to be friends, and she needs to tell me the truth, because otherwise it's going to really fuck me up mentally if she just pretends to be my friend. She said she wouldn't do that and it wouldn't be fair to either of us to do that, and I mean so much to her, etc. This didn't seem fake at all to me. It seemed very genuine. It seemed even more genuine to me because she wasn't giving short answers like ""Yeah of course I want to be friends."" Rather it was deeper sentiments that she didn't have to say if she didn't mean them. Anyway, she promised she would be better about keeping in touch, and she was for a bit, but then I put the ball in her court to see if she would reach out to me at all. It's been over half a year and she still hasn't written back. I'm done asking if she wants to still keep in touch and trying to keep the friendship going. I've had enough. However, I'm a step away from a nervous breakdown partially because of a toxic job/depression but I think mainly because of this situation. The thought someone so important to me could claim I am still really important to her after me asking for the truth and then apparently that's just a lie... it's really fucking me up. I'm not actively thinking about it, but it's in the back of my mind and so many things I see and hear every day remind me of her. I want her to know I'm about to go off the fucking deep end because of her selfishness, but I have decided I'm done trying to contact her. Anyway I don't think that would go over well and I'm pretty sure she will put the blame back on me and not take responsibility. Help.",13Nov2019,1

125,"what’s up guys. I’m new so excuse my ignorance to the app but I’m searching for some enlightenment on something that’s been heavy on my mind. 

Last week my mom died. Suddenly. At home. In bed. My dad found her unconscious, not breathing. I got there as the medics were performing CPR. After 45 minutes of them pumping her with epinephrine &amp; shocking her, they called it. And just like that she was gone. 

My mom literally drank herself to death. The medics left and cops rolled in, they treated her death like a crime. It was so surreal and weird. The detective showed us five empty bottles of vodka my mom managed to down that morning. 

I feel this strange guilt. My moms been an addict my entire life. If it wasn’t booze, it was pills/drugs. But the events leading up to her death I feel were preventive. A few days before I saw her slipping in and out of consciousness - she was sitting up smoking a cigarette in bed and it looked like she fell asleep then immediately woke up. Her entire body was swollen (feet, legs, face especially). 

We’ve called 911 on her in the past and if she was sober enough she refused treatment. If she was drunk, she didn’t have a choice. She was in and out of physical therapy places due to muscle deterioration from not walking and general weakness. She had liver cirrhosis as well. She’s left hospitals AMA when she could too. 

She kept refusing help &amp; after some time I got so frustrated I started pretending she wasn’t there. I even told people I’ve already mourned her death (boy was I wrong).  I feel guilty because I should’ve been a better daughter although she kept choosing alcohol over me. Had I been there for her, maybe she would’ve chose differently. Her entire family wrote her off. They outcasted all of us because we couldn’t hold her against her will and get her into in patient treatment. 

All I can hear is her voice asking me to go to lunch two weeks ago and Me angrily saying no because she was drunk. I hate feeling guilty. And I feel selfish for saying that. I truly feel like I failed her and if I did better she would be here today. Any advice would be great on this situation as I am at a loss for words. I apologize for this being all over the place.

130,"I am honestly so completely lost as to what to do in this situation. I (19F) got a dog this past September. She is an 8 year old American Pit Bull Terrier. I live at home and commute into the city for college, so the dog lives with me in my family's home. Everyone in my family pitches in to take care of her, and they all love her, but she is my dog, and I take her to the vet, pay for her things, etc. 

A few weeks after we got her we started noticing some behavioral issues. She's food aggressive, when we were told explicitly she was not. She snaps at our cat if he gets too close, so we have to be extremely careful about feeding them, since any time food is involved, she gets aggressive. She has taken to peeing and pooping in every carpeted area of the house. She had no issue doing her business outside the first few weeks, then all of a sudden she will not pee in the backyard. Our carpet reeks of piss. We've tried just about every trick to get the smell out, but I think it's sunken down below, which means we'll probably have to replace the carpet. It got so bad that we had to install a baby gate at the base of the stairs last week. Since then, she's taken to peeing on my bed whenever I'm not in my room. (I keep my door closed, but all it takes is one slip-up and she's in and out in minutes.) 

She is also not crate trained, when we were told she was. I bought her a crate, and in the two and a half months we've had her she's spent maybe seven nights in it. She shows signs of anxiety (panting, drooling) every time she's in there and I can't in good conscious leave her in there like that (she clearly was abused, most likely by a breeder). The big issue with that is that she is heart-worm positive and the organization we adopted her through is supposed to give her a series of shots to kill the heart-worm, followed by four weeks of being crated to minimize activity. 

There are other problems, such as tearing up stuff in the house, eating food that isn't hers, and barking non-stop outside. It is a constant problem, one thing or another. From the moment I get home we are attempting to recorrect her behavior, as she is almost always doing something ""bad"".

I am trying to read up on training books and videos that let me know how to address her behavior, but to be honest I am completely out of my depth. I'm a full time student commuting two hours a day for school full-time, I work part-time, and I help my family out with chores and errands whenever I can. I am also struggling with depression and anxiety, and what is hopefully not the beginning of Bipolar Disorder (my father and brother are both bipolar, the first big depression often hits in college). I cannot afford to hire a private trainer for her, as they average around $65 an hour, and she doesn't do well around other dogs so I cannot bring her to group training. 

This entire situation has caused massive strain on my family. I feel so humiliated for begging my parents to allow me to bring a dog home, only for it backfire so spectacularly. At the time I adopted her, I honestly thought I could give her a great life and that she would add untold joy to ours. I was told she was a sweet, low-maintenance dog that loved napping on the couch and cuddles. I know the organization we adopted her from is partially to blame, as they deliberately withheld information (not new, we got our cat from them too and were shocked to find a list of health problems that they didn't disclose), but I know most of this is my fault, as now that big issues arise, I find myself unable to deal with them. My family is supportive, and has done far beyond what I would've hoped in terms of helping to take care of her and clean up her messes, but they are reaching the ends of their ropes. I do not blame them. Our entire upstairs reeks of dog piss, all of their rooms (mine is the only room downstairs). I struggle to take care of myself at the moment, I honestly worry that I don't have the time or energy to train myself to train my dog.

I do not know what to do. A part of me wants to contact the organization we got her from and let them know we need to bring her back, but I am tearing up just thinking of getting ""rid"" of her like she's some problem. I am at my wit's end, I just do not know what to do. As I mentioned before, I am deeply struggling with depression and most days it's a struggle just to go to school. Is rehoming her inhumane? Is it the kind thing to do? Is there some resource I can turn to for guidance as to what the root of her problems are? 

I would appreciate any and all advice on the matter, and ask that you be kind in your replies. I am honestly so stressed out and don't know if I sound tone deaf or like a terrible dog owner.",13Nov2019,1

132,"I honestly just need advice right now and to get this off my chest. 

I am extremely conflicted because I am a current freshman in my first semester at a 4 year school as an out-of-state student. I love it here (at least I think I do... it's only been one semester) and I have made good friends. However I was kind of an idiot when picking schools and never gave the cost much thought.

I was lucky enough to receive an excellent scholarship but at the end of the day the cost of attending this school is nearly 40k still... I have great opportunities here: I am in the honors program and the engineering school is well respected. But at the end of the day I don't think I can justify being over 100k dollars in debt for an undergrad degree.

I looked into transferring to a school back in-state where I live but the cost isn't much different unless I get a scholarship. The only issue is that they only offer scholarships to transfer students coming from community colleges, which is understandable. 

I just feel like I am absolutely screwed now and I don't know what to do. Thinking about being stuck paying off a huge amount of debt if I stay at this school is giving me so much anxiety. I can't determine whether or not it would actually be worth it regardless of how much I like it here. I am kicking myself right now for being so naive when picking schools and not giving student loans serious consideration - I just thought that an excellent school would set me up for success and it would never be an issue.

Should I just transfer to a community college at home for a year and try to figure things out. I could potentially attend the CC for free - and since I am unsure about my major I am even more worried that if I change my mind down the line at my current school I will not graduate on time and be in even more debt.

Any advice? Has anyone transferred out of a 4-year university to a different one? Do you think it's reasonable to stay? It sounds cocky but the only justification I can think of is that my engineering degree could earn me a nice salary which could *potentially* ease the burden of massive loans just a little bit. 

I feel almost ashamed at how naive I was in deciding to come to a school I knew I could never afford. I feel like I am totally screwed now.

136,"w for eating disorder talk//

I'm working through my second bout with ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder). The last time I had this...problem was 2017.

ARFID is an eating disorder where you're not motivated by weight loss/body image, and instead aren't eating due to sensory or appetite issues.

It's been about a week since my appetite started declining and now I've hit a point where its 7pm today and all I've had is a slice of toast. I'm just not hungry. If I try to eat when I'm not hungry, it feels like my gag reflex is at the front of my teeth and I get nauseous and can't swallow.

Obviously, this is a problem. I'm down 8lbs from 2 weeks ago already. I'm tired a lot more and already have a chronic illness that makes me dizzy without any help.

I see a therapist on the 19th but that's a week away and I don't want to go all week without eating. I really want to eat! I have a box from a meal kit service and would like to be able to use it...

What I'm looking for is advice on how to eat when eating is hard. Foods that are nutritionally dense if you dont eat a lot or often. Foods that stimulate appetite. What to tell my therapist. 

some notes on sensory problems: I dont like smoothies or shakes or other ways of ""drinking"" food. I have a protein chocolate milk I buy that's lactose free that I can sort of get down right now even if it takes all day to drink a serving. I dont have many other dietary restrictions past not liking blended stuff.",13Nov2019,1
138,"I always thought this guy was cute from the first football game we had, it’s the first time he really caught my eye. We didn’t sit near each other, I just noticed him from a bit away. I wasn’t sure if he was into guys or not, but he mostly hangs out with girls and (not to be offensive) gives off very gay vibes, so I assumed he was. I generally let the whole interest rest and go unbothered, without ever telling anyone that I was interested. It was like that until one football game where his friends (all girls) were cheering for the game (he does a thing where they cheer from the stands that’s not cheering) called my friend and I over to talk to them because we both enjoyed doing the cheers with them from a few seats away in the bleachers. I was nervous because I was thinking about trying out for their team in the upcoming competition season. And they let us take a picture with them, but the guy didn’t seem like he wanted much interest, but he seems like the more shy type and I didn’t expect much to come from him. After the game my brother and friend [16 F] asked me if I was flirting with him (the guy), I said no, I was just nervous to talk to the team. They said okay, but then said that he was “checking me out”. I then got re interested. Another one of my friends was talking to me about a conversation she had had with one of the team member and how she [the team member] thought I liked him because at the game it seemed like I did, I then denied to my friend that I did, and slid the question in, hoping she would know the answer to, and told her that “I try my best to not like straight guys” and proceeded to “confirm” asking “he is straight, right?” And she responded yes. Within the next 2 days at lunch, a different friend of mine was having a similar conversation with a different team member, where she [the team member] asked if I liked him [the guy], she [my friend] proceeded with saying yes, as a joke, and she [the team member] responded saying that he was straight. Between this time and the game where they [the team] asked us if we wanted a picture with them, I had been trying to spark up a conversation with him over Instagram, and failing to do so. After this, I still had my suspicions and continued to try to talk to him, with the team having a competition coming up that I would be helping with. At the competition I saw him quite a bit, but he didn’t even say hi. I don’t blame him, we hadn’t talked much, but if he had seemed like he had liked me at the football game, why had he not responded to a lot of my text or talk to me IRL when we easily could have. At said competition, his mom (she is very nice and likes to talk), was talking to my friend and I while we were waiting to go on the field for them to compete. She had brought up that he was very close with the team and how most of his friends were girls, and that he had some guy friends, but mostly they were girls, and that he had had sleep overs and gone camping with a lot of them several times in the past, and how she was completely fine with it and they were all just really close friends. My friend and I then proceeded to joke about him being gay after his mom left, and that she too [my friend] had had her suspicions. Later I brought up the topic of his friends thinking I liked him to my friend who had said that he was looking at me at the game, and she told me that he was “checking me out” and was obviously “looking” at me. She then asked if he was straight, I said I don’t know and that he says he is, and she did the face where it like, okay, sure. She proceeded to ask if I liked him, I told her I didn’t like him, but I didn’t not like him. I now try to text him every now and then, and get the DRYEST responses, like “okay” or “yeah”, and nothing after that. I see him in the halls a few times a day, but I don’t think he notices me, I always know when to slow down so that I can see him and he is so cute. I would stop liking him because he is straight, like I have in the past with other straight crushes. But my brain and friends agreements that he isn’t pushes me to not let go. I really like him and think he likes me but I’m not sure and don’t know what to do, I really need some advice.",13Nov2019,1

I didn’t mind if it stayed this way cause it was almost the same as before, just no kisses. A few days later, I notice she is following a guy who goes to our school likes all the same things I do.

He is 24 but is more like a 15-16 year old mentality, he can do multiplication read and play chess but he probably couldn’t solve an algebra problem or write an essay. We had a big family growing up, 8 kids total and 4 really close brothers that always played with him and had fun. Now we all have grown up and moved out.. except him, he is home alone a lot or just home with my step mom (she works part time). So he plays video games by himself mostly. He lives out in the country outside a really small town.

Anyways we have tried to visit as much as we can, one of my brothers (the only one that lives close) takes him out for dinner once week and visits here and there and we all try to play online games with him a couple times a week. my grandma plays Yahtzee with him a few times a week. But I can tell he is sad and is lonely because he is not used to being alone so much. I talked to him on the phone today to check up on him and he was said he finally got to watch a movie that came out last year and after I told him I hadn’t watched it yet it he said “Oh I thought you had since you get to go out whenever you want with your car and I can’t” and that made me really sad because I know he understands he is left out of getting to live a lot of life..

My question is what can I do to help him be happier? I live 2 1/2 hr away, he plays video games a lot and I thought I could help him get a hobby he could do at home or outside, but I’m not sure what. Anyways any advice would be helpful",13Nov2019,1
144,"Long story short I took 90 Xanax pills in 3 weeks. I cut cold turkey cause I ran out of my prescription. I was taking 5-6 pills a day. I had bad withdrawals and many symptoms the first 2 weeks. Only 2 weeks into my withdrawals I binge drank heavily 2 days in a row at my best friends wedding. The next day I woke up with my initial symptoms back like insomnia, night sweats, shaking, bad rebound anxiety, constant high heart palpitations, depression, poor concentration, and blurred vision.

It’s been 3 weeks and 3 days since the wedding and I still have symptoms. I feel very out of it and have like tunnel vision. Also I have bad anxiety still that comes in waves and also have constant light shaking, tremors, and muscle twitches. I’m freaking out it’s a neurological disease than withdrawals. 

Is this symptoms from withdrawals plus heavy binge drinking and possible kindling or relapse? I’m freaking out the shaking hasn’t gone away yet.",13Nov2019,1

152,"For the past couple months, I've been experiencing daily headaches, blurred vision, a brain fog of sorts that wouldn't relent no matter how I attempted to deal with it, and a continuous post-nasal drip. After exhausting several options, I ended up going to an allergist/immunologist, who put me on antibiotics for a sinus infection. Once these failed to do anything for me, the doctor requested a CT scan which revealed a ""moderate to severe"" deviated septum and ""severe"" mucus buildup. 

I've since been referred to an ENT, but I've got a good 3 weeks yet until I can see him. **For those of you who've dealt with deviated septa:** what have you done to expedite **any** kind of mucus drainage to decrease your sinus pressure? I'd really like a way to deal with this not only prior to this appointment, but prior to any surgery that I may need, since I have no idea how long of a wait it's going to be until I can actually get one. *I'm a university student, so the sooner I can read without straining my eyes again the better.* 

Thanks in advance! 

What I've tried:

* OTC pain relievers. They don't do much at all. 
* Other NSAIDs. I was prescribed Diclofenac by a neurologist who thought I had a migraine. I take it when my headaches are intolerable, and it helps somewhat. 
* CBD / other similar relaxants. Helps me feel calm in accepting the pressure and vision problems, but doesn't really relieve them. 
* White Flower Oil. I use this when I my sinuses are miserably blocked up. The menthol in it helps a bit, but not much.
* Sudafed PE (phenylephrine). Felt great taking this, but it started making my urine dark, so I stopped taking it. 
* Allegra. Helps somewhat, but no noticeable pain reduction.",13Nov2019,1

154,"I run the back end of the website for an upscale women’s clothing designer. We are a small and successful company, but small.

A customer recently returned a dress she ordered from our website, and it had obviously been worn ($300 dress). No question about it- footprints/heal marks on the hem of the dress, picks in the fabric... after some light detective work, I found her instagram where she’d posted a photo of herself wearing the dress at a party. Then she returned it to us. The good ole wear and return gig.
 
Do I politely email her and confirm the address we can send it back to? Do we ask her to send us a shipping label for us to ship it back to her (why do I we have to pay to send it back to her)? Do we ignore it altogether and simply not issue a refund? Do we send a warning email and issue a refund? Any other ideas?Our website states that a damaged/used return will not result in a refund.

155,"I know it's unlikely I'll find a book/exact advice catering to these specific details, but I include them anyway in the hopes that someone may find that atleast some of them have been reflected in their experiences

I have recently decided to lose a bunch of weight. I don't medically qualify as overweight but I can see myself getting there. In the past threeish years I have gained quite a bit of weight,  and its very easily visible in my face, arms, belly, etc. I no longer feel like myself. This is mostly due to inactivity and binge eating, both fueled by procrastination. I also realise that sticking to a diet/meal plan, or even working out have been unappealing to me in the past as I didn't think it was ""worth it"" unless I  had a killer workout plan. I know this is irrational and unhelpful and am working to escape that mentality.

I (late-teensF) am looking for a book and advice to help me come up with a workout plan spread over the week/month incl 'days' (glutes, chest, etc) and meal plan. I am seeking out a book as I'm afraid online info could be unreliable. Verifying sources seems (not to sound lazy) a LOT of work and I could mess up by a too many cooks in the kitchen type situation. That being said, advice is welcome and appreciated!!

To clarify, while my relationship with (specifically self-control/bingeing)  food is...not great, I believe it's something I can figure out myself. I don't want to read a feel-good book about loving myself the way I am, or coping with my anxiety through finger paint - impressionist Klingon fanart.  Meal planning, workout planning (and a kick in the ass) however, I'd need help with. 

Blogs/links are welcome too! Thanks!

In the time that has passed since then, I've been thinking a lot and I don't know if I want to be a lawyer anymore.  It seemed like the natural path for me since I got my bachelor's in political science and am interested in maybe running for office one day, but I couldn't help but think about how dreadfully boring the classes and readings were while I was still enrolled.  It doesn't help that there's already a surplus of lawyers in the US and that I'd have to graduate in the top 10% of my class to even have a remote chance of getting a badass job.

Now, after starting therapy and working on improving myself, I've decided to go back to my old school because it's really where I'm supposed to be.

However, my ex has no desire to restart the relationship.  I don't blame her for moving on, but I think we still had a lot left in the tank. Unless she was hiding something from me and all her friends, she seemed really happy when we were together and part of me figured she may be excited to be together with no deadline.  How I see it, we've got the opportunity to jump right back in and be better than before, but she's had a whole year to get over our separation.  She's done the natural, healthy thing and not been stuck in the past.  I'm not upset at her one bit, but I am frustrated with myself because I gave up a really important relationship for a stupid reason and now I don't think I'll ever get back there.  

We've stayed in contact while I've been gone, and we both agree that we want each other in our lives because we still care about each other, but she has just moved past all romantic feelings (at least that's what she's told me). We both share many of the same friends, so I'll surely be spending a decent amount of time with her in the coming months (it's a very small school). I'd rather get over my desire for a romance because I don't want to alienate her as a friend, but it's hard for me to do because I've been in such a dark place recently and have used hope for and memories of us as motivation to get to a healthy point. 

I know this a very strange situation, and I don't know how all of this will change once we're back in the same place, but I'd like to start working to move past the sadness and regret, because my life is better with her in it, be it as a friend or a partner.  I'll be much happier if I can stop dwelling on the what-if's, but I can't stop thinking about how we could still be going strong if I were more in tune with myself before all of this.

165,"Basically, Im really into two guys;

Guy 1: Lives overseas, met him not long ago and we talk often about living together. Ive had a big thing for him for about a year. Were on the same level mentally and he always acts like he has feelings for me but insists he doesn’t despite his romantic tendencies and jealousies toward me. Even thinking about dating makes me feel weirdly guilty.  Like moving away from what seems like his own total indecisiveness would be a massive mistake.

Guy 2: Is..several years younger than me and currently living with me. I didnt really start developing any feelings for him until he moved in. As far as types goes hes pretty much exactly what I need and he /does/ have a thing for me, but for whatever reason I remain unsure of him in that way despite him being pretty great for me. We have the same aesthetic and music taste, hea a fantastic listener and super easy going, he gives a fuck about me and is probably the first person I havent had a hint of doubt about that over.

But my problem is the attachment to guy 1. Im so fucking attached to him. Being with him felt normal. Like how life was suppose to be. I was content. I was happy. He made me feel warm and so...so loved. Guy 2 also makes me feel loved but its different and honestly both are totally special in their own way.

The 35M is the head tenant who me and the 33M have been subletting from, i.e. we have our own semi formal contacts with the head tenant and pay rent/bond directly to him. The 35F is the head tenant’s wife. All of my flatmates are some form of Chinese ethnicity (Malaysian Chinese, Taiwanese, British-Chinese). I’m Australian middle eastern.

My apartment is really nice albeit small and in an expensive area. It’s super close to every amenity imaginable and I rent the master room which is the most expensive. I actually pay the most rent out of everyone. I’ve been having the following issues with the head tenant:

- he moved his wife in without checking if it was okay a few months ago, and refused to adjust the proportion of the rent accordingly (I originally signed up to only live with 2 other people).

- his parents stayed here for 5 weeks, again he didn’t check if it was ok with everyone, and his mom was hogging the kitchen for hrs every night and sometimes using my groceries. He only paid extra utilities when I told him to otherwise he was trying to be sneaky about it and not pay. 

- his wife spends hours in the kitchen every night (typically 3 hrs) and she is jobless so she stays home 24/7 and parks herself in the living room all day/night playing video games

- if I use the kitchen, the head tenant sometimes hovers around and tries to adjust the heat I’m using, nags about stupid things and sometimes uses my milk without asking, same with washing machine, he will nag about useless things like using too much powder or leaving doors open to prevent mould or some shit. Basically he acts like he is my father

- he is abnormally stingy and if I dare to use the heater when it is cold he tries to impose stupid rules like not using it between 2-8pm as there are higher electricity rates at that time. Btw this is my own personal heater that I own in my room.

- I had a fight with him about the rent and he said I should appreciate that he ‘allows me to have guests sometimes as my landlord’ 

- if I move out he is planning to hold on to my bond for a week to make sure I didn’t do some patch job in my room, he wants one month notice which is so difficult so I probably have to pay him like $700 in overlapping rent, and he is demanding steam cleaning which i am actually not obligated to do by law i my state.

I will keep it short as possible. I am from a biracial family. Let's leave it at that. For reasons my parents divorced when I was 6. It had an impact on me. I am pretty close to my dad, but my mom won the custody battle and proceeded to make my life.. miserable. I tried moving out when I was 18 and succeeded at 19. Spending the year trying to find a good job. Well.. as good as possible under today's times. My dad meanwhile lost his eyesight and had to move in with me. Glaucoma. Untreated and undetected untill terminal. He's an idiot. But I will still love him. Meanwhile I lost my first job .. i have a habit of staring into space while thinking. Apparently some woman thought it was creepy. That's all I could gleam. Then got a job as a nights watch at a warehouse. You know the deal. Nothing really there but legals say you need a body. I am that body. Sweet deal actually. Once you get used to crushing loneliness. 
Getting the picture right? This is how my week usually works. The watch is 7 days deal. No complaints. Nothing really happens. Once I caught two horny dudes sneaking around . I told them where the blind spots are and ignored them afterwards. Why stand in the way of love.. or lust maybe idk.. anyway.. the long and short of it is.. my mother who has pretty much ignored me since I turned  18..  5 years ago.. suddenly has grandma fever. Shes on my ass 24 7.. trying to set me up and other bs. She asian. The other part of the biracial puzzle. 
About me.. I'm 5-8. Average looks, average build. Never had sex. Not even kissed. I was in a sort of relationship for a year in high school. Which ended in a text. Did not have the time or willingness to try again. Now it's even more impossible ... I get back home at 7.30ish am. Make breakfast. Feed my dad. Quick shower and a good sleep until 2pm. Get up. Shit shower shave. And make dinner.. then I'm out the door by 5.30. after feeding my dad dinner ofc. From 6.30 pm to 6.30am I'm staring at a wall. With occasional breaks to walk around the warehouse. And Nintendo switch and ofc Reddit.
I just don't have the time to have anysort of relationship. I am not asexual. I like women. I even masturbate occasionally for.. uh.. relief. And I try to keep an open mind about everything. 

This last day, my mom calls me crying and says she heard from a friend about incels. And is now convinced i am one. 

Please help... How do I get out of this..",13Nov2019,1

179,"A little background:
I’ve been talking to this girl pretty seriously for a month now and we both really like each other. She’s even been the one to say “I like you a lot” or “I miss you” or even call me baby first. We had a convo the other day that she doesn’t want a relationship rn however because she just got out of one almost right when we started talking. I get it. She needs time. She said she sees it down the road but just wants to be “friends that f*** for now”. I asked “so FWB?” And she got pissed.

Now:
Well she’s in a sorority and wants to go to a frats formal because all her roommates are going. That means she wants a date and I’m not in a frat. She assured me she wants it to just be platonic but it’s still weird to me that she would go to that over just hanging with me. Anyway, is this whole situation sketchy/not worth my time? I don’t really get it and if she says she likes me so much why would she get a date and go to this?",13Nov2019,1
180,"Weirdest experience ever just happened in the toddler toy section of Walmart. I'm just curious about what you think happened because I can't figure it out. 

I [27/f] was standing in the toddler toy aisle by myself, looking for a present for my nephew.

A woman around my age (~late 20s, nicely dressed and super normal looking) passes me in the aisle and says:

Woman: doing some early Christmas shopping?

Me: Huh? Oh, yeah sure

(at this point she's sort of looking at the toys herself but mostly focused on having a conversation with me)

Woman: I like to get it done early too. Do you have lots of people to shop for?

Me: Oh, actually my nephew is just visiting this weekend. Getting him a toy. You?



Woman: Oh, nice! I'm shopping for my cousins, there are so many! 


(This is the point where the conversation probably should have ended and it would have been a totally normal conversation but it just kept going and she was talking to me as if we were on a first date in a bar)


Woman: So do you live around here?

Me: ...yeah, I live close by

Woman: Me too, I actually usually don't come to this Walmart because I work in a nearby town. 

(little pause ~10 seconds, I start to return to the toys)

woman: Do you work in this area too?

Me: yes, I work here too

Her: Oh nice! What do you do for a living?

Me: Oh, uh, I teach English... you?

Her: I'm a dental hygienist (I think, honestly can't remember exactly what she said and I was also looking at the toys and half paying attention)

Me: Cool!

(another short pause where I go back to looking at the toys)

Her: So you probably studied education in college right?

Me: Oh actually I studied Spanish

Her:. Oh! I actually studied speech therapy, but met someone who... (She went into a story about how someone she knows introduced her into the field of dental whatever but I was half paying attention at this point and honestly kind of panicking about not knowing how to handle this interaction). 

This went on for a couple more minutes and it was just super uncomfortable and I couldn't even look at the toys because she kept having a full conversation with me that required my attention so I eventually told her ""well I guess I'm going to buy these, nice to meet you!"" and got out of there.

I'm not sure if I did a good job conveying through text just how strange it was. 

It was like she was really trying to get to know me and form a connection rather than just making some casual brief chit chat. In the baby toy aisle of Walmart. Lots of ""first date"" type questions and it didn't look like it was going to end any time soon. I'm not even sure she was actually shopping for baby toys tbh because she was talking to me waaay more than looking at anything.

Was I being hit on? Was she just looking to make a friend? Was she just weird? Am I just weird?

Please someone just help me figure out what that was because the curiosity is going to drive me nuts

tl;dr I have pretty good social skills but nobody ever taught me about this kind of scenario",13Nov2019,1

I work at a coding company, and I've been put on a project with another person in the office, it's been a couple of weeks and I've noticed some stuff that seem a little weird.

She is a smoker, and normally takes her smoke breaks behind the building, but in the past couple of days, I've been finding ashes in our work space, I've confronted her about it, but she claims she doesn't know how they got there.

Sometimes whenever I'm getting lunch in the breakroom, I'll notice her staring at me in the doorframe, whenever I turn around to see what she's doing, she ducks her head behind the  frame and leaves the area, I haven't confronted her about it yet.

Finally, she says some weird things out of seemingly nowhere, we were talking about a difficult part of the code when she mentions something about burning a bunch of clothes in a field a couple of years ago.

I'm worried that something is going to happen to me if I dont do something about it, I've already gone to HR about it and they are making a report on it, but I want your guys opinion, what should I do?

Update: I believe things are getting a little worse, she seems to be staring at me more often, and I've found more ashes, I'm still asking her is she's smoking in our workspace, she still is denying it, but I've noticed something about her, she seems nervous about something, I've even seen her murmuring to herself during lunch.

So anyway, this video got me like ""Mmm that's weird"" and I thought about it but not to the point to be paranoid, I mean, that's really sad be we got used to big companies spying on any bit of data avalaible but anyway.

So I was talking with my gf on Discord PC some day ago and at some point she was talking lingerie (bras mostly). Next thing you know I get weird ads on YouTube (on my phone btw) about a girl making some bras comparison (not the kind of ad you usually see from like a brand, more of the heavily sponsored podcast forcefully smiley girl). Also since that day my gf receives this kind of as aswell but maybe because she browsed it.

Isn't the first time it occurs, last time being about condoms iirc (just to eliminate this, may be weird and not credible but I actually don't watch any porn at all, nor do I go on streaming or download sites).

The only thing I've done to make him visibly upset is that I told him that I didn't want strangers sleeping six feet away from me. He would invite random girls off of tinder and invited them to spend the night. I put my foot down and told him no.

I gave him a monitor stand, a $30 one, for free when we first moved in as a sign of goodwill. Not to be THAT guy, but he didn't return the favor. He knew about the present three weeks before as I sent him pictures of it over discord. He is now planning on throwing it away and is refusing to give me the stand back w/out a trade. He wants my monitor and a 1tb SSD. 

I told him about a liquidators that I go to back at my home town, he and I drove about 3 hours to it. After finding shit that wasn't worth the money, he threw a hissy fit. I warned him beforehand that it's essentially a gamble. 

He chews loudly.

He blares Naruto.

He smells terrible.

He's got into my food.

Purposely tries to offend me by playing the soviet union anthem, playing anti-christian songs (IE Rusty Cage), and insulting America. Not because he thinks that way, but because he loves offending people.

I want out, I want out, I want out.

Claims he has insomnia but sleeps through alarms.

Gets up at 6:00 am on the dot, makes coffee, gets on Paladins, notices me awake, talks louder into mic, and then hogs the shower for an hour and a half. Every single morning.

Expects me to work on his PC machines for free.

I've woken up to see him and his grandpa at the foot of my bed watching me sleep.

Wants me to clean the bathroom, the showers, the bathtub, the sinks, the cabinets, mop the floors, and wipe the toilet that he pisses and shaves his \*ahem\* hairs on.  After I did most of those, he claims I didn't and is refusing to acknowledge that I only want to clean up after *my* messes. Nobody picks up after me, all my stuff is packed neatly away and out of sight.

Despite the fact that it is currently 16 degrees (f) outside, his window is open and he's got two fans on.

I've talked to the RA and the director, and they've sided with him:

""Oh you need to be more lenient.""

""Oh, you're being lazy"".

""Get along.""

""Sorry, we can't move you.""

I know for a fact where ten empty rooms are in this building ALONE are. 

Him and I had a little confrontation monday night, and it ended with me saying ""If you don't like the way I clean, then maybe I shouldn't be picking up after you, *your highness.""*

I have refused to acknowledge him and I would be really appreciative if anyone can offer some advice on how to deal with the situation. I can't talk to him face to face b/c he keeps either blowing up on me or talking in circles.

I leave in a month bc he's ran me off and I've found a better school.

First date went great, kissed and held hands etc. 

Second time I ask him to meet me for sex, because I was just really horny for a week. If it matters, I don’t regret it and actually am overjoyed by the experience, it was sensual and intimate. 

We texted back and forth. Today I asked him whether he had plans over the weekend, he said no. I suggested doing something outdoorsy. He asked at night? I said no, morning or afternoon. He then said he had to work in the morning and spend time with his kid in the afternoon. 

I didn’t reply, then he texted again saying something completely unrelated. 

I feel like he is after sex, am I wrong to think that? On one hand, I understand that I may have come across as looking just for sex when I asked for it the second time. On the other hand, I fear that I might be acting on the assumption that he is after sex. 

I want to explore this relationship beyond just sex with him. 

Should I meet him on Saturday night? 

How should I convey without coming across as needy/too soon/ angry that I want more than sex and won’t be afraid to stop seeing him if that’s all it’s going to be?

This whole week, I have been thinking about what I was doing at the end of the Spring semester last year. On my final day, I walked off, and went to my cafe to celebrate. 

I had a massive crush on the owner (I met her before I knew she was a barista.) I considered her a friend as well, so it was lovely to have somewhere to go, and someone to talk to after a very uncertain performance. (By the way, I ended up passing.) 

The funny thing is, I went there, and I saw that her Mum and brother were working, and then I went back LOL, I wanted to wait for her. 

Unfortunately, in February, she broke my heart dramatically. The way she behaved afterwards clearly told me that our friendship was one-sided. It should have been evident in hindsight, I mean I was always visiting her, and giving attention to her rather than the other way round. 

Loving her was the biggest mistake I ever made.

I need advice on how best to do this in terms of not damaging my ceiling too much, what type of sound system will provide the most annoyance to my neighbors without absolutely destroying my hearing. Any other way to annoy my upstairs neighbors would be wonderful!  


To further explain since I'm sure it'll be needed, my neighbors have some sort of stereo in their upstairs bedroom that runs nonstop, even when they're not home and at hours considered ""quiet time."" Have knocked on neighbors door multiple times when I know they're home, they avoid answering me. Have left two notes taped to their door, one polite and one strongly worded, that they ignore. Bang on the ceiling, ignore me. Called the law twice during state mandated quiet time, it's on 10 minutes after police leave.

199,"Hey everyone, I'm very confused about what I want and what I should honestly do right now. I've been in a long distance relationship for about a year and a half. My partner is about 1,500 miles away from me, and we've never had the chance to see each other in person, we met through Instagram and started talking and we clicked fast so after about 2 or 3 months we started dating. And we call and talk all the time and video call and everything. The relationship is pretty great besides the distance, and honestly I've been struggling with the distance here lately, because there is no physical connection between us because of it and it makes it hard for me because I am such a physical person when it comes to those I care about. It's how I show I care, and I've been struggling with it so much recently because of this other person I met, we give each other hugs all the time and stuff because 1. I hug all my friends if I'm close enough to them and 2. We both like the physical connection that we gain from it, cause she isn't able to get any either, see she's in a relationship as well and her bf is kind of an ass with the way that he acts towards her and basically disregards any kind of physical connection with her and I've known her for 2-3 months now probably a bit longer, but even though we're in relationships we've found ourselves growing an attachment  to one another. We figured at first it was cause of how we felt physically with one another since we don't have the ability to gain physical affections from our partners but we've realized it's more than that, we both love being around one another, we both make each other very happy and laugh all the time and we are starting to love each other, and part of me wants to be with her now and we've even talked about how she's thinking of leaving her bf (I feel like she would leave him anyway even if I wasn't a factor in it because of the way he is), and like part of me wants to leave my gf too just to be with her but I care so much about my gf, and I just absolutely hate the thought of upsetting her and I hate it cause I feel like if I wasn't a physical person this never would've happened but I don't know. Plus I don't know if I'll ever see my gf, because she's finishing school (she's taking college courses for being a hair person) and then she would have to prepare to leave and everything and so the soonest we could see each other is like 3 years from now, and that's if she would want to come here by then because I feel like with how she's able to meet new people now she's gonna build a good life up there and will wanna stay, I mean I want her to be happy no matter what and if that's what made her happy id want that. (She's just building connections with people on her area now because of the way her home life is and she's just now being able to do what she wants instead of being forced to stay secluded) and I just want her to be happy, and at the same time, I want to be with my friend because of how well we click together as well and how happy she makes me and I make her, but i also don't want to make a dumb mistake if it is a mistake. I just wanna know what you guys/girls would do in my situation, I mean I get it if you think I'm an ass after reading this, but it's just what's going on and I'm not sure what to do except to leave it to fate.",13Nov2019,1
200,"My mom and I don't get along. 

She overreacts over the smallest things and picks an argument with me over anything. It's exhausting because it really just depends on her mood and she can be really bipolar. 

For example, yesterday I told her that I may get promoted soon after only working there for 3 months, she got mad and said that she's not gonna let me get promoted, she doesn't want me to work more and thinks I should focus on my education. I understand that but it was really a let down, we went to go eat and she was yelling at me in the restaurant and giving me a lot of shit. 

She has called me a burden, told me that my only purpose in life is to sleep with other guys, and has told me ""if I die tomorrow, I hope you're proud"". She only says these types of things when we argue, and over time it has dialed down a lot, but the things that she has said to me have really got to me, and I have lots of anxiety and depression issues because of it. 

It sucks because I know that she has her own issues and a fucked up childhood, I just want the both of us to be happy and we haven't been while living together. Don't get me wrong though, she provides for me and am grateful that she doesn't physically abuse me or is a drunk, but right now I'm just in survival mode until I can move out.

I've noticed a general positive attitude towards Legos on the Internet but it's not something you talk much about IRL, so I have to ask, is it weird to have a Lego collection?",13Nov2019,1

215,"So there's this girl in my math class that I’m 100% sure likes me. We were put into the same group by our teacher for a project last week, and since then she has been waiting outside after class just to walk with me (even avoiding going to her locker just to talk to me), texting me everyday (after school, on weekends, and even during class), and staring at me in class and during lunch from across the library (Keep in mind, I don't sit even close to her in any of these). This girl seems obsessed with me, but I’m not really interested in her at all (Before you say I should just talk to her and see what she’s like, I already have).

217,"Backstory. About 5 months ago my best friend, told me he has feelings for me which i reciprocated, and from then on we were boyfriend and girlfriend. Till july 14th, he told me we needed to go on a break cause it was a little too much too fast for him, he still loved me he just wanted some time, about a month later we were back together and doing great. 
A month later he said that he no longer loved me as a girlfriend or he never did and he was confused about how he felt (i was his first girlfriend) so he broke up with me and said he hoped we could still be best friends which we are.
We talk every day and are great friends, but now one more month later he i were talking and he said he was having some second thoughts. I didn’t want to believe what i saw and asked him “About what?” And he responded with what i had hoped and feared “breaking up” At this point my stomach was spinning and i was a mess. I asked him if he was drunk and then asked if i was actually awake, yes i was awake and no he was not drunk, he was having second thoughts. 
Now he said it’s not a full feeling just some thoughts and that he wasn’t sure and i told him to go to sleep and check back in a few weeks to see how he was feeling about things. 

I’m scared, I’m worried and i don’t know what to do, i still love him but i don’t think it would be a good idea to date again especially since there was a lot of strain around our relationship because of our super religious family’s that don’t even let us sit on the same couch with them thinking we are just friends 

TL:DR my ex boyfriend who has broken up with me twice says he has second thoughts,

I was thinking about something with laboratory work because lab is actually enjoyable to me in my organic chem class. But I also take interest in epidemiology. But I’ve talked to my organic professor and he thinks I should look into nursing. But im not sure if that’s something I really want to do. Maybe a stop in my career ?

224,"So to be perfectly honest I think I’m having a bit of a quarter life crisis. I recently turned 25 and I think it’s hit me that I need to decide what I’m going to try and establish as my career. There’s a lot of layers to what I’m asking advice on so I’ll try to block off each of them. 

I’ve been working for a company since high school, I started at the bottom and have made it almost to the top of the store level. I work in retail and I’m getting to the point where I don’t think it’s something I want to do forever or retire with. Overall if I chose to stay with the company it’s a very safe move. It’s a growing company and it’s actually really good money for someone without a degree. I could be making 6 figures, with a bonus every year that is healthy in the next few years. I make more than the average person in my position now, and more than most of my friends with degrees in other fields. I have a lot of great friends and mentors within the company and there are some truly inspiring people to work for. I was very passionate about the job in the beginning and that’s began to fade. To be frank there is A LOT of bullshit that goes on. The people that work for me that range from 16-60 with 2 days experience all the way to 30+ years experience are people that can be amazing to be around and some of the most draining. I manage about 100 employees at any given time and they are all incredibly helpless and there is a lot of petty drama that ends up on my plate that I don’t necessarily want to deal with as most of my job. 

I’ve always considered the fact that I may not want to stay in this line of work but the money at my age has always been hard to walk away from. However, I’ve always been slightly embarrassed about what I do. It’s not that I need the gratification of others to be happy in my line of work but It’s just nothing exciting to announce that “this is what I do”. I realize that is a petty reason for wanting to leave but I believe that if I’m not jumping to tell people what I do for work then I’m probably not that happy doing it. Another thing is that it is not incredibly challenging, more so draining. I want to feel like I’m working to my potential, and while I’m not perfect at my job, and in my opinion far from it, I want to be challenged on bigger concepts. I know it probably sounds like I’m saying I’m better than what I do now and I don’t want to come off that way. 

The career I was looking at starting was one in public safety. Firefighter, paramedic, inspector, etc. I grew up around public safety my dad is a high ranking member in the fire service, my mom was a fire inspector, 2 of my stepdads were police officers, my best friends mom owns an ambulance company and I’ve made several paramedic friends, several of my closest friends are police officers, my sister worked as a police admin. It’s been prevalent in my life from day one. I know a lot of what goes into being a firefighter, the fact that it’s not all glory and saving lives every moment and battling huge blazes. I know most of the nitty gritty from growing up around it. I’ve spent Christmas and thanksgiving in a fire station many different times. I know that it’s a lifestyle, and that out can be difficult. I’m looking at going to see a college counselor about what it would look like to start the process. I have one class to complete to get an AA and then the rest would be dedicated to fire science and paramedic endeavors. 

The struggle I’m facing is 1) how to start this path, and 2) how to exit the one I’m on. 

I’m currently being groomed for the next steps in my career with my current company and they are investing a lot of time and effort into me. I’ve gone through company based programs and have even completed college courses in business, paid for by the company. I’m not worried about the company losing out on their investment, I’m more so worried about the people closer to me that have recently been investing in me. My boss now has been working with me almost daily, the company has upped my wages tremendously over the last few months in preparation for me to be taking my next steps, and I know that I am a desirable candidate for future opportunities within the company. I guess the best way to put it is that I feel guilty for taking so much of their investment in me and wanting to do something else. I know at the end of the day it’s my life and I have to do what makes me happy, but this is a company that helped me get off rock bottom, back on my feet, and helped me achieve more than I thought I would at this point. I just am realizing that it isn’t what I want to do forever. 

Lastly I just don’t know the right time to announce that I am thinking about moving on. While I am replaceable, it would still cause some waves in my corridor if I did leave. Again I realize I need to look out for myself and not necessarily the company. But I feel shady for trying to see what my options are while taking their time and money that they’re investing in me. I wouldn’t be able to begin my journey into the world of firefighting until January and I don’t want to announce now and check out with what I’m doing and I don’t want to wait too long and take all of what they’ve given me and just throw it back at them like I don’t care what they have done for me. Another aspect that makes it difficult to address is that they’ve given me raises and stipends based on my potential future with the company. I got another one today which is why it’s becoming something I feel like I need a strangers opinion on. I don’t know how to graciously leave or announce that I am planning on leaving. I’ve told a few of my close friends within the company but no one that is a shot caller. 

So ultimately I’m just kind of unsure about how to handle this situation. If I’m being ridiculous that I want to change careers just because Im not totally invested, or if firefighting is even a worthy profession. I’m just a little lost I think and I could really go for some unbiased advice, opinions, ideas. So thank you in advance for anyone who decides to read through this!",13Nov2019,1
225,"I have been severely depressed lately and it's really starting to get to me. I am currently 17 and have a very adventurous personality. I really like surfing and snowboarding, but I am landlocked for 6 hours and it hasn't snowed in probably 10 years. My family takes no interest in what I enjoy doing and I don't have anyone to talk to about the way I feel. It also makes it so much worse that when I try to tell anyone how I feel they just say there are people who have it worse. The only thing that really makes me happy anymore is travelling, but I barely get to do it due to money and age reasons. I am also really big into cars, but it's a 2 hour drive to any car shows and tracks. I really enjoy meeting new people but I am very quiet and I find it very hard to talk to anyone. I understand that if I wait until after college that I can get a stable job and do more things that I want to.

I grew up ever since I was 4 in private school and until I went to boarding school all my friends lived 40 min away. I was forced to grow up quickly and in solitude. I’m an only child. I never had a friend group I was always good with everyone besides those couple of people. I fear that no one will ever be the right one for me to be best friends with at my boarding school. I have been here for 3 years and all I see are fake people, and not the right type of people.

228,"So I’ve been dating this guy about 2 and a half years and I love him absolutely to bits. Around September I had to move to a new city to pursue an internship opportunity I got and hopefully get a job. We’ve been long distance since then. We had been long distance in the past (he graduated college a year before me) and it was totally fine we had no issues. This time around we haven’t nailed it because it’s just further and takes more planning than our spur of the moment habits like in the past. We are planning for him to move here in the summer and are currently saving up to do so. The only reason he didn’t come originally was because my opportunity was super spur of the moment and finding reasonably priced rentals is hard with 2 weeks notice. 

Anyways, on to the advice part. He’s been really depressed lately. It’s probably been about 2 weeks and I know that’s rather short when it comes to clinical depression but previous to us dating he had some pretty serious bouts of depression. These past two weeks were largely started by two really shitty days and he just has not gotten out of the funk since and it’s arguably getting worse. He’s not wanting to talk to his friends or me that much, he’s not playing video games, he didn’t get out of bed till 6pm yesterday, and he’s been super argumentative (not mean, just argumentative). I’ve tried talking for our nightly goodnight conversations, seeing if he wants to watch a movie together via discord, and playing games on steam with his friends. Nothing is really seeming to make a dent. He has good moments, like having fun while playing a game with the group of us but it is generally short lived. 

I’m completely at a loss for what I should do. I’ve handled depression through most of my friends and even gone through it myself but it’s been a long time and it was never long distance. Helping and being there for someone over the phone is really difficult and I just want to do better. Luckily, he is coming to visit this weekend so I think that will be a much needed pick me up that can hopefully get him out of the funk. 

Seeing a doctor is not currently an option. Anyone have any suggestions?

230,"Hey everyone.

**Background/Context**: There is this girl that I'm really into and have the intention of dating. I briefly met her last year and talked to her for like 10-15 minutes, but I didn't crush on her at the time (no introductions were made back then either). A couple months later into summer I started thinking about her and knew I wanted to get to know her/date her. We ended up having the same Biology class and I got to introduce myself to her finally, while she did the same. We talked for a good amount of minutes after that and I got to talk to her for most class days after that. Unfortunately, I only have the class twice a week so I'm short on opportunities. Sometimes I don't get to talk to her while sometimes I do, but recently I have been able to talk to her every class for a certain amount of minutes.

**My Relationship With This Girl**: I would say we are ""friends"" but not ""GOOD"" friends. Like we know about each other's classes, majors, extracurricular stuff (she does soccer while I do band) and we ask each other about it. She likes to laugh at my jokes or when I fool around about things. I also compliment her (*WHEN IT IS NECESSARY, NOT AS A SIMP LOL)* on things like soccer whenever she doubts herself and I try to encourage her. However, I haven't joked about her directly at all. I don't feel we're at that stage yet where I can make fun of her playfully. She's a very smart, sweet, and kind person overall.

**IMPORTANT THING I DID**: A few days ago, she had a soccer championship and she and her team lost to another team who act like a bunch of jackasses. Her entire team came off the field crying (of course because of passion and sadness) when it was over. I saw her walking off and I waved. She was in tears and said hi to me and she said my name (points for that because I have a hard name to remember for most people) and I gave her a high-five (I didn't want to hug because I didn't know if it was appropriate). I told her she played amazingly, that she shouldn't feel discouraged, and not to worry about the other team (and other good words). She thanked me for supporting her in the band and I told her it was no problem at all and how I wish I could do what she does. She told me how much her team hates the other jerk team and that's why they were crying. Finally, after many words exchanged, I told her I didn't want to keep holding her up and said my goodbyes. Everything I experienced at that point almost made me tear up. I couldn't stand to see her cry.

I say this was important because when I comforted her, nobody else came to talk to her. It seemed to be only me. After I left I turned my head and she was alone. I wished to have stayed longer but didn't want to be an annoyance to her. While I did that because she’s my friend and I care, I’m just hoping I made a good impression on her at least.

**MY FINAL QUESTION AND POINT**: Now here's the thing. I want to date this girl and get to know her even better, but I want to do it RIGHT. I don't know what to do now. Ask her to coffee? Talk to her more first before I do that? I really really like her and want to make sure I do everything properly, so what's some good advice?

**TL;DR**: I really like this girl who I'm good acquaintances with, but don't know what to do next to further our relationship.",13Nov2019,1

Shortly after that, he made out with me, hooked up, whatever you want to call it, and then he stopped talking to me. After that, I became very insecure with myself and I feel as if I am still recovering from that experience today, and maybe I always will.

Recently, I've been messaging with a guy who seems really nice, and seems like he cares about me. He's very flirty, seems like he loves talking with me, but I cant help thinking, ""What are his intentions with me?"".

233,"I have this friend, who I was so close with last school year. We loved each other, helped each other, took care of each other, she felt like more than a best friend. Recently though, at the start of this school year to now it feels like we've drifted a lot. The problem isn't that we aren't as close as before, because that was a special time when both of us were vulnerable and in need of help, and we found each other and became friends. The problem is that now it doesn't really feel like we're friends.  

We don't really talk to each other anymore, and we text each other a bit, but not as much as before. She doesn't want me helping her with things anymore, and she doesn't like to do anything together anymore. She doesn't care about me the same way, and I'm not saying she has to, but it feels unusual when last year she would force me to tell her about my problems and now she stays completely silent. She doesn't feel the same way when I ask her if things feel any different, and she said it'd be okay if we stopped talking.

I don't know if I'm overthinking this, but we were super close last year and now it's like I met her weeks ago. I don't know if I did anything wrong, and she's not making it any easier, but again I'm not saying she has to. My assumption is that last year, we were both stressed and needed someone, and we both fit each other and that's why we were so close, but now there's nothing to worry about, and so there's no reason to talk. I guess that's fine if it's her choice, but I don't think there is a point in being friends if I can only be friends for a third of the year. What do I do?",13Nov2019,1

Yesterday i saw my oral surgeon and he thinks the tooth next to it #12 is infected and prescribed me antibiotics and told me to go to my dentist for a second opinion. Today i saw my dentist and he took an X-ray which showed possible signs of infection in both the implant and the tooth next to it. My oral surgeon thinks it’s the tooth next to it that’s infected and my dentist thinks it’s the implant and the infection is spreading to the tooth next to it.

On Sunday Jack who I've known for about 2 years messaged our group chat that is usually inactive. I also want to note that he lives in a rough area and gets into trouble quite often while I am just casual and don't like to get into confrontations. We only met due to work and are very very different people. Since we both left we have only met once since. Jack claimed that someone(Billy) we used to work with a about a year ago had sent his girlfriend dirty images of himself and insulted their child together. He sent some screenshots into the group that showed the chat including the images. It was definitely Billy in the images but it appeared to be a different account to his main one. Multiple people have been talking about it and if it is actually billy but some of us are unsure. Jack said he would take it to the police and that was it.



Well today jack put a message in the group chat directed at me, asking if I can take him to the accused guys house(Billy) then the police station. He also claimed  that he called the police and they said to come in tomorrow and they could trace the harassers facebook account within minutes(this sounds very off). I replied saying I don't know where Billy lives and jack says its ok because he knows where it is. Jack asked me again if I will take him so I say yeah. I will be with another friend most of the day so I said he will probs be there too to take them. But then jack replied saying I should come alone so he can bring his girlfriend and his daughter so they can look Billy in the face when they talk to him. Then straight after asks me to get billys address from my old work mate even though he said he knew where he lived. I thought it was a bit odd but just left it be. Said I'd talk to him tomorrow and that was that. 



When I was going through my Facebook feed jack had made a new post with more recent screenshots of the chat that from the guy harassing them. He didn't say anything about them to us in the group. I went through them but somthing stood out to me. Jack accused the guy harassing them of being me. They also messaged them ""myname how are you doing"". Just seeing that reminded me of how awkward jack has been with me over the past few days. I initially brushed it off at first and told him if hes feeling down he can always talk to me. But now I'm not so sure if that's the reason why. Am I being over the top here or should I just not meet up with him? I feel like he thinks it's me behind it and I dont know if it would be safe meeting up with him.

236,"I’m looking for guidance. I’m new to relationships. Please don’t assume that I have bad intentions or want to dump my girlfriend. If relevant, we are both women, and have been dating for one year. 

I have a pretty stable sense of who I am and what I want out of life. I have career goals, and take steps to keep growing in areas I want to improve. I’m action-oriented - for example, today when I was getting sick of the food in my town, I decided to go to a random small restaurant and try it. I’m also optimistic and relatively confident. It has taken me time to get to this point but now that I’m here, I feel like I’m proud of myself. 

My girlfriend is in a very different spot. She has no idea who she is or what she wants. She is feeling that she’s getting older and feeling pressure to lock down a passion, but finding one has been tumultuous and difficult for her. She gets down on herself and her prospects often, and does not really have many people she talks to other than me. She is a dreamer, but one without much motivation or confidence. She is up and down a lot. 

There are lots of things we do have in common. We’re both adventurous. We have similar taste, like debate, and have creative interests. However, I’ve been realizing that my adventurous traits come from wanting to have fun and explore, while hers often come from wanting to avoid things. I feel that I am more grounded, and more optimistic. 

Sometimes I don’t know what’s normal or how to handle a situation, but I feel a disconnect. I can understand the feeling as I was in similar shoes to her a few years ago. Advice?

I’m a freshman in high school and I’ve had my heart set on a job for a while: accounting. Now I see that that job could become unnecessary due to ai and machine learning. I love to do math and could choose a separate job. I also love film just as much and even more than math. I know it would be easier to go into math because that would probably get me a better job, but I want to go into film. Should I go for a math career or film? I am a freshman also so I have time to think, but I could use some advice.
1. Do what I want despite the risk of being unable to escape debt
2. Go for the more profitable route but risk resenting it.

239,"I had had this cat since I was 6. She had always been there, everywhere we went, the couple times we moved houses, always slept with me, and sat on my homework, and was by my head when I was sick. She was ""my"" cat, as in she spent the majority of her day with me and enjoyed being with me the most.

I am a hugeeee fan of cats, and to lose her really struck me hard not only because of that but because it happened so fast. She started vomiting about 2-3 weeks ago, then stopped eating and drinking last week, then started vomiting blood and her urine was dark a few days ago, then within 24 hours she couldnt walk, she was foaming at the mouth, her eyes were sunken in, she was wetting herself, her body temp was lowering as her ears and paws were cold, etc. And she died in my bedroom, because during that night I told myself that if she were to die that night, 1) she wouldnt be alone and 2) she should be in my room because she spent so much time there. And, well, i woke up a little bit before 6 am the next morning and felt for a heartbeat/breathing, and there wasnt any. Then i lifted her arm, and it was stiff. We buried her in my backyard.

I dont want to be at home at all now because I just keep getting reminded of her. Her fur is still all over my things. I miss having her around and hearing her meow and purr and now all I have is pictures and videos. I've been spending lots of time with my boyfriend together at my dad's house. I feel more comfortable sleeping there, since she died on my bed at my mom's house, where I live most of the time. 

Regardless, I'm glad she isnt suffering anymore and died knowing she was loved up until her very last moment, since she had me there sleeping next to her. She had gone to the vet on Friday, got more ill and died on saturday night/sunday morning in the middle of the night, and monday we got the test results back saying that she had had advanced thyroid disease. We arent getting another cat because my stepdad wont allow it, and my dad isnt allowed to have animals in his apartment. I find cats to be very therapeutic and calming and now I dont have one, especially *my* cat, yes I can see my friends' cats, but when its 12 am and I'm sad and trying to go to bed I just wish that I had a cat (specifically her, but obviously that cant happen of course) with me.

I hate feeling miserable at home and I hate wanting to just lay around at my dads and cuddle with my boyfriend more than anything else. I havent told my therapist (who is there for something completely different, aka me getting out my feelings about my abusive ex and his assault on me and my anxiety)  because I dont see her until Thursday.

I feel I am in an extremely weird place in my head and life currently, I have a job and go to school no extra curricular activities but I do hangout a fair amount with friends when I’m not working (20 hours a week). I feel lost I don’t know what my passion is the more I think about it, I think I’d enjoy business that’s what I tell everyone but maybe that’s  because that’s what I’ve seen around me? It does seem intriguing to be interacting with people everyday and what not but I’m not 100% sure if that’s me or not, maybe I need to wait for trial and error I’m not sure.

I know I’m smart and I know if I took the time to do the things I needed to do I could achieve high marks but I don’t. The reason? I just don’t want too. I’d prefer to have quick entertainment, quick results. I know life doesn’t work like that but it’s how it is for me right now. I’m not sure if I lack motivation or I have some sort of handicap.

It’s Wednesday morning and I still feel like shit and haven’t slept properly. I don’t think I’m going to school. At this point my mom thinks I should prioritize work over my exams (like go to work even tho I have a day off that’s meant to be used for studying for this exam). 

She grew up with a mom that hardly EVER let her stay home from school, no matter how sick she felt. My job is very new and it’s only my fourth shift but it’s very customer based and I’m not allowed to sit down. I have to walk around all the time and interact with customers as much as possible. 

Today, there’s a meeting too, which isn’t mandatory since we don’t get paid, but my boss wants us to attend as many as possible. It’s meetings about the brands we have in store. This means my shift is technically from 14-20.10 and maybe a little later. I’ll be home at around 22.00. The meeting doesn’t start until an hour after my shift ends and I won’t get paid for that time or the meeting.

242,"I matched with an old high school classmate on bumble. We hung out once and I was under the impression it was going to be casual. We went out for drinks and at the end of the night, we kissed but nothing more. It went really well and he said he’d love to take me out on a date next time. We made plans for this week, and I’ve been feeling as though this isn’t as casual as I’d initially thought it would be. I’m used to just going over and banging it out and that’s my usual definition of casual. I’m not used to going out on dates and and he doesn’t try to make out, just kiss. It’s nice for sure and I enjoy his company, but I’m just a little confused. 

Anyways, that’s the context. It’s been a while since I met up with my fwb so I was going to text him because needs, but my friend said that I would feel really guilty if things ended up working out with this guy from high school and I slept with someone else. I guess I’m confused because I was under the impression it was casual aka we weren’t exclusive but since we didn’t go any further than kissing and we’re going on actual dates (dinner, drinks, etc and he insists on paying for everything) I’m wondering if he’s actually looking for something more? So I guess that’s where my question comes in: would it be wrong to meet up with my fwb with this context? I feel like it’s still so soon and therefore, not a big deal but my friend thinks it’s disrespectful and not worth it. He could very well be sleeping with other people as well no?

246,"Before I say anything, if there's a different more fitting community this could go in, please tell me and I'll post over there instead. I don't use reddit a lot so I just went with the first obvious option that came up and that's here. Throw away account obviously.

I don't know how much information I should be giving, I always feel like my treatment isn't ""as bad as others"" to be considered neglect. I was never hit, but I was yelled at a lot for, anything really. For the last 5 years I was living in a house with 7 people in it, with 2 bedrooms and piles of junk everywhere. Mom frequently wasn't home, preferring to spend time with her boyfriend, and while she was an amazing cook, she choose not to (saying she has no energy) and ordered fast food 99% of the time. My mom's not a drug addict or alcoholic, although she has been smoking for years. My dad died in 2015 so I can't get any help from him.

 As soon as I could after high school graduation, I moved into college. I left alot of stuff behind in my rush to get out. I've been here for 9 weeks give or take and Thanksgiving break is coming soon. I made the mistake of telling her I'm going home on the first day of the break. She thinks I'm staying for Thanksgiving, but I'm only going to get my leftover stuff (that she refuses to mail to me) and leave immediately. Similarly, she got ahold of my school's academic calendar and expects my to spend the whole (1 month) winter break there. I don't want to ever go back, and just getting my stuff is pushing my boundaries.

I know the best advice is going to be talk to her directly about how I feel but I'm honestly scared of her. Again she's never hit me, at least not that I remember but I've got very spotty memory. But she yells a lot about anything and everything and is a very loud person, and that voice always scares me, even if I know she's not going to physically hurt me. I never want to go back, I don't even want to talk to her, and I've been advised by multiple friends to block her but I just can't bring myself to. I'll appreciate any advice in this situation.

Since forever I wanted to create educational content on youtube. For more than one year I have been in the process of ""start but not finish"", and It became to irritate me. I really cannot finish one simple video because of the fear that it will be not as good as the ones that I see on youtube. 

I have very basic equipment but people are talking that the **value** of the content is important, and I believe that I do have that value, but the production staff is the one that is holding me back.

I don't know how to overcome this step, and I believe that buying more expensive equipment would not help.

I developed a crush on her and although I’m the worst when it comes to picking up hints I think at least part of her likes me back (things like catching her looking at me and her smiling when I came over but it was in the sense of I don’t know if it was just happy to see me as a friend or what) . Unfortunately she quit and moved about 20-30 minuets from where I live to go to university. We’ve kept in contact through Instagram for about 5-6 months now and we message every day or every other day. I would really like to ask her out but the only way I really have to do it is over Instagram which i know is lame but I don’t mind too much because if she says no it’s a bit less painful.

I’m an only child with loving parents, and for many years I was severely bullied, which isn’t unusual.  I was always the weird kid and stuff. It led to the development of body dysmorphia. I’ve done stuff like almost used scissors to remove parts I hated of myself, I’ve exclusively worn clothes that disguise parts, etc. I rapidly gained like 80+ Pounds in a year.

This year I lost the weight I gained last year and have done a lot of self maintenance. Read self help books. I worked and paid for liposuction for the part of my body that was my main source of dysmorphia. I realized it wouldn’t solve my problem, but it alleviated a lot of issues for me. I’ve even been contacted by a few major modeling agencies

Last weekend my sister(16f) said that she heard that I didn't want to go on the trip and asked me why. I told her the same reason, and she told me it wasn't really a good enough reason to miss out on an entire vacation, and that my family would be separated from extended family(different hotel and cars) since most of them are going drinking. This made me rethink my decision, but I still can't really make a choice.

The reasons I would want to go is because I spend 90% of my time in my room on my computer (the other 10% is school, and I don't have friends I hangout with outside of school), and I really want to spend time outside of the house. I also haven't been to a beach in a really long time.

The reasons I wouldn't want to go is because I feel like I would kinda be a burden since I'm young. I feel like my older siblings would have to always be watching over me, making sure I don't get lost or something. I also feel like I'd ruin their fun, because I have social anxiety and idk how to really joke around or act like I'm having fun.

Also, a few hours ago I asked my mom of it was too late to say I wanted to go, and she said she'd have to book the flight soon, to ensure I get on the same flight with family. She also said she was worried if I'd just be alone during the vacation, because during most family gatherings I'm always alone, and the family that's at the family gatherings is the family that's going to be at the vacation.",13Nov2019,1
256,"I’m currently studying in France (From Canada) which is something I’ve wanted to do ever since my year exchange here during high school. Things have been going relatively well however I am only now becoming aware of how different the French mentality is. What brought me to write here is an event that happened a few days ago involving a student from my university. He lit himself on fire in front of a public university cafeteria building and is now on life support at the hospital. This has led to protests across the country and even violent ones in the city I’m in (Lyon). They are fighting for more money from the gouvernement  each month because students are unable to live comfortably off of how much they currently receive. For context, each student who decides to study at a public university in France is entitled to between 100€ and 500€ a month from the gouvernement, depending on their financial situation. On top of this students only pay 175€ a year for tuition, so one is basically payed to attend school here. This particular student attempted to immolate himself because the gouvernement took away his monthly grant due to him failing his second year of university twice in a row (which is basic procedure).  In the letter he posted to Facebook beforehand, he blamed the gouvernement, two ex-presidents, “the rise of fascism” amongst other things. He also blamed his poor quality of life on the insufficient amount of funds given to him by the gouvernement. As a foreign student I feel like I’m the only one who recognizes how privileged French students are to begin with  (avoiding 7000$+ yearly tuition, student loan debt, receiving hundreds each month simply for studying...). It makes me sick that everyone who surrounds me is outraged by a level of  privilege people around the world, even friends of mine back home, would dream of. Then just the act of him burning to the edge of death in front of students eating lunch, upsets me hugely. I was settling in to life here, but I feel now as though I am very much out of place.

259,"Throwaway because duh  
TL;DR at the bottom  


A few months ago I \[M29\] started talking to a \[F23\] coworker, and to me it seemed like we were hitting it off. This was a big step for me, because I am socially anxious and this was the first girl I've shown interest in for a long time (to put it in perspective: the last time I've dated before this girl was in 2015, and that was a one-month fling that I regret). I genuinely thought it was heading in the direction of a relationship, and I got a little anxious and impatient. Long story short, after a few outings of just me and her, I started pressing on the idea of us dating, to which she never said no because she wanted time to heal her soul because she got out of a relationship a few months prior to us hanging out and found out shortly after that her ex was cheating most of the time. I get that. I tried giving her space. We continued to hang out and chat and stuff. Never sexual, more platonic. It was around two months ago that I came to the conclusion that, although she was ""my type"" and I absolutely enjoyed our time alone together, we didn't have all too much in common, and I should stop pursuing her. I've tried, but I've always had her on my mind.

About a month ago I got really impatient. I told her I couldn't get her off my mind, and I honestly don't know why. My mind was plagued with thoughts like how she was doing, whether she would enjoy a certain activity, reminiscing about that time we were at Chipotle, stuff like that. I also said that friends were telling me to move on and date other people, and to not get hung up on someone. She said she couldn't help me because she was still sad. I said I know she couldn't help, that I was just telling her I was always thinking of her, I misread some signs I thought she was throwing out there, and I'd try to move on and we could still hang out.

Since that day, she has tried to avoid me and avoid eye contact as much as possible, and to an extent I avoid her (it's doable because we work in different departments, but sometimes unavoidable because part of my job is to cross through her department several times a day). It's helped to an extent, but the thoughts are still there. There's an uncomfortable tension I could feel when she's working, and I feel it's all because I said I couldn't get her off my mind. Over messages, it's been absolute radio silence. A mutual friend a few weeks ago said she's ""trying to let us cool it"", and I agree, I made it get a little heated, the break was necessary. But a few days ago the friend said she's open to hanging out again as long as I'm okay (the next planned hang out is a group of 4, so less awkward but still awkward). And frankly, I don't know if I am.

Here's where I need advice. I've come to terms with the fact that boys and girls can be friends and not be in a relationship. I'm not sorry for thinking about her, and I know it'll take time for me to fully stop thinking. I want to keep her as a friend, and I know the resounding advice is going to be somewhere along the lines of ""best to just end the friendship, you're just going to end up even more broken"". I want to stay friends with this girl because I enjoyed spending time with her. In advance of us hanging out again, what (if anything) should I message her? Should I apologize for the radio silence and the avoidance? Am I being a fool for trying to keep the friendship going? I want my friend back, guys.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I asked a coworker to hang out, she thought it was platonic, I got impatient and asked if we could move to dating faster. I can't stop thinking about her, but I still want to be friends. We haven't talked for about a month. She's down to hang out again ""if I'm okay"". What should I message her before hanging out again?",13Nov2019,1
260,"My bf and I are having a party we have every year at our place. The girl in question is the gf of my bf’s best friend. Before any of this happened, I drunkenly kissed her once at a party where everyone was drinking and immediately apologized when I realized what I did. That’s the only thing I can think of that would make her say the things she’s said. Maybe that ties into this. 

She mentioned a threesome to my bf and telling him “your gf doesnt have to know”. I have been told to take this as a joke, but I don’t believe it, I think peace was just trying to be kept. hen at the beginning of this year she tells my bf she hates me more than she hates her ex bf. She called my happy relationship stupid. Anyone who likes me is stupid. That I need to grow up after I got upset at the threesome thing. Told my bf “we’re good as long as she doesn’t touch me again”. Messaged him “i need attention, my bf isnt giving me any.” She messaged all these thing to my bf. 

I told him i didn’t like that they were talking especially when she says these things about me. So he kinda distanced himself from her. A while later she messages him “its funny we’re talking less than 24 hours after I bitched to people we’re not allowed to talk because someone has mental issues” About a few days after that my bf tells her he’s not going to message her anymore because her last conversation made him feel like shit. Her reply to that is “i honestly don’t even remember that conversation but sorry”. 

We have talked to her bf since then that we don’t want her around at our place. As a result I’ve only seen her once and that was on a trip someone else planned.

262,"I'm a 19-year-old transgender girl, as some of you may already know. 

My significant other, who I won't name for privacy's sake, is 16 years old. 

Her mother (single mom) is aware of us being together and is okay with it, and so is her brother. In fact, I'm quite good friends with her brother. 

Anyways, is this morally wrong? And is it legal? I feel like I've heard before that if a minor's parents gave consent for their child to date someone older, then it's legal. But I can't find that anywhere on the internet. I've tried Google, searching through law ""books"" (pages that state American laws), everything I could think of, really. I'm a bit scared that this isn't the case, and that I'm committing a crime by being with the one that I love. 

Does anyone know?? And please, link me a page that says it is, if possible.

Note: I have not asked for or performed any sort of sexual interaction with her as of yet, and I don't plan to until she is above the age of 18. I have not asked her for ""nudes"" (and probably won't, because I don't understand the big deal behind that. It's biology (I think), people. Everyone has sexual organs.

266,"I'm a college student in the US. This is my first term, and everything is going great!

... Except one month into college, thousands of miles away from home, I had to go to the emergency room and get emergency surgery. I'm very fortunate that I had supportive doctors and nurses that helped me get in and out as fast as possible so I wouldn't have to withdraw from the school. The school itself was also incredibly helpful in getting me to transition back into being a student. 

The one problem came when i, understandably, missed a ton of class while in the hospital. Most of my professors were incredibly chill. But my language professor, oh boy. 

For context, I took this particular language in high school. I intentionally enrolled in a level below where I am supposed to be because the level that I should be in isn't offered until the spring and I don't want to lose my speaking ability. My professor didn't appear to have an issue with this until I started missing class. 

Less than two weeks after my surgery (and keep in mind, the normal recovery time for this particular surgery is 4 weeks), I got an incredibly hostile email from him saying that I needed to be coming to class and that I wouldn't be able to make up anything I missed for credit unless i got a doctor's note. Which I had. 

I went to the dean of the college about it.  He told me that he would touch base with the professor. Cut to the next time I had class, and the professor pulled me into the hallway and basically told me that I needed to take the class seriously, I had behavioral issues, I was not smart, and other horrible things (he criticized me for participating in class discussion too). He also accused me of skipping class because I didn't care. And he told me that he thought I was faking recovery because he had had this surgery too and he only took a week to recover. It forced me to share details about my medical history with him that I would not normally be comfortable sharing with mpeople in an attempt to legitimize my situation. 

Long story short, it's been a bit of time since then and although I have the dean of the college and my advisor on my side, the situation isn't getting any better. It's shitty because I really care and have a passion for  this language and this is the only professor who teaches it (gotta love being at a small college, eh?). It's just getting to the point that this professors continued abuse is affecting my physical health: I'm having chills and I've lost a TON of weight. And I'm concerned that the college might not do a ton to prevent this sort of thing from happening to another student. This is apparently far from the first time this professor has abused a student in this way and has escaped with zero consequences. 

So, what can I do to further assert myself and make sure this doesn't happen again? Is there anything I can do? 

TLDR: I have a shitty, abusive professor and I'm afraid he's going to get away with this and be able to continue abusing students.",13Nov2019,1

269,"Hey everyone. I'm 19 years old I've lived in Michigan my whole life and I recently just moved to Florida 2 months ago for a lot of personal reasons and one being school. These two months have been the loneliest and saddest months of my life. I feel like I have lost everything moving over here. I feel like I left behind my friends, the place I called home, and my whole life. The place I'm staying at does not feel like home and I haven't met anyone new at all because of my anxiety. I'm so afraid of being judged and I'm afraid showing my true self will drive people away. I'm constantly worried about where my life is going and this sadness that I have ever since I moved have impacted everything in my life.

270,"I have known this person since we were 14, we are now 22/23. I used to have a huge crush on him, and he was part of my group of friends, but he was quite awful to me, he called me ugly and boring when we were kids. We stopped talking/being friends for most of high school but started hooking up a couple years ago, it would usually just be a summer fling until we got sick of each other or I started catching feels. 

We made amends and met up a couple weeks ago, he was being much nicer to me than usual, affectionate and open, which was very out of character. I think he realized he needed to be nicer to me if he wanted to keep me around. When we hung out, he confided in me that he believes he is a sex addict, and when we were in grade 9- he jerked off in a school assembly. He told me the teacher sent him to the back because he was acting up, then he got an erection because there were girls dancing on stage in skimpy clothes, so he masturbated through his jeans until he finished. I wasn’t sure how to react in the moment. I am very empathetic and non-judgemental. So we just kind of laughed about it, and I brushed it off. He mentioned after that he should talk to his therapist about it, but I don’t think he has a therapist, just a psychiatrist who gives him depression meds. Looking back on it, I am not sure if he sounded remorseful about it. More so, I got the feeling that he just knows he’s a little fucked up.

I didn’t necessarily even have the intention to hook up with him, I genuinely just wanted to hang out, but we ended up hooking up by the end of the night. Also, its important to mention, he told me about his friend who just turned 20, I’ll call her Emily, apparently awhile ago, they had a threesome with our mutual friend, I’ll call him James. 

A few days later I hung out with him again and we hooked up. Later, he tells me “I think I fucks with autistic people” (meaning I think I get along with autistic people). I asked him “Who do you know who’s autistic?” and he told me his friend Emily, and his ex. I am not sure where on the spectrum they are, but it gave me a weird feeling.

I hung out with our friend James. And James told me he was sick of him, and when they had the threesome, it felt like he was just letting him take advantage of Emily. From what I know, it was her idea and she wanted it.  But if she is on the spectrum, it does mean there is a certain lack of social/communication ability. I told him about the assembly thing, and he had no idea. I’m wondering why he told me, but not his closest male friend. James ended up telling me that our friend tried to FUCK HIS CAT. I didn’t ask for details. Didn’t want to know. That was the straw that broke the camels back. I was SHOOK. Like that’s just fucking weird and gross, no matter how hormonal you are, who in their right mind tries to fuck their cat? And I also just feel super weird about him “fucking with” autistic people, because my intuition is telling me he just likes the control/power.

Anyways, James ended up deleting him off everything and isn’t going to be friends with him anymore, and I don’t think I can either. We had great sexual chemistry and all. But after learning that I can’t look at him the same way. I just feel super weird about cutting connections with him without explaining why or ghosting him.  He clearly trusts me to some extent if he confided in me about what he did, so maybe we could have some sort of conversation about this. I just don’t know where I would start, its easy for people like that to get defensive.",13Nov2019,1

275,"So I'm a pretty laid back fun loving person however I'm also relatively academically gifted. I'm a senior in highschool and have taken my fair share of hard classes. Looking at colleges I figured I should take a few AP's to hopefully get enough credits I can graduate a semester early and save some money. 

I've always been more left brained (numbers and patterns) so I took 2 semesters of Calculus, 2 semesters of Calc based Physics, and kind of an intro to psych class. I can handle the work load but it's not enjoyable. I've been ""that kid"" all my life I've rarely gotten below an A in any class I've done a sport every season, I'm section leader of our drumline, NHS, the works. So I'm used to working hard but deep down I've always hated it. Last year I took an electrical apprentice type class our school offers and filled out the rest of my schedule with fluff classes. Around this time I found rock climbing which is filled with very down to earth and enjoyment/fulfillment based people rather than the goal oriented work a holics I've been surrounded by. I realized that's how I want to live my life not chasing some stupid, essentially irrelevant, grade or number. I don't need that $100k a year engineering job, just one that will pay the bills and that I really enjoy.

So this is where my problem occurs. I mistakenly dumped a boatload of work on myself for the next 7 months just before I realized I don't actually care about any of it. I can't drop or fail the classes because although I don't care for them I'm still a take pride in your work person but at the same time I'm a don't do something if you don't enjoy it kind of person. So I'm torn. Is there anything I can do about this? I can handle the work load I'm just generally miserable as a result. Do I just suck it up and adjust for next time or can I fix this now so I'm not in a rut until May?

Tl;Dr: I'm taking 3 AP classes, 2 of which are the hardest our school offers. I can handle the work load but hate my lifestyle as a result.",13Nov2019,1
276,"&amp;#x200B;

(17F) For the last month my mental health has declined very badly and more than I've ever experienced before in my life. There are several reasons: my aunt died of cancer only a few years ago, my family is not nearly the same and is almost broken up, I had a terrible falling out with my lifelong friends, my medical condition greatly effects my self esteem and leads to extremely negative feelings sometimes, my boyfriend lives in a different country and is struggling to immigrate, and now my Mom is pushing toxic behavior onto me and steadily ruining my mental health even more. On top of all of this, I'm so anxious and can't make it to the new school I'm going to, I've been pretending that everything is okay and going to this new school for two months and now I'm realizing how traumatized I am, and falling apart. 

Today I saw my therapist, and unlike last time, I felt horrible after and did not feel better. I felt super anxious and just overall bad. I was told by my doctor to find a pelvic floor physiotherapist so I wanted to get that done, however my Mom thought it was rude of me to be doing that instead of having tea with her and my grandma at the table. So she started saying I was ""acting crazy and being rude"", I then just started crying saying I was sad about my fucked up body (like I said this condition really hurts my self esteem) and then they both said ""well be happy you are just alive, do you think your aunt had any treatment she could get? don't expect any sympathy because you won't get any"". I was so crushed and felt so alone, I went to my room and I started having a panic attack (I get them frequently whenever I'm upset) and I couldn't get off the floor because I was so dizzy and I felt like I couldn't feel my limbs. My mom bursts open the door and starts saying ""you aren't having a panic attack, just stop it! just stop it!"" and ""you are just being dramatic this is ridiculous"" meanwhile, I'm gasping on the floor and sobbing. She then ripped into me how ""you had such good grades, I should have pushed you more to keep going to school, I've always done everything I can for you and it's just not enough"" and ""I've gotten a therapist for you and am switching schools for you and you still aren't happy!"".

I gave up talking, and will not talk anymore to her right now. Just a week ago she said that my alternative schooling would be a great thing for me and was very supportive, but then when something happens that she doesn't like, everything is flipped around on me and used against me. My words mean absolutely nothing and if I try to make a point or say anything ""I'm being disrespectful"". I feel horrible, I feel lower than fucking dirt. I've never felt this horrible in my life, I feel like a burden on my whole family and like I'm just someone to kick around since I'm in such a weak state right now.

I always used to think it was something everyone can do, but I'm starting to realise it's a talent I was born with. I did a corporate presentation in front of 400 people last year and people came up afterwards and said that they felt a comedic presence when I was on stage (I made a couple of jokes and simply did my boring professional bit for 5 minutes, it was a group presentation).

During school, my teacher once made me come up in front of class and do impersonations (famous people, other teachers, animals etc.). Despite being a class clown, I was a loner. Personally, I am not a fun person, I have depression and anxiety, but making people laugh has been a pretty easy thing for me. I don't know, in the back of my head, I always used to think people were laughing ""at"" me. And humour was always my defense mechanism. So I avoided making people laugh and being up in front of people, and instead started loner hobbies like hiking, climbing, working on cars, and joined the Army. After serving 2 years, I left and went into the corporate life, but every where I go people always say that I should use my talents (i can impersonate several Family Guy, South Park characters, Connor Mcgregor, Jason Statham, and numerous accents).

280,"I have been with my boyfriend for about a year and he has recently been attending board plan meetings, reading books, listening to tapes, has been to a 3 day seminar, &amp; weekly meetings at Starbucks with his “mentor”. It started off with him supposedly meeting a guy at Starbucks that he knows from town that is “super successful” &amp; wanted to know how he did it. Well one thing led to another &amp; he’s sucked in to Amway and the WWDB.... 

At first, I didn’t think anything of it because I was under the sole intentions this guy was supposed to be helping him with finances by giving him a book to read &amp; meeting up with him about it &amp; that turned out to not be the case. 

I finally started asking my boyfriend what he was doing &amp; what Amway &amp; WWDB even was, and he to this day still can’t give me an answer. All he knows is ONE couple retired before they were 30 &amp; his mentor is going to help him do the same... I immediately thought it was too good to be true &amp; did my own research, since he couldn’t give me an answer anyways. I found a bunch of negative things about Amway &amp; the WWDB &amp; about their practices on people. I see it in my boyfriend more &amp; more every time he attends one of these events. 

He wanted me to attend a 3 day seminar that was $150 PER PERSON to attend &amp; I told him not to even waste his money on me let alone him. After the 3 day seminar was over, he was 100% convinced that Amway and WWDB was legit &amp; he was all in. This didn’t sit well with me &amp; I have tried sending him links on this stuff &amp; he refuses to read them &amp; my coworker did Amway for two years, but he also refuses to listen to her because he believes she “didn’t try hard enough &amp; that’s why she failed”. 

He doesn’t sound like himself anymore &amp; everything that comes out of his mouth about Amway is definitely his mentor speaking for him. My boyfriend has tried to get me to read the first book that they give out &amp; I told him I couldn’t because I’m too busy with my classes &amp; homework. Every time we have a conversation he tries to slip in something about Amway &amp; it gets me heated. 

I recently sat at Starbucks with his mentor for over an hour talking about this business. I was really upset with my boyfriend because he had told his mentor everything we have talked/fought about before hand, so his mentor already knew everything to say &amp; it almost felt like it was being thrown back in my face. The conversation ended with his mentor wanting to schedule another 35 minute meeting with me to talk more about the business &amp; then eventually read the book so I could attend a board plan meeting... nice try... 

We have been in countless fights over this business &amp; I feel like our relationship is on the bitter end of things. I’m afraid his mentor is going to get more inside of his head that I am a negative influence on him, &amp; that we shouldn’t be together because I don’t want to be apart of Amway or anything that has to do with it. 

I told my boyfriend I would support him through this because it doesn’t sound like he’s giving up anytime soon, but I am not going to join &amp; be one of his “legs”, but that still doesn’t seem to be good enough for him or his mentor. 

Sorry for the long story, but that’s honestly my short version of it all.... is there anyone out there that has gone through this experience that can give me any advice?",13Nov2019,1

If he has trouble parking or finding a parking spot why doesn’t he just leave the vehicle that he parks in front of his garage out on the street so he can have parking anytime in front of his own garage? His trouble shouldn’t be my inconvenience. 
What else can I do if the landlord still lets his brother (neighbor) park in front of my garage and in my spot without asking when I pay good money to live here and park in my spots?",13Nov2019,1

Obvious throwaway,

It was now 6 years ago that my father sexually assaulted me (I was 11). I remember it so vividly and I believe it is the root of my now severe anxiety and depression.

I still live with my parents as I am only 17, and ever since this incident I have tried to distance myself from my dad as much as I can. Even so, it is difficult to do this living under the same household and it serves as a constant reminder of what happened. I have never told anyone else in fear of being ridiculed or even worse breaking my family apart but it’s had having to deal with it on a daily basis. My mom often gets mad at me for ignoring him or being rude but I can’t help but be hostile towards him. 

It was a one time occurrence and I often try to tell myself that it didn’t happen at all.

My question is what should I do to learn to accept what happened or forget about it?",13Nov2019,1
295,"Hello, 

Forgive me for my formatting/ grammar. 

I live in a duplex with very thin walls, sharing a wall with me is a same sex (two women) couple who I hear fight frequently. Like, probably at least 4 times a week. I can’t always make out the words they are saying but I can hear their tone of voices and sometimes they yell. I’m not trying to eavesdrop, it’s just literally impossible to ignore sometimes. I’ve knocked on the wall a few times when I was just trying to sleep and they stop, this isn’t too relevant but just for the record. Anyways, lately it’s been worse than usual and there’s been a few times it really sounded like one girl was harming the other and the other is making scared sounds. I try to get closer to the wall to make it out but I really can’t tell. I hear shit being knocked around and stumbling and I swear I heard one of them once saying “you’re hurting me”

This really bothers me, and if I had hard evidence of one being abused I would definitely report it. But since I haven’t seeeeen anything or been able to tell for sure, I’m really at a loss for what to do. I don’t really know what exactly I’m asking here, I just would hate to be suspecting this and then it turns out someone seriously gets hurt. 

I don’t know if it’s relevant, but they live with one other couple.",13Nov2019,1

Whatever, I'm fine with that, but I still worry for her a lot. Yes, it has been a while since we last talked, so stuff in her life could have totally changed, but I still worry. 

Last I had known, she was suicidal, still on a streak lasting years and years, and was stuck in a house with her abusive dad. Plenty of stress in her life, depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, the whole mile. I guess what I'm asking is, how do I help her, or get myself to stop worrying.

I'm looking for an apartment like those that you see sitting above, for example, Pike street in Seattle/Castro street in SF/maybe soho thirty years ago? Obviously those places are totally out of reach, but that's the vision. I'm wondering if anyone knows of a town (in the United States or not) that has older apartment buildings that are on a well-traveled street and have retail/restaurants on the bottom floor.

I think I’m experiencing the most stress thing in my life. 

I don’t know why but it starts from my classmate. We haven’t talked to each other in person but they hate me just because I can join in academic class straight away while they have to take an extra class for English to get into my class. If it’s just about that, I’m pretty sure I’m fine coz’ that is just their jealousy. BUT, when I messaged them today to ask about our college’s bank account and forgot to tag the one whom I asked details about the notification, they just asked me back with a weird tone ‘who are you asking ?’ And make fun of me coz’ I replied back one’s classmate name. ‘Oh, it wasn’t me’ ‘I didn’t see her tag that name’ ‘Oh, I must be blind’. All of those thing were so rude. I mean, it was my mistake but they don’t need to make it sounds worse like that. We are classmate. What’s wrong with not tagging who you want to ask? Maybe one of them know the answers. I don’t know. But they don’t need to be that childish. I feel like I’m getting attacked. I don’t want to start my freshman’s years with stupid thoughts of those young girls/kids (they prefered it)

 never get to travel, the thing is im 24 now ( from Vancouver) and i think im old enough to maybe travel and well fuck see the world for myself, id really like to see France or maybe go to Portland, i saw online that going to Portland could cost 4 grand for a month! I grew up poor and am a student now but just a couple years ago i made 10grand in as little as 3 months so at that price to live out my dreams why the fuck not, honestly had i known thats what i would have done with the money,4 grand seems more than reasonable, what are your thoughts on travelling and alone for that matter?

303,"I've been talking to this girl for about a month or so, and she is honestly one of the sweetest girls I've met. We've talked about dating but there were a couple reasons we've decide not to, at least not right now. Two major reasons being that I just got out of a serious relationship and the other being that she's a foreign exchange student and would be headed back to Germany in May. Anyway we've gone to a couple social activities together which might've been considered dates. And since we are still in highschool I usually walk her to one of her classes and I'll occasionally sit with her and her friends at lunch. I honestly thought everything was okay but recently I think the processes of ""ghosting"" has begun. Being left on delivered for 23 hours and then just receiving one snap to keep our streak. Although I can see her actively replying in a GC we are both in. Today and yesterday was the first in a couple weeks where I didn't walk her to class. A group of friends decided to hang out today and she was there, we didn't talk at all. Just a couple awkward glances here and there. Which is definitely not normal. After it ends she's sends a text ""sorry I haven't been replying I was having a busy week"" Which is most definitely not true to a certain extent as she was decently active in our group chat. Anyway, She hasn't opened that response either and that was over 4 hours ago. Where in that time has sent multiple snaps to our group chat. What do I do? This seems very out of character for her but it's  pretty clear its deliberate. Writing this out I feel like I probably know what to do or more like what not to do and probably should just let it go but hey, opinions from internet strangers never hurt.",13Nov2019,1
304,"I had a boyfriend in highschool who I was very close with. I dated him my senior year and we basically lived together at his house. I had drawers in his room etc. I am a very big hermit and we enjoyed our time alone hanging out and I would watch him play videogames. The relationship was good but he had a brother and super toxic friends of his brother who would constantly tell him that he needed to date someone else, or they'd talk about my body, his brother even once ganged up with a girl in the cafeteria to make me cry and spread a lie that I had apparently said about my boyfriend. This person was absolutely fixated on my boyfriend leaving me. All in all I ended the relationship because his brother and the brothers friends wouldn't stop saying shit to my boyfriend about me. To clarify I was very very shy and kind. I didn't ever start drama or anything. Plain and simple I didn't do drugs and they did. Like I smoked but that was it...they did more. He was upset about the breakup but I never told him the reason was his brother. I just told him I needed time. His brother was obsessed with him and It was his only sibling and I didn't want him to have anger towards him. A couple years later he committed suicide. It was absolutely devastating. I was so sad and I  had so many questions. I skipped out of the funeral out of fear that his brother and their friends would start shit at the funeral. Flash forward to almost 10 years later and my sister and his brother start dating... Now I didn't mention my sister in this story because she wasnt in highschool with any of us she was way younger. My sister is a townie type dates every guy from the small high school town we lived in I'm sure you know the type.  She knew this entire story about what his brother did to me and she STILL hit on him on FB ( oh and what's her one liner? I had a dream about your brother..a little background they never spoke)then she fucking dates him... They hook up he tells her basically that I'm the reason his brother is gone. He then uses her breaks her heart and she's suicidal. She cries to me saying that she thinks he broke up with her  to try to get revenge on me? I have fucking nightmares about this situation. I was healing as best as I could and my sister opened a mega mega wound by dating this terrible person. I knew that his brother and his friends would blame me. Hearing my sister confirm this made me sick. . I just want to move on and heal from this whole thing. My sister is very toxic and always has no boundaries ( has dated or hooked up with a ton of my friends) should I cut her out? I also do not want to feel responsible for his suicide. His brother was so insanely obsessed with him he would never leave him alone. I Know that dating for him was probably always a nightmare because of this.His brother is now  living in the woods in some cabin with another guy who my sister says he's obsessed with and they're together 247. He's a codependent on a whole nother level. I need help to heal from this situation. Can someone please offer advice on how to heal from this.

•Saying I’m on the wrong dosage of my antidepressant and should be on a different one (she is not a medical doctor). 
•When I told her I met a great guy, she said that is for her to decide (rubbed me the wrong way). 
•She has brought up God and projected her spiritual beliefs onto me.

I’ve never been in such a terrible state. Recently my gf of a year broke up with me and I’ve been completely clueless on the state of things. I honestly don’t want to live anymore.

I’ve always been an antisocial pleb and I somehow started dating an amazing girl. I was a senior in high school and she was a junior, and we had planned to stay together for a long time and worked out how we would do things when I got to college. The university I attend is only about 45 minutes away from the high school, so I thought things would be really easy and perfect.

But about a month into the semester she told me she had a “mental block” against me that she was trying to fight, and it was making her not like me as much. Essentially, she was unhappy with the relationship but said she didn’t want it to be that way. Eventually within two weeks of “trying” she broke up with me over text.

Naturally, I was devastated. But things are even weirder from here. She wanted to be friends immediately and we kept texting all day and night. During the break up she acknowledged the possibility that we would get back together eventually, but to not “bank” on it. Like I said, I’m an antisocial pleb so I have no idea how to interpret this.

Unfortunately, I was so much of an antisocial pleb that I didn’t make a single friend at university within the first month, and haven’t made one since. Texting has gotten rocky with her, she’s much less interested in talking and has finally deleted posts of me from her instagram (after a month). She still texts first as much as I do, though.

I have no friends and my once perfect grades are slipping. I really care about her and want to be good friends again, as now I feel like she’s only texting me out of pity. I don’t know what to do. I’m sorry if this is poorly written. She’s a good person, we were both each other’s first real relationships. I really need help.

None of my male relatives are bald so I never even thought about going bald specially at 19. I've read online and I've seen a lot of people say that the more it progresses the shorter you should cut your hair, which sucks since I love my hairstyle. I feel lost at first when I told my mom that I thought I was balding she laughed and told me I was ""overthinking"" it and I believed her since I tend to do that a lot. Now my mom is buying all sorts of hair products so I don't go bald. It's embarrassing to hear my relatives talk about me balding like I have cancer, I usually just make jokes about me balding and pretend I don't care but it fucking hurts, I don't want to go bald.

So basically I know this 14-year-old from a discord server I'm in. He DMed me that this bratty 13-year-old has been cyberstalking/harassing them for months. They've been stalking him, verbally abusing him/encouraging others to do the same, suicide baiting him and even death threatening him. As they said, the person told them that they were going to shoot him. Blocking hasn't worked because the harasser keeps block evading.

So naturally, I want to do what I can to help put a stop to this behavior. He's a good kid so I'm pissed that this has been happening to him for so long but I'm unsure of what the rational thing to do is.

As of now, my plan is to wait for him to collect the evidence and share it with me. After that, I'm going to tell the harasser's mother on Instagram what's going on and share the proof (the kid knew the mom's insta) and if she doesn't do anything I'm going to try to file an online police report because this is very much illegal.

328,"So, while playing with my step-daughter in the pool a couple weeks ago, I found out that my waterproof phone decided not to waterproof anymore (Galaxy Note 8). 

I am American, but currently living in Australia, and all my friends and family are back home. So, honestly, my phone is probably the most important item in my life atm, purely because it's how I keep in touch. I don't really use social media, just Reddit and occasionally IG to keep up with what's going on in friend's lives. 

So, being able to take good pictures is important. Also, I use my phone for Google Maps and stuff a lot, because... I'm not from here. Lol. I am using a legit Optus burner phone at the moment, and it won't even load Google Maps or the Hungry Jacks app or anything properly. 

So basically, I am asking for a $500 AUD burner phone. 

The complicated thing is because I am American, when I go to Telstra, or Optus, and ask for a contract with a new phone, they won't do it because my Visa expires between now and the end of the contract. I plan on being here for several years, and am applying for a permanent visa next, but that'll be between now and February, and is $7k on its own, so that is why I am trying not to buy a new phone outright. I know in a couple months, I'll be able to use my new visa to get a new phone with a contract, so I just need a phone to last me until then. 

I have no real preference for brand, but my partner wants me to jump on the iPhone bandwagon. 

So, looking for input from people who love their phones (or maybe a phone they don't necessarily have anymore, but used to love), think their phone would be good for my mostly limited needs (I am 30, but you could more just think of me as a cool grandma), and who paid a reasonable price for it. 

Thanks so much!",13Nov2019,1

About a month ago I made some tweets (on an account that's privated btw) that raised some concern because they made it seem as if I might hurt myself.  Really I was just being hard on myself and wanted people to reach out to comfort me.  The tweets I made were sent to the superintendent, leading to me having to talk with her.

334,"I really need advice on how to fix my brother's behaviour since my parents have different views on how to handle it and nothing is getting done. This has been going on for about 2 years 

My brother is 16 and he has been skipping school at least twice a week. My parents work full time and I also go to work and uni so no one is home to make sure he goes to school. We have tried dropping him off to school right at the gates but as soon as we drive off he walks out of school and goes home.

He prioritises video games over his schoolwork and is getting below average results in school. My mother has tried to take him to a psychologist for this issue but it hasn't worked at all. To stop him from gaming my parents take away his iPad but he says he needs it to study, which he does since his school uses a bring your own devices policy. He will just play games on the iPad whenever we give it back to him. My parents have a password for the family PC but he somehow keeps discovering the password and using it without permission.

He has stolen over $8000 from my mother in the last 5 years by taking her credit card from her purse and buying games and gift cards for himself. She has had to cancel over 7 cards in the last couple years but is too lazy to set up a PayPal even when I keep urging her to.

A few months ago he lit a fire in the middle of the school playground, and when asked why he did it he told the teachers he believed he was a pyromaniac and a psychopath.

My mother is far too lenient in her punishments, she will just tell my brother to stop and when she walks away he will continue to do whatever he wants.

My father is incredibly frustrated with his behaviour and has even threatened to hand my brother over to police for stealing money.

I am incredibly frustrated because I don't want my brother growing up to become a dropkick. My mother has told me before that I am the only hope for the family and that is an incredible amount of pressure for me to live up to.

I just really need some advice for both my parents and I. I have considered that my brother is depressed. My parents have taken him to a psychologist before but I don't know what they said about him, and he only went to a couple of sessions. 

Please, any advice would be helpful.",13Nov2019,1
335,"On mobile, I apologise for the formatting.

Tldr: my mother is absolutely insane and we can't figure out how to help her


Some backstory: I (27M) live in the US, I have 4 siblings ( 31F, 30F, 25M, 19M) and my mother (51F) and father (50M) have been separated about a decade. My parents are in shambles with no prospect of retirement for either of them. My father's net worth is likely in the negative and my mother hasn't truly worked for 30+ years, she has been a stay at home mother the majority of her life and she did an amazing job. We all were raised well, even during struggling times she was able to stay strong and provide a good life for us all despite financial hardships. My father used to make good money, but has struggled the last 13 years to gain that status back, he likely never will. 

When my parents divorced they went their separate ways and my father paid her alimony and child support for my youngest sibling. She never found a job in the years that followed, she even tried school for a semester before realizing she wasn't ready for that commitment. 

Since about 2005 my mother insisted that she was I'll. She had seen every Western medicine discipline she could and she was never diagnosed with anything definitive. She believed she had chronic fatigue syndrome and then fibromyalgia and then Candida. I'm pretty sure there were some more, but it was hard to keep up. She currently believes it's a combination of adrenal fatigue and like disease. She eventually got some medications for these in addition to insomnia medication.

Long story short, that didn't fix the problem. So after a lot of frustration from her, she decided to start seeing some alternative medicine practices. Her family have used these alternatives for some time, but never with a serious medical condition or anything like that. It seemed harmless with their utilization.


As the years passed, my father has been on a rollercoaster with his finances and eventually stopped paying my mother her alimony. I believe he was paying her 40k a year, which was all she was using to survive. She didn't save and she purchased many home remedies and supplements that were ridiculously expensive to help \""heal\"" her. With no job and no means of keeping her current place, she left to go live with her parents. My grandparents have been very gracious and have supported her for about 5 years now.

We have now hit a boiling point.  
With my mother not working, or having anything to keep herself busy with, she has embraced about every conspiracy you could think of, has declared herself a doctor, and apparently is the most educated individual who has ever lived. All because she \""researched\"". She is also quite manipulative and has somehow convinced everyone willing to help to cough up a ridiculous amount of money to her self medicated endeavors.

She has still been bearing this mysterious illness this whole time, so any mention of a doctor or anyone that might be able to help is immediately dismissed because they \""won't listen to her and they don't know what they are talking about\"". My mother's family have sunk countless dollars into supporting her and now it has gotten to the point where I think she is legitimately insane and unable to live in society as a contributing member. My siblings and I can't support her, we have growing families and we already have two parents' retirements we have to plan for. To try to support her and rehabilitate her is beyond our means and capability. I'm positive that if a hospital had to deal with her more than a week she would be declared mentally ill, but we can't keep her in the hospital long enough for them to care. We have submitted her twice now, against her will, and they have let her check out just a couple days after on both occasions. We have no say over her medical treatment because none of us have a medical power of attorney. She has called the police multiple times in hysterics as they take her to the hospital and it all ends the same.

We have tried to find housing options for her and Everytime she is put up in a hotel temporarily she doesn't make it a single night. She can't stay with us because we fear for the safety of our families, she keeps \""weapons\"" ( baseball bats, kitchen knives, etc.) Around her because she believes people are coming to kill her. She is then released, my aunt takes her in, and then she storms off because she can't stand the rules and expectations while living with them. The circle continues over and over and over. We have done this dance several times.

We just don't know what to do, she is refusing to actually get help, she thinks that she is sane and won't allow herself to get treatment. My siblings and I are convinced that she will bankrupt us all if we let her.

What can we do? How do we get her the help she needs when she doesn't want, or believe, that she needs it.",13Nov2019,1

337,"I typed out a long ramble of a post. Instead, I will be posting this one - a shorter ramble.

I [22F, USA] recently graduated with a major in Global Studies and have no idea what to do with my life. I regret every decision I've made in life, specifically those regarding my education. I am $70k in debt, currently have a low-paying restaurant job, am paying too much in rent, and have absolutely no aims, motivation, or goals for my life.

The answer is to go to therapy and get a better job, possibly in a different, more affordable city, but I have no idea what jobs to apply for. I like helping people. That's been my mantra for the longest time, I just wish I knew how to make money off of that without going to med school. I wish there was an option for someone to tell me what to do with my life.

Things about me: I enjoy cooking, driving, playing guitar, making people laugh, and discussing international affairs/politics. I'm good at giving massages and I'm vaguely interested in going to law school. I have years of experience waiting tables, a little in marketing for restaurants, and a bit of bookkeeping /administrative assistance for my dad's small business.

If I could have it my way, I would be a truck driver. Never talk to my friends or family again, make a decent chunk of change until the robots take over and screw me out of my hypothetical job, and listen to podcasts all day.

I don't have any figures of guidance in my life that I'm comfortable with turning to for things like this, so naturally I present my case to strangers on the internet.

I’m decent at small talk as it’s a skill I’ve developed but I don’t really enjoy it.

One was lying about something that was fucking true, some other minor stuff like stealing food (had ED, packing my own lunch caused panic attacks and I always compensated them afterwards. I know it’s frustrating and I will admit I was in the wrong here) I apologized for immediately and a bunch of really bad bullshit that I recently found out was completely fabricated. They told me that the entire school hated me and wanted me to kill myself while I was already suicidal. The fact that all the horrible shit that they said I did was all fake made me so fucking angry. I thought I was such a bad person I thought I had to atone. I tried to kill myself for this shit, I begged everyone to forgive me for A YEAR AND A HALF even though I did nothing wrong. They even made someone do it for them because they’re “scared of confrontation” but have no problem telling someone to kill themselves. I can’t even be around people anymore because I’m scared that they all hate me and want me dead. I still can’t even be around people and I’m always alone save for my parents and boyfriend. I want them to pay for what they’ve done. They made me hate myself so much I wanted to die. They deserve some of the pain I felt but I know that violence isn’t the answer. I need to go and get my backpack from my locker soon and I don’t know if I’ll be able to tolerate even seeing them without screaming or attacking them. I know it’s irrational.

345,"I have a tight knit group of friends that go back to high school. One of them is lovable idiot who has truly been one of the best friends I've ever made with my family even treating him like another son. One thing about him that's pertinent to this is he doesn't have very strong opinions on anything. He can swayed very easily one way or the other depending on whose speaking with him. He's gonna be getting married soon which originally I was in support of (I'm even in the groomsmen party), but I eventually learned he's apparently marrying a hardcore anti-vaxxer. Normally as with most of the dumber decisions he's made I writ it off as his life his choices, but that all changed when I learned they were also having a baby. While he may have had a choice in who he was marrying that kid does not have a choice in who raises them. A friend of mine has already tried talking to him about vaccines, but it seems like he has become anti-vaxx as well, most likely through his fiance. Critically he seems dead set on this stance as he now actively debates us on this and is not backing down which is out of character for him. Part of me thinks to let bygones be bygones as that kid is not my responsibility, but the empathetic part of me knows that kid's childhood is gonna be unnecessarily rough with being infected by a preventable disease and/or being ostracized by the public for a decision they did not make. 

Being on the internet for a long time it was easy to laugh at how stupid the anti-vaxx movement is, but now that it has intruded into people that I know and respect I am at a loss for what I can do. I know that they are doing what they think is best for their kid, but that conclusion they reached came from false information and fear-mongering. I've pointed to study after study debunking what they say, but they plug their ears and spout off more nonsense. I don't want to lose a friend over this, but every time I think to drop it the guilt of letting that kid suffer creeps back in. My family who are all medical professionals have been thinking of pulling out of their wedding as a symbolic gesture, but I know that would essentially be end of our friendship. So I ask you reddit, am I being over dramatic for a kid that's not even my own or do I have an obligation to step in cause the kid can't stand up for themselves?

TLDR: Good friend who was manipulated into being anti-vaxx by his fiance is having a kid and I cant decide on whether or not to step in for the child's well being",13Nov2019,1

347,"I went to my local makerspace to take a class, see the space and get a feel for how things work. Met some genuinely nice people there and see a lot of potential. Unfortunately, I also watched/heard a woman who seemed to be in charge in some way telling other people about me and laughing about it. It's always possible I misheard her but, my community is pretty small and my story fairly specific - I can't imagine why else she would start chirping about the combination of thoughts/feelings in such spontaneous order. I'd never met this woman, and I still have no idea who she is. All I know is I've always valued spaces such as this as ""safe"". Where people can be themselves and be free of judgement (there were plenty of ""characters"" there, too). Now I just feel violated. I need places I can go where I can work and there really isn't any other option for this type of work. I feel like she took something from me before I ever had the chance to share my passion and contribute. 

Something about having paid for a membership may also have irked me a bit. Hard to say.

I don't know what to do. I grew up in an environment where if you did something wrong you were told you were wrong and why. Being made fun of is new for me and I'm realizing now it's something I've run from, largely because I feel what makes me a target is behavior I struggle to control.

I wanted to get into babysitting local kids over the summer  but I'm not sure how I'd go about that? I used to babysit my three cousins all the time,  1 through 5,each about 2 years apart.

I'm comfortable babysitting kids 3+ years old,  1 to 3 at a time, I was thinking 8am to 6pm availability . What do I need to do/to know?  Should I charge a bit more for more than one kid? And should I do minimum wage or less?  Minimum wage is about $12 here.

My family member is an addict. He has been using heroin my entire life, and im almost 30. He goes in and out of jail constantly. He has 2 older children. One is an adult, the other a teen. He has no contact with them for the last 10 years and does not provide child support. 

His girlfriend, who I have never met because I distanced myself from these people, is assumed and rumored to be a substance abuser of some type or has used in the past. It would make sense as all his other girlfriends ever were users. 

They all live with his mother. And another &amp; another addict family member. They also sell drugs! 

These people do not deserve this baby, nor can they adequately raise him. It is not a safe enviornment.

364,"Just a short backstory. I was the one to cut ties. He was never there for me emotionally even when I was in deep shit, and he knew I was. He’d often blame things on me and make himself look like the good one when we argued. He’d never apologize when he said hurtful things, and he knew they hurt me. He’d always avoid and brush these problems off and I felt so alone in the relationship.. Because I always tried to talk about things and I always showed care, but I rarely got that in return. In the last month of our relationship I really started to reconsider everything because I became really unhappy and sad. I couldn’t take the beating anymore, everything was so emotionless and I. Since we couldn’t see each other we were just texting. The last night we talked we were just arguing again.. And that was the moment when I told myself ENOUGH, I just didn’t have the energy to carry this on. The morning after that I left him a longer message giving him closure that I’m not willing to deal with this anymore. I didn’t even care what he’d reply, I just wanted to run. So I blocked him. I know I don’t need this in my life and that I’ll be happier with anyone else, but for some reason he is still on my mind. I don’t want to come back because I know I’d end up being hurt again, but I seem to be a bit stuck. I don’t know how to get him off my mind and I feel like an idiot for missing someone who caused me so much distress. Has anyone ever had to cope with something similar?

365,"Need Advice on Positive Discussion

So I was sitting around with my coworkers (we are servers so no normal professional expectations) and we were discussing a white woman who made small micro aggression racist comments. All the time in her day to day life. And at work. But she’s very nice, a good mom, seems like she always has the best intentions. I’m white. My coworkers were two black males and a Greek female. I was trying to explain that we should not view/treat this woman as a horrible racist monster bc she simply doesn’t understand what she’s saying is rude or racist. But if someone points out to her every time she says something like that, maybe it can open a discussion and she will realize that she has been unintentionally nasty. Do you know what I mean? A lot of white people in society are conditioned to be racist and I really think this woman just doesn’t understand what she’s saying bc she spent most of her life with assimilation and sameness. White people, who eat the same things she does and likes the same things she does and talk with an accent like she does and she just doesnt know that she’s fixating on differences bc that’s what society taught her to do. Any way I was trying to explain this to my coworkers-that we need to talk about our differences together and why some language is inappropriate and everyone just acted like I was a racist defending a racist/making excuses for another racist. I just want us all to see past our differences. Sigh. Suggestions on how to reopen the conversation??",13Nov2019,1

373,"Hi Redditors, I'm a second-year university student on the west coast with a whole lotta issues, and I've been feeling truly out of place for three years or so now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm majoring in biochemistry, which I love and excel at during application (Lab and in the little field experience I have). But I was raised using a very unorthodox ""project-based learning"" education, which resulted in me being unable to study or learn in a college environment, and again; me being great at application. While I appreciate the talents I've gained over the years, and I'm not suicidal... I can't bring myself to operate in almost any capacity. It's like a case of criminal laziness, and I feel that I can't just blame it all on my depression and call it a day.I zone out in classes, can't do homework for the life of me, can't wake up or get out of bed in the morning without about an hour of startup time (or it being past 12pm), and get so anxious about studying that in trying to do it I actively avoid it.I constantly have to ground myself through small physical things (ripping toenails and fingernails, tapping my foot or hands, clipping myself with those plastic clips you close chip bags with), or I'll start to lose myself in daydreams and general delusions. I'm very creative, but a good 50% of the time my daydreams will devolve into daymares, or I'll start to have dark thoughts that I've gotten incredible at repressing.I'm genuinely quite happy when I hide from the world and either game or spend time with my girlfriend. But I'm terrified of the future since I've spent a year at uni learning almost nothing, and I'm unsure as to whether I can find a place to live a comfortable life in this world. I feel less and less safe in my own skin as the days go by, and it's getting pretty bad.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Because of this, I've tried to look for some other paths I could take in life...\*

&amp;#x200B;

I've practiced and gotten good at; Deep tissue massage, computer assembly, machining parts and designing machine blueprints, wiring and manufacturing basic machines, creative writing (especially with fantasy genres and dark-fiction), and a bunch of other things that I won't say because I feel that it'd discredit professionals. \\\[I also didn't realize how uncomfortable it would be to talk about things I think I'm good at...\\\]I don't know how I'd go about starting a career in any of those without feeling that I've wasted all the time and effort I've put into university so far...

I’m currently a senior in high school and I’m good friends with this couple!
A = girlfriend, have been really good friends with her since freshman year
B = boyfriend, been friends since sophomore year, grew closer last year

So basically, today A wasn’t in school today so it was just me and B during the whole class period (in our computer class). We weren’t doing anything so we decided to watch a show on his computer, and I was leaning in his direction so I was able to watch with him. Out of the blue he looks around to see if anyone is looking and whispers to me, “Okay, kiss me now... no one is looking.” I look up at him, and give him a confused face and laugh bc I’m like wtf... He gives me a kinda serious look, looks around again, and leans in but stops centimeters away from my face. I push his face away kind of aggressively and he just LAUGHS?? and looks back at his screen. I brushed it off because he naturally has a flirty personality around everyone he is good friends with so I didn’t really take him seriously. This is repeated a few more times, but then I finally decide to mess around and I jokingly say, “Um... deadass?” and he smiled and shook his head yes. I said, “Alright. Bet, you won’t do it.” NOT THINKING HE WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT. He leans in to kiss me before I could even blink, and tries to make out with me in the middle of class?!?!?? I honestly have never hit someone so fast (oops! He was kinda of towering over me, and I was trying to push him away but I ended up pushing his neck/jaw really hard). I got mad at him for doing that all he did was laugh and kept asking to try again... and even asked if I wanted to hang out after school (WTF). But then he said “oh wait... never mind A is gonna be waiting for me at her house... so not today. AND don’t tell A of what happened, okay?” I just roll my eyes at him and continue watching the show. And we went our separate ways after class ended.

Anyways, I feel so guilty about it and I want to tell A but I know she won’t believe me and will say I’m lying. B has been accused of cheating numerous times during his relationship with A but she always tells everyone that they’re all liars and they know nothing about B. She even rants about to me sometimes and I just agree with her because I don’t want to be another person who “accuses” B of cheating on her. Should I tell her? I still want to be friends with her and I don’t want to lose our friendship over B. I’m just afraid we won’t be friends anymore if I tell her... she’s so important to me!",13Nov2019,1

379,"Some background:

* I began dating my girlfriend last year while she was pursuing a LLM degree, I am pursuing an undergrads in economics at the moment. Thus there is an age gap and she is 7 years my senior. 
* She is the daughter of a rather wealthy businessman in China. 
* She returned to China after completing her LLM because she was unable to find a job here. However we decided to maintain a relationship because we both deeply love each other very much. 
* She has been speaking about her father a lot because of the uncertainty regarding her future. 
* I am not Chinese (I am a White American) and I am just beginning to learn how to speak their language. 

The offer:

He told her that what she should do is pursue a career in the meantime in a given industry, and that after I graduate should I move to China he would invest into a business for her and I to run.

On the face of it, this seems like a rather amazing career opportunity and I should consider myself lucky to have it, particularly because my family simply isn't rich (we are upper middle class.) However, there are some problems with it. Firstly, he is a conspiratorial person. I have a hard time believing that he wants to do that just because he is an amazing dad (he is an amazing dad though.) 

Secondly, he has never actually met me  (and even if he does it'd be hard for him to judge me, given I don't speak Chinese well at all) so all he knows about me is whatever it is that she told him during their conversations. I have a hard time believing, given he never met me, he would just want to do this for me without having an alternative reason. 

Thus, I believe his reasoning is as follows:

He has voiced to her that he doesn't care about her career and will always support her, he just wants her to have a family. Consequently, I believe his motive for this is that if I did this I would essentially be indebted to him forever, and would more or less have to marry and stay with her. Additionally, because this would be in China I am relatively powerless when compared to him so I wouldn't really have much of a choice in the matter. 

Obviously, if that is the case even though I love her accepting this offer would be dangerous. On the other hand if it isn't the case then it is great. So I don't know what I should do.

381,"A little back story on the subject.
We met online earlier this year and took it slow to begin. After a couple of months we were spending almost every day together. I didn't live too far away so it was easy at the time. We became really close to each other in what was a relatively short amount of time (7 months together). About 2 weeks ago we got into a fight about holiday plans and her telling me she couldn't commit because she wasn't comfortable with doing so. This is what ultimately led to her breaking up with me later in the night. I asked if we could talk about it more when we cooled off and she agreed. We met a week later, but talked intermittently through texts and a phone call. It was a pretty stressful week, but had some meaningful time to reflect. 
When she came over we talked for a very long time. She said she would miss me, that she loved me and that she wasn't sure how to be alone. We cuddled, cried, and held each other. It was one of the most sad breakups I have ever had because it wasn't clear why. All she said is that she didn't feel like she was getting what she needed and didn't actually know what it is she needs. But one thing was certain and that was to break up. That was last week. I pushed through to the end of the week and went to go hide out at my Moms (A farm 2 hours away in the country) for the weekend. 2 days after we talked I got a text saying ""I miss you"" from her.  I didn't respond right away and waited a few hours to think about it. It felt incredibly validating of my feelings and instantly made me optimistic about there still being a chance.
I texted back that I missed her later that night and heard from her the next day. She apologized for reaching out and said it was immature and that she had been drinking. I pushed back a little and told her how I felt about breaking up. A while later she texted me saying she was having a difficult night and missed me.
That was two days ago. I have been feeling a bit confused since then and don't know what to make of this. I texted her tonight telling her that this has been incredibly difficult and that I still very much love her. I got almost the exact opposite response. She told me I wasn't listening to her, that I wasn't respecting her decision to end things, and that all I'm doing is being dramatic and making this whole thing worse by reopening this wound. She said she wants space and that we should do our best not to talk going forward because bringing up the past isn't helping. 
I very much am in love with this person and know exactly how I would respond to a second chance. I'm confused and looking for any sense of direction. How do I go forward from here?",13Nov2019,1
382,"A little back story, I've been dating this girl for five rocky years. Infidelity on her end has been an issue a few times in the past.  We were engaged at one point, and up until a few months ago lived together for two years. She moved back to her parents' for school. About one month after she moved back with her parents, she called me to tell me we should take a break to work on ourselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then, I feel that our relationship has only gotten worse. We call on the phone every few nights and the conversations start off normal until she asks me how I'm doing. I'll tell her that I haven't been doing all that great recently, and she asks why. Then I'll *start* to tell her why I'm not doing well and out of nowhere she'll blurt out, 

""Oh, so you're saying it's my fault?""

And I'll get so confused because I never said anything about anything being anyone's fault, I'll just be talking about what I've been feeling down about, whether it's work or I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. And when I try to explain that I'm not blaming anything on her, I'm just telling her why my day hasn't been the best, she interrupts by screaming at the top of her lungs that I've pissed her off again and that it's my fault she's angry now.

It'll go on for maybe an hour where I can't get half a sentence out without her doing this, She'll start telling me to shut the f\*\*\* up and let her finish talking, which I do. When she's done talking I'll try to explain that I wasn't trying to blame anything on her and that I'm not yelling or cussing at her and she shouldn't tell or cuss at me either. All she ever replies with after that is that it's my fault she's ugly and has pimples. Or that it's my fault she had to scream and now her voice hurts.

Ive always thought of myself as a smart person, logical thinker- great problem solving and situational skills, but school has never been my strong suit (a point my, mensa-leveled IQ, little brother loves to point out at family gatherings.) I had an honest heart to heart with my dad and tried to explain to him that I wasn’t a scholar in my heart and needed to find another path, it was a difficult discussion to have because I made a point to let him know I was serious. Same “too bad” type of response.
Im almost finished with my first semester, doing horribly in all my classes, sleeping ~20 hours a week, and my already poor mental health has gotten severely worse. 
Ive known for years that i was never going to make it through college and that I needed another path, but growing up in a family like mine - where the first priority was education- I don’t know what else besides college i can shoot for.

Sam keeps flipping out and starting fights with Alice (verbal not physical) over petty things that happen around the house e.g Sam took Alice's washing off the lines in the dryer room when they were still damp and Alice was like ""Sam why did you do that, they weren't dry"" and he started picking a stupid fight. 

Sam's stance is that we should ""say things how they are"" and not ""dance around a subject and stay quiet when there's a problem"". My counter was that sometimes avoiding conflict is the absolute best thing to do, particularly in circumstances similar to the above where nothing will be achieved by kicking off at someone, and that at the end of the day it would blow over very quickly on its own and be forgotten. 

He and I can't seem to agree on that at all and I was wondering what you guys thought on the subject.",13Nov2019,1
395,"This is a throw away so here me go...

This took place about a week ago and I need some advice. As some background my parents are divorced and have been since I was very young and I am very close with both of them.

My mother and my father are in quite different financial situation. My dad is quite comfortable with his income while my mother works her ass off with two hard jobs. 

The other week my school computer needed a new battery as I had been using it for years and it was draining.  I asked my mum if she could help me out in buying the new battery and she straight up said no get your father to do it. I objected saying that it could at least be fair to go half each or something like that. She guilted me into getting my dad to pay the full thing by saying I am not sympathetic to her financial situation and this, that and the other. I am completely sympathetic to her as I have seen her struggle and try my best to help out as much as I can. 

I had no idea what to do from there and asked my dad and fed him a story about how mum and him will go 50/50 on the battery which my mum told me to tell him. I am old enough and wise enough to know that this was the wrong thing to do but I was lost and stressed about everything that was happening. 

I payed the people to repair the thing with my own money and now my dad is trying to pay me back as he still believes my mum helped out and I cannot bring myself to accept the money due to me lying. I feel incredibly awful and gross. The battery doesn’t even cost that much and should have never asked my parents for help but, I did and I’m here now.

I feel completely guilty and I’m not sure what to do from here. Shall I tell him, keep it internally or something else.

397,"Hi all I’ll try to keep it short - The back story goes like this, I joined band in hs and found a passion and love for playing in a drumline. Years pass as my competence and self-esteem grows from watching myself get better at something I loved doing. Fast forward to after graduation, 2 years ago (2018), and try I out for my university drumline and make it (!), making a ton of new friends along the way. Season goes great and I wouldn’t trade the experiences and memories for anything. Without getting into detail, after the season ended I end up injuring myself and developed nerve damage in my neck and into my hands ( :( ) preventing me from playing. At this point it’s a toss up to whether I’ll ever be able to seriously play again, but now I’ve arrived at my main topic. I feel like I’ve stagnated as a person without an outlet. Drumming was a big part of my identity and I got a lot of self-confidence from it. I miss having that underlying purpose and mission to get better at one thing. I’ve been searching for another hobby and so far haven’t found something that hits the same way. My question would be how can I find an activity hobby or passion that gives me the same fulfillment? Is trying to find something to do as hard for everyone else? Thanks in advance

TLDR; can no longer participate in my first passion, how do I find another?",13Nov2019,1
398,"Hello everyone! I desperately need for an advice and I would really appreciate your opinion on this. My story:

Im 30F, moved from my home country somewhere in Europe and enrolled in a PhD program and I am very close to finish it. The PhD is related to a very specific field and I can apply to jobs only to ONE company in the country im currently living. Of course the company doesn't have positions available now.
For the sake of simplicity I will name my home country A and the current country im living B. 

My partner is a citizen of B but he has a limited countract in country A for another 2 years. Our personal plan is to live in country B. 

Here comes the problem. 

- I could move to A and live for 2 years and get my old job back (which is underpaid), and after 2 y move to B with no job perspective (the company in A has an non-compete with company in B).

Or 

- I can live in B and sign in to unemployment services, and during this time I want to change my profession to programming and/or apply to jobs to the only company which offers jobs in my field. The unemployment services offers me almost double the salary I will take from country A. 

My partner thinks is better to have a job, although its shitty than having a break in the resume. He is affraid that I will end up doing shitty jobs since I am overqualified for the jobs the unemployed services offer. 

I believe that although I will end up doing shitty jobs, at least I have the freedom after finishing the programming school and not being tied to only one company. I will have a wider perspective on finding better jobs in the future. 

Which one do you think is a better option?",13Nov2019,1
399,"She is incredibly confused what shall I do

This is lengthy but I want you guys to understand the whole situation 

So my(18F) ex broke up with me(18M) 3 weeks ago cause I didn’t give her attention , also cause of how i was taking time to actually be more intimate (yeah I know I’m dumb pinch me)and also something that happened.The break up was clean nothing messy you know smoother than a babies ass,then the night of the break up she tells me “dude I’m really sad” and she’s crying and I really like her but I didn’t say anything I just said she could get a new guy soon (cause she’s hot as a brisket).i met a girl she was a perfect 10/10 and all but I could not kiss her or anything cause I’m still into my ex I told the girl and she got mad and hit me with a shoe , I’m saying this to show how I really want my ex.

So then a week goes by I ignore her texts and cry myself to sleep every day like a pro , then she greets me we talk but then we call and I said the dumbest shit ever that frustrated her and then now she started ignoring me the whole weekend(I’m so good at ruining things btw)

So a week passed every time I text her she is dry and seems like she doesn’t want to talk with me but oh no reddit i was very persistent I did not give up because I WANTED this lady,a week passed she’s fine and good we haven’t talked about our relationship.Then we face time I tell her exactly how I feel and how I don’t want us to be friends and how I want to give her smooches, she says that she’s glad I have shared my emotions and how I never dude it , then she says she doesn’t know how she feels because the past week I ignored her and the dumb thing I said on the call was me talking about another girl so she said that too,then I pissed her off on the video call and this is when I knew I really fucked up,so now she started completely ignoring me telling her friends she’s not into me and that she hates me (this hurt because I like her) then 3 days  goes by of me trying to solve things and I could tell she was not having it .So I gave up my boys.

A whole week of no talking then on Monday she sends me a voice message,talking about how when me and her started talking she said “it’s funny how I  was once so into you , i was physically and emotionally attracted to you and really was crazy about you and now sometimes you lowkey annoy me , it’s funny how .. never mind”To which I responded “yeah time changes everything yeah I also realized it seems like i was bothering you“ she then sent another voice message saying “you know .. nah never mind cause what if I say I like you and you don’t like me back and it’s embarrassing I’m not saying I do but never mind..”
I then call my lady and tell her I like her to she says ohh and I told her let’s meet up she then proceeds to lie and say she’s busy on that day (fucken piece of horse radish) a act cool and tell her not to tell her friends we had this conversation.Later on i text her and say to her she must really tell me how she feels or she should just be my friend or nothing ( cause we share friends) she replies the next day my G,and she says” I like you , I really do but right now I’m really confused I don’t know what I want”
I proceed to say “thank you this will help me move on “ 
simple right but wait there’s more

At 12 am i was crying listening to some sweet rnb thinking of her and she responded to an instagram story of mine where this couple was kissing and stuff she replies “this could be us” i then reply “...but you are playing “ she then responded with “true I know , I’m sorry”

I ignored until the Morning cause i was still crying my ass off,so I don’t know what to do cause I want her but this is a very confusing situation and I dont want to seem like she can always do this to me

I feel as if I've just wasted 2 years of my life. I wanted to be an electrician I'm fully qualified for an apprenticeship  I've done work placement at two different companies and I've applied at up to 6  but no one would give me the chance and hiRe me.  

my parents are really religious and strict  so I'm not able to do any of the things I want to do like when my friend's go  to the city  for a weekend or holiday  I can't go.  never beEn  To any concerts.  can't even stay out past 12  so never had any of those nights where you do stupid shit with your friends till the Amy's and I'm 19 

 that's why I wanted to get this apprenticeship and  after a few years move out  to fully experience life.  at the moment I feel alone at home with no friends I've got no job or income and I just feel like my life is being  wasted away  while I watch all the fun things and experiences my friends and people I went to school with are having  I also live in a small town with not many electrical companies which makes it hard to get employed. And i cant afford to move to another city or town as on a 1st year apprentices wage I cant afford it

I'm trying to make something of myself, I came from Congo when I was 7 and grow up in Australia, I wanted to start my own electrical company one day or any company financed by the savings my being a electrician and returns from investing on the stock market. My parents are wealth so everything I have, my car and my clothes (which are really my only possessions) I paid for myself. I didnt want to go to uni even tho my dad said he could pay for it because  I know for a fact he cant afford it and he also has my siblings to tend to. And I didnt want a government loan because at the time of graduating I didnt have any uni course that I was whole heartily committed to and wanted to do and thought it wasnt worth the hefty debt I would carry for the rest of my life.

-i am 21yo and the oldest of us three

-my little brother is 15yo and the youngest

-my parents are divorced

-my father is an alcoholic and tells me brother he is Garbage and won't achieve anything

-my mom tries her best but she's fighting depression and has no energy left to deal with weekly school visits

-my other brother and me developed perfectly, good grades, study, all that

- now my youngest brother gets bad grades, gets cought steeling condoms, is found drunk in the park at 1pm. Every few days he has done anything stupid in school, like harassing others or trying to steal phones. He is spending his time with bad influence. I am talking of crimes, drugs, you get what I mean. I think I have a very good relationship to him and try to talk to him here and there. I want to gain his trust but it doesn't seem like he is honest to me. I tell him I don't care about bad grades, that I know I can't prevent him from meeting his trashy fans, but I don't want him to become criminal or do drugs or anything. I tell him he can trust me and that I would help him if he's in problems. 

Sometimes he seems to be willing to change. We study for school together, his grades become better temporarily, he comes in my room and spends time with me. My mom is just shouting at him and losing her mind. I think that's not going to bring him further. But no matter how often I try to talk to him and tell him how things are, he just pretends everything is okay, that he has nothing to do with drugs, that there are no problems in school, until he gets cought and then he brings up another lie. I want him to understand that I wouldn't punish him or wouldnt be mad at him for doing stupid stuff, but instead would try to help him. Whatever I try, I don't seem to reach his mind. Today school called and my mom has to pick him up because he tried stealing a phone. My mom had do cancel work today and it seems she's losing her job because all of that.

I’m new to reddit and only really made this account so that I could receive some advice from multiple people. Me and my boyfriend have been together three months however I’ve always worried about his feelings for his ex. Anyway I know quite certainly that he met his ex two weeks or so before we met, the meeting was spontaneous on my part however I think when they met they stayed at one another’s and the weekend after. No matter how much I try he won’t tell me and denies it ever happening, yet I feel like I need to know what’s happened. Recently he lied about something because I assumed he was doing so to protect my feelings but now I’m not sure if it’s because he still has feelings for her. I’m unsure whether I should just leave it in the past as it’s the only thing causing harm to our relationship which is otherwise perfect, move on and forget the situation because I’m never going to know the truth from him (I have tried repeatedly to find out but he adamantly denies it despite everything else suggesting otherwise), or whether I should know what happened and continue to try and find the truth to the situation.",13Nov2019,1

We don’t converse about something deeper because we’re both busy in the day, especially him. He always messages me first though, and I just reply when I feel like it. I’m not hoping for this to lead to something romantic, i know it’s just about the sex and we’re both single and lonely and horny but I really want to keep having sex with him while he’s in the city.

412,"Me (19f) and my mom (47f) fight a lot. We love each other so much and overall we have a good relationship, but i feel like nowdays everytime we fight we get more and more angry and our relationship has started to take a toll.  

When i was younger (14-16) we didn’t really have the best relationship because of our fights, because we could barely talk before getting into a fight, and i said so much mean things to her. I remember calling her a bi*** at times, i was absolutely horrible and i feel so bad about the way i used to act and the words i used to call her. But i know that during that time in my life i was really sad and depressed, and now i know that i was taking out my feelings on her. Since then i have apologized a lot, even now i still feel so bad about it.  

Now our relationship is a lot better, but we just can’t seem to get along lately. We get into fights about the smallest things and we make it a big fight that sometimes last for 30+ minutes. We are both very angry at each other but my mom is a lot calmer than me, so i’m usually the one raising my voice. Sometimes i have to go outside to calm down and take a break. I also feel so irritated at her sometimes for no reason. Right now my dad is away for 2 weeks and me and my mom fight almost everyday. We fought this morning. It really sucks, i hate fighting with her but it just happens! Our fights now are a lot calmer (and i would never say anything bad to her like i did when i was younger) but they still get very heated and it’s exhausting to fight like that. It seems like we can’t get along, especially when dad isn’t home.  There are still some things she has said weeks ago that i’m angry at; things that made me really angry and weren’t resolved.  

We fight usually because of a misunderstanding, either she or i say something and one of us misunderstands it and here we go again. Other times she or i say something that one of us gets really angry about, and we fight because of that. For example (sorry if this is a little TMI) this morning my little brother peed all over the toilet seat, and my mom cleaned it up. When i heard about it i asked my mom “did you use a spray on it?” and the reason why i asked that was because my mom is not at all sensitive when it comes to things like that, and i don’t really trust her when it comes to those types of things, and i’m a bit of a germaphobe when it comes to certain things so that’s why i asked. And she just says “i’m not going to answer that” and i was very confused by that, because in my opinion me asking that was not weird at all. I certainly did not mean to offend her, i simply wanted to ask. Apparently she was offended because “she cleans this house and is not ok with me not trusting her that she cleans the toilet properly” and i “should not even ask her stuff like that” and she refused to answer me. I understand where she is coming from, but i don’t understand why she was so offended by me asking that. This is actually a pretty common theme in our fights, for example we used to fight a lot because my mom never washes her hands before cooking (cooking that requires using hands) and she refused to wash her hands after i asked her to do that. She has always been that way, and i have always been big on hygiene... so we fight sometimes when it comes to hygiene things. But we fight about basically everything, those were just some examples i could think of now. 

I don’t know what to do and i could really use some advice. I mentally feel so drained and sad every time we fight, and i don’t want to anymore, but i can’t stop it when it happens. I don’t care who is right or wrong, i just want to stop fighting. Please help",13Nov2019,1

414,"

Backstory: 
Around August my mum kicked me out and my best mate let me stay with her until I got on my feet and I stayed with her and her boyfriend for about a month. Right after I moved into my new place my best friend broke up with her toxic boyfriend (a few months ago now) and I have been living with her since to help support her. 

We are pretty close and I love her so much as a friend. The problem is my dumbass is catching feelings for her and I’m starting to crush pretty hard. I’m really anxious that she knows or can sense that I am catching feelings for her. I haven’t said anything to her because I don’t want to act on my feelings, I just want them to go away. Also because she is not in a very good place right now it would be SUPER inappropriate to act upon anything. My concern is that she is somehow able to sense that I have feelings for her , or am I being paranoid? 
It’s really hard not to express my love towards her. I think maybe she thinks I’m just super friendly/flirty naturally but I’m also worried that she might be able to tell I’m catching feels. I don’t know how to not be flirty sometimes. There’s so many moments where we hug or when she’s stressed I tend to hug her and rub her shoulders and stroke her hair. Or times when we grab and hold each other’s hands or stroke each others hands or sometimes she’ll put her hand on my lap or vice versa. Or sometimes she’ll rub my shoulders. Please help do you think that’s normal for friends to do that with each other?? I can’t help but feel so connected to her for so many reasons and want to console her when she’s not coping and it’s not me trying to flirt I’m just a pretty affectionate person. It’s really hard because I try to tell myself just friends but I can’t stop thinking about kissing her I know it’s so stupid. 
What should I do???? I don’t know what’s happening right now honestly. We are both going through a hard time and I feel really confused about everything, I just need any advice, anything is appreciated &lt;3",13Nov2019,1

416,"I've started my life with people that shouldn't have been allowed to have kids. Since my mom primarily raised me I'll start with her.

My Mom grew up in a very difficult situation, she never really matured and I felt that I was smarter than her since 14. She probably has trauma from my dad dying. She was terrible at dating and had no control over her emotions, most of her boyfriends were rebounds or from being jealous of her friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

*  She said to date guys for food, she was in constant survival mode. She brags constantly about buying new brand name stuff from garage sales but it was because other people bought shoes and she got jealous again. She also bragged about her hair being straighter than mine. We went to the mall every week to spend money and learned incredibly bad spending habits. Do normal mothers brag about themselves to their children?
* Her jealousy prevented me from taking opportunities that would have greatly improved my future.
* I was introduced to Christianity by the way of manipulation, you just quote the bible until you get what you want: Cherry Picking. I don't think my mom's actually religious, she's just afraid of the idea of going to hell.
*  I was praised for being the 'Good Kid' but in reality, I was just quiet. I hated most people in school and in middle school I even drew my classmates being stabbed. No one was interested in anything I had to say. I just now realize that I'm afraid of people that know the real me because they might be judgemental or mad at me. In the past 5 months, I've only had conversations with 2 people irl, I don't think I can talk without weirding someone out. I think my silence made them forget about me(not in the physical sense), conversations were always shallow with me. People were afraid of me being a school shooter but I was happy about it since I knew that meant that they were afraid to bully me. I was never good.

**My main issue** is that I'm just now understanding all of this as ""bad"". I look back into my past and question an occurrence that turned out to actually be terrible. This has happened almost every week this month.

But there's this nagging voice in my head (probably my mother) suggesting grad school. Now, I graduated with a degree in the arts, and definitely have a knack for something old-fashioned and specialized, and to be guaranteed a career in my chosen field grad school seems pretty necessary. The kicker is that it's too expensive, I'm burnt out, and I heard the it's everything college was *supposed* to be. Seriously, I feel like a lot of us, growing up, heard that college is the only thing you need to make your life better and grad school 'is an option.'


I don't know what the pros and cons would be, but I do know what my current limitations are. Hell, I hardly have enough money for an application fee. Plus, so far, my experience with institutions is that concerning the arts, i might kill my motivation because I'd be so bogged down with needless studies when *I just want to hone my craft*.

420,"I was divided between posting this here and on /r/relationship_advice . Opted for this one because this is more of a _person_ issue rather than a _relationship_ issue.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been dating this girl for a little over a year now. Things moved fast, and we moved in together about 5/6 months ago. We both have had our bad moments in life, where it kicked us down really hard, me more than her even - It may seem that I'm just playing the victim but there's a point.

During my life things have gotten really bad, to the point that I've been to therapy for it and am still dealing with issues. However, I've always tried to be positive about things. If something went wrong, is hard to do, or just sucks in general, I do get down, but after a while I also try to see the positive side to it. I believe in self sacrifice for a better future also - It may suck to go through this thing now, but in some time it will be worth it.

Now my girlfriend, is the opposite. Everything is negative. If something is bad, it's really bad, and there's no way out. Everyone and everything is out to get her, and no solution will ever be even worth, because what's the point. It's a fact that she works a crappy job at a call center, starting at 8am in a place that takes over 1hr to get to ( and by out country's standards, that's quite a bit ). Wakes up at 6.30am, gets gome after 6pm, and then there's chores and everything else to do. We try to split things around the house, and lately I've even been trying to do her part so she has more time. Even so, there's never any time for anything, she's tired, and is in general, in a state I'd call depression. The warning signs are there - ¨I'm tired of life¨, ¨I wanna sleep for a long time¨, ¨There's no point in anything¨. I've tried to suggest therapy, in passing, but she receives it very badly. She dated a therapist before me, and thinks she knows how it will go, and plus, its a waste of time she doesn't have. I've been trying to help her get a new job, sending out applications myself because she complains about lack of time and that jobs here suck, got her a couple interview requests, and its a new problem because she doesn't have time, she can't take calls, it's time she doesn't have. Yes, time is a big issue here. I've pointed out that it's just a day or two of having less time, for a potential break in a new job, that will pay her better and have better hours. Nope. Still negativity. And these are just a few examples of how negative towards life in general she is. 

Anyway this post is getting really long by now. Just want to add that this morning, after a big bout of negativity from her, I googled ¨how to deal with negative people¨.  Two things have gotten my attention. First, [this list](https://www.developgoodhabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Identify-Negative-People.jpg), of which she checks most of the bullet points. Secondly, the general sense of ¨deal with negative people by removing them from your life¨. That for me is a silly way to deal with things. If something is broken, you try to fix it rather than just throw it away. It's a pet peeve of mine from nowadays culture, but I won't get too much into it. Furthermore, removing her from my life is the last thing I want. Someone reading this post might feel like I'm done with her and all, but in fact I love her, a lot really. I want the best for her and her happiness is very important to me. So I come to you, hoping someone can help me a bit on this.",13Nov2019,1

431,"So my parents have just inherited a house, they will be renovating and then moving into it. 


When it is complete (10-12 month estimate) they have offered their current house to me so me, my partner and our 2 year old son could live there, save and eventually buy a house of our own. (We rent currently and are breaking even with our bills but would never have much chance to save for a deposit) 


This move would involve us moving nearly 2 hours from where we live now and would be a huge jump for us, but would not only benefit from the money but the fact there is a garden (which we don't have now) and a good school round the corner. 

So if we declined the move they said they would offer it to my sister. 

So my sister currently has a mortgage on her house but is going through a pretty nasty divorce, she lost her job but now works self employed. She has 2 sons.

 She's having to either sell the house or pay her husband half if she wants it. 

She has been told she wouldn't be able to get a mortgage as she is self employed for less than 3 years. She is clearly struggling with this situation and I do feel for her completely. 

My parents told my sister that we were planning on taking them up on the offer of moving, my sister wanted to talk to me and explain her situation. She's saying she'll be left homeless even though I know 10000% my parents have offered to give her money. 

She basically wants me to not have the house so she can get back on her feet which I appreciate and understand, my problem is that now I have a family I do need to think about this, if I was single and no children I would let her. 

My son would be around the age of starting school which I would want him to be settled in a family house and not moving around, there is a garden which would benefit all of us, we would be closer to his grandparents and other family members and we could save money to pay for a deposit for our own house. 

What do I do? I love my sister to death but I feel like she's sort of guilt tripping me and then me and my family will be left without. I don't expect these things in life and I am so grateful for even the tiniest of opportunities but would I be crazy to take it to benefit my family? 

I don't want to ruin my relationship with my sister but I feel like this would. 

thanks guys.

432,"Hello. Thank you for reading. 

I struggle with anxiety and hypotheticals. This issue has grown in the past month to the point where I have fallen behind. I am currently a first-gen senior undergraduate set to graduate in May. 


[BACKGROUND INFO]
My relationship with my parents has never been great or bad, it's been a solid neutral when growing up. We lacked communication and I never felt close to them. Since moving a little over 1000 miles away for college we have been able to start connecting little by little. They went to school until about 3rd grade which made it hard to explain why I had to go to college. They don't understand what I'm studying or the significance of higher education, but they also weren't going to stop me from pursuing it. I'm so close and just need to hold on a little more, but I can't help but worry about the future.

About two months ago, I received a phone call from my mom. She works as a janitor for a retail store and mentioned that the store changed companies and therefore replacing the workers. It was a sudden single day notice to not return the next day. She had been working there for 13 years and traveled 2.5 hours each day. 

My parent's family live outside the country and have been longing to move back permanently for a while and now it feels like that is going to happen much sooner than expected. I know that I will have to be completely independent from them one day, but now it feels like the only option. 


[HELP]
I had planned on continuing on to graduate school, but now I can't help but think that I have to support my family and find a job asap. This semester is 4 weeks from ending and I'm averaging a D at the moment. This is considered passing but it is definitely going to hurt my GPA. I know I can work some classes up to a B and others to a C but I am having trouble concentrating. 

Recently, I began going to counseling and my therapist was rather stumped on my situation when I gave them the more in depth story. They suggested I see a psychiatrist for anxiety to potentially start medicating. I was a little surprised that this was their suggestion after only a single session. 

A past professor gave me advice to just worry about today and try to get through it. It did help for a bit, but then all the hypotheticals start coming in again... Which is essentially a waste of time because most of them are likely not going to happen. 

I can't help but think what if ""They decide to move away next month"", ""I fail a class and don't graduate"", ""I drop out"", ""I can't find work"" etc... 

I'm so close to graduating and it has definitely been harder than anticipated but right now it feels difficult to focus on anything. I have fallen behind on class work and research projects. 

Is there any advice, motivation, or if you've been through something similar that may help? 

TL;DR
First gen senior college student. Parents plan to move back home sooner than expected. My relationship with them is only now beginning to form. They expect me to work after college but I want to go to graduate school. I want them to stay but I would have to support all 3 of us and I don't understand much about adulting. I'm scared of being alone. I need help trying to get through the semester and overcoming my worries.

433,"Apologies for the long post ahead.

About 2 years ago I got a sporting injury. Specifically I dislocated my kneecap. I recovered from that and went back to said sport after getting the all clear from the physiotherapist, wore a brace as I was meant to (I wasn't allowed to jump or twist on the knee at that point in time so I didn't), I was careful and my instructor was very cautious of me and always checked in. Anyways, it happened a second time (while wearing a brace and taking all precautions, happened during a pattern that I had done multiple times since the initial injury without any issues). Both times it was really hard on me, I struggled mentally being on crutches, injuries and I just do not gel. So a few months after the second dislocation I went in for surgery because it turns out I had damaged so much soft tissue with the first dislocation that my kneecap actually wasn't being held in place on one side of my knee, this meant the second dislocation was inevitable and it was just a matter of when it would happen again. I went in for surgery and boy was that difficult on my mental health as well.

So anyways now over a year since the surgery, I have a pretty cool story to tell, one giant scar down the side of my knee, and two smaller ones. But the worst thing that I got out of this was the thoughts of the dislocation just flooding my mind, that have gotten progressively worse and more frequent over time. It took me long enough to shake the noise of the second dislocation, that noise haunted me for months. Now nearly every time I close my eyes I see a knee dislocating or picture my knee dislocating, it makes me feel nauseous. I can't do gore anymore either, it now makes me sick. This resulted in me also needing to change my uni degree (I was doing forensics). I can't see people get injured and I am nervous a lot of the time about my knee. The thoughts are starting to stress me out a lot now because they're getting harder to get rid of and have upset me on more than one occasion. I have every intention of seeing a psychologist when I have the money to do so, but right now it's not an option. Has anyone else experienced this? If so how did you overcome it? I just am not sure what to do at this point, distracting myself and changing my thoughts are starting to not work anymore.",13Nov2019,1

So I (19M) started up a relationship with my friend from highschool (18F) a little over a month ago. She's a very accepting and understanding christian, she doesn't judge, and I know I can talk to her about almost anything. 
While I was in highschool, I was in a HardCore band with friends outside of school. In short, we did ALOT of drugs, hard drugs, marijuana, psychadelics, insane amounts of alcohol, fighting, sex, etc. Stupid band shit. But I've left all that behind me now for the most part. 
I was always careful to keep this away from people because I didn't want them to look at me different, especially, my now-girlfriend. 
Now that we are in a relationship, and I genuinely love her, I feel like i need to sit down and tell her about everything. At the moment, she just knows that I used to be in a band. I don't get the sense that she'd leave me or anything, I just don't want her to be ashamed or disappointed in me. 
I definitely don't want her to find out from anybody other than me. If she finds out, I want to be the one to tell her. I wanted to get some opinions or input if possible, thanks for reading guys and gals.

She is also very easily persuaded. There’ve been multiple occasions where she’s fallen for online scams and has gotten viruses in our computers and phones. She doesn’t seem to give a shit most of the time, she doesn’t really learn from her mistakes and she doesn’t want to either.

Just recently she convinced my parents to let her get Snapchat. I’ve already seen her doing those secret messages things where people can submit a question anonymously and have it answered on her story. Last night, she posted up 5 responses, all of which saying things like, “ur hot”, “do you have a boyfriend?” and one even going as far as asking for nudes. She responded to all of them with a grain of salt, almost in a joking “haha” way.

Give yourself enough time to study

Don't leave it until the last minute. While some students do seem to thrive on last-minute cramming, it's widely accepted that (for most of us)  this is not the best way to approach an exam. To help sort out your [time management](https://www.topuniversities.com/blog/7-time-management-tips-students),   set up a timetable for your study. Write down how many exams you have and the days on which you have to sit them. Then organize your study   accordingly. You may want to give some exams more study time than others, so find a balance that you feel comfortable with. 

Organize your study space

Make sure you have enough space to spread your textbooks and notes out than other study accordingly.  Have you got enough light? Is your chair comfortable? Are your computer games out of sight?

Try and get rid of all distractions, and make sure you feel as comfortable and able to comfortable focus as possible. For some people, this may mean almost complete silence, for others, [background music helps](https://www.topuniversities.com/blog/whats-best-music-studying).   Some of us need everything completely tidy and organized in order to concentrate, while others thrive in a more cluttered environment. Think about what works for you, and take the time to get it right.

Use flow charts and diagrams

Visual aids can be really helpful when revising. At the start of a  topic,  challenge yourself to write down everything you already know about a  topic - and then highlight where the gaps lie. Closer to the exam,  condense your revision notes into one-page diagrams. Getting your ideas down in this brief format can then help you to quickly recall everything you need to know during the exam.

Practice on old exams

One of the most effective ways to prepare for exams is to practice taking past versions. This helps you get used to the format of the questions,  and - if you time yourself - can also be good practice for making sure you spend the right amount of time on each section. 

Explain your answers to others

Parents and little brothers and sisters don't have to be annoying around exam time. Use them to your advantage. Explain an answer to a  question to them. That will help you to get it clear in your head, and also to highlight any areas where you need more work.

Organize study groups with friends

Get together with friends for a [study session](https://www.topuniversities.com/blog/university-study-groups-benefits).   You may have questions that they have the answers to and vice versa.  As long as you make sure you stay focused on the topic for an agreed amount of time, this can be one of the most effective ways to challenge yourself.

Take regular breaks

While you may think it's best to study for as many hours as possible, this can actually be counterproductive. If you were [training for a marathon](https://www.topuniversities.com/blog/why-being-student-bit-being-olympic-athlete), you wouldn't try and run 24 hours a day. Likewise, studies have shown that for long-term retention of knowledge, [taking regular breaks](https://www.topuniversities.com/blog/how-have-productive-study-break) really helps.

Everyone's different, so develop a study routine that works for you.  If you study better in the morning, start early before taking a break at lunchtime.  Or, if you're more productive at nighttime, take a larger break earlier on so you're ready to settle down come evening.

Try not to feel guilty about being out enjoying the sunshine instead of hunched over your textbooks. Remember Vitamin D is important for a   healthy brain.

Snack on brain food

You may feel like you deserve a treat, or that you don't have time to cook, but what you eat can really have an impact on energy levels and focus, so keep away from junk food. Keep your body and brain well-fuelled by choosing [nutritious foods that](https://www.topuniversities.com/blog/brain-food-what-eat-when-revising) have been proven to aid concentration and memory, such as fish,   nuts, seeds, yogurt, and blueberries. The same applies to exam day - eat a   good meal before the test, based on foods that will provide a slow release of energy throughout. Sugar may seem appealing, but your energy levels will crash an hour later.

Plan your exam day

Make sure you get everything ready well in advance of the exam - don't leave it to the day before to suddenly realize you don't know the way,  or what you're supposed to bring. Check all the rules and requirements,  and plan your route and journey time. If possible, do a  test run of the trip. If not, write down clear directions.

Work out how long it will take to get there - then add on some extra time.  You really don't want to arrive having had to run halfway or feeling frazzled from losing your way. You could also make plans to travel to the exam with friends or classmates, as long as you know they're feeling likely to be punctual.

Drink plenty of water

As a final tip, remember that being well hydrated is essential for your brain to work at its best. Make sure you keep drinking plenty of water throughout your revision, and also on the exam day.

Good luck!",13Nov2019,1

446,"Hello reddit. I (American) am planning on sending a friend of mine (Brazilian) a gift over the Christmas season. It is a small gift that will fit in a envelope. Probably 2-3 lbs.

My only concern is that I know once it crosses customs, it’s in the hands of the Brazilian postal service. I used to work for a small business and I remember anytime we shipped internationally, we always used ups because boarder customs were always a hassle.

So, my question is two fold, will there any other fees/costs outside the flat rate to cross customs or that the Brazilian postal service might charge? And in you experience is the cheaper rate to ship internationally with usps worth it in the end or am I guaranteed to run into some issues?

Yesterday she came to me and said she was quitting and it was gonna be hard. The last time she started just lessen the amount of cigarettes per day and getting used to it. This time she just wants to stop out of nowhere. So she had abstinence crisis. She threw up a lot at the middle of the night and she's not feeling really well. I wanted to know ways of helping her through this. Any tips or advice would help a lot. Thank you :)",13Nov2019,1

I was so busy dealing with my mental health I barely noticed she never said why. She gave me a bullshit excuse saying she needed space and she disappeared. She broke up with me months ago. Supposedly already got a new boyfriend when she said needed space. 

I still have her number and the question is killing me. I loved her a lot and still have feelings even when she might have lost hers. I still have her number, should I ask her why she broke up with me?",13Nov2019,1

Pros: Experience, probably a lot of fun, and I’ll get to practice my Spanish. 

Cons: Huge economic downside, since it’s not a paid exchange and I won’t be able to work simultaneously - I won’t be making any money. The thing is that there’s a job in my hometown which pays extremely well but they need me there over the whole summer, otherwise I won’t get a job. I’m paranoid about not having any money saved/not enough money saved once I graduate, but I don’t know what a “normal” amount of saved money would be either.

456,"So this is hard to write since it didn't happen yet, so forgive me if this doesn't make sense.... I'm Male and 15.

1 year ago I met a friend, and by meeting him I also met his friends. Fast forward until 3 months ago, me and this friend, let's call him James, break our friendship. And by breaking my friendship with him (for reasons not important such as not inviting me to places/lying to me about alot of things/bassicaly his entire fault) I also broke my friendship with his friends.

So one of these friends, let's call him Alex, gets really angry at ME for not being friends with James. Now before we go on, this Alex has been bullying me for a good year even before I had trouble with James. Such as: Sending sexually harrassing messages/ calling me by pornstar names/ spitting on me every time I cross paths with him. Oh and also all the sexual harassment in real life such as: touching, cat-calling. And all this time I haven't done one single thing to stop it.

Recently, he started doing these things again. This time I can't take it. I want to be evil, I want to destroy his fucking life. I have thought about killing myself because of him, now he has to pay.

Again, before I go on, I just want to point out that I'm the smart student. I'm an introverted guy that is friends with everybody but doesn't have any ""real friends"". I never use violence, unless I need to. And in this case, I don't think I will. Teachers LOVE me, I get high marks and they never have to tell me to be quiet. So that is an advantage I have, he is stupid, teachers hate him.

My plan is to tell him that I want to fight him, which I have done already. Then tomorrow when he comes, I'm gonna let him score some small punches. Then after that I'm gonna throw myself on the ground and pretend that I got hit really hard. Teachers will come and see what happened, he might think that he won the fight, but I'm gonna win the war.

After that I go to the medical department of the school, tell them what happened, make them file a report. Then I would go back to the school, where he would be sitting at the principal's office, thinking he had won. And then I pull out my phone, where I have all the messages he had sent me, then show the principal my proof. And also tell him about the sexual abuse.

Now, my knowledege of our principal tells me that he is probably going to want to make this thing smaller. Just a shake and we will go back to classes, but what he doesn't know, is that I will tell my father to come after school to pick me up. I will tell him everything today, and get him ready for tomorrow. I will ask the principal to meet my dad and discuss what had happened. After that, Alex's parents will get involved too. Which will destroy his life. Which would include telling his parents that he is gay (which I'm fine with), a sexual abuser, possibly a rapist, and finally a fucking bad person and incapable of going to the real world.

I have planned this thoroughly, I'm sure it will go as planned. People always say: ""If you are getting bullied, stand up for yourself, and tell a trusted adult"". I don't think that I'm doing anything that isn't Justified, should I do this?",13Nov2019,1

I’ve tried to conceal it a bunch of times but it’s tiring honestly. It strains my jaw so much and I really just want to be rid of it.  

So back to the story, We were in the middle of a important event in our school and I was talking to my friend, he was seated at the back of our row with his friends. They were bunch of popular dudes in my class. When i was laughing at something my friend said, he noticed my quiet laughter and in the corner of my eye, pretending not to see him, I saw him talking to his friend (apart of the popular dudes in class) and he was like pointing his finger kinda at me and THEN lowered his lower lip with his finger imitating my lower lip. That’s when i felt really insecure about my lips. I felt like i was the ugliest girl in the world. But it doesn’t end there. On twitter, i saw that he he changed his icon to his selfie with the snapchat filter that has big lips (if you know what i’m talking about) and i just felt like... crying.

So when it comes to sleeping at night things get irritating. 

She is just over a year and still very much a kitten but she can't settle down to just sleep overnight.

So we've had to close the door and not let her into our room overnight.

So the argument was over her friend. 

Them two had sex before we started dating and that’s fine but it makes me insecure when she still wants to see them. 

When I tell her how I feel she doesn’t bother to negotiate or try to make me feel better about my insecurities instead she brings up my other insecurities like my trust issues and just says I need to trust her more and that I’m not trusting her even though I’m trying to. 

I ask her if he flirted with her would she give him another chance. She said she’d give him another chance even though he knows she has a boyfriend beforehand. 

I said that she shouldn’t be giving someone who knows that you have a boyfriend and still chooses to be flirty and try to make a move on her another chance, especially that guy cause he seems like the type to do that. 

She then goes to list off all the people that make me insecure about our relationship and say that she’d give them another chance because they mean a lot to her. To her keep that in mind.

She always has this selfish emotion attitude where she doesn’t care about how I feel it’s always about her. 

Sorry this was a rant but I wanna know if I’m ta for feeling this way or not.

463,"I'll predicate this by saying that I have literally no one to turn to. Not my mother, siblings...I have no friends because I am the definitive shut-in. So in essence I am trapped and I have you guys.

I've never gelled with other human beings. My teachers had suspicions of autism (and even child abuse!) in a British primary school. I never maintained a stable friendship with anyone for more than a month. I was (and probably am) ridiculously shy and (disgustingly) self-effacing. I feel socially very vulnerable and tend towards appeasement to feel I am not targeted or excluded 

I of course like other loser outcasts made academic performance my maim source of social value. Until third year in med school when the accumulating pressure broke me. I am dyslexic and reading is painful...I was first by a mile and lost it after developing suspicions of aspersions such as homosexuality (in an ultra conservative Muslim country!), insanity, ignorance and false success. 

I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia despite never having experienced auditory hallucinations. Something that took my psychiatrists 10 years of resperidal and clopixol to amend to aspergers syndrome and social phobia. After presenting them with large amounts of research on right hemispheric dysfunction too.

Then as I got clearer and clearer I was very good in my career, praised by my peers but still fearful of that same ostracization. And then people attacked me on WhatsApp claiming I was insane, a homosexual, a fraud etc. What's worse is that its spread to my workplace. Girls from a nearby medical college at the hospital laughing and giggling the same things from the WhatsApp attack, he's gay, he's married to a man.

I don't know what to do. I walk out of my house on 40mg propanolol, 60 escitalopram and barely make it out of my neighbourhood without stares, laughs and mocking comments (""thank Allah for giving me the blessing of sanity"", ""he's mindless like an animal"", etc).

Naturally you like my adoring mother would be skeptical but I am caught in a hell I can't get out of. I don't think any human being should suffer this kind of abuse. This is a nightmare in one form of suffering, coming to life.

I don't know what to do anymore.

I really like one girl for some reason and I've been wanting to be with her since my surgery.

I waited until my tumour was out, but of course, for my family it is never a organic health issue, if you feel anything wrong, you must be depressed or stressed.

With me half dead, my mother bought antipsychotics and antidepressants and forced me to take them

They kept at the meds, my mind went downhill. Tried to kill myself, I ended up blaming her and showing her pics 

She mocked me. I never had the opportunity to show what I am, who I am, what I overcame.

470,"&lt;&lt;English is not my native language, sorry for potential spelling / grammar errors&gt;&gt;

I need some advice on how to handle a delicate situation.

There's a woman in my life who is very dear to my heart. Many years ago (10+), she was in a dark place, and noone knew where she was for several months. It turns out that during this peroid. Some men were able to convince her to make an adult film (if you catch my drift). It's important to note that she was under 18 at the time, and I suspect drugs were involved.

The films now recently are popping back up on the internet and are relatively easy to find. She hoped this was a closed chapter of her life, and is absolutely devestated to know that people are finding the videos again. At this point she just wants to ignore and forget. She's not doing so well already because of bad things happening all around her, and this is not something she wants added to her pile of bad news. She also wants me not to think about it and try to forgot the situation.

I on the other hand am finding it hard to ignore and forget. I want some justice for my girl. I was thinking of contacting Google to make the videos harder to find, and contact the host to delete the videos. However I also contacted the police for advice. They say they need a report from the victim. And they advice me not to have the host delete the video's, because this will be proof for her case. 

However the police also tell me that they need her to file a report before they can take any action. And that will require an interview with the police, and having her relive all the things she went through. And seeing how she just doesn't want to be involved with this any more, and she is already not doing well. I don't want to do this to her.

What should I do? Do I give her some time to build the strength to contact the police? Do I convince her? Or should I forget about the police, and try to just have the videos removed? 

Am I being selfish because it's just me that can't handle doing nothing about this?",13Nov2019,1

10 months ago i was 19,i had started eating better and feeling a bit better for the first time after years,and my skin and appearance started improving.I started to feel a bit more confident. It reached the point where i recieved compliments about my looks sometimes,that gave me enough confidense to finally try and engage in flirting.Wanna guess what happened?First 2 weeks i started to have girls starting to smile at me and on some occasions approach me,finally i thought i might pass through all this lonelyness and depressive past and expierience for one time what it feels to be in a relationship.

A few days later when i was staring to feel happier i tried doing some streches before workout i saw for my neck muscles,i might have pulled extra hard and i felt something tearing and then some numbness on my face,i went to the mirror and checked my face and didnt notice much change,it was late so i though it might be just a pulled muscle and i went to sleep.

Next day i woke up with an extremly heavy feeling on my jaw and numbness on face or neck muscles,i went to check the mirror,and for a sec i froze,i noticed my face had being pulled down muscle were a bit swolen and my jawline was gone,my face looked like it doubled in length.I was initially shocked but i also didnt pay too much attention to it,it was unil i got out ofcource,

As i went to the usuall place i buy tickets for bus,i saw the worker i greet every other morning and she smiles,this time i went and noticed she had a very sour and ingorant expression when i told her hi,but idk maybe she had a bad mood i though,Later on i went the place i buy seeds and tea,i also new the worker there and she treated me well but the reaction was the same when i said the usuall good morning.Then i went to the gym,i also noticed the trained casting a weird look at me when he saw me but agian didnt thought much.I finished my workout and went later on to have the test for my uni exams,i was late,so i drew some attention when i have into class with 200 people sitting,As i passed from the hallway to take my test there was a kid from my class sitting on the desk and as si passed by him he looked at me and yelled""Hahaha,look how he has become"".At the momment i didnt really feel anything,i noticed a few stares maybe it was my imagination,i just took the test and went home.

Next day,i still feel som,e heavyness and numbness on face,i went again did my routine and still notice some people  was familiar with,treated me with more indefernce,like i had done something,i also wouldnt get any stares or looks that i sometimes get when i passed by girls.At that point i realized that the only reason for that was my appearnce,i went home took a picture for the first time in a long period with the front camera and looked at my face.I was completly disgusted,i didnt want to believe this is my face at the start,but i was conviced agter a few picks.There was another situation where at my uni i would just pass and there was a group of girls who lookeda t me and said""What?!This is him.i would definately not recocnize him!"" ""We just had a good looking guy in our class,emhpasis on the had."".

Yeah after that i just met a girl i knew and that had flirted wtih before she looked at me for a while,i looked at her and tried smiling at her,she just made a look of disgust.After that i was done,i just went to home,cried,and stopped going to uni the next day.I didnt even go to my exams because i was afraid to show my face to people who knew me before,i missed the whole semester and spend most time closed in my home,went days without eating tried different stuff to see if my face can improve nothing worked,and the worst part is that i didnt mention any of this to my parents.I really cant stand this,i dont want to see the future,my face is fileldwrtih marking,messed up features,assymetry and the damage from malnution i suffered on my teen years.I cdont want see my relatives or classmates,i feel to much shame,and some i have met they didnt even recocnize or where afraid too.I never had a relationship,now im useless,ugly,and untalented,what is there for my future,i cant find any point for me,i just feel humilated every day that passes and i dont have the energy and mental capacity a young person should have to move through this.",13Nov2019,1

The feelings are gone I am not attracted to them anymore. I never ever crossed their boundaries.

481,"Tl;dr at the end. 

Well, thankfully, after weeks of pleading with the ether for my insomnia to lapse, it has! 

And been replaced with vivid and strong dreams of uncomfortable topics.

Thanks. 

Well, last night, I had a dream, involving one of my exes. The specific content isn't important because it was fictional, but basically, he helped me through a difficult task, like the kind human he is.

Now, in college, I wasn't a good partner. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. I was never on the level of doing anything even remotely illegal, but, I was a private school, sheltered, pretty girl who finally had her first taste of freedom. 

I learned I was pretty and good with words and could twist most situations with my partners so I was in control.  

Enter my ex, we'll call him Dan.

Dan and I were on the same NCAA team, but he was a year ahead of me. He and I never really noticed each other until my Junior year. We were both huge Mass Effect nerds. And started bonding over that. But, I was in a relationship with someone we'll call Mike. Mike and  I weren't good for each other. He was a doormat and he let me get away with murder. 

Throughout all of this, Dan, Mike, another friend, and I all start bonding over GTA V and we all play together (it's a SMALL college this is not the weirdest situation to happen.)

Fast forward to April of my Junior year, Mike and I finally break up. And Dan and I get together. We were exclusive or offical. Just...kind of enjoying life. It was great. He was kind and sweet and just wonderful. But over the summer, Mike and I start talking. He and I want to work it out. Now, I know we aren't good for each other, but he's my comfortable and safe choice. With Dan...well the future is scary. 

So I get back with Mike, but very loosely. 

But I don't really tell either of them that I am talking to the other one. To this day, I don't think either knows for sure. 

Fast forward again to October of my Senior, my mental health is in decline. Within a year I had lost both of my grandparents who lived right across the street from me and helped raise me, the Senior year is started to make me crack, I found out my future plan is no longer viable due to hiring freezes...I fell hard and fast into some depression. 

November comes and Dan asks me to be offical. I tell him I can't. And the relationship kind of...pitters off after that. 

We stayed friends and still played games together until Mike and I had an explosive and horrible break up. That kind of killed the GTA game bros.

Well it's been over two years since then. I haven't spoken to Dan since...well, since a night two years ago. I was sexually assaulted by an abusive ex. Dan is a cop now. I call him in tears asking what I can do. He talks me down, wildly uncomfortable, but he is kind and amazing. 

We all play GTA oncle last time about a month later...and that was the last time I spoke to him. 

After all of that, I got my shit together. I went to therapy, for put on medication for anxiety, depression, and ADHD, and started working on bettering myself. 

I know an in a healthy relationship with a wonderful man who I love more than anything. Our relationship is one of mutual respect, trust, and communication. 

Dan, according to his Book of Faces, is in a relationship with a woman that seems great for him.

But fuck, I just want to apologize to him. I was not the best person in college and he got caught up in it. I ruined what could have been a good friendship because of my crazy. 

Like, I still have this beautiful necklace he handmade for me. He was such a good man. He really cared about me and I was...so fucking inexperienced and drowning in freedom.

But like...how do message someone out of the blue after two years and NOT come off creepy or weird?

I just want to tell him that I'm sorry. I was shit person in college. And it took me growing up and looking back on myself to realize that. 

As someone that HAS recieved messages out of the blue from people I hadn't spoken to in years, it's hard to not come off as weird.

Tl;dr - Was a shit partner to so.eone I dated in college. Grew up. Realized I was a shot person. Haven't spoken to him in two years. Want to apologize without seeming creepy. Help?",13Nov2019,1
482,"Lately, my parents have been fighting way more frequently than they usually do.Before they would start fighting, I would bring my little brother and my younger sister into my room and tell them to watch YouTube so they wouldn't be able to hear our parents screaming and the occasional sound of objects breaking. My little sister is 12 but she's mature,  so when I asked how she felt, she replied that if she's married to someone, she doesn't want her kids to experience the same thing, and also, her facial expressions when the argument was going on, was calm and collected. After that I told her if she needed me with literally anything, just ASK. But, I don't know how to help my little brother, yesterday when my parents just started to shout, I would go to them to get my little brother(cause he is always around my mother) and saw that he was in the middle of both of them with this face wanting to cry. By the time I brought him to my room, then he started crying. I just sat there and tried my best to comfort him. Usually the eldest(or the 2nd/3rd) would handle things like this but all 3 went abroad to study and now i have to take care of them. What am I supposed to do here? At this point, I'm willing to try anything, so that I wont see my little brother cry over stuff like this.",13Nov2019,1
483,"For a while now I’ve felt like my own passion isn’t what drives me to do anything these days. I keep tidy , work hard (exercise etc) and try socialise but I don’t do it out of my own natural feelings. 

I feel like I could stay in bed for days watching Netflix but I don’t, because i know I shouldn’t. I don’t even have passion for anything really. It’s just I know that my situation will be worse for me if I don’t do these things. I’m putting a lot of effort into something , but I don’t know what for. 

I’ve lost my hair (due to alopecia) and I have major insecurities. I can’t even see a photo of myself without having a mild freak out. I’m not sure why I carry on moving forward, it just doesn’t pay off. 

The thing is people will say “don’t worry, no one cares what you look like” but that kind of hurts more than anything really. It’s like i will just keep on living alone , being ugly and gay with no one to love but it’s ok cause no one cares what I look like. I really don’t want to become bitter, but I’m finding it so hard ,when all I am is just a nice person. 

No one cares to take it further with me and I can tell how much of a difference being attractive makes in this world.  I’m not basing everything on my looks. I feel like I’ve suffered major mental trauma because of being gay. It messed up my whole perspective on how the world works and who I am. 
My father made me self conscious and introspective at a really young age because I couldn’t process how to handle hiding being gay. He made me see myself as a monster who’s sexuality makes people uncomfortable and disgusted. A deep hatred was being spoken to me, so I started to self doubt and hide who I was in fear of exposing my sexuality. 
I feel like I’ve got to a point where I’ve pushed the part I was trying to keep safe (by hiding my sexuality) so far down, that I’ve forgotten what it even is. (If this makes sense please to you, say it). 
Which is why I have come out to people. Not out of bravery , but out of being a coward. Protecting the thing so much that it disappears and I have nothing to loose by coming out. All self respect has gone, many standards of social life have gone , I’ve lost so much at a cost of self preservation. I find it so hard to talk to people. I remember my dad said ‘even when they say they don’t mind gays, they’re lying’ . It’s not about not believing his words, it’s about the damage I’ve taken as a cost of believing them as a young child / early teenager. Now not only have I suffered the consequences of his words , I’ve also gone fully bald with no eyebrows etc at 19. I hate complaining but I’m so tired of everything. It feels like I’ll be alone for the rest of my life. I’ve been feeling like swallowing a bottle of pills for years but my situation just gets worse gradually, it’s never enough to push me over the edge. I always find hope . I’m not sure if it’s narcissism that keeps me afloat or just the fact that I’m too numb to feel such an emotion to make me do it. I’m just tired of everything. 

Don’t even get me started on finding a man. I was at a point where I was willing to meet up with old men just to feel wanted in some way. I have major issues with feeling like someone wants me around. I have fucked up thought patterns which I constantly battle with. 
For example a while ago I started thinking “if I just killed myself maybe people would miss me and feel sad that I’m gone” . Absolutely disgusting mentality and I still battle with it to this day.  Sometimes I feel like my personality is so unattractive that the only way to get attention from ppl is by doing something stupid or dangerous. To make them stop me, was a way I received wanted attention. I would leave the house at 5 am absolutely shit faced in the hopes someone would come and stop me and tell me not to do it. It’s such a fucked up way of thinking and I hate it. It’s so sad I can’t gain the attention of someone without doing ridiculous things. 

Maybe by putting so much effort into everything in a positive way , I am on the way to gaining the positive attention from the people I want it from. Rather than self destructive acts. Maybe it will actually help me in the long run. I don’t know. But the insecurities are still here. I hate it. I wish I could have my hair back. Then I could go on much happier. Maybe have a chance at finding someone with good standards.",13Nov2019,1
484,"Hey guys. Probably sounds weird at first but please hear me out.
It all started 5 years ago. My family got bunnies. 
1 boy, 3 girls. The boy died after a few days of a suspicious infection. 2 summers ago the living condition of the three got worse. One died of a heat stroke in summer. Living conditions got worse again. Now, this summer, one of the last two remaining ones died as well. I barely come back home anymore but each time I do my heart cries. There is exactly one bunny left, alone. She doesnt get a lot of food, has a very tiny cage. No one plays with her. Plus my parents think it's funny when their dog tries to attack the bunny through the cage. I talked to them about it everytime I'm there. But they never listen, tell me to shut up and that im just trying to fuck them over for some reason. 

Well, I cant look at it any longer. I tried persuading them for along time, even asked if I could ""buy"" the bunny from them. But they dont wanna hear about it, tell me the bunny is fine. He barely moves anymore and is terrified of anything outside the cage. I know I can not keep the bunny myself because I live in a really tiny apartment and wanna get a dog as soon as I have more space. I know I dont have the time to responsibly take care of both. But I also cant let him be there because I think he (the last remaining female bunny, sorry for all the misgendering, my language has gendered articles and that's why I tend to call bunnies ""he"") will either die this winter, this summer or when the dog manages to pry open his cage. I plan too go there Friday morning, take the bunny and bring him to the nearest shelter. I bought a transport box and will go there in a time where no one is home. Now my question- am I a bad person for doing this? I feel guilty even though I am sure it's the right thing to do because otherwise the bunny wont live for much longer. 

And trust me, I tried talking. For more than a year now. Never listen. Never. Shelters told me I should inform the authorities- problem is that keeping a bunny alone is illegal where I live. The fact that most of them died of heatstroke is bad as well. My parents would definitely get into legal trouble and I already know that my younger siblings would suffer as a result, first of all financially.

Thank you for your advice and sorry if anything is unclear",13Nov2019,1
486,"I recently took a new job in a very rural part of the country, because my old job in the city where my friends and family lives, was making me miserable and it was a very toxic environment.

I knew I was going to be in the middle of nowhere, but I never expected it to be this hard. It’s been only a week and I miss my family and friends so much. I cry myself to sleep at night, cause It freaking sucks being here alone. So if I quit this new job and go back to the city where my family and friends are I am going to be jobless and also bunch of “I told you so” from everyone who told me not to go in the first place.

487,"I need some advice. 

I’m a male. I don’t have lots of friends. I have a few different friends groups. One being my main one which is the one I’m having the problem with. 

So my main friend group are my friends in school. There all girls (3 of them). Recently I’ve started to notice a lot more that I’m not valued the same way the value each other. They seem to have these inside jokes and things that I don’t know about and will reference and talk about them when I’m around and won’t tell me what they are. I’m pretty sure they have a separate group chat with out me. They’ve don’t things before without telling me. Recently it’s really been making me sad. Every time something like this happens which is nearly every day in school I get super upset, I just act a little sad (because I can’t help it) but I never really tell them they way they act makes me feel really shitty and sad. 

The reason I’m posting this is today was the breaking point for me where we were all walking down the stairs when school was over and one of them decided to run away, one of them follows and the other one waits a few seconds before following on, she’s kinda the one I’m closest to and most friendly with. She saw my face and how I upset I looked when the two of them ran off and she then ran off with them as well. I then wait there for a few mins and then I see them walking out to the school with there bags, one of them sees me then I turn around and go into the bathroom and start crying. One of them texts me and asks WHERE I WENT!! as if I had went anywhere. She then apologised and said sorry for upsetting me. I haven’t replied yet and I don’t know what to say. 

This is the breaking point for me and it’s making me so feel so shitty everyday. Is this my fault? I really like them, I really do. We’ve been friends for a year. We’ve smoked weed together all as our first times, drank together all as our first time. We’ve done all these things together which I have such fond memories off and still do but I just don’t know.. 

any advice please and I’m feeling pretty depressed atm. Thanks",13Nov2019,1
488,"This is sorta hard for me to explain, but I hope you can understand it, I'm F16. 

In my group of friends I've always been that loud and energetic person in the group, and the one always getting teased.

I've gotten used to the teasing that goes along the lines of ""You're dumb"" and stuff like that, and I've often given these types of teasing as well. But whenever I reccomend something to my friends (bands, songs, games, etc) they'd never take me seriously. For example, I would reccomend a band and they'd start mocking it, even though they have absolutely no knowledge on the band's songs and members. Or when I'm watching a movie or playing a game on my phone, they'd start making fun of it, and they would continue even if I start crying (due to the movie/game) 

Despite the constant teasing and lack of effort in trying any of the reccomdations I'd give, they would get really mad at me whenever I don't try out their reccomdations. One of my friends has been reccomending this band for a while, and since I just never really had the time to check it out because of a bunch of projects I need to do, they'd constantly pester me about it. The thing that bothers me the most is that they actually think about my other friend's reccomendations, it's just me they do this to. 

I'm really tired of it, so I decided to talk to them about it. I'm usually okay with confrontation, but I'm always so energetic with my friends it's just so out-of-character for me that they'd stop listening and usually change the subject. I really, really, want them to stop, it really is affecting me but I don't know how to tell it to them. Any advice on how I can confront them without hurting their feelings?",13Nov2019,1

490,"I saved a kitten three years ago, when she was a week and a half.

I raised her for three years and ended up leaving for college. My first year, she stayed with my parents. I'm in my second year, living in an apartment styled dorm and she's now with me as an ESA. Except, she cries. All the time.

She'll have been here a week soon. She free roams but she'll whine at night, so I keep her with me. I let her out, she'll yell loudly in the living space so I bring her back in. Same thing. Even if I keep my door open.

Constantly. Over everything.

I'm not sleeping, I'm distressed.

She wasn't like this before.

I don't want to surrender her because I do love her, and if I give her back to my parents, I can't have her back when I get an apartment.

491,"I am 18, the year is 2019. People form groups right, they hang out in these groups and dont tend to really talk to people beyond that. In college, I have many options for girls to pursue. But I don't know how. I mean, they dont expect it. Going up and saying ""Hi"" like most of what the internet suggests just seems ridiculous to me. Bare in mind I am in the UK too, if that makes any difference (I've heard its more commonplace to talk to strangers and introduce yourself in America, whether that's true or what, idk.)
I get much eye contact but do not know how to go beyond that. Remember that people my age are big into social media, so that is like the go to way to talk to someone, eliminating the whole potential awkwardness and whatnot, so I don't even know if they would feel comfortable with me approaching them irl. I'm just baffled. Been single for a long time and just don't really know what to do, I want a relationship, but its been years of nothing, waiting for nothing. I'd definitely find that catching them alone would be better. But what would I even say? I feel like we are all so disconnected from each other, as if its weird to talk to new people. Just don't get it. It's all I really care about too. Just want a person to hang with that is a girl (I barely have any contact with them).

492,"I have a female best friend for almost a year, we got along very well, I went in a different school for about 4 months, and we kept talking to each other online. After that my family had financial structure to put me back in my old school, with her. My first day there, nothing unusual, she made new friends, and had a crush on one of her closest friends. I've never felt jealous, but in these past few months, I got anxiety symtons (sry dont know how to write it), my dad refused to get me into a therapyst.

Her best friend committed suicide last month, one of her favorite artists too, and since then shegot very sad, obviously, but with her other friends, she laughs, talks, make jokes, and then with me, all we talk are musics, idols, and sometimes series.

And its blatant, when she is with me or in a conversation with me involved, she becomes a lot more unhappy, sometimes ignore me, and when i leave the situation, she becomes happy all of sudden.

10 of November was the birthday of her best friend, and, obviously, she got sad. I tried talking to her, be there for her, I explained how I care about her, how much I love her and how good of a friend she is.
 
She has severe depression and anxiety, along with that disease that she can't concentrate very well, and sometimes has suicidal thoughts and episodes, so I thought it would be great to say all of that to her.

Since then she stopped showing emotions to me at all, and my only interactions with her are conversations that I appear in, not invited at all.

Our friend group consist of 4 people, 3 females and me. Right now, she wrote A and B friend's names on her notebook, not included mine. Am I overthinking? Probably. lmao even their surnames..

She consistently asks me to bring her backpack to the classrooms while she goes to the bathroom with A and B. I feel used, giving, giving and giving,and not getting anything. Last week, she was crying and I was the only one to support her. We wnt home together, and while we were walking she started ranting on her friends, about how shes there every time for them, and when she gets bad, nobody's there for her. But I was there. She said ""I think the only people I should help are you and (girlfriend's name)""

That day I felt aknowledged, reminded of. The day after that, she's all buddy buddy with her friends, even after all that roasting that she made. And surprisingly, she was more friendly with them than with me. Every day they exclude me from their jokes, memes and conversations. I talked to her last night about that, and she said it was everything jokes, nothing serious. Exact words? ""Não é isso, para de pensar assim"". Roughly translates to ""That's not it, stop thinking of it like that.""

She hasn't spoken to me since, she shares memes with them, and I feel alone, empty inside.

Our friendship for the last year has built for me a huge love for her, so I care ""too much"" about how we are going, how she treats me, how I treat her, etc. And when I think something is going wrong, I start having more anxiety symtons, and a little bit of depression symptons. I'm scared of talking to her about this, scared that things change to worse.

I feel very insecure of my personality, and talking at all, since B simply doesn't like when I talk, and A just ridicularize me. I don't talk that much, since I don't want to be ridicularized, so I guess it's my fault too that she rarely talks to me.

Right now they sat in a differemt table than me, so now I'm just with a couple of friends that I'm not that close to. Texted her, she ignores me.

I've ready told her a bit of how I feel, and she said that ""You're my best friend, I would never do this with you on purpose"". But I think that I can't take her words seriously, because of all that she already did and say.

I already talked to my dad of going to a psychologyst, but he refuses to, because ""They will give you medications that will rewrite your personality and I don't want that."" And even saying that I need to at least get diagnosticated, so I won't think I have it/it's worse than I thought, he refuses toeven have a word about it.

She's my best best friend, of 3 best friends I have. We have a best friend in common, and she talks so much more with her, than with me. We used to have about 100 messages per day, now it's about 10, 8 of them being mine. And I give my best to not be annoying, I try to talk to her like we used to, but she just won't. Again, I am scared of what I might do, that is, accept it and stop talking to her eventually, for the best.

After her best friends death, she is a lot quieter. WITH ME. With other friends, it's immediate response, laughter, memes, but then with me? Only responds fast when she's ready online, when she's not, even that she spends her whole day on her phone, the fastest response I've had was 2 hours. Some days, she won't respond at all.

""I don't like to talk online, you know that"" Yea say that to your 15 messages in one minute to our friend. I might send her this thread, because she will not respond me seriously if I talk to her, so it's already written, and she can't interrupt me.

With all that negligenciation that she has with me, I started feeling empty, sad. Did I became emotionally dependant of her? I believe not, and I hope not. With my family I've been agressive, with my other friends I've been annoying, just because I want someone to aknowledge me, to show love to me.

One of my other female friends posted something like ""give me 2 challenges, I can only say 'no' to one of them"", and what did I did? I could've asked for something challenging, like do a backflip or something like that. But no, I kindly asked for her to hug me. That was the only demonstration of caring that I had on some days. My parents? Or they are too tired from work, or they are mad at me for ""being rebellious"".

Please help me, my only escape from thinking of this is sadly, hearing heavy metal and jerking off. I don't want to become this kind of person.

493,"Hi,

I would like some opinions on my current situation with my friend. 

Background 
Around July time my friend (we’ll call her R) met up with me and we was discussing plans for her birthday and agreed I would take her to Harry Potter at the Warner Bros studios. 
Unfortunately my partner (we’ll call him G) is really struggling with depression and unable to keep a job at the moment and R is fully aware as she has helped with CV writing etc. 
It got to a month before and I was holding out for deals to appear or my partner to get a job so we had more income but when I crunched the number, R’s Birthday trip to Harry Potter Tours was really unrealistic for my finances and I informed her a month before. To which she sent this message;

R: “Months ago you told me you would take me and there wasn't any ""if G didn't get the job"".
Like I said you knew when my birthday was and you had plenty of time.
Your partner's financial situation shouldn't affect how you treat your friend and I shouldn't have to chase up something you've booked.”

This message is the most important as this is the one playing on my mind. Most of our back and forth was me trying to justify why I could afford it i.e cash &amp; situation 
Since this I have distanced myself and avoided contact (we mainly talked over messenger) and she recently reached out to ask how I was.

The thing is I’m not angry or holding a grudge I just feel really hurt by R. I feel as a best friend she should of been more understanding and supportive and not being a brat about it. 

I’m currently in two minds whether to cut all contact or try and be friendly again but I don’t think I could be me or talk about myself around her. I personally think she’s kind of turned our friendship toxic.",13Nov2019,1
494,"I just started working at a large school in the administration department. I am a fresh college graduate and all my coworkers are either in their late forties or late fifties .When I first started working there I was told that it would take at least one year for me to learn everything because there is a lot of information and material to go through. I was told I'd be in training until December and that is what I've expected so far. At the beginning of training I was doing very well and mastering all of my assessments. Suddenly the person who does training started cancelling (multiple times) and I've felt stuck and in need of help. When I asked my supervisor for assistance in lieu of training he said ""it's a process"" and told me to go watch someone else work. So all of the questions I had I asked this person. The issue with that is this person didn't know the answers to some of my questions and when she di d answer it was sometimes wrong. At the time I didn't know it was wrong and was taking her answer as fact. So after being gone for two weeks the trainer comes back and issues a test that I fail. This is used as justification that this department might be a bad fit and that I'm not doing well. 

What makes this worse is I feel completely misunderstood by my coworkers. The other new hire in another department is 40 and openly shares photos of her children, house, etc. As for myself, I am not that open. On more than one occasion a male supervisor kept asking me about my dating life and if I had someone interested in me. I was shocked but respectfully said I don't answer personal questions like that.  Of course that was taken as an offense and they've been treating me strange ever since. Since I don't answer these questions about myself I was told that I'm not building relationships with anyone in the department. However, a couple of times I have commented on the information they freely shared and because of that I was told I ""dish out questions but can't take personal questions"". Again, I respectfully said I understood and said that it wasn't intentional and that I didn't mean to cross any boundaries. A few moments after this when I went to my desk to check emails, that same woman then accused me of filming her. I don't know if she was joking or if she was serious, but she said she felt like she was being filmed by me. From that moment she's been making things difficult and ignoring me if I ask questions or try to speak with her. I have to go out of my way to be recognized and get help. I don't know if it's because I'm 30 years younger than her, but she made a thing about me calling her by her first name.

So with all of this the boss comes to speak to me yesterday and he tells me that I don't know everything and that I need to be teachable. And I said that I've felt just a tiny bit frustrated with the training because so many have been cancelled and also because I've been unsure of what methods/procedures to do because some information has been inconsistent. He said I shouldn't be frustrated, that I'm making excuses, and that there are personality clashes. So I don't know what to do.",13Nov2019,1
495,"My first two years of University went extremely well, getting good grades and passing every class I took, I even managed to get in to a scholarship program that replaced my 4th semester.   


This year, however, things have went extremely poorly to say the least. To the point where I've just barely passed most units and in some cases failed some :(.

496,"Okay so, my entire family loves cats. However, it's been a hot minute since my mother has had one and she keeps leaving food lying around. Which of course, the cat is going to try and eat. And then mother gets mad because the cat was being a cat. 

What I really need is some advice on how to help the family adjust to owning a cat again. Nothing I've said so far has helped and I'm afraid it may be the way I'm wording it, though it possibly could be unwillingness to change despite the new addition of our furry companion. 

The cat is a bit older, though we aren't 100% sure how much older yet. (Vet appointment is incoming), she's been fully declawed (not by us, I'm 100% against declawing) and I'm fairly certain with the way her belly hangs slightly she's been spayed. (Again, vet appointment incoming.) 

Anyway, any advice at all is appreciated. I've never had issues like this until now because I always had at least one cat growing up and we just adapted to it without issue. Now issues are everywhere and its stressing my mother out more than it should be. 

Also any advice on how to properly take care of a declawed cat because I've never in my life owned one would be appreciated! ",13Nov2019,1

499,"Hi folks,

I've been agonising about this for ages and I'd be super grateful for some advice from people who don't know me personally. Sorry this is not concise!

Background: 

I was lucky enough to get into a very good university. I ended up doing well on my degree, but completely failed to deal with the depression and eating disorder that plagued me through it. I graduated, got a well-paying job at a prestigious company, again was deemed to be performing very well... but I was also working 70-80 hours a week, had no social life whatsoever, was bingeing and purging constantly, and would go AWOL for 2-3 days every 3 months when the depression got on top of me (how they didn't fire me I'll never understand). I still don't even truly know if I enjoyed the work overall... 

After 3-4 years of this I think I just panicked - the project I was working on had some programming-adjacent stuff in it, which I'd never done before but really enjoyed, so I made a snap decision that I was going to go back to school to do a master's in CS, and about a month later (! see above re: not thinking through) I did. 

That allowed me to discover that building cool shit is pretty much my jam, but losing the only structure/community (my workday) that had kept me going as a semi-functional adult for the past 4 years also took its toll. Halfway in the depression had got way worse, I hated everything I was doing, was terrified of failure etc etc. I took a year out. 

I got on meds, got a therapist (who is trying to push me in the direction of figuring out wtf I was feeling and/or wanted and didn't want at any given moment, but it's hard going). When the end of the year came around I had to decide whether I wanted to go back to the course (which involved sitting a bunch of exams before I could resume). It didn't feel like something I was passionate about at that point, or something I could do without diving straight back into the bulimia/depression pool, so I didn't finish. 

Now it's been 6 more months - I've embarked on a few, more manual projects that I found easier to manage myself through (sports photography, woodworking), but I'm scared of how difficult it would be to make a living going into any of those trades. I'm also getting broker! 

I'm actually beginning a proper job search now (incl. figuring out what the fuck I can do on an 80% basis that will pay the bills), but on ill-thought out impulse I applied for a job with a tech start-up that was looking for people with my profile a few weeks ago (consultancy + some programming). 

They've offered me a job that's 3/4 of what I made before (which is not crazy, my previous industry was well-paid) but they don't have a great rep, culture-wise, and even though they've tried to reassure me re: work-life balance they come off as super-competitive and output-focused. I'm scared that if I went I would just work myself into a hole again, even if I tried not to, and all that for some ex-IB guys who are in it for the IPO. On the other hand, it's money now, which I need, I don't need to relocate (which I will need to if I pick up freelancing contracts while I look for something more permanent) and I guess the work would be intellectually?? interesting??? and varied

503,"Before I say anything, I just want to say that this is more of a lighter advice request and the advice isn't anything urgent. I've been having a huge crush on this one celebrity for about a month now and for the most part, they are all I think about when I go out and daydream. 

I tend to have limited yet extreme interests and she happens to be one of them now. It is actually refreshing in a way, as I tend to also be extremely socially awkward, so making friends/relationships are hard. It feels nice to be able to fall for someone and just have that feeling again. 

Then again, it comes with the downsides, like knowing there are others in the world this celebrity has been with, and how other people daydream about her. I know, it's dumb, but it just makes me a bit sad knowing that in the back of my mind. I get really down on myself because of it, knowing I'm not good enough for people like that, despite all the love I have for them. Which is why I'm asking for advice. Should I continue daydreaming about her, if it makes me feel good at the end of the day? Anything is appreciated! Thank you all",13Nov2019,1

508,"TLDR: How do I find time to look for jobs, read, write, learn, and do basic living necessities with like 5 hours of downtime a day?

Contrary to what the title might convey, I am also an adult. But I just graduated and I'm having a hard time finding time to do the things I both need to do and want to do. 

A little overview for context: I'm an English graduate currently working part-time in an unrelated field at a math-only learning center.  I have a lot of goals for myself. For financial stability, I need to find a new job. I'm also taking an online class for IT in hopes this will help. For anxiety, I need to play chess. For my personal edification, I need to read and practice Spanish. Because of my own ambitions, I need to write. Because of vanity and general concern for health, I need to work out. This doesn't include the things I actually want to do to maintain basic happiness like watch TV, play video games, and go out. 

The problem is how to find the time. I regularly workout from 6-8 am. And I'm ready to get on with the day by 9:30 am usually. But I can be scheduled to work as early as 2:30 pm and be back as late as 8 pm, sometimes later. So in the mornings I'm typically applying to jobs, but I'm a cover letter person and if it's not one of those 1-click thingies there's a lot of info to fill out. And what if I want to read, or write, or do my IT classes? You get the idea. And then when I come home it's already late. I often obsess over new jobs to apply to and end up going to bed later than is recommended, which just ruins my workout and energy for the next day.  Also, I have issues staying awake in general, so making time for all this stuff by cutting out sleep intentionally would be a no-no anyways. 

The other problem is I work every day.  My job has shorter shifts than most so I guess giving employees 2 days off automatically isn't a thing they do. Either that or its because they're understaffed. I could take a day off myself but my financial insecurity always gets the better of me. Especially since I need to pay student loans soon and I'm trying not to dip into my savings because one of my goals is to move out of this expensive city.  On weekends, I work in the morning til about 3 pm but the rest of the day is often spent running errands like grocery or laundry. 

Long story short, I'm wondering if anyone has some miraculous time management tips or scheduling loopholes?",13Nov2019,1

But to me, that guy is super human, I got horny jus watching it, how the fuck would I ever not get a boner? Or is there some really right underwear that even if I'm boner girls wouldn't notice, and eventually the boner would go away, with practice?

&amp;#x200B;

And since I'm virgin I'm not sure, but once I have sex, will it make me less horny? Or is it like fapping? Because definitely fapping helps deal with being horny, if I didn't fap I would get boners while hugging girls, but I think I know for a fact that even if I fap right before a jiu jitsu class, I would be able, easily to get a boner if I had to practice with a girl, even if I don't even want to fuck her, and I don't really find her attractive, I think it would happen.

&amp;#x200B;

So first of all am i crazy? Is this normal? Can I work on it? Because I want to have sex and be horny and all, but when I want to, when it's appropiate, I'm not going to jiu jitsu to get horny, so it's just my body not being aligned with my wishes.

And actually I feel inspired, becasue I didn't know (Im a virgin, give me some slack) that you could control your body so much you can practice jiu jitsu with girls and not to have a raging boner.

Back in August I was driving my (23F) 2010 chevy malibu on the highway when the service light came on and it read ""engine power reduced"" and just stopped. I was lucky to coast off the highway and was able to get off the road, but after my car stopped it wouldn't even turn on. I was able to get it towed to a service station and they told me that something was wrong with my valves (?) and needed to take it to the dealership to get it fixed, they also said that this is a common occurrence in my kind of car, and there may be a recall.

The next day I took it to the dealership and tell them what happened and what the mechanic at the service station told me, and they said that it was going to cost $2,000 to conduct the tests necessary to find out what the exact problem is. A couple days later they called and told me they were going to have to replace all the valve heads on my engine, and it was going to cost another $2,100 to fix. 

The dealership had my car for over two months, and they called me last week and told me that my car was ready to be picked up and all the problems were fixed. I paid the $4,100 and drove off. 

Last night I was driving my car and the same thing happened AGAIN, the engine light came on and the car read ""engine power reduced"" and just stopped. I had to call a tow truck and get it towed to the dealership again. Just to have the guy say that ""he was going to take a look at it and see what was wrong."" I am pretty furious that I spent $4,100 to fix my car for that to apparently not even be a problem, and I don't want to have to spend more money when they wasted two months of my life and thousands of dollars to repair something that wasn't even the cause of the problem.

One thing I continuely get stuck on in my mind is this:
I would wake up frequently while sleeping with my ex to him having sex with me. We would be in the spooning position and I would wake up due to him having sex with me. I assume he would have only just started and I woke up pretty fast but then I'm not exactly sure.
I know this sounds like a stereotypical rape thing but I'm not sure it is because I would never stop him once I was awake. Usually I was still half asleep and I remained that way until he finished, but sometimes it would progress into 'proper' sex.
I never said no and didn't really think much of it at the time but for some reason I can't stop thinking about it at the moment. It is likely just an anxiety thing that's made me focus on it but I figured I would post here and see what you guys think.

The new job that was offered is way easier and less stressful and the man in charge is super friendly. What do you guys recommend? Should i stay at this one? The people are friendly so far.

So basically two months ago I moved to a new country alone to study in a performing arts school (3 year course). At the start I was obviously very homesick and I figured it would pass but it’s only gotten worse. To start, I am slightly older than some of my classmates and it’s hard enough to bond with them without adding the fact that they are all your typical musical theatre type personalities and I am not. The course very much revolves around getting performers on stage, and I am very much not a performer, I’m a dance teacher through and through so I don’t feel this course gives me the right path to follow, although the training is excellent. Apart from all of that I just miss my home, I miss my family and my friends and my boyfriend and I only get to see them a handful of times through the year. I walked away from an amazing teaching job back at home with students who meant the world to me, and I left an opportunity to gain my teaching qualifications all because I felt like I had something to prove by moving abroad. Now I’m starting to think it was a mistake. There are a handful of reasons stopping me from just packing up and moving home, the first is that I’m afraid I’ll just be seen as a failure and I don’t want to disappoint people. The second and most important is that my parents have very kindly offered to pay my tuition (around ten grand). There is no way I’d drop out without paying them back every penny obviously but I know that they would be so angry because really it is wasted money. I am at a loss because I am so depressed, I don’t get out of bed unless I have to, I cry all the time, I’ve started drinking by myself on the weekends, I’m even wishing that I get badly injured or really ill so that I have to go home, I’m just not myself at all but I really don’t want to let anyone down.

547,"Some facts:
21 yo. First job out of college. Working from home. Very little rent. Make roughly $3500 per month. I have 50k in savings, and about 10k left in student loans.

Been struggling with this for awhile now - almost since I started the job. I do not enjoy my job or interracting with the people I work with, whether over phone or email. When I wake up in the morning I dread seeing emails or voicemails pop up, seeing more than a handful makes me want to roll my eyes.

The job involves staring at spreadsheets and cross referencing numbers and text all day, while trying to keep track of dozens of different assignments all at once, all in varying stages of completion. I find it stressful and difficult to work by jumping from one assignment to the other every half hour, and it does not feel like my brain works that way - Im much better at focusing on one single objective for a long period of time rather than hopping back and forth. Because of dozens of different tasks, as well as constantly having to rush to get everything done, it feels like an uphill battle where I am always making mistakes and am always behind. There is little support from the rest of the staff, as I'm mostly left on my own to figure anything out, being isolated from everyone else, om top of them dealing with their own assignments.

I've had numerous ""mental breakdowns"" (not sure what to call it) over the past couple years at this job, throwing pens, ripping up binders, screaming at my computer, because of the stress. I'm embarassed by this childish behaviour, but I cannot tell whether this is due to immaturity or simply an incompatibility with this job.

I do not know if quitting is the ideal thing to do, when I don't have anything else lined up. My parents have raised me to have a strong work ethic, which is the cause of my conflict on deciding if I should quit, but part of me feels like this job is just too much pressure. The money is good, but I cant tell when the ideal time is for me to just give up, take a month or two off, and find something else.",13Nov2019,1

550,"So I’ve been talking to this girl lately and she’s been hesitant to try things but last week I was at her house for a few hours and we made out here and there and I was super horny the entire time, including my dick being hard.  Yesterday she came over and a similar thing happened but for much longer, except at first I was very horny but as time went on I slowly started to get less and less and by the end I could barely get my dick hard if I tried.  Yesterday she prefaced things by saying she didn’t want to “do things” (sex) but I think by the end of the night she really wanted to.  I’m worried though because I’m going to her place today and now I’m scared that my dick won’t get hard or something and it’ll just be disappointing for everyone.

Some things that may have contributed to it (these are simply guesses but could have had no effect)
- I masturbated the two days before she came over yesterday and I don’t normally do that with that frequency 
- I was stressed because my grandparents were home (although last week her grandma was home as well)
- I had just smoked weed and a lot, for the first time in a while the day before

555,"I’m using an alt and being a little vague because I know she’s on Reddit.

So my best friend moved very far away when we were young but we’ve stayed friends. She recently moved closer (relatively speaking) and I invited her to my house for thanksgiving.

She’d expressed that she wanted, while she was visiting me, to visit another friend that she went to high school with (when she lived far from me) and who goes to the same college as me, albeit on a different campus.

Cool beans. I thought that sounded like a good idea so no problem.

Now she’s asked if this friend can come to my house for thanksgiving too.

All I know about this other friend is her name. I’ve never met her and I don’t know anything about her. I haven’t seen my best friend since last summer and she hasn’t been in the area for about five and a half years.

It was cool when she wanted to go visit this friend but I was under the impression that my best friend and I would get *some* time alone but now it’s looking like this other friend is going to be spending considerably more time than my best friend initially told me. (And for all I know, my best friend has already mentioned this idea to her.)

So I’m torn. On the one hand, I want my best friend to be happy and enjoy her time here and I would like to open my house to whomever would like to spend thanksgiving dinner there.

On the other hand, I feel really put on the spot. This was very abrupt. My best friend isn’t staying here very long. I don’t know this girl and I’m really frustrated because I thought my best friend and I would be able to spend that time alone together. And it’s not like thanksgiving dinner is the only time during this trip she’s going to see the friend.

559,"This person (I'll call them ""A"") has a history of taking things personally and being on the defensive.  We work for a relatively young company and admittedly things got off to a rocky start, but we are really starting to settle in.  A has been with the company since the beginning (as have I), and has been at the center of several past disagreements.

Recently A sent an email to someone in our company (""B""), and that email went unanswered for a couple of weeks. Rather than send a follow up email checking on the status of a reply, A sent a lengthy email to B talking about how it was really rude to not reply, that this is the kind of behavior that she has come to expect from that department, and generally being kind of an ass.  

The very next day another coworker (""C"") sent an email to A regarding some corrections that were needed to a document (this is typical in our line of work, there are several people who review these documents). A believes these corrections were not needed, but rather than simply stating that A went on a tangent about why they were not needed and had a general ""I know better than you"" vibe to the reply. It really was unnecessary.

I have known and worked with A for several years.  We even occasionally get together outside of work. I have figured out how to navigate A's personality and I know how A's mind works, but the same cannot be said for everyone in our company.  I know what A was trying to accomplish with the email responses, but I also understand how A came across to B and C.  When I was promoted to supervisor, A became one of my team members.  My boss was made aware of both of the situations mentioned above and has asked me to deal with it.  My question is how.  How do I step into my supervisor shoes to talk to A about how they are coming across?

560,"
After a divorce last year I (31m) have been dating a girl (29f) who seems completely perfect for me for the last few months. We have things in common and enjoy spending time together. My only problem is that it feels like I am dating her entire family and I don’t know how to bring it up politely or fix the situation.

For some background I come from a very broken and toxic home and am not in contact with any members of my family whatsoever. I have no kids.

She has a 4 year old and lives with her parents and has for a while. Her mother needs a lot of help with everything due to medical issues and in turn her parents help out with watching the kid. Recently her sister also moved into their house with her 4 year old son. It’s a total madhouse.

My problem is that she always wants me to spend time over there since she can never get away from responsibilities. The kids always want me there and I guess her parents do too since they invite me to everything. I like her family a lot and we get along but it can be a pretty uncomfortable situation for me since I can’t relate and always feel very uptight like I can’t really be myself when I’m around them since my sense of humor can be very crass and offensive. We might hang out 4 days a week but only get a moment alone for a couple hours every week, maybe. I think she realizes this is a problem already but I’ve never brought it up.

It feels pretty terrible thinking I could let something like this could get in the way of our relationship. I sincerely admire her sense of responsibility and dedication but I’ve never dated anyone who doesn’t have a similar family background and the whole situation feels pressured and strange from my end even though it’s a perfectly normal family dynamic.

Any advice on how I can address this and rectify the situation without hurting her feelings or coming off like an asshole?",13Nov2019,1
561,"Hey guys! A friend of mine streams on a certain game and she has some regular viewers who watch her. Recently this guy has started joining her Twitch chat asking invasive questions and even managed to find out the server we are on and coincidentally he was on our server. He joined us for some games as just a little bit of fun but later that night i left, and he was staying around and messaging her more questions in-game etc. kept giving her gifts and other things which she all declined. 

&amp;#x200B;

We thought he would go away after the little game we had... we like to keep our group closed but we still casually play with random players and we move on. This guy however keeps sticking around and my friend keeps telling me she's getting a little tired of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

He's followed us in game and I've seen him in-game standing in the distance, we would go to random places we don't normally go and he's there too. 

he went on another character and was asking us to join our group of friends for gaming fun however we werent taking anyone on in our group. he was private messaging other members in our group asking to join. I had to cut it clear and whispered this guy we arent taking anyone on. 

&amp;#x200B;

He understood the direct message from me but then went on her Twitch channel saying passive agressive things like ""thanks for not inviting me"" etc. kind of left her in an awkward position on stream. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although she streams, she's not really a confident person in general with socially interacting with other players and Ive noticed its started to effect her confidence. she keeps appearing offline now while messaging me that he's still trying to send gifts to her.

He got the clear message from me but it's apparent he's still not stopping and she's too scared to talk to him.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to step in now and cut this shit before it gets worse. I told her to add him to the ignore list and she said she will do it soon but I just want to speak to him and make him aware he needs to stop or we will have to end up blocking

&amp;#x200B;

I dont quite know myslelf on how to tell someone to ""piss off"" politely. Im not a nasty person in general but she's a good friend and seeing her like this is not fair. Is there any way i can compose a message to him to say ""leave us alone"" without sounding like a douche?

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to compose something like ""hey dude, thanks for playing with us last week, but can you stop sending gifts and following us in game? I can apreciate we are nice people and we had some fun that one time, but we just want to keep things closed in our group."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Like TECHNICALLY he's not doing anything wrong sending gifts, but it's making her uncomfortable... I just suck at social interaction too with telling someone to go away

My boss has an open door policy, so I hear everything that he says to her unless he has his own door shut which is not too often. Over time, my boss has berated her in front of clients for the work she does, finding little mistakes and micromanaging. He's threatened to fire her on three separate occasions in October, and today it came to a head again. He told her to get out of his office, but then continued to yell at her for about forty minutes. He told her that she would never change and that he will get someone new and that he was done with her. He told her she was fired multiple times. She tried to defend herself but to no avail. Then, out of nowhere, he said ""I tell you what I'll give you. I'll give you one month to get your act together"". He then said that if she improves to where he wants within the next month then he will let her stay. My moral quandary is that I have seen her cry after being yelled at by him. He's an asshole toward her, and honestly I thought her leaving the office would be the best for the both of them.

The problem here is that I don't know exactly what she has but I can tell she's mentally screwed in the head, in this case most likely manic-depressive disorder due to the laughing fits and the sad look she always has on her face (even during her laughing fits which creeps me out), and NPD due to the fact that she is specifically targeting me and ignoring my comfort levels.

About a year ago, my partner and I thought we were going to be murdered by a guy with a gun. Afterwards, I was diagnosed with ptsd, and my therapist and I know that I’m doing much better. I’ve stopped going to therapy regularly (therapist was on board with that decision), and I’m doing much better and feel like myself again.

Anyway, recently a coworker pretended to shoot me with their finger shaped like a gun. It fit with the context of our conversation (I’m a law clerk and the case involved a gun), but the coworker still meant it as a joke. I was instantly pretty disturbed by that. For me, it instantly brought the conversation to a 10 in seriousness when we had been having a pretty relaxed conversation before. I mean, that’s fine when you need to have a serious conversation, but as I said, he meant it as a joke.

I didn’t say anything, because I wasn’t sure if my reaction was based on a personal problem that I should deal with in therapy, or if anyone would be disturbed by that. I guess I’m wondering if pretending to shoot someone as a joke is the same as casually saying “cunt” during a conversation, or something else that others would think would elevate the seriousness of a conversation.",13Nov2019,1

My friend (we'll call him X) and I met about 5 years ago.  He is a great dude, everybody loved him, and was the life of the party.  X is a really smart kid.  He seems to know everything under the sun, and when he gets into something - he gets fucking into it.  

  
About 2 years ago is when this all started.  He started watching Infowars/Alex Jones (which I don't have a problem with, I think he's actually funny sometimes). From there, he started getting deeper into politics, finding everything he could about the deep state and the atrocities that well-known politicians commit. I said whatever, focus on school and shit and do what you want in your free time.

  
After a few months, he started going deeper down the rabbit hole - which escalated to 8chan, the known website of psycho boomers and mass killers alike. Not everything on 8chan seems bad, but the stuff he was getting into was some of the crazy conspiracy bullshit. Now, he is starting to discredit his lord and savior Alex Jones, calling him a shill of the military and whatnot. This is where I am starting to build some concern. 

  
Now, X starts getting into Q (look up what Q is if you don't know), which is basically a theory that there is a secret operation going on within the White House that sends coded messages to the followers of Q that predict certain events. X has these phases of being super intense on something for a few months and letting it go and moving on, so I figured that it was one of these phases. 

Except it really wasn't. A year later X is still sending all of our friends texts/links on a daily basis to crazy-ass threads about God knows what. We are all well-versed in politics, but we could not wrap our heads around Q's bullshit nonsense. He has since been betting multiple friends (up to a few thousand dollars) that certain high-level politicians will be arrested under the Trump administration (Obama is not going to be arrested lol), and has picked up quite a distaste for Jews.  He has distanced himself from our Jewish friends, calls them retards and shit, without much reasoning as to why. They disagree with him politically, but before all of this, we were still cool with each other. 

If you disagree and try to have discourse with X, he will just dismiss you as being inferior because we have not done the extensive ""research"" that he has. It is infuriating to be at social events (or even just hanging out) and all he discusses is the rabbit hole, how JFK Jr is still alive, how Obama is going to Guantanomo, and all of this crazy fucking nonsense. I have to give him credit though - if he applied all of this energy into something else, he would probably be a millionaire by now. 

Recently is when it started to get really crazy.  He went out with our friends and started explaining that he ""thinks we live in a closed system where the earth is a battery the sun is the positive node and the moon is a negative node"". WHAT. He also talked about how gravity/space/Antarctica is fake and that he will harness energy in order to figure out how to levitate.  Note that this kid used to be completely competent and had absolutely nothing wrong with him. 

He has recently started talking about how Jews are bad, they run everything, you need to read into it, etc... A few weeks ago, he mentioned he is now starting to read and research the Quran (grew up atheist) and wants to start ""befriending"" Muslims because their ideals seem much better than those of the Jews.  

To be completely honest, I don't think he would act on anything.  He isn't the type of guy that will actually put a plan into action, but rather just read and consume the knowledge that he wants.  I still love the guy, but it is getting to the point where I feel like he's too far down the rabbit hole. We've tried explaining that even if it were all true, he needs to focus on himself and his life or else he will go out of control (and that he has explained he can't do anything about it), and there is no point in adding this stress and information into his life when he should be focusing on school, the professional world, and his future. 

I really just want the kid that used to smash chicks and chug beers back.  It is sad to see what is happening.",13Nov2019,1

582,"Around 2 weeks ago I met this girl at a party (I’ll call her J to make explaining easier) and after a pretty long, yet fun, night, I was able to get her snapchat (such a Gen Z think I know) and we’ve been talking just about every day since then. Me and my friend (who I was able to hook up with J’s roommate) ended up going to hang out with these two girls this past weekend. It was a pretty cool night just getting to know each other more since we really didn’t know anything about each other aside from our age and where we are from. After talking every day for a little over two weeks I’ve been thinking about asking J to hang out with it being just the both of us but i’m not really sure if it is too early for that. The only reason I believe that it’s too early is because I noticed she just got out of a relationship around September of this year and just recently deleted all of the pictures of her ex from one of her social media accounts (She told me they were in an argument and I believe that argument finalized the break up). So with that being said is it too early to ask her out due to her just getting out of a relationship or should I wait a little while to ask her out? 

If anything about this is confusing I would be glad to try and explain it better in the comments. Thanks!",13Nov2019,1
583,"Hi everyone! This is my first post ever, and hopefully I'm in the right subreddit.

So, essentially, this is my first school year living in an apartment. I've never lived in an apartment. I'm also a transfer student, so I'm still working out the kinks to the new school and making friends. My question is about the apartment I'm living in. 

I live in a 1BR/1BA with a roommate, and she had put in a maintenance request. However, when maintenance came by, she was sleeping. I was going to wake her up, but the maintenance person said that he'd come back at a different time--he said this on his own. We also got an email from the leasing company later that day that the guy was coming again within the week. He did not. 

Now, in our tenant portal, we have a charge of 30 dollars because ""Service Call- declined by tenant."" I called the leasing company about this, and they told me basically what the portal said. I asked where that was written on the lease, but they never told me and repeated the same thing. I know 30 is a small amount for some people, but I just want to know if this is normal? To be charged that amount? Should my roommate and I just pay it off?

Note: im extremely worn out from both studying and working and I dont even know if I want to be a nurse.  I like helping people of course and i have good people skills but the only reason im entering the medical field is because Ive always been ""booksmart"" and everybody from family, friends and teaxhers pushed me in that direction since I was young.

586,"I have struggled with crippling social anxiety (and panic attacks, depression) since i was 12. I lost all of my friends after school and i haven’t had a friend since i was 15, i’m 19 now.  

After school i was home doing nothing with my life, then last year i tried to turn my life around. I got a job and everything was going great, despite me still having a lot of anxiety. However after a few months it all came back out of nowhere, and i eventually had to quit my job and everything i had worked to be was gone. My social anxiety started becoming worse than ever. For over a year now (i quit my job october last year) i have been home Again, doing nothing.  

My anxiety is so bad now, i can barely leave my house alone. I can’t even go to the shop alone to buy something, and even if someone goes with me i feel very anxious. Today i almost had a panic attack at the vet when me and my mom were taking our cat there. My voice was shaking and i was so embarassed.  

I can’t live a normal life, i haven’t been able to live a remotely normal life since i was 12. My whole life since then has been filled with pain and anxiety. I have seen many therapists, and earier this year i tried seeing 3 different theapists (at the same place) and the first one was great, but unfortuently she was moving, and both of the ones i saw after her were really bad (i tried changing first, but the next one had all the reasons why i didn’t like the first one) .  

All the joys in my life has been my family, my pets, food and video games. Those things are what has kept me going, and what is still making me keep going, but now i thinj i’m suicidal.

I know i’m a burden to them and i’m most of the time a really bad daughter, but i can’t leave them because i know that they would be sad. I’m turning 20 in a month. Another year of suffering, and ruining my own life. I’ve wasted half my life. I’m so tired. I don’t see a way out of this, the only way i see is too hard because i don’t have any strength left.  

I’m ugly, weird, disgusting, horrible, mean, boring, and fucked up. I’m fucked up from all these years of being in isolation. I will never be able to have a normal friendship again. I have ruined myself and my life. I hate myself so fucking much.

During this time at this job I was barley scheduled, never felt welcome, and my boss never fully trained me and would get frustrated with me whenever I didn’t do something right. However the wage for this position is pretty good. When I was hired I told my employer that I could only work during the summer and then come back for Thanksgiving/Christmas. During the semester, in my head, my final plan was that I would just not go back to this job because I hated it so much. 
Flash forward to now, I forgot about it entirely and got a call from my employer asking to see if she can schedule me for the holidays. I didn’t answer the call because I was in class, but now I’m really distraught about this.

593,"I have been living with an old friend, we'll call him A, for 2 years now. He was in a relationship with my other roommate, B, when B moved in a few months after him. A was not able to pay the deposit to be a leaseholder so it has just been B and I on the lease this whole time, though A pays 1/3 of the rent. They have been the stuff of nightmares as far as roommates go, but we have always tried to work things out to preserve the friendship. But the craziest thing of all is that when A and B broke up back in April, neither one of them moved out.

&amp;nbsp;

I told them that they needed to be grownups and decide amongst themselves, rather than put it on me to decide. To my shock and annoyance, B simply moved out of A's room and made himself comfortable in the living room. I had been living there for a year by the time they moved in, and had furnished the living room, including the TV and PS4, so you can imagine my unhappiness. Amidst the constant fighting between them, grotesque messiness, B getting a cat without consulting anyone, issues paying bills on time, and generally not having use of my living room, I was not eager to continue living there once my lease obligations were up.

&amp;nbsp;

Our lease ends in Jan. and I have both of them the heads up that I didn't intend to re-sign. My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and have decided we're ready to get a place together. A is making plans to move out before the lease is up (remember he's not on the lease) and B has made plans to move out with other roommates, but we all agreed that it was time for us to go our separate ways as roommates and I made it clear clear that my bf and I just want it to be us. I have no idea how set in stone their plans are.

&amp;nbsp;

My bf and I have been looking at places, and are finding that moving to a place similar in size and area is going to cost us hundreds of dollars more than what I am paying now. Less expensive areas are not great to live in and obviously anything better would be even more costly. Last night we discussed the possibility of saving money by staying where I'm at and having him take over the lease from B. Since both A and B have expressed that they are leaving, it's possible for us to save money that way, but we would have to fill out different paperwork than if we were all leaving, so I need B to agree to it. There is a big difference between us all moving and me telling them that they should both move while I stay, though. I feel like bringing it up is worth a shot, because if they aren't okay with it, they'll both be moving anyway, but I have no idea if there's a tactful way to bring it up! Please help!",13Nov2019,1
594,"We moved in about three years ago, and our neighbors have never been very talkative. Until we invited them over for a pool party for memorial day. 

Things started declining shortly after. It's mainly just the wife. She started coming over just to talk about nothing at all for an hour at a time, never really making sense. Then she lost her job, and said she couldn't afford to pay for her medicine anymore, which we understand, but we couldn't help as we're tight on money too. Since then it's been a sort of rapid decline. She's started saying really far fetched and sometimes insane things. She says the other neighbors are out to get her and me and my mother are the only ones who understand, and that she was going to buy all the houses in the neighborhood so she could kick them out and only we would live here. 

Then she said she was going to run for mayor. Then she crashed her husband's car. After that she came up with the idea that her son that she kicked out was running a brothel from her house before she got fired, and that the neighbors were all coming over and participating, and that her dog never attacked the woman two doors down (untrue, that poor woman had to get stitches) and that her dog only growled at her because it didn't like her because 'she was always coming in and out of his w****house'.

Lately her husband has been coming home less often, staying out as long as possible. When he is home she's outside yelling at him. There are many late nights where car doors are being slammed and lots of yelling can be heard. Sometimes we go a week without seeing his truck in the driveway.

Her front yard has garbage spread all over it, and her dogs are running all over the place because they keep getting out and she keeps them in the backyard all the time. She's gone most of the time but we aren't sure where, since as far as we know she hasn't gotten another job.

She's even started bringing random people to her house. A month ago she brought a homeless man she met at the gas station home so he could shower, before kicking him out saying he was lying about being homeless.

A few days ago, she brought home a car full of people. I don't like judging based on appearance but they looked homeless. And I'm sure I've seen one of them on a busy road near our house. We think she goes out and just picks up random people. The thing is, some of these people are drug users, I've seen track marks on their arms. And one woman she brought home has started accusing my neighbor of stealing her boyfriend. 

We're starting to feel very uncomfortable and sort of unsafe around her. My mother has told us not to open the door for her anymore, but I'm honestly scared of what she might do if ""the only people who care"" shut her out. She has been shown to violent before. 

What should I do? I've never dealt with anything like this. My mom casually offered to buy her medicine in hopes it would end but she refused saying she doesn't need it. I'm unsure what's wrong with her but she seems to be mentally ill. Is there anything I can do?",13Nov2019,1
595,"*Please ready my whole post before commenting. I'm going to try to keep it short to get my concerns across. Saying ""circumcision bad, you're a monster"" is simply not going to help. I know Reddit is vehemently anti-circumcision but I need advice regarding my situation... I know I'll get a lot of hate, which is why I'm using an Alt and am prepared for the lashing.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I am an American Jewish female. Circumcision is obviously a religious norm for me but beyond that- I was  very promiscuous before settling down and have had lots of sexual partners. All but one were circumcised, meaning 99% of dicks I've seen have been circumcised, from every race and religion. Circumcision was not only a religious norm, but a cultural normal. It's all I knew. My husband, who is American Canadian &amp; not Jewish, is circumcised. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is why when I had my son a year ago, he was circumcised (in the hospital, not by a rabbi, as requested by my husband). Even at that point I was on the fence about it but had always thought my son would be circumcised. My son is fine but it was deeply upsetting for me and really made me question the whole thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, through research and discourse, my views on circumcision have started to shift. For instance, I had an ""oh shit"" moment when my husband and I were talking about infant ear piercing and I said: ""How about we leave baby's bodies alone? ... Oh fuck.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I'd get my next child circumcised, it feels wrong now. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's my dilemma and why I am scared to have another child**: I'm deeply concerned about the ramifications of having one circumcised son and one not. I cannot go back in time for my first son, so I have to think about the future. They will see each other's penises at some point in their lives and obviously notice the difference.

&amp;#x200B;

How would I explain the difference with damaging their psyche? Breeding resentment between brothers? Making them hate their bodies?

&amp;#x200B;

Part of my thinks it would be easier for both of them to just get my second son circumcised, so I don't cause issues in their relationship down the line with each other or with me. Kind of like, I made my bed, now I have to sleep in it sort of thing.  

&amp;#x200B;

But again, I'm becoming more anti-circumcision by the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a very close friend who has been struggling with depression and „finding herself“ ever since she finished high school which is since 3 years. For a long time she thought it was because she studied the wrong thing (tried business, medical and some more universities) but she finally has come to see the pattern. 
She idealizes one course of study and thinks it will solve all her problems if she studies it. Then however the first bigger struggle (exams, tests,..) comes along and she completely breaks down and idealizes what she was doing before or opportunities she didn’t take. This always starts in october/november so it has to do with seasonal depression. She is in therapy and on medication. 

Her grades were always flawless in high school and I think because she had it so easy and only cared about her performance she now has no idea what her actual interests and talents are. 
It’s kind of strange because in school I was always a little jealous of her grades and now she seems to be jealous because I am so happy where I am. Actually every time she sees someone who is happy with their life she thinks she might be too if she studies the same thing.
It just feels like anything anyone does or says throws her off track and changes her opinion 180 degrees. And it’s not like she doesn’t notice it. She does and it is fucking hell for her.

She is super afraid to lose even more time and that she will never find her way in life. She also blames herself for having had so many great opportunities (e.g. it’s very hard to get into medical school here) and throwing them all away (that is how she says it). Her parents are desperate as well.

I have been one of her most important supports the last years (her parents are not too great when it comes to emotional struggles). Everyone tells her that sometimes it takes time to figure out what you really want but she insists it has already been so much time and she doesn’t feel like she is getting anywhere. She keeps bursting into tears when I see her and sometime she calls me when she is really down. But I am running out of energy and things to say to her. It’s all starting to feel a little hopeless...

Please read this whole thing and try to help me.


I always had lack of friends. I am that shy and introverted kid at the back of the class only a few recognize. I never had much friends, and for some time I was okay with it. 

At the age of 13 (7th grade) I was in a friendship with two other girls Girl A and Girl B). I thought they will always be with me and that we're best friends. Well, I was wrong. At a point Girl B started speeading rumors about me. None of them was true, but everyone believed her, Girl A did, too. I was terrified, sad, lonely at the same time, and I started sinking into depression. Somehow I managed to make some friends but I felt these friendships are not the ones I'm looking for.

Soon I started secondary school. The start hit me really hard. I couldn't make friends, I was by myself a lot and even though I love being alone this was really bad. I thought I recovered from the pain the incident in 7th grade cause me, but in real life I lied to myself that everything is alright. It wasn't, and deep inside I knew it. At the same year, I got into hospital because my parents  worried about my mental health. I stayed there for almost two weeks. My ""mission"" was to get out as fast as possible. Now, almost 2 years later have I understood that I LIED. Not just to myself, but even to the doctors.

After I got out I made some great friends. I was living a happy life - or I thought I am. I am slowly realizing I am not okay, even after almost 2 years of the hospitalization. At school I play a role - a happy teen girl, who has some small issues but it's not that bad. But at home, I get face-punched by this incredible loneliness and solitude. It is not that my family doesn't care or love me, they do. I can't really describe this feeling to you. I just ache for somebody. Someone who I can text at all time with anything and he/she will be willing to text back, help me, listen to me and my thoughts I am afraid to share with other people. 

But even if I had someone like this, would it help my problems? Will I feel myself better? Because right now, I feel like I am useless. That no one needs me. There are some people who ask me how am I, but they are interested in my mood. Not in my current feelings, thoughts.

Please, if you can, help me. Give me any advice. I do not want to struggle anymore. I want to live a more happy life.

(PS.: ""think positive"" and ""see the good in the bad"" things won't help me, because I've been thinking positive for 2 years now but I lied to myself the whole time. Also, do not be afraid to ask for more info, I'll try my best to answer any other questions)",13Nov2019,1

We have a client that has 2 separate sites *(Let's call them London &amp; New York)*, both requiring an upgrade.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The plan was to upgrade x2 SQL servers to the 2016 version  (from 2008, old servers) then transfer the services from our application to point at the new SQL instance.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Each site has x2 Servers:  
&gt;  
&gt;\-  Application Server  
&gt;  
&gt;\- SQL Server  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So we didn't interrupt the current service(s) we decided just to create x2 new servers on each site:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- x1 Application Server  
&gt;  
&gt;\- x1 SQL Servers  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;4 new servers total. 

&amp;#x200B;

**End of July this year** (unsure of exact date)

&gt;I carried out the work on both sites, remotely, had both servers ready to run.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
On one-site they're on-site IT Dept run into an issue and asked us to instead upgrade to the 2012 SQL version then move to 2016 once they were ready for the upgrade.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;London went ahead with the upgrade.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;New York had to be cancelled (even though the new system was fully setup and running, an issue with their ), Anyway, I went on holiday, it was decided by a colleague to spin up an additional x2 servers and they would put them on the 2012 version in the interim, until the 2016 upgrade.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I didn't do the second upgrade for New York, This was done by a colleague. - Which was fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here comes the problem - 

***Monday, 21st October 2019***

&gt;I'm asked by manager to get the New York site ready for an upgrade. Which I tell him is no problem.   
&gt;  
&gt; *-* *The system was up and running but we had to get any data from July to then transferred from the 'Production Servers'* *to the new system again.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As I knew there were x2 additional servers created for the 2012 and it had been a few months since I'd worked on the site, With the servers being so closely named, I decided to check through my e-mails to make sure I was carrying out the work on the right servers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I go onto my e-mails, search the last e-mail received by their on-site IT department with an attachment (which contained server info). I open it and open the attached spreadsheet.

&amp;#x200B;

The spreadsheet is laid out like the following *(all server names and IP addresses removed for security):*

|Site|Server Name|IP Address|
|:-|:-|:-|
|New York|DS-INT01|xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx|
|New York|DS-INT02|xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx|
|London|DS-INET3|xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx|
|New York|DS-NTN01 |xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx|
|New York| DS-NTN02|xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx|

*Note: all servers are similarily named, they're based on the software name NINET.*

&amp;#x200B;

So then:

* I looked at the servers, seen New York, logged on..
* Checked to make sure it was correct version ... it was.
* Checked for back-ups (always check for backups if your planning to clear a system down!) - there was

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So I stopped any services on the server and began deleting the old, outdated databases in preparation for copying over the date from the current productive servers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I then get a panicked phone call from the client saying the site is down, Straight away I knew it had to be something to do with what I just did, I contacted my manager had him shadow me restoring back-ups to make sure I hadn't missed anything. I had the site back up and running within 1 hour 30 mins.   
&gt;  
&gt;I spoke to the people on site, apologised and investigated how I made such a mistake.  
&gt;  
&gt;Upon looking into what happened, the above e-mail \^ is actually incorrect, THEIR IT department had sent my colleague and e-mail with the servers incorrectly labelled, the top 2 were actually LONDON not New York.  - My colleague actually sent an e-mail advising them of this, as I only searched for attachments, I didn't see his reply.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate if I had have looked up and down the full spreadsheet I would have noticed New York on the sheet x4 times (although they did spin up an additional 2 servers when I wasn't in the office), however, I didn't expect information from their IT department to be wrong or the sheet to be wrong. - The whole reason I searched it was to make sure I was looking at the  most up to date information!

&amp;#x200B;

**Today**

&gt;So today, I got a phone call from my manager telling me he's coming to my office on Friday and I'm ""invited"" to a meeting about what happened and we need to 'address what happened' in regards to that site. I can tell from the way he spoke it's most likely I'm going to get eaten for it or disciplined/investigated.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get an unbiased opinion, this has got me anxious and slightly worried. I know that I won't lose my job over it or its unlikely as it's my first mistake. I feel it'll be a warning or I'll just get a really awkward pressured conversation about it. Which I honestly feel is unfair. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Info:**

* Been with the company 18 months, first mistake I've been involved with.
* It was months since I worked on that site, I was checking server names (additional there were x2 extra servers put on since I worked on the site)
* I did check for backups first, I also checked the version running to make sure I was on the right server
* It was info provided by their On-site IT Department that confused me, I could have went back on e-mails and found this was wrong but if I start doing this for every job, where does it stop? Do I need to check back 3 months, 6 months, a year?

&amp;#x200B;

I do understand, at the end of the day I did do it, I do feel however, I did everything I could correctly. I checked the version, checked for backups, contacted the manager/colleague as soon as possible to get the site back online and contacted the site myself to explain and apologise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've got this meeting and I'm not sure what stance to take:

1. Stand my ground on 'This is not my fault, I did it, I apologise but they're IT sent out the wrong e-mail info which i picked up'
2. Take my colleagues advice, just keep apologising and say it won't happen again, accept what the manager gives me.  - Which I feel is really unfair.

I feel this is a really unfair situation to be in because this will be like a mark against my name, If anything else happens, I'll probably be gone - in reality this wasn't something I did out of stupidity and my first real mistake will be overshadowed by this.

Then I feel sad and lonely. Whenever, I see people together it makes me bitter and sad.

607,"So here's my story,

I'm a second year biology student, and with lots of studying, family duties. I kind of get burned down a lot. So to resolve that, I try to find certain ways to fully release all my stress, and basically just take a day off for myself. Yet this day always seems to be a let down.

What I'm trying to say is the following: Usually when I take breaks, I either go play a game, or I try doing something with my friends/family. Yet, my computer has been god aweful (I've had it for 10 years now), so playing games always leads to insane fps issues, and just makes it not fun, but instead frustrating and it adds more stress.

If I want to do something with my friends/family there's either 2 options; A. They are either not in a nearby area(either dorms, or travelling), so meeting up is really hard. Or B: we can't actually have a common stress relief day, each person has their own day, so it's hard to just combine it(also the fact that some nice people have left the country, and the remaining are not my cup of tea)

I told my parents/sister about this, but they always provide horrible ways to release stress(hey let's go and get some water! yeah that's real fun! Or let's go to my dad's relatives that really don't care about me, and ask questions about gardening). Others recommended series/anime/movies, but tbh I really amen't in the mood for them.

So what I'm asking is what can I do to just kill time and release stress? I really want something to do with gaming, but my computer is just god damn aweful, and my phone, to be frank, I'm kind of sick of playing stuff on it, I feel like mobile games are either too repetitive, or the online ones are never updated/focused by the developers. Some friends suggested going to the gym, but TBH... The nearby gyms are always governed by dooches, and I don't want to be judged by my aweful form by people who are just damn judgmental. (Also gyms here are so expensive, and the near by ones will constantly record you without your permission, and post it on social media, so even more judging). People also recommended watching...... you know what.... and to that I say no

So basically, I'm burned out, and I really need some way to release that stress, but the ways I used to aren't working anymore, I need some way to solve this. I'm sick of this cycle of studying/eating/chores/ and sleeping

TLDR: I need a day to release all my stress, and certain methods that I USED to do to release stress, aren't working anymore. So what do you recommend?",13Nov2019,1
608,"Some of my fondest childhood memories consist of Christmas mornings. Waking up to open gifts after not sleeping at all the night before and just feeling enveloped by love. For me it has had nothing to do with anything but that. It’s a time to really focus on loving and giving; two things we all are guilty of just driving by throughout the year. I just love the beauty this time if year brings out in most people, the selflessness, the patience. 
I have two brothers and a sister. I’m the baby of the bunch. My sister has two children and my oldest brother has a son so I’m the cool auntie lol. I feel just so upset at my siblings though because they both have certain beliefs that don’t allow for holiday celebrations and I just don’t get it. I feel like they’re depriving their children, my niece and nephews of those memories I have always held so dear to my heart. I am a person who is open to all beliefs because at the end of the day we are all clueless and just trying to figure this life out say by day so who am I or who are we to judge another for what they believe? At the same time a person’s believes should be their choice and not something forcibly bestowed onto them. 
I just don’t know how to feel. I’m I contradicting my openness by feeling some type of way about my family not celebrating?

612,"All my life I've never once talked to a girl outside of my family, when I bring this up to people they seem to think its the craziest thing and assume something is wrong with me while I thought it was pretty normal. Through my life I've formed a natural prejudice against women due to my past experiences with them. Throughout all my Middle and High school years literally no girl bothered to be my friend, and most of them actually bullied me, ridiculed me, and humiliated me. I was always ignored by girls, they constantly talk and laugh about me behind my back in the most obvious way, in general they mentally beated me down for 6 years until I graduated. Some of the guys were the same but not nearly as bad as the girls in my school. One of the worst scenarios is when I actually found a kind girl, I wasn't planning on asking her out however her friendship helped me get through tough times. One day she actually revealed that she had a crush on me, And literally everyone of her friends made fun of and harrassed her for being into me of all people. She eventually got turned off by this, while we still talk from time to time its nothing like it used to. Idk why but the girls at my schools acted like I had a target on my back. I've never been to prom, never had a relationship with a girl whatsoever, never dated, or talked to any girl just because I was sick of them. I know it sounds like I have a hatred towards women and thats because while I don't hate them, I've formed a bias about them, and a bias I'll willingfully admit. I didn't go to any universities because I couldn't stand the thought of being tormented by girls for any longer and i opted out of the idea entirely. Fast forward to now and I've never talked to a girl outside of my family and business for about 3 years (no exaggeration). And its just generally lonely, I'm an extremely introverted and isolated person. I still talk to some of my bro's and I'd be lying if i said I don't have jealousy towards them, women always seem to treat them nice and kind. Meanwhile I'm still wondering where you find girls like that. I generally don't know how to meet or talk or have fun with women because I always feel so instinctively uncomfortable with them. How to have any conversation with them not thinking your a loser?

I have two more brothers of which one of them is playing basketball and trying to work his way up. So, last summer I went to work with my dad who isn't rich nor poor he just has some comfort. I worked for 1 month and got 700€, which I was really surprised with because I was saving for a PC so that I can start playing games, which is something I would do for a living. My mom isn't that good with money and we kinda struggle now, passing each week with a lot of effort and luck. I also gave her all my money because she asked if I could help her and that she would return them later, which I don't think will happen but I love her more than anything and will always be on her side. Anyways the last 2 months we are really struggling, I'm worried about her and my future because I never liked studying and the whole school stuff although I study all my homework. My mom has been working two jobs to try and make it better for us, but I think it's getting worse and worse with time, which I'm really worried about. She told me a few hours ago that if she couldn't make it with trying  to make enough money for us we should consider moving with our dad because he has more money than her as I mentioned. My father has found a new partner to live with for the rest of his life, I should also mention that my parents are still talking like before and nothing has changed for them. Anyways I didn't like that idea of moving in with my dad and don't know what to do now and in the future because I always said to my self that I will become a professional gamer and streamer, bit with the current conditions I don't think I'll make it.

614,"Around a year ago it came to light that my Grandad (who is married and lives with his wife) has been let to believe that he has a new girlfriend who lives in the UAE.

The new girlfriend has been asking him to send her money. He has been sending this person huge sums of money, it came to light after my Nan checked the bank and to her horror - £50,000 was missing.

We’ve spoke to my Grandad and have given him an ‘intervention’, yet we get called liars and he continues to send money - I guess he truely believes this is real.

As far as I am aware, the businesses local to us are under strict rule to not let him send money abroad.

I’ve just received a phone call from a friend who works with him (yes, my grandad is now working after being retired 15 years) and he was asked if he would mind sending some money abroad for him - £500. This raised alarm bells with my friend straight away and he  made up some excuses as to why he can’t.

What I want to know; is there any lawful way we can stop this happening before he spends the rest of my Nans money and drives her further over the edge.

It’s pretty clear that he’s mentally ill - Would this constitute him being sectioned?",13Nov2019,1
616,"New account for obvious reasons...I've been saving money to pay for whatever isnt covered by insurance to get my chesticles removed along with money to hike a long distance trail. I found a doctor, had a consult, but after ins. auth. came through, I discovered he is scheduling out into the end of Jan now. I was hoping to have it done by the end of the year, before my parents kicked me off their insurance since we aren't on speaking terms. I am trying to find insurance that will help cover the surgery, but it isn't required for them to offer this kind of coverage. After researching the insurance offered by my company, they do not cover it. 

It is important for me to get top surgery, but also important for me to hike and move forward from the past. I have funds to hike the trail (then resettle) or get the surgery.  If I would be unable to get a good insurance to help cover the surgery prior to April, I would hike with a sports bra on cuz breathing is a struggle wearing a compression binder. I have a full beard so it may result in some weird or possibly dangerous situations on trail to see a guy with beard and hefty moobs.  

An option I've been debating is hiking the trail to raise awareness for people who are trans and attempt to fundraise for my top surgery. I've always been discreet, but especially after being beat up for being trans. Would it be safe to do this?

Top surgery = freedom
Hiking = freedom

626,"This post got pretty long, TL;DR at the bottom. I'm one of five kids, and all of us are very close, but this post is about my sister A. A was diagnosed with autism when she was two years old and is now 30. At the time of her diagnosis, the physician said that she would never have the mental acuity to drive a car, but could work a job and live a relatively normal life. She's always been drawn to a more problematic lifestyle, but it's reached a critical point and I'm at a complete loss. This may be above r/advice 's paygrade - but I don't know where else to turn. A has been living on the streets for the past 2-3 years and is now pregnant and still refuses to come home. 

&amp;#x200B;

A has always been kind of resentful of the fact that she was different. She was processed through the local school's special education department until she was 21 and hated that she didn't graduate at 18 like our siblings. Things got really rocky when we all started moving out to go to school or rent/own our own places. We tried to rent her a place using her part-time income and the money she received from her social security benefits ($650/mo), but she cried because she didn't want to be alone (or with a roommate) so she stayed at home until she was about 26.

&amp;#x200B;

It reached a breaking point when our dad passed away unexpectedly when I was 16 and A was 18 years old. She began hanging out in sketchy crowds in strange places and not showing up to her part-time job at the grocery store. About a year later, she went missing entirely when she was supposed to be at work and we found her a week later in a dangerous part of Philadelphia which has been in the news lately as a verified open air drug market. Her picture was on social media and the news, and a transit cop in the subway found her with a known drug dealer along with a duffel bag full of heroin, money and guns. They took the guy to the police and called us to pick her up. I know that sounds absolutely ludicrous, but it is what it is unfortunately. 

&amp;#x200B;

She returned home and her job allowed her to come back without any penalties. My mom started keeping her under close watch, from checking in with her job and taking her with her at all times (so long as A didn't have prior engagements). For a while, it was alright - she met a nice guy at work (S) who became her boyfriend and they talked about getting an apartment together. We started the process of helping both of them find a place and the two of them moved to a smaller city about 45 minutes away and would come back to visit for holidays. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess A was still befriending people with shady histories, because about 2 years later S broke the lease, returned and told us that A's friend stole a large amount of money from him and that they broke up. A didn't come home with him, and that brings us to today. Since then, it's been extremely difficult to contact her - sometimes we go months without hearing from her despite trying to find and reach her. She'll contact one of us randomly to ask for food or water money, but won't tell us where she is and will hang up/block us if we press. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point, we learned that she was living in a ripped tent behind a big box store in the same city she had lived with when she was dating S. We learned she's been unemployed (still receiving her social security benefits) and hanging out with this guy who goes by ""Tank"" along with his dog - she refuses to give us his actual name or his last name since she and S broke up. We've called the police and social services who say since she's of age, there's nothing they can do.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been going on like this for almost three years . She contacted me last week to let me know she was pregnant and cold and I pleaded with her again to come home and she refused. I sent her money for a blanket and some food just to keep her from dying wherever she is. Today, my sister was contacted by an ex-girlfriend of Tanks who has a four year old child already with him. Apparently they visited her house the previous week and Tank confessed to her that he was only with A for the source of consistent money (her SSDI \~$650/mo) and confirmed that she was pregnant. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I've told A she can stay with me and my husband and my siblings have all offered the same, but she refuses. Is there anything that can be done now that she's pregnant by the police or social services or are we still out of options?

(A year and half ago) and I downloaded tinder last week to see what all the hype is and today I got my first match.

629,"I host events throughout the year for friends that lack family, either by distance or drama. A home away from home. This becomes especially paramount during different holiday seasons or celebrations. As I was writing out the list to send invites to today for December, I stopped at one name. I'm so very torn and don't know what to do anymore.

A good friend of ours has been going through challenges, and during such, has become morbidly obese. It was a slow progression over the years. Many attempts have been made to get involved and help them get on a healthier track, but they have made it very clear they don't want to address it. It has become the 'unspoken' topic. 

However, during the last get-together we had at a restaurant, this person left in tears. No chair fit them. Putting two chairs together to remedy the situation caused a meltdown instead. A lack of a handicapped bathroom was the last straw and they made a giant scene and began actually screaming at the restaurant manager before leaving. This was 6 months ago. It has only gotten worse since then, I've heard.

This next event will be held at my house, which does not have such accommodations. Seating I might be able to manage for weight capacity, but not width capacity. I really can't afford to go out and buy specialty seating either. Plus, we only have one bathroom. Its an old farmhouse, so it is smaller and not handicap friendly. 

I'm torn between wanting to be fully inclusive and being realistic.

If I invite this person, but can't accommodate their needs, I'm a shit host. If I don't invite them, but invite all of our mutual friends, I'm an asshole. And if I don't invite them simply based on their size, then I am essentially saying they aren't welcome. 

How... can I address this?",13Nov2019,1

I was sexually abused by my older brother around 10 years ago (im M21 now) and i have been living with it ever since, i have not told anyone about it until a couple months ago when i told 2 close friends and they are worried about me. Keeping it bottled in for so long has had negative effects on my life as i believe i suffer from depression and anxiety due to it.  Ive tried to push it down for so long but now i cant stop thinking about it. I feel like im at a disadvantage in life now due to this thing i am suffering with all because of my fucked up brother. 

Im so scared to tell my parents about it because they see my older brother as a saint and he has given them 2 grandchildren. My parents love my brother and i dont know what will happen if i tell them that he raped me multiple times when i was younger. 

I have been recently taking pressed Xanax bars and doing a lot of cocaine to deal with this fucked up situation, however i know its not sustainable. I need some advice on what to do next. I want to talk to a psychiatrist but i think they would have to get police involved which could make the whole situation worse including my mental state.

633,"I planned a trip originally for me, my boyfriend and invited my best friend and her boyfriend to go to three countries/meet my boyfriend’s family. My friend’s boyfriend can’t come, so it will just be the three of us. 

Originally I didn’t talk about it when this friend was around because I didn’t want him to come and I didn’t want his feelings to be hurt if he heard about it.  

He overheard my friend talking about going on this trip, the next day was at my house and started bombarding me with questions about it. I was drinking so I didn’t do my best to be upfront about not wanting him to come. I didn’t go into a lot of detail but realized I made a huge mistake as soon as I started talking. Right before he left and shut the door he said he was down to come on the trip. The thing is, he didn’t even want to go when I told him about the country months before when I was just saying that I had always wanted to go. He said “why would you want to go there? Let’s go to Australia instead.” He just wants to go to have something to do. 

The biggest reason I don’t want him coming is because the same group of us went abroad last year and he was AWFUL. He was so rude to locals trying to help us with directions or just waitstaff while we were eating out. I told him before we left that he needed to be respectful and not his usual sassy self and he agreed, but didn’t follow through. It was embarrassing having him be a representation of me/our group. Our travel style is different as well. He likes to go shopping the whole time while the rest of us like exploring and diving into the culture.

638,"For context: I am a Bass player and really passionate about music + i am from Finland so greetings! :)

So i started talking with this girl who i knew as my friends friend. We pretty quickly started talking a lot about music as we are both musicians and lots of other stuff. We haven't known each other more than a month and she starts talking about deep stuff/secrets. I was okay with this because i liked her at this point/had a small crush. I didn't want to ruin anything by stepping too much over the line in our conversations and stuff because i knew she had a boyfriend she had been with about 4 years (she didn't mention this at anytime if that counts for something). We also hang out at school a lot.

Well today she sent me a message about wanting to talk about something. I said okay and went to meet her at the next break. She wanted to talk to me about something serious clearly.

Well her friend was telling that i was showing signs of liking her and stuff (pretty reasonable cuz i was spending a lot of time with her) So she asked me if i liked her. I didn't want to give a straight answer and say yes or no. I said ""I know you have a boyfriend and i don't want to disrespect the relationship in any way."" She said that ""Thank god! I don't want to ruin this. You have became very close and important to me. You are so easy to talk about anything. But i do have a Crush/small crush on you"" (i cant remember it exactly). I also admitted on having a small crush on her and we agreed not to rush anything too much and see where this leads us. 

I really like her a lot and i would want something more serious with her but i am afraid of telling her/ruining the thing we have. I know that it doesn't look very good for me but i want advice and you can give it straight. If i don't have chances you can tell me that but also tell me how can i let that feeling go.

641,"so to start this off, i'm very mentally ill. i'm autistic with severe depression/ anxiety and ptsd in remission, i have my whole life ahead of me but I've already had 3 s-icide attempts this year, and more in the past. I want to move past that, i've been in counselling/ therapy for years and i'm working on it

i'm currently in sixthform college (im in the uk) and i restarted after failing my first year, which is already disheartening. im doing fine art and ctecs in media and health/social care. and the problems start in that im already very behind - i have a code of conduct for not handing in work, and i don't know how to explain that i feel too depressed and suicidal to do my work - just coming into lessons takes life out of me. i'm beginning to to think that even though i used to be a really smart kid, that higher education just isn't for me

my goal in life is to be a tattoo artist, and that too is hard work. considering how things are going, its likely ill fail this year too and have to drop out, meaning i wont have an art qualification and that will put me at a greater disadvantage, which makes me feel like i cant pursue my dream anymore

basically, im stuck. my mental well-being is at an all-time low, and it wont fix itself if i'm stressed the fuck out like this. i feel like my only option is to drop out and start working on my portfolio and save up to start my tattooing apprenticeship when im 18, but i doubt my parents would agree to that (immigrant family standards are very high - they pushed for uni and were disappointed when i said i wanted to go into arts.)

644,"(Obligatory apologies for bad mobile formatting)

So some context I suppose, me (21) and my girlfriend (20) have been together four years now. We’ve been very happy together overall but with obvious arguments here and there that you’d expect with a long term relationship.

However, we both struggle a lot with mental health. I am on medication for depression/anxiety and it affected our relationship A LOT at the beginning of the year with me being aggressive and argumentative a lot. Eventually we talked about it and I agreed I would seek help hence why I am on medication now.

Lately she has been in a very bad way, she has been having suicidal thoughts and she tells me it is not due to depression but simply because she doesn’t like the ‘concept’ of life. She always tries to tell me that in her head it is all very rational although she assures me she never actually could, though obviously it causes me a great deal of stress.

Whenever we talk about it, I suggest therapy/counselling or at least telling her dad about it, yet she downright refuses all three. This often ends in argument and me feeling like I have no choice but to at least tell her dad, as the stress of just me knowing about it and having to deal with it is often too much. Recently, she told me if I did talk to her dad about it that she would break up with me, and I just have no idea what to do. I love her very much and just want her to be okay, and maybe just telling her dad and her breaking up with me would be good in the long run?

It frustrates her that they don't understand her, and staff becomes exasperated with her and feel that they're frustrating her and letting her down.

669,"I just got back from three weeks of holidays.  Before I left I had made arrangements with the 25 year old son of one of my mother's friends to stay with my cats (we've known the family pretty much his whole life).  He still lives at home with his parents and doesn't have a car, so we thought it would be a good fit.  He enthusiastically agreed.

He and his mom came over beforehand and we explained everything he had to do for the cats (which is very little) and explained VERY CLEARLY that we were expecting him to move into the house while I was away.  We told him we'd leave him food, we left my mother's car full of gas and told him he could use it the whole time, I didn't need him to check in with me, he basically just had to feed the cats twice a day, clean their litter, and stay there.  I told him I thought I'd pay him $500.00, did he think that was fair?  He agreed.

I went off on my vacation and left 5 $100 bills on the table with the cat food.

As I was waiting for my last flight, I got an email from his mother saying she hoped we'd had a great trip and, oh, by the way, he wound up having a lot of studying to do and couldn't dismantle his study space and move it to the house, so no one had stayed there, but they'd stopped by every day to feed the cats.

I'm pretty irritated at this, we had been VERY clear that we intended him to stay at the house because I don't like my cats being left alone for huge lengths of time.  I'm not crazy, go to work, go to school, hang out with your friends, I just want you to sleep there most nights.  I've left them for a couple days before with having someone stop by once a day, but three weeks is a really long time.

So I got home, cats are okay, a little skittish, but they're fine.  And the $500.00 was left on the table.  I had expected him to have taken it and wasn't going to make a thing out of it, but he left it.  

I just got an email from his mom (don't know why he's incapable of doing any of this himself) saying he 'felt weird' about taking the money (huh?) and I should text him to make arrangements.

Now I'm torn.  If he had taken the money I wouldn't have said anything.  Ultimately, the cats are alive and there's no significant harm done.  But now I feel weird.  He really didn't do what I'd asked him to do.  So - advice?  Do I just give him the $500?  Give him some other amount and explain that, because he didn't do what he agreed to do I'm not prepared to pay the whole amount?  Ignore it?

A few hours ago i dyed my hair green (a color i usually love) but this time i dyed it and i saw myself in the mirror and i just felt so upset and disgusted by myself.

My mum first bleached my hair when i was 6 years old and did it regularly after that, when i was about 14 i just began to obsess over my hair i ended up missing a lot of school and being put on medication for depression and OCD but it just got so much worse.

676,"Hi all I’m gonna dive right in.

I started dating my boyfriend early this year. We have known each other as friends for five years prior to dating and as soon as we started dating we were faced with distance. He had to go away for school/work. Now he’s moving somewhere closer— still not the same state but closer and we’ve been talking about the idea of moving in with each other. It’s the only way to close to the distance and we’d really prefer to do that. My only issue is that of many others... student loans. I have a lot of loans which I probably will be able to pay off in the next 6-7 years. Doesn’t that sound great? It does to me. Here’s the issue, I’d be able to make payments to pay those off within 6-7 years if I don’t play rent. I’m currently living with my parents rent free which is honestly what they prefer for me, this is a cultural thing. How do I approach this topic with my SO?",13Nov2019,1

678,"I am the assistant manager for a small document preparation company. Everyone in management does not have management experience. I am the only one advocating for a modern approach to management such as positive re-enforcement, specific employee recognition, and even employee of the month as a last ditch effort to try to help people feel validated. I have no management experience other than this job. 

The morale in the office is bad to the point where in the meeting today, two employees starting verbally fighting and the GM did nothing. It is not my job to be the first one to take a step in that situation and the CEO agreed with me when I brought this to his attention in the past. Although the GM has been spoken to about taking on a leadership role, I do not believe she is very capable of gaining authoritative respect from the employees as they constantly undermine her and ""punishment"" has been placed on the Office Admin and not the GM.  

I accepted this position because it included a pay raise and it will look great on my resume once I leave this job. Also, my employer covers 70% of my insurance and I have a major surgery that I will need later this year so I do not want to look for employment elsewhere at this time or if I do, it would have to be the same kind of insurance with the same coverage. 

I am also mentally ill - chronic depression and generalized anxiety, so this job is affecting me mentally and leaves me in bitter and unhealthy moods. I believe that if I asked for a demotion, that I would likely be happier over-all as I would not be responsible for the betterment of the company and the people who work here. 

Our company is getting close to closing and the CEO holds it over our heads that if -we- can't turn the company around then the collapse of the business is on our shoulders. 

I am just so tired and want to cry as I'm writing this because I am so fed up. I want to go back to working in a cubicle where my only responsibilities are my clients and campaign management. 

 There is so much more that I am dealing with here, but this is the primary issues I have experienced just today. Any and all advice here is welcomed.

684,"It's been well over a year since we went our separate ways and I haven't stopped thinking about my ex since then. We only went out for three weeks because we met about three weeks before her graduation. When she graduated, I was deeply inconsolable. But! I hid it from her and kept up appearances as she soon moved on and began texting me about a new gf she'd met a couple weeks after graduation. It was easily the worst pain I'd felt in my young life. Even then, we texted almost every day until March-ish, through two failed relationships of mine. March-ish was about the same time my ex had found yet another gf. Around then, I also got into another doomed relationship - with a guy, this time.

Do you know how much femme-induced pain a lesbian has to be in to try it on with a guy? Lots. And lots and lots and lots and lots. Though it was really my fault for going into those relationships when I wasn't ready to move on.

Now I'm stuck in the boring, lezzie-bereft South and I still can't help wondering what things might have been like if I'd gotten into a law school near her or into a school in any major metropolitan full of actual people, instead of chattel. However, I did run into a dairy cow that was sending out some solid butch vibes...I haven't seen her on Bumble, so I can't be totally sure what team she plays for.

Anyway. Something my ex said about her newest, March gf still sticks with me: ""Is it weird that she's strikingly similar to you?"" As a person who's always had the subtle feeling that my life is a like a superfluous bump on the universe's backside, I was thoroughly rattled. My feelings had been confirmed: a self-actualized, superior version of me already exists, making my existence kinda pointless.

The problem: As insecure people of my generation tend to do, I've spent too much time doing the least healthy thing possible: cyberstalking the shit out of both of them. Turns out, New GF seems exactly like me, interest-wise and personality-wise. Even music-taste-wise! All she's missing is my height, my blackness, my light mustache, my grad school debt and my impeccable, erudite wit. However, New GF actually has friends - like, ""sign my yearbook"" ""omg we've been part of the same squad since high school"" friends. Something I could never offer a future partner.

The constant social media stalking and random Googling is biting into my time and messing with my dreams - my actual, unconsciously-produced, night time, beddy-bye snooze theater, y'all! This 1L semester has been non-stop fantasizing and crying and intrusive thinking to the point where I can't even begin to remember what the hell I'm supposed to be learning half the time.

Is this some kind of deeply toxic narcissism? How do I make it stop?",13Nov2019,1
685,"I am a high schooler (10th grader) and I’ve been struggling with multiple things lately. I lack on focusing during class and my books are always unsolved and I’m losing too many grades for that. It’s whether I can’t write because my arms are wrapped around my waist because I’m feeling cold or it’s because I cannot keep up with whatever the teacher is doing.

I haven’t been socializing as much as I been before and I would isolate myself from everyone because I don’t feel as anyone cares about my presence and I feel scared these days to speaking to people.

693,"I am a 21 M with zero self-discipline, as much as I hate to admit it, it's true. 

So, growing up I was the youngest of 5 kids and was basically spoiled with all the video games I wanted. I spent all my time out of school playing my games and never played any sports, learned to play instruments or anything like that. I got through high school by always doing the bare minimum, I rarely studied and did barely did homework assignments but kept my grades high by doing well on tests (I didn't cheat, things sorta just came easy to me.) I am now in university and will be graduating soon, I have done pretty much the same thing here and feel like I have wasted time and haven't really learned anything. 

Now that all this has caught up to me, I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my life by trying new things on my own, but I can't get myself to persist through learning curves and hours of practice for whatever it may be ex; running, working out, playing an instrument, video editing, reading books, or even waking up early. These are all things I want to do but I find my self getting bored/giving up easily or just not having time because of school. 

So basically I have little to no work ethic unless the task has a hard deadline set by school/work, and/or there is an immediate consequence for me not doing it. I want to be able to do things on my own. I feel pathetic because I am aware that many people deal with bigger problems and don't have a choice but to work hard and I'm over here just barely doing anything.

696,"I live in a big city. I've lived here for most of the decade. I’m beginning to see a career in what I do, and my city has  good work prospects. I’m in an affordable, rent-controlled, central apartment that I don’t want to let go of easily.

My quality of life would be acceptable, except I spend almost every weekend alone. I have only a couple of friends here, and I see them rarely. It’s for this reason that I’ve been single and celibate for six years. No one to go out to pubs, clubs or house parties with. I've become more depressed and jaded as time has gone on.

I’d stay if I had a legitimate social life. I have been gone to meetups and evening classes, and I initiate conversations. I’ve tried quite a few things, even online dating and reddit to find friends. I’ve gone into uncomfortable situations and met new people. Most advice online is aimed at people who’ve just arrived, ‘it gets better’, or it’s things like join classes, ‘salsa’, ‘improv’ etc. I’ve tried medication and therapy. I meditate and journal and keep fit, eat healthily, have a regular sleep pattern, socialize in bits and bobs.

The main reason I've got myself into this situation is a life-long maelstrom of 'niceness', shyness, introversion and moderate depression. In my twenties in the home city I had a social life, and the ability to drink my way into relationships and a social life, through being out and about a lot, and having social proof on social media. In the past five years in my current city, in contrast, nothing has worked. I scold myself, because it could be as simple as 'feeling the fear and doing it anyway' and being more direct. Or maybe not. Maybe time is against me. I’m not young anymore. Maybe it's just all part of growing older. 'You can't go back', 'wherever you go there you are', 'you can't rely on your home city friends, they'll be different' etc.

Should I try to reboot somehow in my current city? I would need to make much more of an effort, if I were to stay. Find a therapist, somehow, even though it's almost impossible. Go to three events a week. Plow myself into social hobbies. Even then, I'd say it'd take at least a year to 18 months of intense work on myself, with no guarantee of success.

Alternatively, as I have an existing social life in my home city, should I cut my losses and go back? It's a small city, in a small country, but I can get a job there if I want it. It is more expensive with fewer career opportunities. But it's the only way I can see that I could have a social life in the near future. I could also make friends through my existing friends there.

715,"Myself and about 6 other people are in school for a trade right now. The class is almost two years, and we have the same teacher all year, every day, Monday-Thursday. She’s honestly the best teacher any of us have ever had and we’ve all expressed that it feels like a little family, all of us.

On Friday, her 30 year old daughter who was her only child, passed away in a terrible freak-accident, leaving behind her husband and 2 very young children. 

We’ve seen our teacher since then, she’s come into the classes at the beginning of the days to tell us what was going on, and what had happened- while still going over our lesson plan for the day (trying to distract herself a bit). 

She brought up when the wake and funeral is, but never directly said, “you guys are welcome to come.”

So everyone else in my class wants to get together and go to the wake this weekend. 

We’d never gotten the chance to meet her daughter, but we want to show support for teacher and her family. 

I’m just wondering if this is a bad idea or not- I’m not too familiar with grief but it’s an open ceremony- family and friends. 

I’m just worried about teacher seeing the 7 of us there and maybe not feeling like she can break down and cry and grieve the way she needs to in front of us. 

What do you guys think? I’m just trying to be as sensitive as possible because she could either be glad we came for support, or she could be upset that we’re witnessing one of the saddest moments of her life.",13Nov2019,1

She always did this for awhile which is why I had the passcode so at least that way I know she is snooping in my phone. The trust issues is really bothering me. But I googled if you can track your phone with these two numbers and turns out you can as well as collect data from the phone like who your messaging and etc. they have services for this kind of thing.

Is there any way to find out if your phone is being tracked or it’s data being collected? What can I do? I want to confront her about this but I also want to be sure before I do.

718,"Hello, I'm going to graduate from college in about 3 semesters. Even though I will be 21 soon I feel like I don't know a lot of things an ""adult"" should. Here are some questions that maybe I can get some help with.

1. I still have a bank account that's under my mom. I have a debit card connected to it that my Mom had gotten me when I was about 16 awhile ago. I THINK I should be opening a new bank account for myself but not sure where to begin.
2. I have a student credit card. I'm assuming I'm not allowed to use it after I graduate and therefore I would like advice on getting an actual credit card.
3. I will most likely be living in NYC after graduating but the option is there to live with my mom while helping her with rent and stuff. I would have the money to live in NYC but I would save alot of money staying with my mom. The problem is that the commute would be absolutely brutal.
4. Is there any other advice that would be good for me as a soon to graduate? I know it's early but I'm trying to prepare my transition. My mom speaks 0 english and therefore I'm transitioning completely by myself and don't really have anyone to talk to about this.

722,"So right before I left for college my step dad (basically my dad) told me he’d give me $10k a year for college, but he’d give me $20k for my first year. Done with my first year and this summer as I was enrolling in classes at a new university, he told me he can’t give me the money for school because he’s absolutely broke, but would help me when he had the money. He’s a lawyer so money really does come in waves a lot of the time as he has to win the trials, go through appeals, get the judge to sign off on the payment, all sorts of stuff. So I was stuck paying for school on my own. I switched schools again and enrolled in a community college because I could (barely) afford it this semester, but I didn’t have to take a loan out. He just got paid on a realllly big case and another smaller one. I know he’s doing fine financially now and I’m not sure if I should ask him to “help me out” (whatever he meant by that). I really don’t feel like he owes me anything BUT I am about to leave for an 8 month mission trip and I won’t be able to have a job. I worked by butt off this summer so I could save money to survive off of during my mission. All that money ended up going towards my tuition at community college and now I’m really nervous that I won’t be able to get by on my mission trip.

723,"Hi,

I just want some advice really. My sibling has recently (6weeks ago) come out of a 4 year long relationship. His partner dumped him. My sibling is 21, and is now drinking every night. He says he isn’t and that he had cut down but I regularly see vodka in his room or in his hand (he doesn’t hide it). He was drinking in the car on the way to a family meal a few days ago, will be the only one drinking when he goes out with his friends and alone in his room. I know he is hurting from the end of the relationship but I’m really worried it will develop into an alcohol dependency problem. He does had an addictive/obsessive personality and has gone through many phases of being hooked to things which he then drops after a while but obviously with alcohol it’s a bit different in the sense it could develop into an addiction. He is the type of person who doesn’t take on board what others say to him either, which is good as he sticks to his opinions but he doesn’t seem to understand that what he drinks is a problem (1/2-3/4 bottle of vodka a night I estimate). He keeps saying he can stop but he doesn’t want to, which is ringing alarm bells in my head. 
I just want to know if there is anything I can do to help him. Bear in mind he doesn’t really take advice on board and has semi returned to behaving like a 15yo in terms of his attitude? I’m trying to encourage him to do other such as football/running/boxing all of which he used to be interested with, but I’m really aware of the fact he has his own mind and I don’t push him too far as it will cause a row. I want to help him get over this breakup without developing an alcohol problem.

I am totally lost on how to go about this!

I want to dive into HR, specifically becoming an HR Coordinator and maybe working up to a Training and Development manager someday. I don’t have much experience, besides helping with interviews at my last job but that was just a scratch on the surface. 

I have a BFA in Illustration, and I know that is just a fun hobby for me (I went ahead with this degree because I didn’t have debt and didn’t 100% know what to do so I did the fun route). But now that I’m a mom and pushing 30, I want a meaningful career that is also fun to me, and I believe this is it.

So, my question: would another bachelor’s be better? It would be less time and maybe cheaper than a masters...or go ahead into the Masters degree? I feel since I have no experience that’d be a waste, however maybe one day I’d like to teach university and having a masters and experience will get me there. Or even an associates degree? Even though that’s “going backwards” that’s the cheapest of them all. I know I need experience, and once my son is in school I’m going to try, since I’m a stay at home mom.

762,"My(20F) brother(21M) has been suicidal since he was about 18 years old. He’s been with his wife for about a year now after marrying her after about 5 months of knowing her. She’s 7 months pregnant now and my brother is cheating on her, doing drugs, getting our 16 year old brother involved with drugs and alcohol and he doesn’t even have a job. He came to my apartment last night very drunk and was screaming at me to give him LSD (I had some a few months ago but obviously don’t have it on hand all the time and of course i wouldn’t give it to him in this state) I told him I don’t have any, he needs to go home to his wife and leave my apartment, he says he’s depressed and needs something to make him happy, that he’s not happy in his marriage and he’s scared to be a dad and he’s scared that he’s going to be like our sexually and physically abusive dad and starts punching things and getting up in my face and screaming at me. I call my fiancé and tell him to please leave work right away and that my brother is terrifying me. My brother gets a kitchen knife out and is screaming, i run out of the front door down the street and he chases me. He tells me he’s going to kill himself with the knife and I call the police. When my fiancé comes he throws my brother out our back door and my brother slams his head against the door challenging my fiancé to fight him until i was afraid it was going to break. He ran off when the police arrived and drove around all night drunk. I feel so bad for his wife and for his soon to be son.  My brother has physically assaulted me numerous times in the past and also has had sex with younger boys (under 18) He’s stolen money from numerous family members and has ruined my moms credit when she cosigned an apartment with him that he didn’t pay rent for for about 5 months.

763,"So, I think my life long best friend, a brother really,  is and has been ignoring/avoiding me for months for no apparent reason. It started maybe 4 months ago, we just didn't talk for a couple weeks, and we stopped hanging out competely, we used to hang out atleast once a week and have been doing it for as long as I can remember. First I thought it was depression or just a bad time for him, so I kept contact to him and tried to get him to hang out, but he just answered really briefly if at all. He only really sends me snapchats that are clearly just general snapchats that go to many people, and he rarely answers me even if I ask something. I still kept saying that it would be cool to hang out but I backed out a little bit to give him space but still being there for him. Lately though, he has been hanging out with his other friends, which is okay, of course , but it just feels like shit when he still ignores me and doesn't seem to want to include me even though I know those friends too.

I hope that I don't sound like a jealous partner, but it just kills me inside when I wonder why he would just act like that. We have been like brothers from a really young age and lived together and gone through life with each other, but now I'm just invisible to him. And it is worrying because it is getting to the point that it is really weird to talk to him, and if we don't start atleast talking casually then I think I have to move on and get another brother from another mother",13Nov2019,1

It is locked before PE lesson begins but our teacher always arrives late, wich leaves it unlocked for  like 10 minutes. So I hid in that room and waited. And He really tried to steal something again I caught him off guard in the act. he made up stupid excuses but he knew he was caught. So hes standing with his back up against the wall And i'm standing about 15 cm away from him and his whole class is looking at us. He's like 15 16 a head shorter than me. just a boy basically.

So I talked to his teacher too and she said ""you don't have proof I can't do anything go to the police"". I don't have any witnesses his friends are defending him.

766,"tl;dr title

I got some almost decade old trauma (nothing serious objectively, personal failure etc. more or less) that I kindly burried and things resulting from it just built up over time. I never got to process the emotions from it properly because as a consequence I immediatelly went through all sorts of randomly-developing phobias &amp; panic attacks followed up by mood-swings, while having lived with a parent as a teen back then who decided to emotionally/verbally 'abuse' me for my eff-ups, insisting I was making everything up, etc. Basically the reaction of my parent traumatized me more than what caused the situation for me to begin with, as I learned taking problems out = bad, not being functional = bad, negative emotions = phobias. Plus I was really busy trying not to spiral down even further because the pressure I got from her was enormous.

I basically tend to pretend those things never happened because the way she reacted (and made me believe anyone else would judge me for my failures, while she was projecting her limited world-view) made me feel ashamed for my mistakes and things that both were and weren't in my control. I learned to cope a bit by ignoring the issue when shit hits the fan or often when challenged by someone else it will be followed by a total emotional break-down lol. Then I will nope out of it because the weight is unbearable, and well, my brain on negative emotions prolly = bad thing.

Basically I resolved all my phobias etc. by now but what has remained is the unresolved emotions. Plus I am really not living my authentic life either because to do that I'd have to process the problems first, to reconnect to the point where it all spiralled down, so I can start over where I failed. Most of the days I am just emotionally bland while blocking out all of my true aspirations because they directly connect to the trauma.

I really wanna journal this problem away but not only I have trouble ""letting myself"" come close to the spot, to feel how things felt, perhaps because I unconsciously repress emotions, but partially also actively suppress some of it - because I know that once I face it it will be basically facing my ""demon"" that I kindly let grow over years by ignoring the issue, ouch.

**Any resources (books, ...) that would soften the blow of processing the issue and that would guide a person to what to look for anyway and how to get over it for good?**

767,"Before we even moved in they tried to totally screw me with room pricing by giving me the smallest room in the house for only $20 less than the master but almost $200 more than the basement?

Then we move in and my roommate argued with me about payment forms for electricity. It was in her name but I was completely locked out of my Venmo account which is what she wanted me to pay with. So I asked her if I could use Zelle to which she asked me to write her a check (for $25 which is so ridiculous to me) so I told her no because I had a limited amount of checks and I pay my rent in check. She hesitantly agreed to eat me zelle her then when I asked for her username she didn’t reply to me for a week, I asked again and she said she changed her mind and wanted me to figure out my Venmo so I did so and paid her the day before it was due. She sent me a long text message about how uncool it was of me to pay her the day before which was last minute in her eyes and how I’m a child because my parents support me and she’s a real adult basically insulting me the whole time because I’m in college for engineering and my parents support my bills. I told her that the second she didn’t answer me when I was trying to pay, her right to be mad about whenever I sent it was gone. And she said she had every right to be picky about however she wanted to be paid and that it was my problem to figure it out based on her wants. I offered to just put my bank account on the electricity bill and have auto pay turned on while everyone pays me since I had no preference. She refused.

Fast forward.

A couple of weeks ago she messages me saying that her boots in the back of the common closet has paint on them and that I was the one that did it because I grabbed a duffel off the top shelf. I told her I didn’t do it and she told me that I definitely did it and probably didn’t notice when I was grabbing my bag. I told her that a) it doesn’t make sense that me grabbing a bag off the top shelf made me kick a can in the back of the closet over and that b) there’s no way I didn’t notice kicking over a 3 gallon can of paint. To avoid conflict I paid to get the shoes cleaned anyway but when I brought them back she said she no longer liked the quality of the boots and asked me to give her $100 for new ones. I said no that I wasn’t paying for something I didn’t do and that getting them cleaned as a courtesy was the farthest I would go. THEN she proceeds to ask me if my boyfriend was home and if he did it like?????? She was just TRYING to find reasons as to why it was me. She sent me a ridiculously long text after I refused that I ignored because she always sends me super long texts and it’s a waste of my time to read because they’re often composed of her trying to tell me what to do as if she’s my mother while simultaneously insulting me.

The final nail in the coffin was are argument about the heater. I like my temp 73 they like 69 so we agreed on 71 and the beginning of the lease in August. It’s now November and it’s 20 degrees outside and she sent a passive aggressive text to our group chat declaring that the house temperature would be 69 with the heater because they don’t even want to turn the heater on yet. Im anemic and my hands go blue and i get extremely sick when its that cold. She told me to get fuzzy socks and wear more clothes in the house if I was cold. And I said no, that I’m not budging and that if they change the temperature I’ll put it right back to 71. She then argued that if I wanted the heater on then her and my other roommate were gonna pay a flat rate for electricity while I would pay the rest and I said fuck. No. The electricity bill is not comprised of just the heater and turning the heater up two degrees would only make it go up $15 (I did the math). I said that if they wanted to pay a flat rate then everything they used the electricity for would be limited (lights, showers for hot water, stove usage, etc.) so they backed down.

Now we’re in a battle of turning the heater on and off when each person gets home/goes to sleep which is absolutely riduclous and might end up breaking the AC.

I seriously think that they’re both bitches that are treating the house as if it’s their lease that I’m just living in while forgetting that it’s MY home too and my opinions and comforts are equally important even if I’m the odd man out. On the contrary I cannot live like this it is exhausting and no one is getting a sublease.

776,"A little back story sorry it will be a little long: I love dogs. I have decided that they are the only form of living thing that I would like as children. I have a German Shepherd, that I’ve had since she was 12 weeks. She’s a great dog, listens to commands, can be left uncrated and has full range of my fenced in yard. 

Almost a year ago, I decided that it was time to get her a friend. One of my best friends is a foster mom. And I had been seeing dogs come and go from her just waiting for the one that spoke to me, and then I met Cash. He’s a mutt, was given back to the rescue for being too much with his litter mate. I love him from the second I met him and Blue tolerated him. We brought him home, and in a few weeks they were playing all the time and being buddies. 

I have a doggie dog, which my GSD has always used as she pleases, well I let Cash do the same. Then he started to break out of the fence. And when I mean break out of the fence he legitimately took chunks off my wooden 6ft privacy fence. I re enforced the fence with more wood and cinder blocks, yet he finds a way to break it again.

I crate him when I’m not home because he’s destructive which he doesn’t mind but now I can’t even let him out into the yard unsupervised. I work full time and come home during lunch to play fetch with them. They get taken to the park on the weekends or on nights I’m home early. So basically I’m trying to do everything in my power to keep him but it’s come to the point that I’m running out of options. My fiancé has been understanding but he is also out of ideas. 

The rescue that I used is willing to take him back, and I’m thinking of taking them up on that. Is that fair? I just need some ideas on what else I can do or if it’s best for him to find a better suited family.",13Nov2019,1

781,"I am a receptionist at a law firm, so I’m basically the assistant to the office administrator (my boss)

I am in charge of logging her firm card receipts to the accountant. I also use her firm card to buy anything the office needs. Whenever she buys something she usually gets the receipt to me.

At the end of every month, our accountant makes sure all the transactions are accounted for and that she’s been sent all receipts. This past month, my boss made close to 10 purchases on Amazon and didn’t send them to her. Or me, even.

The accountant sent me a list of transactions that weren’t logged or sent to her. There were maybe 3 ones I forgot, but other than that it was a long list of my boss forgetting all of it.

I went into her account and found every single receipt for her. I spent over two hours doing it.

When she sees me the next Monday she pulls me aside and tells me how “frustrated” she is that I keep forgetting to log my Amazon receipts. And that I’m keeping our accountant from doing her job. 

I just apologized and smiled. But honestly. I’m really frustrated that she’s blaming it on me, when it’s clearly her forgetting everything.

My sister who lives in Seattle WA. asked my dad if we could take in her homeless friend (F19), her rescue pitbull and brother (M24) for a month or two because her friend is with an abusive ex and their current situation isn't permanent.  They are drug addicts in recovery and have multiple health issues. The plan was they would get enough money and move out with my sister.

That ended up not happening. It's been 2 months and it's been hell. I've done everything I could to help these 2 and make them feel cared for because they probably haven't had that and it would help them to move on. They started out fine, picking up after themselves and whatnot, but that was shortlived. Their dog was making messes in the house and is food aggressive toward other dogs. She was using my expensive makeup without my permission and he wasn't picking up after himself or her, because she doesn't want to do anything and he'd do it for her to cover her. 

Eventually I got around to asking them to step it up because my dad was supposed to and was taking his sweet time doing it. I confronted them a week ago and apparently I'm a terrible person because I don't treat them like people. He's got it into his head that I want to be in a relationship with him; something that never came out of my mouth. She started straight up cussing me out. ( Mind you Everytime I try to talk to her about something she didn't like before I'd get attitude about it; like helping her pass her drug test for probation, told her I wasn't gonna do it again and it's the end of the world) He starts giving me this manipulative BS that he can sense my bad energy when I'm upset and it puts him in a bad mood, and I'm an awful person for not wanting to talk to him. 

I told them to get out because of this and when my dad gets home we have a chat and he lies to me saying they have until the end of the weekend and they'll be out. Here we are Wednesday and my dad had changed his mind to the end of the year until they screw up. 

I'm at such a loss because I owe them nothing and here I am stuck in my own house walking in eggshells all the time because they're still here and my anxiety is through the roof. My dad gets confrontation and Idk what to do. HELP PLEASE",13Nov2019,1

atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting 




My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? what reason do they have to put them together?

Always stronger together. We've gotten through bad relationships, losses, and well, everything else life throws at you together. 

A couple of years back, my sister moved away when she got married. That was hard. The next year, one of my brothers moved even further away because he couldn't afford to live here anymore. That was harder. My remaining siblings have talked hypothetically about leaving at times, because it is hard to make ends meet. But we've all agreed we couldn't stand to be split up any more. 

Now my parents are planning on leaving our home state to buy a house somewhere else. I mean it's gone from zero to 100 in like a week; they barely thought about it and suddenly they're charging ahead with it. It's pretty much all they've been talking to me about. They've been calling places about getting loans, and they're even planning on driving out next month to look at a place. 

One of my brothers feels he has nothing left here, and he's going to be leaving with them. The last of them said he's been thinking about moving for a while, and will probably do so once they're gone.

I'd go with them, but I'm about to be married myself. My S/O has his entire family here too, and I could no more ask him to leave them than I could imagine being separated from *my* family. Where he goes, I will be also. 

I tried to express some of this to my mom a few days ago, and in attempt to make me feel better about it, she told me they wouldn't leave until after I'm married. I understand she was trying to de-emphasize the mania of the deadline, but now all I can think about is how once I'm married, the clock on everyone leaving has started.

I feel like some of the color has been drained from the world. I've been trying to distract myself so I won't dwell on it, but all I can think about is how next time I hear this song, or watch this movie, they won't be here. I can't even think about the holidays coming up. All the things I love doing with family - going to local fairs, theme parks, family dinners, long drives, the movies, walking around looking at Christmas lights... Soon all of this will be gone. 

It hasn't even happened yet, but I can't stop thinking about it. I've been crying for days and it seems there's no end to it. I know there's no point in dwelling on what can't be changed. ""You can't live tomorrow today."" But I don't know what to do with myself. How do I move forward with this?",13Nov2019,1

801,"So I have this Indian roommate who I just met this semester and he’s pretty chill. We’re not the best of friends but we get along fine.

Recently the room has started to smell god awful. I can’t explain it any other way. It’s a musty strong odor. Our room window has always been open so I guess I never noticed it but now that the cold is here the window is closed and the smell is trapped inside.
I didn’t know where it was coming from before but now I realized it’s his towel. After he showers, he doesn’t even hang it properly to let it dry. He just throws it on the rack he has, still damp. There’s a few weeks left so i thought I might as well just deal with it but the smell has gotten bad to the point where opening the window isn’t much help anymore. 

Like I said, we’re not super close so I don’t know how to let him know of the situation. I fee like if I tel him he’ll get offended or something. Plus I’ve been kind of in a bad mood recently so he’ll probably think its because of the smell when it’s for a completely different reason.

I also realized he hasn’t done laundry since the semester started. Unless he does it secretly. This sounds stupid but is there any religion out there that doesn’t allow you to do laundry or use soap or detergents? Because I don’t see why someone wouldn’t wash their clothes regularly.

Please help bros I need an answer on how to deal with this situation.",13Nov2019,1

803,"Hi all. I'd just like to start with a little background (TW: mentions of suicide and self-harm)

I was diagnosed with depression at 13 years old. I have been hospitalized for a suicide plan and have been through an intensive outpatient program. I have been seeing a therapist consistently since May, and although I still struggle sometimes, I'm generally in a better place now than I used to be a few years ago. Currently I'm fifteen years old. I live with my dad, my stepmom, and my stepbrother, who is one year older than me. I've always been uncomfortable opening up/talking to my family about my mental health, and although I thought I was getting better with that, I don't think that anymore.

Over the weekend, I got very overwhelmed and cut myself with a razor. I went to my school guidance counselor on Tuesday to talk about it. Here's where the issue begins. My dad is not the best with handling mental health and whenever I have to get sent home (which is what happens when you go to your school guidance counselor about self harm), he screams at me, calling me selfish, manipulative, attention-seeking, etc. This time, I thought it would be the same. But it wasn't. On our way to the ER (which is where I had to go this time to get psychologically cleared to come back to school), my dad (who is the one that picked me up) almost crashed. On purpose. We got into a fight and he screamed at me like he never has before (literally, it was just screaming at the top of his lungs without words. Like someone had cut off a limb), and started repeating things like ""I don't give a f\*\*\* anymore"" and ""I'm so f\*\*\*ing done with this s\*\*\*."" Not only this, but he told me he'd send me away to live with my biological mom (who is in no condition to house me), that I ruined his marriage and his job, and that people shouldn't be asking me if I'm okay because it doesn't matter whether I am or not.

Reddit, I'm really, really scared. When I say he almost crashed, I mean it. He was swerving on the road. I don't know what to do at this point, and I'm scared that if I slip up again and cut myself, and tell guidance again, that he'll actually come after me. I'm afraid to be alone with him. What should I do?",13Nov2019,1

805,"I got a job as a dog bather a little less than a year ago as a way to be around animals that I loved. I wasn’t prepared for the amount of stress that comes with making animals do things they really don’t want to do and for the past couple of months my mental illness has been manifesting itself at my work to a debilitating level. I have horrible harm OCD in which I believe I am constantly hurting things without realizing it, which is very difficult to explain, and I know how strange that sounds. But to put it simply, it escalated to the point at work that anytime I touched a dog, I had paralyzing anxiety that something bad was going to happen and I would end up hurting the dog. If something as simple as a dog bumping his head happened, I would go into a full panic. No matter how many times I accessed the dogs I could not convince myself that no harm was done. It got to the point that I was going home crying everyday, crying in the bathroom, crying while doing my job just from anxiety. I woke up one morning and just couldn’t go back into work. That morning turned into a week and eventually I told my boss that ideally I wanted to put my two weeks in but mentally I didn’t know how to get through another day. I’m now unemployed and ridden with guilt that my mental issues have prevented me from staying at my job. My work was a very small business as well and I feel guilt for how I’ve left my coworkers. I feel like I have no where to turn and I feel like a horrible person. I left a situation where I was mentally unwell, but I feel like I’ve just traded it for an equally painful situation. I’m so mentally unwell I’m scared I can’t find another job, but I don’t know if I should ask for my old job back knowing how mentally painful it was. I don’t know how anyone can help me, but I just wanted to hear if other people had to leave their jobs with no notice due to mental health and how that worked out for them",13Nov2019,1

810,"Everyday, I go to a small local park walking distance from my house around 7am before work to train my dog (german shepherd) for about half an hour. This park is totally fenced with two openings on the same block. I get the usual passerbys that take their kids to school/go to work. I'm used to having passerbys watch because we do advanced obedience, but they usually leave shortly after. 

A few months ago, I've noticed a male (25-35M, race doesn't matter because still creepy) loitering around the bathrooms near the exit of the park. I can't predict when he is there because it's been pretty sporadic, and most of the time he leaves me alone. I've just been assuming it is just a homeless guy who uses the public restroom and as long as he leaves my dog and I alone, I won't bother him. 

Monday this week, he's been a little bit more creepy. He was watching me and standing in front of one of the exits. I took the other exit and as I walked across the street, I thought I misheard him say 'excuse me', but I ignored him and walked away as usual.

This morning, he was even more ballsy. On the other side of the fence, he asked me whether my dog was a 'real K9' and if I was a trainer. I said no, hes not a police dog, I train my dog for fun. He proceeded to walk slowly away while watching me. 15minutes later, as I was leaving, I saw him watching me again, standing by the same exit. As I approached the other exit, he walked over to that exit and said 'excuse me, can I talk to you for a second?' I was walking away and said 'no, I have to go to work'. He asked if I lived near the park and I replied with, 'no, I don't. My car is right over there and I'm late for work'. I proceeded to walk away and he again said 'excuse me, can I talk to you?' and motioned me to come back into the park. I again said 'no, I'm late for work' and walked away with my dog. I didn't see him follow me.

I don't feel comfortable going there again tomorrow morning, so I am going to drive to another park to train. That doesn't resolve the problem in the long run though, because I would like to still go to that park since it is so close by and I'm on a tight schedule before work. I'm going to take pictures from here on out, if he is there. I can't go earlier/later because the park is closed before sunrise and I have to get to work at 9am. I'm also assuming worst case scenario that my dog cannot protect me in this situation, though I hope he would. 

I feel like this is fairly obvious: file a report to the police ASAP. However, I'm not sure how to approach this because I have no evidence and the man hasn't tried to approach/harass me until today. Plus, if in the situation, I have no reason to call the cops for a non emergency, right? I didn't take any pictures since I didn't think anything of it and again, just thought he was a homeless guy and we'd leave each other alone. Could I still file a police report without picture evidence?",13Nov2019,1
811,"First of all sorry if I make some mistakes but I'm on mobile and English is not my first language.

So I'm 18 and I realize that I need to go to therapy badly for many reasons, but the most important one that is crushing me is that I can't study. I can't find the motivation, I literally enter panic mode just thinking about it, I procrastinate as much as I can, I cannot concentrate for 5 minutes straight for the life of me.

I've been to therapy 3 years ago for the same reasons, again mostly because I couldn't study and I had panic attacks, and then I started having panic attacks just opening the books to study. Obviously it didn't work much, the therapist wasn't graduated in anything, to be specific he was a musicotherspist. My parents chose him because of course he was the least expensive one and I accepted it as I didn't want my parents to spend a lot of money on me, it already was incredible that they gave me that possibility.

Now, I'm in as much as a bad spot as I was at the time, my mental health is absolute shit, and i can't ignore my problems anymore.
The thing is I can't ask my parents to pay for my therapy, so the solution would be to pay with my money.
I've worked my ass off this summer and I put away a discreet sum of money, but going to therapy would mean spending around half of what I've earned. That's really demoralising. I only work in the summer and some other dates in the rest of the year, but I worked hard for that money and I wanted to use it to get my life started away from my home. My family situation is definitely not the best and I always wanted to part from my family as soon as possible. Going to therapy would mean postponing it at least a year. I really really don't want to set myself back like that.
I thought about postponing therapy instead, until I had some more money, but I needed it like yesterday so yeah it's not a good idea to wait a year, I need to improve my mental health asap before I ruin my life. 


Going to the school/town psychologist is out of the table as they are no good, I literally never heard one person say one good thing about those experiences, I have friends who came out of therapy with them worse than before because of how incompetent they are.

I don't know if I should do it, I don't know if it's worth it, I don't know what I should do. So yeah, any advice is welcome.",13Nov2019,1
812,"Currently i’m 17 years old about to hit 18, I wanna say 1 thing and that’s that I HATE college, not because of college itself but the whole system around it.

I’m currently doing something about ‘creative’ stuff and to me, itms the perfect settings, I love my class love the teachers love everything, but I am so demotivated for college, I want to work fulltime so I can start get money to get a car, and progress on.

The thing is i’m very demotivated for college, I just don’t see the point of it the lessons are doable (rather easy) but It just takes so much time, I have 2 diploma’s one being MBO other one HBO (holland) and I can already say that I will stop with college ine I get my mbo4 (on my first year now, off of 4 years)

At home, I sometimes work on my horror game through UNreal engine 4, or make my own model in blender, i’m not experienced yet but I want to work my way through there to rventually make money out of it, I know I can do it but school REALLY handicaps me there, I get home quite late go to the gym quickly afterwards and then come tired home for like what, 2/3 hours for myself...

Once i turn 18 (month left) I will work my ass off and say fuck it all, i’m gonna work daily and probably sleep 2/3 hours a day because if how restrictive time becomes when college comes in to play, would this be a good idea?

But I have never slept with anyone while we were together.

About two and a half years ago, we were broken up for real and I started dating this guy that I am still in love with, let’s call him X. It was the first time I ever fell in love and was over the moon. Nevertheless, this dude had abusive traits and I left him. I still have strong feelings for him. 

L took me back no problem and he started talking about kids and marriage and I was ready to get on board because after seven years of me being elusive, he deserved to end up with me.

816,"Okay, a quick rundown about me: I have depression and have this issue where I self-sabotage. I have a pattern. I don't know why I do this to myself. 

I just did something really stupid and I don't know if I can fix it. I declined a job before I was offered the position. I have been seeking fulltime employment and haven't been landing anything. I get an interview for a part-time job, I didn't want to settle for a part-time, but it was all I could get. Beggars can't be choosers after all. It went well, but I didn't hear anything back from the manager for a while. I knew there was competition so I just assumed I didn't get the job. 

So I sent a polite email to the manager, but this is where I royally messed up. I didn't follow up on my interview. Instead, I told the manager that I decided to accept another position. I have other interviews, but this was a lie. I have not gotten another offer. I have no idea why I did this. He emailed me back congratulating me and mentioned that he was going to offer the position to me tomorrow. Insert the biggest facepalm ever. 

It was a very stupid, irrational, and impulsive decision and now I don't think there is an opportunity to get the job back without being viewed as a waste of time.

818,"I (30F) am traveling for my family’s business in Europe and Asia for 3 months with my father (65M), mother (64F), and brother (37M). My SIL (38F) and my husband (39M) will be joining us in a few cities as they are able.

My mother has been heavy my whole life. She’s about 5’1” 200lbs or 155 cm 90 kilos. She is the kindest, most generous and loving mother I could hope for, but she never learned good eating habits and we ate a lot of fast food, meat and starch growing up. My brother is heavy as well, but he’s got a big frame (6’4”, 280) and is very strong. I’m on the small side at 5’2”, maybe 110-115. My dad and I have stayed at fairly healthy weights because we don’t like meat and are very active.

We are 2 weeks into this slog and my mother is miserable. She can’t carry a suitcase without getting winded, even going down stairs is a struggle, and if we walk more than a few blocks she has to stop and rest. Her knees are bad and all this walking and public transport has her in a lot of pain. We all try to accommodate her and make her as comfortable as possible.

I find myself increasingly terrified of gaining weight. I watch her wheeze and fight through the pain all day, then we go to dinner and my anxiety spikes through the roof. Looking at a menu and seeing nothing but meat and heavy sauces (we’re in eastern Europe rn) makes me sweat. A lot of places in small towns won’t even have a salad, the only thing without meat will be something fattening like potatoes or bread and cheese. 

I love my mom but it really stresses me out to see how much trouble she has getting around, fitting in tiny cafés and trains (my brother obviously has trouble too). I’ve never had disordered eating, even when I was dancing professionally, but I will tell them I had a big lunch with a client or say I’m tired and getting room service when I really just don’t feel like eating. I feel so bad for her but also don’t want to go through that myself.

819,"So last month I was trying to get a new internet service plan for my home. 

I settled on an internet service I will not name (but you can have fun guessing who)

Settle in because this is gonna be long.

So initially when I agreed to their plan they promised me a 50mbps for their internet service + an installation fee.

I didn't want an installation and requested to do it myself. However they explained because of my house location they said they would need to come install it. I agreed. 

 So they come and install the internet and I was like cool and asked if everything was good? and the technician said everything should be working and it was but only at 25mbps half of what was originally stated. 

This was unacceptable so I called customer service the next day and they said that's all they can offer me. 

So I canceled their services and asked what to do about the installation fee and they said that I was fine because I had canceled within 14 days of installation. So I canceled the service and thought it was done and that was it. 

They said I didn't need to worry about the installation fee and I would be clear. 

Now a month later I get a bill of $110 stating I need to pay the installation bill. I thought it was a mistake and decided to call customer service again to make sure everything was good. 

Turns out installation fees are not the fees they wavier. EVEN though I asked a month ago if I had to worry about it and they said no. Now they are saying they had never agreed to this and I need to pay the fee and if I don't they are going to send it to collections. 

Now I was wondering what would happen if I didn't pay for it?

I've never not paid a bill before, what will happen?

 Do they just keep sending bills? 

I've heard that this could affect credit but I don't know anything about finance. 

Clearly I can't dispute this with them.  

Should I just pay it and be done with it?

833,"So I’m a senior and as we all know American high schools hold a prom at the end of the year for seniors. Because this last hurrah isn’t enough the seniors take it another step farther and party for a whole weekend. A lot of them rent “prom houses.” So it’s November and a girl in my grade lets call her “Maggie” is planning a prom house already. She invited maybe 40 people and my best friend, let’s call her “Grace”, decided she wanted to go to this prom house. Grace was not originally invited and anyone who wasn’t invited must beg and suck up to Maggie. Grace, some other friends and I decided we could  have our own prom house and but Grace decided she wanted to go to Maggie’s. She wants to go to the prom house because she likes being around a lot of people and wants to get drunk. I tried to tell her it was rude of her to ditch me because she wanted to get drunk as she could do that at ANY OTHER PROM HOUSE. But now I really don’t know what to do after prom and whether it should have anything to do with Grace.",13Nov2019,1

836,"20F from the midwest, but I have never really liked it here and always wanted to move to a place that offers more opportunities to interact with nature. Specifically somewhere with mountains. I considered moving away for college but couldn't afford to so I go to a state school now. I chose that school for its cost and history program and I am now in my third year, almost finished with my first semester. I have a pre-law track but honestly, my grades are average and I think it's because I confused what I am good at for what I want to do. In high school, I did an internship for a field ecology center and loved it, but I always felt like I wouldn't be smart enough. I did really well in high school but I have a 3.3 GPA in college and I would need to do better to go to law school. Plus, I am not even sure that's what I want to do anymore. My university doesn't offer any botany or forestry or anything remotely similar (three environmental science classes only) so switching my major this late isn't even an option. I tried speaking to my advisor and he was not helpful and also mean. 

I get aid federally which covers only eight semesters and if I take more than a semester off, I need to start paying on my student loans. Here are my options as I understand them, but obviously if you have suggestions or know more about the system I would love to hear it:

1. Switch to a school about two hours away and basically restart my degree and eventually have to pay out of pocket. I can't really afford to move right now and my family cannot and will not help pay for my schooling. With this, I could get a degree in the field I am interested in (ecology something), but again, I would be very poor and have to pay my way for schooling. I could take this spring semester off to work a lot and get enough money to move, then work to save for paying for school out of pocket. In this scenario, I would not go to graduate school and I would instead get my EMT certification through a local program and upon finishing my degree, move to a mountain place and work my way through at a state/national park and eventually do search and rescue stuff. That is kind of my ultimate dream. Without a degree in that general field, I would not be eligible to become a national park ranger or likely get a position in a related field. The issue with this is transferring schools is a problem because my long term girlfriend transferred to our current school and could not transfer again so we would probably have to live separately and we currently live together. 
2. I could finish out my degree, suck it up, go to law school, move to the mountains as a hobby. I may love this or I may hate this and I also probably won't get into a GREAT law school if I can finish at all. I worry that unless I am really committed, I won't have the stamina to finish or finish well. 
3. Finishing my history degree alone isn't really an option because I would struggle to find a job and here is where it gets a bit tricky and I could have used an advisor's help: Can I finish my history degree and apply to graduate school for a botany/forestry/ecology program? Or no because they aren't related? If yes, then that seems like a good plan. If not, then back to square one.
4. Last, but certainly the most exciting and daring: Take the semester off to make as much money as possible, move to the mountains, just a lesbian with a Subaru and her cat, and work the other stuff out. It is important to keep in mind that I would have to start paying on my federal loans after six months so I would have to work hard, but then I could find my footing, start school at a local university eventually, take my time, and get actual nature experience to apply to my future career. Then, if I hate the forestry bullshit, I can transfer my history credits and keep chugging along... but in the beautiful mountains. This is more of the ""put yourself where you want to be and the rest will work out"" mindset but it is uncharacteristically intriguing. I have always been a 'play it safe' kinda gal but I'm young, so what's wrong with getting out of my element and fleeing my current life to explore a new one? Plus, I would have the opportunity to get into climbing and that would really help me with my future goals.

Factors to keep in mind: My girlfriend and I are in very similar situations so for every possibility except #1 we can be together as a team. The decision must be made in the next few days so I can figure out enrolling next semester or not. Or applying to another school.  I have a fine relationship with my father and my sister supports me no matter what. Hell, she may cave and want to come too. I don't owe my dad anything because \*insert complicated family history\* so I feel like this may be one of the only times in my life where I can really make that leap of faith and adventure, but also it's fucking scary out there in the world so... Any advice is appreciated if you have managed to read all of this. I am really new to Reddit but I will definitely be watching this closely and responding to anyone kind enough to lend support and advice. Thank you so much in advance!",13Nov2019,1
837,"Idk where else to ask, I have a crippling fear of getting old. It's to the point that it affects my daily life. I was trying to set a 4 year goal and I thought 'Holy shit i'll be 27 by that point and I haven't accomplished a god damn thing' and just spiral into a paralyzing depression. 


I feel like 'whats the point of being successful if i'm 90 fucking years old by the time it happens'. i'm gonna be an old man with a bunch of resources that I'll be too tired to use. How do I fix this fear? 

I think about how other people were wildly successful by my age and it genuinely makes me suicidal. I haven't been living how I'd like, my life has been pathetic thus far. (By my own extremely high standards I guess)",13Nov2019,1
838,"A little backstory:

When I was super young I didn't have a care in the world. I coasted through school with A/B's and didn't really put any thought into my career path past wanting to enlist in the military and travel the world and figure it out as I went along.

That was all well and good but it all changed when I was 15 I had to have brain surgery to fix an AVM (I had a brain bleed and was hospitalized for like ~3 months). That threw all my plans in a loop because I knew the military wouldn't let someone in that had asthma let alone a brain bleed.

This thought of having no career path threw me into over drive. I completed my junior and senior year (11/12) of highschool in 8 months and walked the stage at 16. (About 20 days after that I turned 17) 

After that I spent about 8 months working at a restaurant and seeing all the people in their 30s/40s still waiting tables scared me even more into accelerating my career.

So I made a huge jump and moved from Texas to Boston, with some money I saved and help from my parents, to attend a coding bootcamp that was 15 weeks long and got certified in market relevant languages.

Out of that bootcamp I started working at a startup and I'm regularly pulling 70 hour weeks just to meet the client imposed deadlines we have to meet. And I think I'm finally starting to burn out.

Every morning I wake up and feel like I'm getting chased by dogs. My heart will randomly start racing, I'll panic about my future constantly, and I alienate friends because subconsciously I think they'll get in the way. And when I get home at night I'm terrified to go-to sleep because I know when I wake up I'm just gonna get that feeling again like I'm getting chased by dogs. This leads to be laying awake for hours with my heart racing but dead tired and I don't know what to do.



TL;DR Constant anxiety is making me terrified of sleeping because that means I have to start over from square one tomorrow",13Nov2019,1
839,"Long story short:  
I'm a creative writing student, and in one of the classes I take we have to work on a small literary magazine which is then published at the end of the semester. The magazine accepts submissions from students. One of the submissions that are currently being evaluated is a collection of poems from my ex-girlfriend. In tomorrow's class, a huge part of the submissions will be either rejected or accepted, and among them is the collection of poems. One of the poems talks about me. I know it because it's about something personal that barely anybody else knows about me, and I would rather keep it private. Yet, the poem *does not* include my name, or anything else that could be traced back to me. It's also not offensive towards me. I really, *really*, ***really*** don't want it published. It's well-written, and the number of submissions that we currently have is scarce, so there's a good chance it will be accepted anyway. I know some might say ""just leave it, since it can't be traced back to you,"" but seriously, the only thought of knowing it might be on written paper and being read by other people makes me angry.

I made the concious decision to forget about my classmates, as very few were ever my friends (I have one, but he's a busy guy). I aspire to go to university in the latter half of next year, but I'm afraid my job search is going nowhere, which means I would need a massive loan to get a degree. And most of all, I'm very lonely.

I’m really not happy when he treats me like that it makes me really nervous and upset and at that time it doesn’t make me want to break up with him but then there’s all the other days where everything is ok I think to myself ‘I’m glad I didn’t break up with him yet’.

846,"Before I begin, let me point out that I am an 18 year old male who attends a relatively small community college in southern middle Tennessee. This is my first semester in college (and it has been rough) and something happened to me the other day which I request further input on. 

On Mondays and Wednesdays, I attend two classes. One is at 9:30 AM and the other is at 12:30 PM. This past Monday, as I was walking into the building to attend my first class of the day, I was walking behind a girl who opened the door for me. Before I could say thank you, however, she looked at me and said that I have absolutely gorgeous hair. Now, hear me out. This may seem silly, but one thing to keep in mind about me is that I live a very, very boring life (which I am content with), so interaction with people who are not my friends is somewhat rare for me. I tend to be more introvert around strangers (especially females); I was more of an extrovert back in high school, mainly because I had known those people for the majority of my life. 

After she said this to me, I didn't necessarily freeze up, but my mind did. It was the heat of the moment, and as I mentioned before, ""thank you"" was all I could say. And then, after I got out of class, I was walking to my truck when I passed her again and she said the same thing again. Once again, all my mind could think to say was thank you.

Normally, I would simply disregard this happening and conclude it as simply being a friendly comment, nothing more and nothing less. However, I consulted some friends about it, and they said that they think she was flirting with me and that she was definitely into me since she said it twice. I couldn't really agree with them, I think because my knowledge of what exactly flirting is is insufficient; I haven't had someone flirt with me since high school when I was still with my ex and  even she hardly flirted to begin with. 

The thing I need advice with is this: I trust my friends and their judgement and advice, but at the same time I'm still uncertain of the situation. As I stated earlier, I'm not familiar with situations such as these since I rarely ever find myself in them. Now that my friends have mentioned this to me I feel as if I may have missed an opportunity. Which sucks, because I do desire a relationship. Not only that but it all happened so quickly I don't think I remember what she looks like so if I did try and even speak to her, I don't know who I'd be looking for. 

What should I do? Because now, it's really bothering me.",13Nov2019,1

I was a bit dejected, but still liked him a lot and respected his decision so we continued it. Fast forward again, out of nowhere one day he wanted to make things official, which took me by surprise because throughout the entire time I realized that it was actually better that we weren't official because we were both extremely busy. However, I still agreed. This is when things started to change. He became much more controlling, and just acted a lot differently than before. One week in, I started to feel like I was happier when we weren't official, but didn't say anything in hopes that it would change. We didn't see each other for almost a week, and didn't text much either. When we finally saw each other, he told me a lotttt of shit (mostly about how he felt he was too busy) and we ""broke up,"" but he said he wanted to go back to what we were before (unofficial). It honestly made me really sad, and I cried for a couple of days about it but he thinks we're still good with our unofficial status.

852,"Hi guys so this might be a no brainer but I would like some other perspectives on the matter. I'm on my phone so sorry for the bad formating!


I guess my ex boyfriend broke up with me two weeks ago. We had a big fight that he no longer makes time for me or puts in effort in keeping the relationship going. He avoided me the last two weeks prior the split saying he's sick/tired/wants to game/other obligations that made him cancel seeing me.


When I pushed the issue of avoiding me he stated he isn't really for people this lasy month and didn't even enjoy seeing me. I asked why couldn't he just say that at the beggining as I would have given him space instead of canceling and lying to me. He just repeated the same thing and asked why I can't understand that - he said it's just a general mood and nothing hapoened as I asked him if he wants to talk about it.


Since he brushed me off with no further explenation or wish to talk about what I can do to give him the space or what does he need or want at this time from the relationship , I told him to call me in a months time when he remembers that he has a girlfriend he promised he'll put effort in the relationship (we had another go at mending our relationship as it didn't even feel like a friendship- he just wanted to play video games alone/eat/sex)


Well...I didn't get a message after that. One week later I texted him if we broke up or am I still waiting for his 'not for people' mood to pass.


He didn't answer, that was a week ago and I accepted that it just died and there was no need to push someone who doesn't want to be in a relationship. 


Today I got a call to the same place we both applied - he's been working there for 5 months. They called me and I passed all the interviews. 


They told me to decide by Friday if I want the job.


Thing is, I support my mother and brother. The pay,benefits and advancement opportunities are bigger than at my current job- by quite a good deal too. And this all happened when he knew that my familly and I are losing our house and financialy it's overall hard for me.

He lives alone and his mother pays him the bills of his apartament (they own it). However it's his work place first and if he's going through a hard time mentally I don't want to make things bad for him.


We would be working on the same Team.


I don't know if this is going to be that bad of an idea? I'm an adult, I can act profesional at work and act as we barely know each other -distant acquaintances.


Should I even go for this job? My mum told me to look out for myself and not if he will feel awekward as he didn't show any respect to me. She told me that it would be a good deal career wise and not let a spoiled relationship ruin my further life opportunities.


Maybe let him know that I got this offer and give him a heads up so we can both be civil at work and know how to act? Maybe just decline?

About a week ago I got my scores back and I was told that my scores very good. I compared with a few friends and my score was over 20 points higher than the next closest score. I thought it was cool, but I didn't think very much of it.

I don't eat breakfast or lunch and my dinner consists of me pretending to eat in front of my family to avoid them being concerned about me.

I hate myself for it. But it's like I'm addicted to the way it feels to hurt myself whether it's from not eating, not sleeping, or cutting.

I've been cutting myself on and off since I was 11, and I'm 18 now. This isn't necessarily a way to make myself feel worse, but I like the way it feels and it calms me down.

I know this is stupid and I know people have much worse problems in their lives, so I do feel guilty about struggling this way. I have a good life now for the most part, so I ask myself everyday why I feel this way and do these things. I should be happy, but I'm not.

864,"I'll try to make this less of a rant so that I can get to the point ... I'm a molecular and cellular biology major at UCSD (just transfered there, this is my first quarter), but I'm trying to transfer into the chemical engineering major. I'm taking a CHEM ENG course right now, and I'm pretty sure I just failed a test in it. I couldnt get an answer to a single question. I don't know if I'll pass this class. 

I grew up very closeted, and everyone babied me. That left me with little to no ""street smarts"" or, I just come across as very naïve and ignorant. I hate that about myself, but the one thing I've always been able to pride myself in has been academic intelligence. So now, it feels like I don't even have that, and I just feel absolutely worthless right now. I had thought, well maybe everyone thinks I come across as stupid, but if I prove myself in a respectable field (I like/don't mind the work ... Apparently I just don't understand it) then maybe people will respect me. But I obviously don't know what I'm doing. 

I never thought I'd be the type of person to fail. I know that sounds terrible, everyone fails, but I never thought I'd have a ""fall out in my academic career"" kind of fail.

Am I cut out for this? Is it okay if I'm not? Because it sure doesn't feel like it is right now.",13Nov2019,1
865,"Im having a panic attack right now at school and when I panic I typically go somewhere quiet and isolated, it helps me relax a lot, but my go to spaces are all very busy and it’s stressing me out more. There’s no where quiet to go (including the bathroom), and I can’t go to the teachers office because I am in trouble so they do not want me there (and we do not have a nurses office). I don’t have anywhere to isolate myself and calm down, or even earbuds or anything to tune out sound, which is the worst trigger for my anxiety. What do I do????",13Nov2019,1

867,"Hello, I've been thinking about this for awhile now, and I've finally decided to post and ask for some advice. 

I wake up at 4:20 AM Tuesday-Saturday for work-related reasons. I'm part of a large group of friends who hangs out almost every Saturday night. The hangout sessions usually begin around 10 PM and are wrapped up around 4 AM.
It used to be a great time and I loved becoming close to everyone. The problem is, I find myself getting tired when everyone else is just getting amped up to party. Most of the time I end up passing out on a couch around 1 in the morning from pure exhaustion. 

I've begun slowly finding myself less and less excited about going out with my friend group specifically because of how tired I am after the work week and waking up so early on saturday already. 
I'm not sure what I can do, and I feel like I need to choose between my health and my friends. Which sucks. 
I've made remarks about how the hangout sessions are too late in the evening for my schedule to be met with less than helpful responses that generally can be translated to ""grow a pair and deal with it"".
What should I do?",13Nov2019,1

869," Ok I’m in a situation right now. I am good friends with two people who are in a relationship and they have been for a while. Recently I hosted a party at my friends place and things got a little wild for my friend. She did not want to tell her boyfriend about the things she did at the party. But on the other hand, her boyfriend is one of my close friends and I want him to know the information and the things that happened but I feel like it is not my right to tell and figured she should tell him since it's their relationship. Although the answer after reading these two sentences might be clear and would be  ""oh just tell the boyfriend, shes a bad girlfriend"" the downside of this for me is that they have both been my friends for a long time and it would pain me to lose either one of them as friends. Right now they are in a pickle because I recently was able to talk to him and the things came up and he was suspicious when I was talking about it and asked me if anything else was happening. I did not really know what to do. I said no I don’t think so and that made me feel bad because I was lying straight to his face. On the other hand she was under the influence of things such as drinking and weed.. So I don’t know if her actions are entirely her fault or the items. Is it her fault or not? What should I do Reddit? I value both the relationship with these people.",13Nov2019,1

873,"I love her so much, but she’s always had issues with keeping a job for an extended period (more than 6 months) and her lack of higher education means she has trouble finding anything that pays more than $8/hr with ~20hrs/wk(which is basically nothing). She is super talented artistically, and has real ambition for becoming a professional artist, but right now she just needs to get a well-paying job so she can help offset my student loan payments that are coming up. 

I make enough money to support myself and pay those bills, but if she’s living with me I won’t be able to afford everything. She’s been applying for months and been working a part-time job, but the hours and pay are stupidly low. If she could get a job making as little as $30k it would be fine, but nothing is coming back and the stress is mounting. 

She understands and doesn’t blame me for the situation that’s beyond my control. It’s hard on both of us though. The apartment is getting messier, we’re both starting to crack, and the deadline for her getting a job is basically the new year. I refuse to drain all of our savings trying to keep her here when she doesn’t have a way to contribute fairly. 

I’m currently moping over a bowl of mushy cereal as she’s at work cuz I don’t have the energy to work full time, be the maid, enthusiastically support her like she needs, and also cook for myself. I can’t talk to my family because they have always held some kind of irrational disdain for her because she didn’t choose to get a degree she has no interest in and saved her money instead. 

I don’t know what kind of advice I expect to get. Maybe I just need to vent. I don’t wanna hear I need to leave her because as bad as she might come off in the above, she’s an amazing friend and partner and I don’t wanna be with anyone else. I’m paralyzed by the thought of her going away because of this. Neither of us are confident we could sustain a long distance relationship 500+ miles apart forever. A few months yeah but indefinitely we start to lose hope.

875,In middle school and early highschool I was pretty popular I had a lot of girls talking to me all the time and I had a lot of friends. Fast forward 2 years now no girls talk to me and I have like 3 friends and almost no social life. I don’t know what went wrong I never had problems with anyone people just slowly drifted out of my life. I used to get invited to parties all the time now I’m never invited to any parties or social events. I sit alone in classes now and my life has changed 100% and to my best knowledge I didn’t do anything different for this to happen. Can someone please give me advice on how to have a new social circle with more friends and how to talk to girls again? Back then it was easy but now I’m quiet and 99% of the time too afraid to approach or start convos with them.,13Nov2019,1
876,"Yesterday, my grandmother suffered a stroke and was taken to the ER, which then lead to her being in the ICU. The hospital bills are expensive, so we have to put her in another hospital.

When I first heard about this, I didn't believe them. My strong and healthy grandmother in a hospital? You're joking. So I went on with my day as usual. Until, it did hit me and it wasn't in the comforts of my house, it was during a class I had.

I had to hide my tears and we'll, the rest is history.

In morning, my grandfather came to visit. Even though I was extremely sleepy and tired from schoolwork and whatever I was doing last night, I immediately sat up and ate with him. He, he gave us a talk about my grandmother's illness, saying things like ""I hope you don't get that from her"" and etc. I tried to stop my tears, but I just can't. I just wished I could go back in time, to when I was a kid again. When I was so naive and my grandmother is still healthy.

But I can't do that. No one could and if we couldn, we'd probably have to sacrifice something that we love to achieve it.

Now you know my story. I need advice on how to cheer up my family, how to cope with this, and how to possibly make my grandmother proud before she lets go.

879,"I don’t even know how to begin,it’s so confusing and scary.
So I really like this guy,but  he keeps being aggressive around me,hitting me,psychically touching me etc.
I’m even afraid to walk into the class because I know he will hit me or grab my parts.
I told him that I’m not comfortable for him to touch me,but he just smirked and grabbed me again.
Even though I tried to fight back,I’m not very good at it because I never had conflicts that will end up physically aggressive,so I’m pretty much weak at this point.
What am I supposed to do?I know it’s not normal and I’m scared that this will end up more terrifying.",13Nov2019,1
