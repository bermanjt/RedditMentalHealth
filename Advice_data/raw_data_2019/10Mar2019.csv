I ended up scraping one of the bordering cars and left a note w/ my name and phone #. Everything I‚Äôve read says I shouldnt have admitted guilt (I wrote ‚ÄúI hit your car‚Äù and ‚Äúmy bad‚Äù), but I can‚Äôt change that now. I left and parked elsewhere. I also failed to take pics of damage because I wasn‚Äôt thinking and was running late for a track meet.
They called a little bit ago and said the scrape went from the back bumper thru the tire and a bit into the back door. It didn‚Äôt seem that bad when I looked, but I don‚Äôt doubt it either. They said they‚Äôre getting an estimate soon, and asked how I wanted to approach it.
Should I get insurance involved? If the costs are above or below deductible? I‚Äôm a 17yo license holder. What effect will it likely have on my rates now and in the future? 
Also, they asked if there was a repair shop I preferred they go to. Is there any reason for that besides cost?

8,"Hi,

I was wondering if throwing a drink is considered as assault in Belgium. I just want to expose a boy that did this to me and two other of my friends yesterday. I just want to be sure... because I would look stupid if I called it assault if it wasn‚Äôt.

Short story: my girlfriends and I were at a party and this boy (i will keep calling him a boy bc he got his feelings hurt bc he got ignored) wouldn‚Äôt let us be and dumped his beer on my friend after she told him something and told him off. We left him be and stayed as far away from him. He came back to talk to my friend but I blocked him with my body so he couldn‚Äôt talk to her and he came back the other way because everyone was ignoring him and she said something to him again and he threw his drink on her again. That was it for me and I threw my drink on him. He forcefully grabbed my friend‚Äôs drink and threw it on me but most of it didn‚Äôt land on me but the people behind me. After 5 or 10 minutes I decided to leave but the same guy came out of nowhere with a new beer and dumped it on my head. The security guard only saw when I got out of the crowd soaking wet but he couldn‚Äôt do anything to the boy because he didn‚Äôt see anything. Sad. It was my first party after awhile and will be my last for sure.

Thank you to anyone who answers",10Mar2019,1

11,"So I (M18) am a ginger with really pale blonde eyebrows (the point where it looks like I don't even have eyebrows). I was raised a mormon and all my close friends and family are devout mormons. I love them all to death even though our beliefs differ, and they generally respect me for my beliefs. My sister has always filled in her eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil, and I always wanted to do that but was too afraid to because in Mormon culture, anything a guy does that could be considered ""gay"" is heavily shunned. So I dealt with my pale eyebrows (not a big deal lol) for my whole life. 

This last year I moved to college, and I've really been getting out of my shell. I'm out of the frankly toxic Mormon community I was raised in, and I can be myself a lot more here. So, I decided to try filling in my eyebrows. I really like the way it looks and was happy with it. But this week I visited home, and my friends have been giving me shit all week. They call me ""super gay"" (which they mean as an insult because mormons are kind of homophobic) and I feel like they think less of me now. I know that they think less of gay people, which is SUPER wrong, and now they're making fun of me for being ""gay"" just for filling in my eyebrows. But in all ways other than this, they're great, supportive people and I can't see myself ever cutting off the friendship. They're like brothers to me. 

So, do y'all have any advice for dealing with their homophobia/making fun of me? It's really bothering me because even though I know I shouldn't care, I'm now feeling super self conscious about using makeup to fill in my eyebrows.",10Mar2019,2

After 5 months, quit it for my own good.


Since then i only met guys online cuz idk how to find anyone irl (tried but failed). Had some awful ""dating"" experience online where they didn't respect me and only wanted my nudes. I didnt realize it before that i was too easy or put up with too many bullshits that men showed clearly he didnt respect me and wasted my time. 


Now i hate how the dating world looks like now. So many games. I know better now i will do better. Im not as naive as i was. But i have seen a lot how there are too many manipulative ppl out there that i think im better off single now because its too frustrating for me.

Another problem. As im jobless, i have been applying to  master's programs in europe. I can't afford it . Tried scholarships but not all cover the whole expenses, only part of it and i still won't be able to afford it.


Found a weird guy online who doesnt mind spending money. He gave money to strangers, became a sugar daddy, paid girls for nudes, etc. He is a lonely weird man himself. So , he spends on me and will pay for a program if i live with him. I know his identity , where he works etc. 

Some part of me: yea lets do it, experience life.


Some part of me: i will be stuck with him. I dont like him. He is a weirdo. I wont afford to find an apt myself. I want love.

Recently I have been feeling quite empty. I don‚Äôt have any goals in life and the only thing I do is study and play one game. The relationships I have with others feel fake because I barely talk to them outside of school. I think about scenarios a lot and have made them desensitised, like saying a word over and over again. I don‚Äôt think I would feel anything if a person close to me like my mom or dad died. I want to have a close relationship with someone like a girlfriend but I know that I would just be lying to myself saying that it is meaningful. I have been through a suicidal/depression phase where I did cut myself, but I have convinced myself that it was all just a way to make myself a bit edgier because I felt lonely. When some people did find cuts on my wrists, they would barely say anything, no words of comfort. 

I‚Äôm out of that phase now but still feel empty. University is going to be a must for me. I know that when I do get there, I will be no happier than I am now. All my life will amount to is meaningless relationships and work. I am certain that I will not commit suicide. I feel like I am in some sort of limbo, having to go through life not actually living.

21,"Throwaway. My family....we hit rock bottom and I have no idea what to do. My mom went to school for her BA in English and got her Masters in Education and Early childhood education. She really wanted to be a teacher but struggled to pass the boards and now we are left with her huuuuge student loans, and creditors and bill collectors are down her throat constantly.  
She worked grant funded postitions for a while, and eventually the grants wouldn‚Äôt get renewed so they would let her go. She has no unemployment left, no retirement saved, no savings. I feel so bad because she is always depressed and cries regularly. Other family members are getting annoyed because she asks for money regularly. 

She owes everyone including my high school (I‚Äôm now a junior in college) to which she owes $20,000 (they let my sister and I walk because my mom begged and pleaded). It is affecting my ability to take summer classes at universities other than my primary one because they ask for my transcripts. Every time I request them they make me pay $500-$1000 to send them to the institution.

I constantly am anxious about this situation because she already filed bankruptcy and it‚Äôs looking like she may be going down that path again. She‚Äôs approaching 55 and is worried that she can‚Äôt get a job because of her age. I have tried to convince her to retake the board exam but she denies it because it‚Äôs costs (go figure).

26,"Disclaimer: sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right place for this kind of situation but I do need advice so I came here. All advice is appreciated, thank you!

So I met this boy at my college during the beginning of the year at a party. We started texting/snapping last semester but it slowly died off due to finals coming up. We didn‚Äôt talk often enough to initiate hanging out or anything, but we did keep in contact for the majority of the semester. 

Then this semester, we ran into each other at a party, ended up hitting it off, and I went back to his place for the night. That night we had a tonnnn of fun but didn‚Äôt have sex because I was on my period. Also, at the party, I drunkenly asked him to be my date to my sorority formal to which he said yes. I don‚Äôt regret asking though because I was considering asking him prior to seeing him at the party and I don‚Äôt have a date so why not. Anyways, in the morning he lets me borrow his jacket and gets me an uber to go home. 

He texts me saying that I hope I had fun and that we should chill later that week. I told him I was sort of busy with a project due that week so it would have to wait till the next week. Anyways, we text all day everyday about random things about our lives and just overall carry on a genuine conversation. I think we both enjoyed talking to each other and the conversation flowed pretty naturally.

The next week, I tell him I‚Äôm free on Tuesday night. His frat was actually having a Mardi Gras party that night, that I knew about but told him I didn‚Äôt really want to go because it was a school night and none of my friends were going, but I would be down to hang out after it if he got free, to which he agreed. That was basically the plan all day so I wasn‚Äôt too worried. Around like 12:30 am he snaps me telling me that he was about to go home and if I wanted to hang out now. It was kind of late at that point and I fell asleep so I didn‚Äôt see it till the morning. I was a little bummed he didn‚Äôt leave earlier than that and just went to bed. 

So we planned on meeting the next night. He started mentioning something my college town has on Wednesday nights called ‚ÄúSalsa Wednesday‚Äù which is just where they teach you salsa and they serve alcohol if you‚Äôre 21. He asked me if I‚Äôve ever been and I say no, but a few of my sorority girls were going to go that night. I felt like he mentioned it because he wanted me to ask him, so I did. But then he says ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm tired from yesterday, but you should go!!‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm really confused because why would he want me to go by myself when we were supposed to hang out that night? And why would he mention it if he said he was too tired to go? Something in me is telling me he wants me to be a little drunk before going to his place because he was also mentioning how underaged kids sneak alcohol into it too. I tell him I‚Äôll probably go another night. He then asks me when I‚Äôm leaving for Spring Break and I say Friday after class, so he says ‚Äúdo you want to hang out tomorrow night then?‚Äù I tell him I was actually going to have a girl‚Äôs night that night and ask why he couldn‚Äôt do tonight. He said he‚Äôs exhausted and that I should ‚Äúsleepover at his that night bc it‚Äôs more fun ;)‚Äù. So I said I‚Äôll have to think about tomorrow night. We continue to text and have a normal conversation after that.

The next day, he doesn‚Äôt respond to my last text which was sent late the night before. The girl‚Äôs night plan actually falls through because they still had homework to finish before we get off for break, so I wanted to tell him I was actually going to be free that night. He doesn‚Äôt text back the entire day so I double text him around 6 pm letting him know I‚Äôm going to be free that night. He texts me back saying he‚Äôs sorry for not responding and that he has a birthday dinner to go to around 8 and then he‚Äôs going downtown with his friends (which is where all our town‚Äôs bars are), but he‚Äôll be free after that. This annoys me because I have been trying to free out my nights for him so that the two of us could actually hang out/talk/maybe hook up and I don‚Äôt know like get to know each other and just have fun. But, the way he has been handling this is having me over AFTER he goes out and gets drunk. Like, I don‚Äôt mind if we go out and get drunk together or something but he doesn‚Äôt seem to be prioritizing hanging out with me, but rather has his plans and then thinks of me as an after thought. I tell him I might actually be hanging out with a few friends but if he wants to stay out late that‚Äôs fine, we can do another night which would have to be after Spring Break because that was my last night in town. He texts back at like 11 pm and says, I‚Äôll be back home around 1 am if you want to hang then. I say that that‚Äôs too late for me I‚Äôll probably just stay in for the night after hanging with friends. 

He texts back at 2 am saying ‚Äúdamnnn I‚Äôm sorry I feel so bad, I really wanted to hang with you, my boys dragged me out‚Äù.

2 days have passed and I don‚Äôt know if I should respond to him or not. I‚Äôm a little hurt he isn‚Äôt putting aside time to actually hang out with me, despite him saying he ‚Äúreally wants to hang out with me‚Äù. If that were so then he would have made time by now but he hasn‚Äôt done that. He definitely just sees me as someone he could probably have sex with and that‚Äôs it, but if that‚Äôs the case, then why does he choose to carry on a conversation about my life, school, personal things and show genuine interest in me? Like, if sex was your only goal, why have we been texting continuously for the past two weeks? I‚Äôm still interested in hanging out with him but I feel like I‚Äôm a little more invested in him than he is with me.

So, what should I do? Do I text him back saying it‚Äôs fine? Wait for him to double text? Try to suggest another night we could hang out? Ghost him? Also keep in mind that I still have his jacket from the first night, and I asked him to my formal which is about a month from now. Not sure what to do but I‚Äôll take any advice you guys give me. Thanks!

it wasn't even meant to be flirtatious, just mildly humorous, but this person is hypersexual (observed her with friends previous to this encounter) and at me saying that, she walked up behind me and pretended to run into me again, but this time she rubbed her breasts up and down on my back. when she stopped, I acted like I was turned on and said ""do it again"" and so she did (I was not actually turned on). Another time a few days later, she did it again and while I didn't encourage it, I didn't stop her.

Should I tell my girlfriend this? I had no other contact with this girl, nor any emotional attachment. I guess I encouraged the behavior at the time because 1) i was playing around and didn't think of wider implications at the time and 2) the female attention admittedly felt good. There have been no other transgressions in our relationship. I feel like it could endanger the relationship if I tell her, over something pretty minor. On the other hand I have been feeling really guilty about it.",10Mar2019,1
37,"Hey Reddit.

I just wanted to pop in and ask advice, because frankly I'm kind of at a standstill.

I have a good friend (he may see this, frequent Redditor) who I am concerned about. He has expressed to me that he is getting into vaping. Now, I've heard a lot of things about vaping, good and bad, so I'm stuck. He currently uses spray Listerine during the day to get a sort of relief, but has expressed that he wants a vape stick and juice for his birthday in the near future.

If anyone knows anything more about vape than some good information would be appreciated. Both of my parents have struggled with cigarette addictions for decades and I really don't want him to have something similar happen. Thanks.",10Mar2019,1

I‚Äôm a 17 year old transgender man who‚Äôs struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life. My mom has been supportive in the ways that she can. I go to therapy, I take antidepressants, I‚Äôm even on testosterone.  But when it comes to my depression, she‚Äôs supportive one day and angry the next. I struggle to get up for school almost every day, only making it one day a week usually. Some days she comes into my room and asks me if I can make it to school, and is understanding when I can‚Äôt. Other days she sends me texts like ‚ÄúGet it together. Finishing high school is a basic thing to do in life‚Äù. Yes, I understand where she‚Äôs coming from. But I feel like some days she completely disregards my mental illnesses and expects me to act like a regular person. 
I‚Äôll tell you about the most recent thing she‚Äôs done that has absolutely set me off. I hadn‚Äôt gone to school in weeks, couldn‚Äôt shower or brush my teeth, or leave my room. Instead of talking to me, or simply asking me how I‚Äôm doing, she just shuts off the wifi and my data and expects that to get me to school. Here‚Äôs the thing, I don‚Äôt give a fuck about whether I have wifi during school hours. Most days I sleep in until 4pm, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm getting up at 9am and playing Fortnite all day.

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being petty or if this is justified. I would appreciate any feedback I can get, even if it‚Äôs people telling me to suck it up or I‚Äôm overreacting.

43,"hi, thanks for looking at this post, i've got a burn reddit username here.  


well, here we go:  
I'm from a bigger city from California. I grew up in a middle class area with a high diversity level. growing up there i've gotten a high level of different interactions with a multitude of different types of people and grew myself into a self-politicalized individual since i was in my teens (don't call me a liberal just aware of my surroundings) while understanding the cultural struggles that vary in different demographic groups (i.e. gentrification of low-income people of color via white hipsters, and I do understand that we still live in a white man's country regardless of the demographic population size with POC groups. ). I found my passion in working outdoors so i had moved around to a handful of states these past few years and now find myself in living in Bozeman, Montana. Being a multi-cultural mutt i've experienced racist, and bigoted ideologies for the agency I work for (from co-workers here in MT) - but the agency i work for (inherently) requires you to have tough skin since my line of work can be fatal and is, let's say, always working in less desirable conditions (i work in the woods woods seasonally, so an unbreakable camaraderie exist)  but that isn't my issue of focus here, but i hope that this has painted a decent picture for you from where I am coming from.  


So I'm currently living in Bozeman, MT for the rest of the winter and when I venture out to the downtown I run into so many white ""bro's"" of the all sort (frat, ski bums, hipsters, etc) that have such neglect and understanding for the small bubble they live in. I say this with personal experience when I even hear my roommate yell ""n\*gga,"" whom is white, and when I got to bars and see the occasional MAGA hat, to me remembering how hipsters, and exclusive white frat bros  have displaced people of my color because they like the culture but yet haven't the slightest idea of what how their very skin color affects the world around themselves in their haven. And before you think, ""ya dumbshit, what else do you expect from Montana,"" I would suppose my naiveness would allow me to believe that anyone with half a brain has an understanding of how the world works, but bubbles exist for a reason, i guess, and age and experience is just a falsehood idea as we grow older to become ""wiser."" And before you say, well not everyone is like this, i do believe, and agree with that, but yet the surface is what i must go off of and how people project themselves via the simplest interactions, and even attire (unfortunately).  I might be bitter given my past experiences in life, but when I started become ""self-politicalized"" way back when I have grown ever-so more knowledgeable, especially when i took a classes in Critical Racist Theory, and as people call it ""ethic studies,"" and continued farther and farther into that path. I have sympathy to those whom have not access to the tools, classes, and great resources I have come across where I am from, and certainly lack in rural states such as Montana - but yet we live in the information age and those whom do not have access to information are only the very, very poor (and are only a result of our system, regardless of color.) But i do not have sympathy for those who have access and yet continue to live so, so ignorantly (ya think that cocaine that crossed the border to get here you're sorting up your nose didn't kill anyone? Think again.) And I watch this happen, all around me.  


Jeez, I really went on a rant. So I am asking for advice of how to funcition normally, i suppose. Suggestions of meeting people is difficult for me, but not impossible, but I suppose I am asking for things I can do personally. I might be a self-centered bastard caught up in myself but I am who I am, and I am asking for advice. thank you.",10Mar2019,0

46,"So I'm in high school and starting my own non-profit political organization. I was telling my friend (on Monday) how I was going to buy one on Fiverr (around 40-60 USD) and he offered to make one for me instead because he supposedly was good at Photoshop. To be nice, I told him I would pay him 40 bucks. 

Fast forward to today (on Saturday), and he sends me what he has completed so far. Honestly, it was something that could be made in Microsoft Paint. It was worse than a logo that I could've bought on Fiverr for 5 dollars and showed that he put no effort into it.

I legitamitely thought it was going to be quality, as he did have a proficiency in technical skills. In my favor is that he lied about how good he was at Photoshop, and did not dedicate enough time to it, but I was the one that brought up payment. 

So how do I nicely turn him down without ruining our friendship and pissing him off? I have to share a hotel room with him for a team competition that we are competing together in and don't want that to be awkward.

50,"Hello all, I'm a college freshmen and last semester I took COMX101 something with a teacher and it was very fun, I ended up with a b minus, she had allowed me to turn in several unfinished assignments but only gave me credit for 4/17, despite claiming that I'd receive full credit for all of them as long as I completed them. Even still, It got me to a B minus, so my friends told me to shut up and take the grade.   


This semester she convinced me to take a different comx 100 level class again as she thought I'd enjoy it. (same credit so I gain nothing from passing it)  Early in the semester she cancelled class for 3 weeks for her honeymoon. It's about two months into the semester and she's said that she will take everything late. I have emailed her several assignments using the email she put in the syllabus because that's the only way I can send them to her. I feel like every time we have class I have to nag her to ask if she's even looked at them yet, because after a month they still haven't been graded.  


She assigned us something stating ""You have the whole spring break to turn this in"" but I woke up today to a grade of 0 and the assignment can no longer be turned in, while spring break doesnt end for 2 days, and I don't have this class for 3 days. One assignment I turned in I got a grade of ""??? you didn't turn this in"" when it's sitting in her email. She's apologized to our class several times for being so far behind on grading and said shes going to use the break to catch up, but she still hasn't graded things from the first week of class.  


I'm honestly tired of nagging her and not knowing how I'm doing in the class, should I just drop it, or be willing to pass with a lower grade then I expect due to her ""losing"" assignments.

52,"Today was a big day drunk day at my school. My friends from home came up to my school and I was just really excited to spend the day with them and my girlfriend. Something happened and my vibe was just killed. I went on my girlfriends phone and to look and send myself the pictures we took earlier, and when I swiped up to get out of the app, I saw her texts. 
 

She‚Äôs in sorority first of all, and i used to be close friends with her roommate.Roommate and my gf just kinda recently started bonding.  I saw she had texted her roommate last night and this was the gist of it 
Roommate- *name of frat‚Äôs* party starts at 1 tomorrow 
Gf- I lowkey wanna fuck half the guys in there
Roommate- who
Gf - shhh
Roommate-I‚Äôm not that close with OP anymore don‚Äôt worry 
Then my gf names her top 3 guys, and says she would let the #1 guy spit on her. Also, number one guy introduced himself to her and a mixer a few weeks ago, and that was ‚Äúalmost nutted‚Äù ( her way of saying orgasm)


At this point, my entire vibe is just killed. Eventually my girlfriend fell asleep and I wanted to see if there was more. I saw she was texting one of her sorority sisters and there was no mention of the introduction, but her sister ( who has a boyfriend) asked for that particular guys instagram and my gf replied with ‚Äú look through my follow list üòõ‚Äù
They had a mixer with a different frat who‚Äôs the bottom of the barrel in terms of popularity, and my gf said she felt like she was ‚Äúwasting this outfit‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy couldn‚Äôt it be *the other frat*. 


My entire mood is killed. I suppose it‚Äôs normal in a relationship to have crushes on other people, but I feel this is over the top. Especially the outfit thing. Where do I go from here. We‚Äôve been dating since October 2017, she joined the sorority Oct 2018.

53,"Hey all, so I've been mulling over reaching out to others about this for a fair while now, but I'm at the point where I seriously think I will collapse if I don't at least tell others about my situation.

So for some context, I'm currently studying for my final secondary school exams, and will hopefully be going to university in a few months' time. By all accounts I should be excited about the opportunity, and literally every other person tells me how exciting the future is looking for me, but there's literally not been a single moment for the last ~1 year where I haven't worried about the future, particularly with regards to my choice of degree (major)/career. All being well, I will study Biochemistry at university - the subject is one that I am absolutely captivated by, and I feel a real exhilaration that comes with solving problems related to the subject both in and out of my classes. I've never felt more passionate about any subject before, and even the thought of being able to have an impact in the field and study it thrills me and excites me to no end.

Or at least, it did once - my primary issue is that I feel like I am setting myself up for failure and future hardship if I study Biochemistry. Over the last year I've read article after article singing the praises of other more respected fields like Computer Science and Physics, whilst Biochemistry doesn't get even a passing mention. Reading post after post of people saying that ""non-computing degrees are a waste of time"" and that ""computing and physics are the only real sciences"" has driven me to the point where even I am now starting to see just how pointless Biochemistry, a subject that I truly want to be able to love without feeling abstained, is in the grand scheme of things. Look around you and you'll more than likely find countless devices and infrastructure designed by computer scientists and engineers - the very device you're reading this from right now was inevitably built by someone with experience in computing. People seem to sing the praises of computing and physics degrees as being near-perfect - high salary careers, a well-respected role, employability for life etc., whilst I've heard nothing but horror stories about how people have chosen to frantically switch their choice of degree from Biochemistry to literally anything else due to the practically non-existent job opportunities, let alone ones that would provide a level of job security and salary anywhere close to being able to compete with other STEM degrees.

Another big issue that's tearing me apart about this is that it's not even as if I wouldn't be capable enough to study a Computing or Physics degree, at least from my experience - so if my pursuit of Biochemistry does turn out to end in failure, the crushing fact will be that I was capable enough to avoid that situation, but didn't purely for ""following my dreams"" and in the process making the entirely wrong choice. There's a part of me that never stops reminding myself of how idiotic I am for actively choosing to follow a path that leads to less respect and less security in virtually all aspects, when another path could so easily have been taken.

To summarise, I feel like I need advice on how to change my way of thinking, so that I can finally start enjoying a subject that I love rather than feeling guilty or sub-par for choosing to study it. All advice of any kind is appreciated, and if you've read this far, thank you for your time.",10Mar2019,1

59,"I [22] have been with my boyfriend [24] for three and a half years. I've made it pretty clear that I want to be around my late 20's early 30's to get married and that's something he had always said he was fine with. But we went drinking the other day with his best friend since middle school and his best friends wife, all of them are heavy drinkers but me. The wife and I went to the bathroom and she said something along the line of, ""I'm happy X found you, you really make him happy and you guys are cute. I can't wait til he proposes."" I laughed it off and said it will be a few years from now and she slipped and said he was going to propose on our anniversary (2 months from now) I believe her because my boyfriend is pretty open with his close friends and she slipped about one of my birthday gifts before (it was the day of my birthday but before I got my gift).

Here I am now. I love my boyfriend but do I think I want to marry him? No. Do I see myself with him in ten years? No. Three years? Eh no?. Do I still want to be with him? Yes. I love him and I love our life together now, he's a great boyfriend but I don't think he'll be a great husband. Does he have potential to be a great husband? Sure. But we're so young and have a lot of growing to do. Also, I went on a work trip for two months last year and seriously contemplated breaking up because of how much growing we need to do and seeing all the people I was working with and admiring. That's where I wanted to be. I wanted to be like them and I want a life partner like them, I know it may sound shallow, but I want a partner to be at my same level or better, it's a quality I look for because I feel like we can motivate each other and help each other and I'm not a nurturing person. Do I see potential in my boyfriend making it there? Sure but I feel like career wise I'm moving faster than him and I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait for him if I get a crazy job offer that will cause me to leave the city. 

I love my boyfriend I do and when he proposes I'm not sure what to say. I know he wants to spend his life with me. He has expressed it so many time, and I've been honest saying, ""I don't know, we're too young to make this decision and I'm not ready."" And he would say, ""I know, but I just want you to know."" It's super sweet and I love him for it. But I'm not sure what you say when he pops the question cause I don't want to marry him and right now I know that I don't want to marry him because he's not what I want in a husband. But I do love him and I want our relationship to continue and grow and for us to enjoy our time together now. So if I say no I'm afraid it's going to crush him and start conflicts in our relationship because I don't want him to change who he is or rush his life now, I want him to live his life the way he wants and experience it authentically (does that make sense?) But if I say yes I morally feel wrong because I don't want him as a husband and I don't want a marriage with him and I can probably convince him to push the wedding back to when we're at a better age but still it's me telling him I want to marry him also when I don't. What does Reddit think I should do? 

TLDR: my boyfriend is going to propose to me and I don't want to marry him but I do want to still be in a relationship with him, so should I just say yes and push the date of our hypothetical wedding to avoid an argument.. but is that morally wrong?

61,"This is really hard to type because it‚Äôs pretty embarrassing and personal... Basically I had a papsmear done by a female nurse and that was fine. She was very professional and nice and everything. Then I went back in to get my results and the nurse said I had bacterial vaginosis. I was prescribed antibiotics and then I went back to have a follow up appointment. I went to a doctor who was not my usual doctor, and he said he had to have a ‚Äòlook‚Äô to make sure everything was ok. I felt a bit weird about it, but I let him do it because he is a doctor so I trusted him. I don‚Äôt know the process of checking for bacterial vaginosis but he did put his finger inside me... Afterwards, he asked me a lot of questions about my sexual partners, (I was seeing 2 guys at this point) what their occupations are, how old they are, etc. he advised me to break up with one of them, and make sure they didn‚Äôt have multiple sexual partners too because that could be why I got bacterial vaginosis... Fair enough I guess? Then he asked me for my phone number and said he wanted to meet up for lunch when he wasn‚Äôt at work, just to ‚Äòcheck in‚Äô on me (especially about my partners). I felt weird about this too but I gave him my number anyway. I really don‚Äôt k ow why but I guess I still trusted him as a medical professional.

I am someone who hates being told how to spend my free time. I want to spend my weekends doing whatever I want. If I want to volunteer at a soup kitchen, I want to make that decision. If I want to spend all of Saturday just eating sweet potato pies, that should be my decision too. Calling me selfish would be a fair statement.

Most marriages are different, but one characteristic that I think every marriage has is the inability for spouses to do whatever they want whenever they choose. A big part of marriage is making sacrifices/compromises for and with your spouse.

I have already known for a while that I don't plan on having children, and that's for this very reason. I want my free time to myself. But now, I'm starting to think that's expanding to marriage too.

To be honest, I'm 21 years old and I have never really cared to maintain a long-term relationship. I've just never wanted to make such a commitment.

The only problem is that a single life can be very lonely. Friends are great, but they're not as close as anyone you could start a family with.

The reason I‚Äôm torn is that if I do call the Boro I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll be put out of their home or otherwise terribly harmed. Also, people in glass houses shouldn‚Äôt throw stones - I have some shrubs to trim and concrete to patch in my driveway. 

Talking to them is impossible as they‚Äôre convinced I called the boro for their yearly overgrown front and back yard (I did not).

66,"First an obligatory sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile.

Let's start with some backstory; My parents are divorced, they divorced a few years ago and my mom, brother and I all moved about 6 hours away from Dad. Things have been tough but we've made it through so far. I've struggled with school because of the divorce so last spring in March I decided to move in with Dad. Here's where it went wrong. I was horrified to tell my mom because we've always been so close, but the small town life just isnt for me, so I didnt tell her I was moving until I showed up after a trip to Dads with bags and boxes ready to pack. I left within 4 hours and she had no warning, I still hate myself for this. After about 5 months (August 2018) I decided to move back in with Mom and go from there. Here I am 7 months later realizing I never should have left Dads, but I dont want to cause Mom anymore hurt. This small town makes me feel trapped and I know that for my education and for finances I should go back to Dads, but I can't even begin to imagine the hurt this will cause Mom. How can I tell her without her hating me or worse things happening (self harm, suicide)  I cant imagine being the cause of that for my own Mom. What do I do? I can't stay here. Maybe I can convince her to come, but she has a mortgage to pay with her ex (not dad) and refuses to sell the house because shes too naive to realize how much pain ex is causing her. I need some help here guys.",10Mar2019,1
67,"This is extremely lengthy, but it puts everything that's happened with me and this ""friend"" of mine into detail. Mobile formatting too, sorry. 

I have a toxic person that I've been ""friends"" with since early July of last year. Let's call her K. We bonded after a month of talking casually, and had some fun together. I had to wait a bit longer before I really got to see what she was like. 
K developed a crush on me a bit into the friendship, and I was like, wow, that's new. But I didn't accept because it was way too early and I was dealing with personal issues. After that I found out she was depressed and such, had anxiety issues, and suffered some trauma back when she was younger. I had some empathy because I went through and suffer from the same stuff she does, so we became closer. 

She started to make me more and more angry as the months went by, for seemingly no reason. We started to have arguments more. I don't know what exactly lead me to investigate her behavior, maybe from consulting friends about my anger issues, and find out she was toxic‚Äî aka emotional manipulation and guilt tripping, which she did most, but needless to say I was pretty upset when I found out she did these things after friends telling me.

Now, I'm pretty bad at expressing myself and communicating properly, so it took me over 2 months to say this to her. I let her know that her actions were manipulative and a whole dramafest ensued. She calmed down though, and agreed to change. A week into the whole ""new K"" program I told her about my irrational anger issues towards her. She got upset, and unfriended me/unfollowed me from all social media platforms possible. She even told me she was aware she overreacted. I went along with it though, and proceeded to ignore her for the 2 weeks this went on. This brings us to today. 
This sub doesn't allow images so I'll type out the texts her and I exchanged.

K: hi

Me: do you need something or

K: no i was just saying hi

K: and i'm sorry

K: i'll just uh, leave you alone now though because i'm only making this worse for myself. idk why i texted you. have a good night ig

So I thought, okay, that's pretty annoying. But whatever. 
I made the mistake to message her today though, although I just wanted to get things off my chest. It didn't help and you'll see why. Mind I was a bit aggressive. (If actual proof of this conversation is wanted, pm me) 

Me: i'm not messaging you anymore past what i need to say till you get your fucking act together. i've wanted to say so many things but i don't like to be a cunt unlike yourself. 

K: what ? what did i do? 

Me: -explains recent situation-

Me: you're not helping yourself or others. don't try and defend yourself at all, because i don't need this to drag on longer than it needs to. 
(I said this due to her tendency of trying to cover up her actions and not letting me finish what I have to say)

K: i'm not defending myself lol

Me: it was precautionary. i just wanted to say that to get things off my chest.

K: and i know i was just overreacting

Me: passive aggressive as fuck, jesus christ. cya

K: and good ok

K: bye

K: lol

This happened an hour ago. I frankly don't know what to do with myself, due to two reasons.
I want to help this girl. She clearly has issues and I've tried to be as civil and helpful as possible in the past, but I kinda broke apart here. I even talked her out of a suicide attempt. But reason two is that she's manipulative.. I know she's trying to work on herself but she's still hurting me in the process. I'm just stuck in this rut and don't know what to do.

Both my older sister and mother have noticed this and even his homeroom teacher has made a comment about it to my parents. I have attempted to talk to him in private about how he feels and ask whats on his mind. But he tells me that he doesn't know how he feels and there is nothing really wrong with his life. Today though, my older sister went to out with him and our younger sister. She told me that in the car he began to cry and tell her that he feels alone and feels like he has no one he can trust at school. My sister let him cry it out and took him to target to get snacks and get a movie, and when they got home they ate the snacks and watched the movie. She hoped this could help relieve some stress on him for today. All of us are worried about him, and I don't know what to do. I tell him he can come to me for anything he has on his mind, but he seems to just bottle everything up.

72,"Throw away acct. Long backstory but needed for context. 

My GF is driving me up a wall. Long story short she had 3 kids when we met. She was also pregnant with the 4th when we met. She didn't tell me this. I noticed about a month in but decided not to say anything about it. I figured she would tell me when she was ready. Fast forward and she has the baby and I took on her and her kids. 

I moved (unwillingly) into her place which her dad owns so she doesn't pay rent. She does however pay the rest of the bills. She pays them using an allowance from her dad as she does not have a job. This is where shit gets crazy. She hates taking these hand outs from her dad. She does it out of necessity, which I do understand. Shortly after we met I had landed a great job with good pay and benefits. Due to circumstances beyond my control I no longer have that job. Therefore it has been a struggle for the last year. I had planned to buy a house but I just don't have the money for that. I am trying though. 

Here's where most of the issues come in. She says she feels like she's in a constant hell. That I put my prioritys first and her's second. That I give no thought to getting us off food stamps, that I don't listen, that she can only go out when I give her enough money to. The list goes on. Thing is I have the skills to earn much more money than her. I have looked into jobs that she's qualified for and every time it's ""they will just laugh at my resume"" or ""already tried that"". So I tried to encourage her to start a small online business. I have had a few good ideas but never chased them. She puts no effort into it at all. Says she can't do that either. So I again tried looking for some type of work from home job for her. No luck. Same as before. 

I love this woman and the kids with everything I have. I just want to help her but i feel like I've tried everything I know how to try. ",10Mar2019,1
73,"Last night, my family member that lives with me and my family, and IS listed on my car insurance, hit a parked vehicle last night while under the influence of alcohol, and left without reporting or leaving insurance information.

They had given a stranger a ride, and that stranger witnessed it and reported it, since he had just came from our house.

This is my vehicle, my insurance. The driver was given a ticket for failure to control, hit skip, and I believe one other thing. DUI was not mentioned, since the officer didn't see them driving under the influence. They have court Wednesday. I do not have collision, so MY vehicle will not be covered. I do have liability. 

Obviously, the driver could lose their license, be fined a hefty amount, or be put in jail (kind of doubtful). They were planning on getting their own vehicle and insurance....today. And now probably won't have the money for any of that. 

My insurance rate will go up. I'm currently waiting to be employed, have three children, and am pregnant. I can't afford to care for the driver and their child if they lose their license, and their job. Them living with us was supposed to be temporary. A couple of months. 

It's been over a year and a half. 

I am at my wits end with them living here. I love them. But I can't do it anymore.  Help with bills has been minimal, until they got their taxes and I was laid off. We need the extra room for our baby. And we are all they have. They have no one else to stay with. No vehicle of their own. Very little stuff of their own.

I can't just throw them out. But this was my last straw. Driving drunk is absolutely, 100% not fucking okay in my book. Ever. Period. They are obviously upset and apologetic, but I am still upset. And I don't know how much more i can take. All of this affects me and my family. My insurance could be canceled if they are charged with hit skip. I don't currently have the money to start a new policy if that happens.

I feel trapped. I feel like my feelings are wrong. I tried so hard to help. And it is causing me so much stress and resentment. I have no idea what I should do...",10Mar2019,2

About 5 years ago my mother passed away after a LONG battle with cancer. My parents were married for just over 26 years. 3 months after my mom passed away my father was engaged. He never said a thing about this woman and I found out everything on Facebook. 3 months later they were married. My new step mother refuses to talk to me longer than 5 min and has never called or texted me. Now my father is a completly different man than the one that raised me he never talks to me or my siblings and it's nothing but drama when he does. 
Im looking to buy a house now that im trying to be an adult.(at 30 years old lol) So last week I was looking at the housing market and saw my childhood home on the market. My wife asked him when and where they were moving. The response was ""nothing is finalised"". BULLSHIT!!! You dont have your house on the market unless you plan on moving.... today I asked him and got vague answers and after many direct questions about it he finally said ""you'll know once we move"" WTF?!?! is this even my father? He was my best friend growing up. The best father anyone could ever ask for. The kind of father that was always there. He took my mom to dr appointments 12 times a week and was still at every sporting event for all 5 kids. For 13 years he did this. He was the father I want to be and now I cant even get a phone call on my birthday. I got married and instead of saying ""im proud"" I get ""dont ask me for money"" dude... I just want my dad back.

Now, because this kid grew up in a highly religious and strict environment, I have always supported him in what he wanted to be in future, have always let him talk and informed him about the matters he couldn't talk with other adults around him. Was with him whatever he had to live through. As the time passed, the kid started seeing me as the only one that matters for him. To the level that he would rather visiting his father's grave with me instead of his mother. I didn't like that, but didn't say anything. My most repeated advice for him has always been ""do what's best for you, don't give up, don't let people get on your way and decide who you'll be"" kind of thing. I thought that was a good advice, the classic. I still do think it's a good advice, but turns out, the kid had a very interesting way of interpreting this. I'll explain it further. 

His mom called me at 2AM, sounded pretty sad, and asked if I knew what the kid has been up to recently. I told her no, and asked what the issue is. She told me everything, and it made me FURIOUS. I felt horrible, wanted to destroy that little piece of shit. It was too much.

Turns out, the kid asked money from his teachers because he's been saving his pocket money since about a year, so that he could go to somewhere else as soon as he turns 18. Also, I have no idea what the fuck did he tell to his HS counselor, but the poor man geniunely offers him to leave the house and that he can take care of him if he needs to. He constantly lied to our relatives about each other, trying to turn people against one another. I had no idea about any of these, and none of this shit is acceptable. His mother asked for help, and I told her that I'll be on it ASAP.

92,"Alright so this might be long. If formatting is off I apologize as I'm on mobile.

So to start off with some background, I've had a lot of ups and downs in life. I held several jobs and then lose them for some crazy reason (using the restroom too much, layoffs, etc). I'd be getting ready to move away to work when my father got really ill. My wife and I were getting ready to move in together when both of our fathers died within a month of each other. Years ago I was followed home by a random person who got out of their car and criticized my driving before leaving. You get the idea.

Right now I'm in a good spot. Happily married, love my job, bills are being paid, etc. But I have this thing, this issue, that if there's even the SLIGHTEST hint of something going wrong I get messed up. Like not just worried. I get anxious and stressed with knots in my stomach and sometimes crying.

Like I very carefully keep track of my finances, but if something comes up unexpected I start freaking out about not being able to pay for stuff. I always think people are following me if they're driving behind me for an extended periods.  If my wife and I get into a small argument I think she's gonna leave even though she never would. Countless other examples of things just plain going wrong.

And the latest, which triggered this post. I was approached at work recently because there were complaints about my body odor. Now I typically walk a cumulative 2-3 hours a shift so I'm bound to work up a sweat. So I decided to take deodorant with me. So that's fine. Someone accused me of not washing my hands enough and we are in a hospital, so that's a no no. Fine I'll wash them more. A guard relieved me last week and found I had accidentally left a used Kleenex on the desk and he laid into me. I promised it wouldn't happen again but now I'm worried he's gonna escalate it to someone.

So when I check the logs for his shift this morning it says ""talked to X about incident at hospital head office"". Now despite the fact I have no idea who X is, have no idea what the incident in question is, and have no idea of it had to do with our hospital personally or at the company head office, I'm freaking out  I mean maybe it's nothing. Maybe I'm making myself stressed for nothing. But I often feel my life is precarious as I've already mentioned and I can't afford for something to go wrong now.

So is there something wrong with me? Is there anything I can do?",10Mar2019,2
93,"Throwaway account because I'm insecure and want to make sure this is anonymous.

My SO and I have been together for nearly a year and I can confidently say it's a happy, healthy, fulfilling relationship on both sides. We're about to graduate college and enter the work force at the end of this school year. He has a promising position lined up and I'm still searching for work. Neither of us our happy with our current living arrangements, but luckily our leases will both be up in the fall. Given how well things are going and the fact that we spend more nights together than we don't (to the extent that we're practically cohabitating already), I have started to imagine what it would be like to move in together for real.

On one hand, given how much time we spend together, I'm not convinced it makes financial or logistical sense to continue splitting our time between two apartments. In order to account for the increased burden of student debt payments and saving for grad school, I'll be looking for one or more roommates next year. I worry that his frequent presence could cause problems with them, and if I'm going to live with anyone I'd rather it be him, anyway.

On the other hand, he's about to be very comfortable in his finances with his new job and I'm not sure I could afford half of any of the places he's been looking at. Our income disparity hasn't caused problems for us so far because I've made it very clear that I'm not with him for his money and pay my own way wherever I can (though he often 'forgets' to let me know how much drinks/groceries/etc were in his own small way of taking care of me without wounding my pride, I suppose). If we were to live together, he would have to lower his expectations for apartment quality or take on more than his share of the bills. Because of that, I feel like it's unfair to ask him to get a place together, and that I should wait for him to suggest it instead. Whenever we talk about next year, he mentions how excited he is to have his own place, or talks about us in the context of still going over to each other's new apartments. I have no idea if he does this because we haven't talked about taking that step yet, or if he genuinely isn't at that place mentally. We both think young marriage is generally irresponsible for a number of reasons including financial, and I have no idea if his feelings on that matter extend to cohabitation and the more formal commitments that come with that, but that's my predominant fear.

All of my past relationships have been manipulative or flat-out abusive, so I'm still learning how to be in a healthy relationship and communicate in a productive way. He's patient and understanding with me, and I try to be the same with him. If he isn't ready to move in together, I'll be disappointed and I'll understand, but I feel like I'll have to draw some boundaries on the time we spend together for my roommates' sakes and I don't think either of us would enjoy that. I'm terrified to have this talk because of how my exes would have handled these things, but I know I can say anything to this one and I need to know his thoughts soon so I can figure out something else if it's not an option. I just have no clue how to word this and would rather plan ahead and have an adult conversation rather than waiting until I say something dumb while I'm drunk like I usually do when my fears and insecurities are holding me back.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I want to move in with my SO, but I'm afraid of his reaction for a number of reasons including me having bad relationship experience and poor communication skills. How do I go about asking his thoughts on the matter? How do I word the question? How can I make this feel less intimidating for him and myself?",10Mar2019,5
94,"TL;DR at the bottom

My mother has a lot suppressed trauma, as well as BPD and many health issues both physically and mentally. This causes her to get very angry very quickly and sometimes, seemingly out of nowhere. I'm 17, and over the years we've had many arguments that have resulted in her grabbing me by the hair, threatening to pull my peircing out, and verbally abusing me by calling me names and throwing things I've shared with her in private in my face. The next day everything is fine and dandy again and she gets upset when I'm still, ""Hung up on it."" She often gaslights, however I'm not sure she realizes what she is doing. I'm not saying that I'm always perfect, but often times her actions have been very un-parent like and have caused me a lot of anxiety and hurt. I feel like it should be a parent's job to set an example and to show restraint, and that she has often failed as a parent in that aspect. All that being said, she has gotten better as of late (the last few months or so), and I've done my best to forgive her, but it's still hard for me to completely move on.

In addition to all this, there were a number of years where she was very sick and could barely get out of bed. This led to my twin sister and I virtually being all on our own. Other than my grandma staying with us occasionally, we had to do most things ourselves, such as cooking and cleaning. The lack of supervision led to utter chaos and fights between my sister and I were also very common. She used to have extreme anger issues that led to her doing things like shattering a coffee pot over my leg and punching me in the head, as well as being extremely stubborn and petty, which just fueled more arguments. She also seemingly lacks a filter and will often share or say something I wanted kept private to others.

 All of these things combined make me feel like I can't trust my sister or mom, at least not really, and I feel very antsy when put into an emotionally vulnerable situation with either them. This in turn causes me to act cold and uncaring, which makes both think I no longer care about them. I know they love me but it's hard to forget all the things they've said and/or done, and sometimes I actively have to withhold the urge to flinch whenever either of them touch me. I'm not saying I've been perfect throughout the years, or that I'm an emotional wreck, just that it's hard to be completely ""normal"" with them. I have also had many good memories with both of them, which is why I care about building up the relationship again. 

I know the obvious answer would be to sit down and talk, but previous efforts have failed miserably. My mom's mood took a huge turn for the worse and she said that she wanted to kill herself because I, ""No longer love her,"" among other things. My sister also just acted hurt and didn't talk to me for awhile, and we haven't spoken about it since. That being said, is there anything I can do to improve my relationship with them that doesn't involve a direct confrontation? I'm not scared of it going there, I just don't feel like it would be effective, and would just make things worse. Any advice would be greatly appreciated

97,"A brief synopsis should prove useful here. I am an elegant, privately educated, high class citizen. I might wear a monocle, or wing-tipped glasses, and untrimmed hair might cover my neck, but why the indignation? My feathered fedoras (stringy brims and trilbies) and duster jackets are neatly stacked on a rack. I wear fingerless gloves, a Tyrian cloak embroidered with gold, and wield a sword studded with jasper. I view the world through a Freudian lens where weapons are seen as phallic. They are a talisman of classy Otherness. Medieval-oriented escapist pursuits are my *raison d'√™tre*, especially the massively multiplayer online role-playing game ‚Äò*Old School Runescape*‚Äô. I watch only critically acclaimed films, listen to classical music, read Hentai manga, and drink Mountain Dew. These are all part of the lore. I might while away my evening swilling pints of whiskey or the finest wine. In the summer months, I wear cargo shorts or their medieval counterpart - utilikilts. My T-shirts end above my navel, and my trench coat is an evening must. They are part of my semiotic costume. I stick with the mantra that facial hair is synonymous with virility, so my idolatry for wizened sages cannot be overstated. I kneel when addressing my lady. I refer to women as ‚Äúm'dam‚Äù and to men as ‚Äúm'gent‚Äù. When meeting new people, my first question is usually, ""do you read Nietzsche, gentlesir?"". I assure you that this is not spurious profundity. The universe is illimitable and one's place in it is of minuscule duration. My pronunciation is eerily similar to Jeremy Clarkson's. I toss out ""if you will"" and ""indubitably‚Äù, but not without a hand gesture. I scratch my goatee and gently caress my shoulder-length hair. I surround the bath tub with scented candles and a path of red roses reaches my king-sized canopied bed. My girlfriend swirls with excitement as I gently grunt and sweat on top of her, exclaiming, ""Ah yes, goodness gracious, my neurons are firing serotonin!"".

It was not long until the house of cards came tumbling down. There is a side to her that is darker than a moonless night in Africa. She screams with so much vigor that veins bulge at the side of her face. She shouts blue-faced into the void during her ovary-fueled hissy fits. She uses pejoratives such as ""c***"", ""bet*‚Äù, and ‚Äúredbull/monster drinking neckb****"". Her anger is the result of personal slights to which she has taken excessive resentment. ""Archaising does not mean that thou art a master of the quill,"" my girlfriend continues, ""petulant smugness lessens the potential for discourse."" I moved my mug of Da Hong Pao tea closer to my mouth and took a sip, ""You are to stop amply; heed my warning lest the chilling hand of fate grabs and throws you mercilessly to the land of heartbreak."" She was losing sight of her destiny. She was unaware that intelligent beings communicate using superior language - literary professors, critics, masters, screenwriters, authors, novelists, renown writers, scientists, revered philosophers, historians, economists, activists, revolutionaries, et cetera. I was ready to set off into the distance in my Pontiac Sunfire with a Cuban cigar trapped between my lips. I was unmoved by hackneyed jokes, aphorisms, platitudes, and so on. Her lamentations were futile. Her whimpers went unheard. She was cold, feeling and distant. Why? For I was unwilling to sacrifice my individualism. But she yearned and craved for my attention. She was as passionate as ""frogs on a branch"", but as vulnerable as ""doves driven headlong down by a murky tempest."" 

Must a man of my stature have no tolerance for such behaviour? Must I restore order by quelling the metaphorical storm? If so, this requires my girlfriend to, like a snake, shed the skin of her current dogmatic self. If not, then I shall let loose this troglodyte and indulge in generous libations. ",10Mar2019,0

100,"I'm a 21 year old guy, dating a 21 year old girl, who we'll call Luna. I care about her a lot, but she struggles with a lot of things. She's bipolar one, diagnosed since she was 16. She's also been diagnosed with severe depression, as well as having a lot of medical issues. On top of this, when I met her she was in a five-year relationship with an extremely abusive person who she started living with when she was 18 (thankfully with separate rooms). He would push her around and had convinced her that it doesn't count as rape if you're dating the person, and he was entitled to take what he wanted because he ""put up with her shit."" She grew up in a rough household with a drunk abuser of a father, a mother who cried herself to sleep in my girlfriend's bed, and an uncle who had committed suicide who everyone in her family kept comparing her to because ""they were so much alike."" Luna is extremely smart and got fantastic grades in high school, but she also had severe drug and alcohol issues. She has a long history of self-harm, and the most amount of scars of anyone I've ever seen. Honestly, I'd say there's more scar tissue than skin on both of her arms. She's been to mental institutions twice for suicide attempts, once by fifty-two pills and once by a cut down the length of her arm. Needless to say, her upbringing was less than stellar.

We met through our work, where we're both tutors for the school we attend. Over time we became closer, and we hung out more and more. I didn't know anything about her boyfriend except that I thought it was strange that she never wanted to bring him anywhere and would stay out with friends really late to avoid going home. The whole group of tutors were always hanging out, but she and I were attached at the hip at those events. Neither of us had any romantic feelings towards each other at the time, we're both very much the type to not think about other people like that while we're in relationships. The girl I was dating at the time and I eventually came to the conclusion that we wanted different things for the future, so we broke up. Luna helped me through a lot of that, and she became my best friend over time. She also opened up to me a bit about her situation with her boyfriend, and I worked on letting her know how messed up it was for him to be doing that to her. She didn't listen for a long time because she was deep into stockholm syndrome, but I slowly started to get through to her.

One night at a tutor hangout, we both got drunk and ended up kissing. She felt awful afterwards, and I definitely regret it because I've been on the other end a relationship where someone cheated. It was pretty messed up, but it ended up being a good thing because she started to think about her relationship and whether it was something she actually wanted. She told him they were on a break, but still went on a cruise with him (despite all of her friends telling her it was a bad idea) because they had been planning it for a year and they had already paid for it. The boyfriend took the cruise as an opportunity to get her drunk and rape her again, for which I almost took a baseball bat to his head. The only thing that kept me from doing that was Luna begging me not to. Thankfully she told them they were over after that, but she was still stuck in the lease with him. Her parents didn't know anything about the situation and she didn't want them to, so they weren't going to be helping her out of it.

We started dating soon after that. The relationship started very intensely, but not in a sexual sense. She had severe PTSD from everything that had happened with her ex and I'm not a sexual person so I didn't care one bit that she didn't want to do anything. I helped her process a lot of what had happened and why it wasn't okay, and we had a lot of times where I would turn a little too quickly or would say something her ex used to say and she would start to dissociate. She would get a certain look on her face so I knew when it was happening, and she would either think I was going to do what he had done or she would think I was him. I would sit down on the ground and tell her I was going to stay right there, and she would eventually calm down. Sometimes it would get really bad and she would dissociate so badly that it was like she wasn't in there at all, buried so deep that all there was on the surface in a girl sitting on the floor, staring into the distance and rocking back and forth. More rarely, when she got like that she would lock herself in the bathroom and I would have to beg her to open the door because I knew there was something sharp in there she was getting. I'm amazed that to this day, the worst thing that has happened while I was her dissociating and scratching her leg until it bled, which is bad but not as bad as using a blade on herself.

Her ex knew that if he did anything at that point then I would beat the ever-living shit out of him, as well as him going to jail, so he kept his distance for the most part. He would still try to convince her that I was going to cheat on her and he was the only person who would ever stick around to date her, and he really knew how to get under her skin. Thankfully she talked to me about all of it and we worked through her concerns. The relationship progressed pretty quickly, with her coming over and us talking all night long. Sometimes we would stay up until nine or ten in the morning, but she would always end up going back to the apartment because she was still scared of falling asleep around guys, and at least there she could lock her door. I don't remember exactly how it happened, but eventually she asked me to start staying over. Her ex is very non-confrontational with people who he can't shove around and would mostly avoid me and stay in his room if we weren't in Luna's room.

There were a couple times when I had to leave for a weekend, which unfortunately resulted in her hurting herself. I spent every night over at her place, still working through a lot of things with her. We would still stay up late, but working through PTSD turned into working through bipolar episodes. She's a very open person, and will blatantly tell me when she's feeling suicidal. I knew that if I fell asleep before her then there was a good chance she would have a panic attack and possibly hurt herself because she got wrapped up in her own thoughts, so even though she had insomnia because of the bipolar I would still try to stay up later than her. I worked at a popular coffee chain with a siren mascot where I would work opening shifts several times a week, which would require me waking up at 4:30am. My sleep has suffered a lot as a result, averaging about three to four hours a night maximum. Oftentimes, I would just stay up all night instead of going to bed and having to wake up half an hour later. I would spend all of my time with her when I wasn't not working my barista job, and we would hang out when we were working our tutoring jobs. I was afraid to leave her alone when she wasn't sleeping because either she would get in a bad spot or her ex would try to talk to her and get in her head again.

My major is International Business, and as part of that I'm required to do a study abroad. I chose to do it this year, now that I'm a senior in college. I've been afraid of leaving because I didn't want to leave her for so long. I left a couple days ago. My study abroad is for four months in Germany, and that distance and time difference is really rough. What's happened so far is that she's told me how sad she is and how badly she wants to kill herself, and she's been drinking excessive amounts. The first day I was gone she had a panic attack and went to see her psychiatrist. Since arriving, I've stayed up both nights to talk to her because as long as she's on the phone with me, she's not hurting herself.

I'm on the phone with her right now while she talks about her uncle who killed himself. She's taken large amounts of DXM and Gabapentin, and when I tell her how scared I am for her she just laughs and says she's fine. She says I should go to bed, and she's doing greeeeeeat (as she does when she's high and depressed). I don't know what to do because I can't help her like I want to. I can't be there for her 24/7 anymore because I'm six hours ahead and classes start soon, and I can't stay up all night but then go to class all day. I worry about her constantly, and I know it's bad but I'm happiest when she's asleep and I know she's safe. I just want to help her, but I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this long-term? Because I can only do so much, and I can only do this for so long until something breaks.",10Mar2019,1

It was a love at first sight sorta thing and I can't get her outta my head. When I woke up, I almost started crying. Still am on the verge of crying, tbh.

105,"Last night I was at a party were I was a plus one. To my surprise the host was hesitant to invite me, as the way he put it 'I'm on bad terms with him'. Me and the host have had our disagreements in the past, mainly when he broke up with one of my friends and she told me about a bunch of horrible stuff he did to her, but later on I came to learn it was more complicated.

About ten minutes in I asked him what's up, and we went outside and talked. 
He told that we're not going to be friends just acquaintances, because I betrayed his trust and told his ex about a claim he made about doing heroin, which she claimed was false, it wasn't something he told me personally but to a group. He found out that I told her because I told a group of his friends the response, a couple of months later. (No reason to do so, I was just having a bad day)
I understood of all that and can understand why he didn't want to be my friend but it's what  he said after that hit hard.

He told me that I'm an argumentative person who try to contradict people and this makes them uncomfortable. What I call 'debating' and 'conversation' others see as just arguing or making fun of their beliefs.

He also said that I come off as snobbish, rude and a prick.  (I often make jokes, that I think are in good fun) about others actions, like asking others for cigarettes and random hookups.

He said that I make others uncomfortable by asking if their is anything going on at weekends that I could go to. And that people don't want to invite me to things they do so out of politeness. 

I say things that people get upset over an example of this is I was at a band night and I offered to buy a girl a drink who I thought I was getting along well with. (I'm 18 she was 17, I'm one year above everyone in my year).

I'm creepy around girls as well

The conversation was confusing to me as the person who told me this offered to act in my film for me up until two weeks ago, which he then told me he couldn't do it anymore. Which I respected, I asked him to help me find someone else. He told that he considered it a reconcile, however when he informed he couldn't do it anymore I was apparently very manipulative saying that it really bothered me and that he'd have to help me find a replacement. I don't think he understood just how desperate I was, I wanted to start filming in three days.

All of this bothered me because I either felt that my actions are being confused as creepy (in terms of girls) and I don't know what to so about it or that people expect me to be someone I'm not. I'd describe myself as very honest and upfront but also respectful. The thing that mostly bothered me was about the asking on messenger and social media apps if anything was going on, I thought the people I was asking were my friends who would gladly invite me to things but they were talking behind my back. And when I was indeed talking to these people about wanting to go out more they told me to just ask them and they'd invite me.

Overall I don't know what to make of the whole thing, I feel they have a point and yet I also feel really upset, the people who I liked didn't consider me a friend back.",10Mar2019,2

114," So I (15m) have been friends with these same three guys for many years, we are now all in high school. At the start of the year we started hanging out with these other people, mostly girls, and we would always go to one of our houses and just either drink, smoke, or just hangout. I had been dating one of these girls for the majority of that period until about 6 weeks ago, when she told me that she needed to recover from something in her past before she could be in a relationship. I told her that I understood. that really hurt me, and ever since we broke up I've felt as if the group has been intentionally leaving me out. Me and her haven't been talking for the past 6 weeks very much, but yesterday she texted me asking to give her money for carts (marijuana wax). I said yes, thinking that doing this would make me more part of the ""group."" That was until I realized the same night that they were all hanging out without me, even though I had texted my friend who was there if anything was going on, to which he said he would let me know if something happened. This really hit me hard, so this morning I texted her (my ex) saying that I would not give her money for carts because I felt like I was being used for my money and that I wouldn't pay for the carts if I wasn't going to be there. She responded by saying that she had asked lots of people, not just people in our group, for cart money and that I was overreacting. She also said that I had done something to make her feel uncomfortable the last time our group hung out (about a week ago). We had quite a heavy argument and now I'm left feeling terrible, I feel like the rest of the group is going to start like being mean to me and not talk to me because of this argument.

123,"This has been eating me up the past 30~ hours and I need some second opinions on this topic else I may make the wrong choice. Prepare yourself for a long read for some context 

I'm currently in my first year at uni and have been looking with a group of friends for a student house in the second year. This group consists of 3 single students and a pair of partners who'd been living together in shared accommodation since the start of the year. As not to use their real names I'll use Myself, Bert, Susan, Lola (gf) and Gary (bf) for reference.

We all bar Gary met at a boardgames society and quickly bonded as good friends. In the first term we agreed to look for a house together, it was at this point that we met Gary and got along pretty well. At this point I probably should've had red flags at moving in with a couple but I was worried I wouldn't find another group so I went with it.

In November we found a house that we really liked and quickly rushed to put down a deposit on the property, unfortunately after 2.5~ months of radio silence we got the news that it had been let for the year and we needed to look for some place else. Fast forwarding to a few weeks ago I got back onto the grind of finding a new house. After finding a few that we liked the look of we had 5 viewings booked for last week. 

The first viewing was nothing special and we unanimously agreed we'd probably go with one of the next ones, the next was nice but not quite on far with what we'd of had previously. On the Friday of that week Myself, Bert and Susan went to look round the last three properties. These were 6 beds that we'd have to ask another person for. Luckily Gary knew someone who was in the same boat as us so that wouldn't be an issue.

This house we saw ticked all our boxes and more, a short distance from the campus along with being greatly furbished and kept in fantastic condition. The three of us were instantly sold and sang praises of it in our messenger chat. We had agreed beforehand to take pictures of the property beforehand but had forgotten whilst excited about the place. Naturally this was the first thing that Lola asked for and was ""disappointed"" when we didn't supply any, despite confirming the listing pictures as accurate.

Over the course of the next hour, for reasons we couldn't explain at the time Lola blew up in our faces for no justifiable reason over every small detail, telling us to choose our next words carefully as she had been asked by another group to join them. I being an absolute sponge didn't  gauge this as an actual threat and responded with a Karl Pillkington Bullshit Man gif. Which in post wasn't a good idea.

Having been told by the estate agent that another party were viewing the property later that day I was eager to get the ball rolling and put down some deposits, but I couldn't get any movement to happen with the other members of our group which hadn't seen the house. Later in the evening I was sent a text telling me that they didn't like the next party and that we could consider it over the weekend. They also asked if the rest of our party would be okay for a viewing on Monday. When I relayed this to the group however I was immediately attacked for not remembering Lola's schedule proceeding which I wrote what I thought was an unnecessary apology for the days events. Which annoyingly wasn't aknowleged at all.

Anxious to reply to the text I asked if Gary and his friend could do a viewing on Sunday if I asked the estate agent. No reply, assuming they could I and with no cooperation I sent the text anyway. Tensions eased up that evening and the group chat was back to its regular jokey state. I called it quits for the night. 

In the morning I got a text back saying Sunday was no good since they don't disturb Tennant's then. I posted the response in the group chat and outlined what our options were. Either we run the risk of losing the house but getting another viewing so that 5/6s saw it or we pay the deposits now and get it secure. Lola immediately criticized me for ""not learning anything"", being a dick and being a ""pushy cunt"". I got no reply from anyone else either. 

Having worked my balls off to find this house and all properties beforehand I couldn't deal with it and after explaining my reasoning, that it was March and we didn't have a place yet, I still couldn't get through to her. I went for a walk to get my thoughts straight, coincidentally on this walk I bumped into Gary who explained how Lola was often controling like this and outlined his plans to look for a place without her next year and that he'd have a chat with her later, eluding to breaking up with her.

I braced the rest of the group aside from Lola about this and we agreed it was best to look for some replacement housemates which we managed to find very quickly. We didn't know when we'd tell her our plans. That evening we were told by Lola into the group chat that Gary had broken up with her and moved out of their shared accommodation. 

This put a huge spanner in the works as a now emotional wreak Lola was apologizing for her actions and pinned the blame on her boyfriend manipulating her decision making in an attempt to live somewhere else. I don't know how much of this excuse I believe, not much probably, however I think the apologetic nature is genuine. How do I tell Lola that we've found new house mates for next year now? And to what extent should our friendship remain, she was a great friend term one and this whole event was completely out of the blue and unexpected. Have we had a glimpse at the really Lola though?

This whole scenario has left me feeling sick to my stomach, I don't know what I should make of it all. Did I look for new housemates too quickly? Should we consider changing our mind about leaving her out? What do we even say? All I know for certain is that I've never experienced a falling out of this severity and don't know who I should forgive and who I should forget.

I respect anyone that makes it through that wad of a story and I'd appreciate any advice/guidance you have. Thanks.",10Mar2019,1

I've been with the company for about 11 months now and I got short listed for a leadership position. I will be moving into this position within the next 6 months and since this is my first career job, I feel like I'm damn good at what I do. Everything is going extremely well and I make around 80k-100k/year.

My dilemma is whether to go to school and get a degree. I know that if I want to move up past this position I will need credentials. Before this job I was studying computer science but I love being in the business side of things. I don't really care what my degree is because I already make a lot of money and I'm doing what I want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons I **don't** want to go to school:

‚Ä¢ Time - I have to spend time on studying

‚Ä¢ Money - it will cost around 20k which can be used to invest in real estate, side-business, or stocks

‚Ä¢ Effort - I don't know if I want to put in the effort to get a piece of paper when my effort can be geared towards my business and work

‚Ä¢ It goes against my belief - I hate the education system and I feel like I can learn anything on my own without having to pay someone to paraphrase a book. Studying CS I pretty much learned everything myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason I **DO** want to go to school:

‚Ä¢ I can get a higher position in the corporate world - I don't even know if I want to stay corporate

‚Ä¢ I can move to any company smoothly

‚Ä¢ I have a fall back in case my entrepreneurial projects don't work out

In one of my program's classes, the teacher was gone for 30+ minutes so everyone in my graduating class (around 10 people) gathered around this table and started socializing like it was a party.

For the first time in 2 years, some of us finally talked. I mostly stayed quiet. 

All of a sudden, this girl whose known for being an uptight SJW (and with no friends) starts specifically talking about native English speakers from a very specific English-speaking city (the one I'm from, coincidentally) and how she recently met someone from that place who is trying to learn French having moved here just recently. 

She starts talking shit about how cringe worthy they sound when they pronounce certain words, but then it starts getting heavy to the point where it's just straight up mockery and discrimination for their accent.

I started getting flashes of strong anger and annoyance, as I myself have struggled with achieving a decent French accent through years of hard work. I found her comments so rude, and no one really reacted or said anything. 

I started staring her very intently and with a very icy glare. I thought she was nice but I guess not.

139,"Tl;DR I love my best friend but she doesnt love me

I (20m) have known my best friend (20f) for nearly 4-5 years now and have always had a crush on her.

She started dating my best friend before I could ever really get to know her on my own, but because she was with him I became really great friends with her and would spend a lot of my time with her. I started to develop even more feelings for her and honestly started to feel as though I loved her.

She started to spend more time with me because her boyfriend wouldn't, it felt amazing having her around all the time, but got to the point where I didn't want to spend time with anyone else. I know that's bad and unhealthy but she filled me with so much joy and happiness that I got intoxicated by it because I had always felt alone. She made me feel as though I was special and that she needed me, like I needed her.

So end of 2 years ago, she finally broke up with him and I stupidly confessed how I felt about her, she rejected me and I felt as though my heart had been smashed into pieces. It was so hard to hear the words that I fell deeper into depression (I've had depression most of my life) and felt like I couldn't live without her, I started to self harm and just not care about myself at all. I had to cut her off because the pain was unbearable and she started seeing another guy for just physical stuff.

But during the last year I got to know amazing friends and started to be healthier, I lost a bunch of weight and was feeling happier with myself. I got to know what it was like living without her and it was fine, it was hard because she was on my mind most days but I started to live with it.

About 5 months ago, I went to a party and I knew she was going to be there but I wanted to prove I was strong, my friends and her started playing spin the bottle because they said let's do something stupid. I felt my stomach drop and had to leave the room, she followed and started crying telling me she wanted everything to be back to normal and wanted me in her life. So I started talking to her more and hanging out and I felt better hanging out, I tried to maintain the thought of ""don't fall for her again"" but to little avail.

About 2 months ago I was at another party with her and she told me she didn't want a relationship, but we got drunk and I kissed her, then things went further and we got pretty hands on. Then till now we had been hanging out and started to hookup without expecting it, it just felt natural to be with her so I couldn't help myself. Even though I knew she didn't want a relationship, I had told her I did and that she was really special to me.

Everything was feeling different and the things she would say like never wanting to leave my life and that seeing me happy made her happy, felt as if something was blooming. She told me a few weeks ago she was seeing someone else before she started seeing me, it crushed me to find this out but she would say he means nothing, to me that felt like reassurance that something is happening between us but she's waiting to start it. She was still hanging out with him and it felt terrible knowing, but I still had my hopes up.

She told me a few days ago when I was at her house, that she doesnt want to hurt me and she cares about me a lot but can't go into a relationship. So she said that we have to stop seeing each other that way and go back to just friends. I told her I wanted that as well, but I couldn't shake the feeling of wanting more from her. I told her how the things that we did together felt so special to me and that I wished I could do them to her then and there, we ended up doing them and it was amazing.

I feel weak and useless not being able to control myself when I'm around her, but I don't know how to be without her again and I hate it. I feel so much for this girl and all I want is her but I feel like that's never going to happen.

149,"Tl;Dr at bottom.

This gonna be long so here's some context, I am not that close with my family/relatives. They decided 3 weeks ago that they wanted to plan a huge trip to the Philippines. I wasn't there for the planning because I was either at work or in college so I didnt know about this. This trip should be taking place at the start of December 2019 and lasting for 3 weeks.

To paint you a word picture of what kind of person I am, I am 20 years old and I am not that close with my relatives/parents. Not that I hate them or anything, we just never really clicked. I get drained during family events, so I try to avoid them, usually having to go to work is excuse enough. I'm considered the most introverted amongst all of my relatives. I just have small anxiety that I never talked about with anyone.

2 weeks ago, during dinner, my older brother (28 years old) and younger sister (19 years old) were discussing about budget and the costs of plane tickets and they thought I knew already. Plane tickets right now costs 1,000-1,200$ this took my by surprise because they were talking as if everyone had to pay for their own tickets. (Lo and behold, ofc we had to) My sister had a financial plan ready which got me impressed on cause she is only a student. 

My siblings then asked me what was my plan. I had no prior knowledge about this and I was put on the spot. I told them I didnt know about the trip, but I was most likely not to go. My siblings always respected my space and choices (I'm considered the most introverted amongst my relatives). They were cool about it and I offered to take care of the dogs during the 3 weeks while they were gone, which my brother was down for. I thought that was the end of the discussion and I thought to myself  ""cool, I dont have to spend a grand on a trip that I wont enjoy and I can spend those 3 weeks working and saving more money during holidays"".

Today, my parents caught me off guard and said that I am obligated to go. (Fun.... ) a tldr of the discussion was that they expressed it might be the Last BIG trip for the entirety of the family and our cousins together that's in good health (my parents are in their late 60s).  They made the argument that they do not want to make a trip out of a bad cause, just like last time 7 years ago when I was 13y/o , where I had to attend my mom's dad funeral. 

I told them I don't want to relunctantly spend a grand on a trip I won't enjoy. It's too much people and I'd rather just work. Probably my fault that they got flustered because of how worded it / I prioritized my work over them, but I'm just not that close to my relatives as I am with people I spend my time with. So I expressed that I don't want to spend more than 1k of Canadian bucks and 3 weeks away from here. My dad decided to exclaim money isnt important but that family is. Then he claimed that this might be the last trip with them before they move at a nursing home. This obviously made me guilty. (Yay, a guilt trip ...)

The fact is, I told them I'm not comfortable with the idea spending 3 weeks away when I'd much rather just work and save money. They didnt seem to get that. ""Family first. Family is important."" They want me to go because allegedly every single of my relatives are going. That means I'm the only one in my immediate family that's in Montreal for 3 weeks. All I thought to myself was ""holy shit that's at least 20+ heads"". 

I'd like to remind you guys I'm not close with my parents, but I am fond of them. We never had a heart-to-heart but I do something nice for them once in a while (Dinner, Shopping with mom, sharing a beer with dad, all the little things)

On one hand, my parents are certainly right, that this might be the last trip ever we can have that's all in good health. I'm with all my relatives, and I can just spend most of my time to myself and go sightseeing or bringing books that I didn't have time to read back home. And it's only 3 weeks right ?

On the other hand, I am absolutely relunctant to spend over 1 grand to go to a 3 week trip where I'm more than likely to get mentally drained. 1 grand is 50% more money than what I currently have right now (Family first ,amirite). I know for a fact I'd much rather work than spend my time in heatwave hell.

I'd like some insight and thoughts. Advices on what to do is appreciated because I'm too conflicted or too much is on my mind.

Tl;Dr: not fond of the idea of spending 1 grand and 3 weeks on a trip that I wont enjoy with a huge amount of people. But might be last one in good spirit with family/relatives.",10Mar2019,1

I might wear a monocle, or wing-tipped glasses, and untrimmed hair might cover my neck, but why the indignation? My feathered fedoras (stringy brims and trilbies) and duster jackets are neatly stacked on a rack. I wear fingerless gloves, a Tyrian cloak embroidered with gold, and wield a sword studded with jasper. I view the world through a Freudian lens where weapons are seen as phallic. They are a talisman of classy Otherness. Medieval-oriented escapist pursuits are my *raison d'√™tre*, especially the massively multiplayer online role-playing game ‚Äò*Old School Runescape*‚Äô. I watch only critically acclaimed films, listen to classical music, read Hentai manga, and drink Mountain Dew. These are all part of the lore. I might while away my evening swilling pints of whiskey or the finest wine. In the summer months, I wear cargo shorts or their medieval counterpart - utilikilts. My T-shirts end above my navel, and my trench coat is an evening must. They are part of my semiotic costume. I stick with the mantra that facial hair is synonymous with virility, so my idolatry for wizened sages cannot be overstated. I kneel when addressing my lady. I refer to women as ‚Äúm'dam‚Äù and to men as ‚Äúm'gent‚Äù. When meeting new people, my first question is usually, ""do you read Nietzsche, gentlesir?"". I assure you that this is not spurious profundity. The universe is illimitable and one's place in it is of minuscule duration. My pronunciation is eerily similar to Jeremy Clarkson's. I toss out ""if you will"" and ""indubitably‚Äù, but not without a hand gesture. I scratch my goatee and gently caress my shoulder-length hair. I surround the bath tub with scented candles and a path of red roses reaches my king-sized canopy bed. My girlfriend swirls with excitement as I gently grunt and sweat on top of her, exclaiming, ""Ah yes, goodness gracious, my neurons are firing serotonin!"".

It was not long until the house of cards came tumbling down. There is a side to her that is darker than a moonless night in Africa. She screams with so much vigor that veins bulge at the side of her face. She shouts blue-faced into the void during her ovary-fueled hissy fits. She uses pejoratives such as ""c***"", ""bet*‚Äù, and ‚Äúredbull/monster drinking neckb****"". Her anger is the result of personal slights to which she has taken excessive resentment. ""Archaising does not mean that thou art a master of the quill,"" my girlfriend continues, ""petulant smugness lessens the potential for discourse."" I moved my mug of Da Hong Pao tea closer to my mouth and took a sip, ""You are to stop amply; heed my warning lest the chilling hand of fate grabs and throws you mercilessly to the land of heartbreak."" She was losing sight of her destiny. She was unaware that intelligent beings communicate using superior language - literary professors, critics, masters, screenwriters, authors, novelists, renown writers, scientists, revered philosophers, historians, economists, activists, revolutionaries, et cetera. I was ready to set off into the distance in my Pontiac Sunfire with a Cuban cigar trapped between my lips. I was unmoved by hackneyed jokes, aphorisms, platitudes, and so on. Her lamentations were futile. Her whimpers went unheard. She was cold, feeling and distant. Why? For I was unwilling to sacrifice my individualism. But she yearned and craved for my attention. She was as passionate as ""frogs on a branch"", but as vulnerable as ""doves driven headlong down by a murky tempest."" 

Must a man of my stature have no tolerance for such behaviour? Must I restore order by quelling the metaphorical storm?

153,"Advice needed on a combination of graduate school, parent's divorce, and my choice of summer jobs.  


&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I've been struggling with the aforementioned issues lately. The explanation is pretty fucking  lengthy though. I have the longest TLDR of all time at the bottom if you don't want to spend five minutes reading.  


&amp;#x200B;

\*Parent's divorce -\* My parents finally divorced the semester before I graduated college (my sister is in her second to last year of undergrad nursing). As of right now we're finishing up selling the house and my parents now live apart (but around an hour away from each other). I don't really feel guilt about the fact that they divorced. However, I do feel a strong responsibility to help out one of the parents who is really not equipped for this (has a lack of hireable skills after years out of the workforce, is reclusive, and doesn't have many friends outside of the family). I'm torn though for a few reasons. Number one, I am atrocious at helping people with anything emotionally related. Number two, said parent is probably one of the hardest people to get along with that I have met. Number three, I am really concerned for their physical and mental health and am not equipped to really deal with that. I'd appreciate if you read on here since all three of these subjects tie together at the end.  


&amp;#x200B;

\*Grad School -\* I have pretty much obtained a software engineering degree. I dislike the majority of my undergraduate degree intensely. Luckily I found two subjects that I enjoy, Mathematics and Statistics. As of right now I've been accepted to the school I wanted to attend. However, I'm having second thoughts. Mostly about my own competence and the possibility that I can really succeed. I've never been great at math. I had an aversion to it coming into undergrad, but my mind was changed by introductory stats courses (and conversations with professors about applications and theory). I've now completing my Math and Stats minors and enjoying all of the classes. Real Analysis and Statistical Machine Learning are two standout favorites. The problem I'm running into here is that I am emphatically not confident in my ability to actively remember and understand items on some homeworks. I'm getting wicked frustrated when I forget or miss basic math tricks and foundational concepts that were taught in previous courses when they are applied to problems that I'm doing now. Long story short I'm starting to really doubt my ability to truly succeed in graduate school. At the same time I enjoy reading about the subject, enjoy doing problems, and really enjoy it when I am given the opportunity to do independent research (for example I'm investigating predicting ocean wave conditions based upon regional weather, and I'm pumped for the project). As a competent software engineer who really enjoys (but is not good at) mathematics and statistics, is it a good idea to go to grad school instead of getting a job in an industry that I dislike? As an addendum I do have enough money to pay for it between scholarships, loans, and personal funds, so finances are not an issue thank god. I am infinitely lucky to be in this position.  


&amp;#x200B;

\*Summer Job -\* Lastly there's this. I've been running the sailing team at the school for a while and I've taught sailing as a summer job for two summers. I was offered an assistant head coach position in a really great spot that allows me to earn a decent amount and spend my ""last free summer"" on the water. The problems here are threefold. Number one, I will have to live with the aforementioned parent having an extremely difficult time. This is good because I get to help her out. It is an issue for the same reason, as that will be guaranteed to emotional trauma right before grad school. Number two, I could try to get a better job, but it'd have to be in software on a co-op basis / salary. This would also require a bunch of work and interviewing as I would have to narrow it down to companies where the work I do is valued in some way (unlike two of my three previous co-ops). This could be awful, and it also gives me the option to not live with my parent (good and bad for the same reasons as above). Number three ties in with the question, should I just skip graduate education and get a job that I'll probably dislike for the sake of being an adult and earning money?|  


&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TLDR :\*\* Parents split up as I graduate from undergrad in a major (software engineering) I have a serious dislike for. I have the option to go to graduate school in the fields I am interested in but am not good at (statistics and mathematics). the combination of degrees has great potential (and I would enjoy it more), but I am starting to have serious doubts about the possibility of success. Lastly because of graduate school I need a summer job. I have been offered a decent paying sailing coach position that would allow me to have a great summer (and time to study to prep for grad school), but I would have to live with the parent in the divorce who is going to have the most issues getting on their feet, which will be guaranteed emotional trauma on my part. The alternative is to get a job I will probably dislike somewhere else. How much responsibility is on my shoulders for my the well-being of my parent? Is it worth it to go to grad school? Is it more selfish of me to spend a summer not doing technical work and not seeing the struggling parent, or get a great job and being present for all of the trauma that is on the way? I just really need advice....or people to talk to.",10Mar2019,1
154,"I'm a female and I have basically been alone all my life. My parents used to show me love when I was a child but as I got older they stopped telling me that they loved me.

My mom has never called me beautiful and I feel so rotten in her presence.

I want to stop talking to TD but if I do I will lose my friends in the process because they\`ll just follow him and would literally make fun of me for taking a stand.

159,"(Sorry this is kind of long)

One of my Managers recently told a whole shift of people not to listen to one of the other managers because he‚Äôs autistic and doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. Nobody at my store knew he was autistic prior to her announcing it out of the blue. Recently this same manager hired a girl to work in kitchen. Before she even got there this manager was telling everyone that she was ugly and wasn‚Äôt allowed up front because she didn‚Äôt want the customers to see her (this manager is the one who hired the girl in the first place). Once the new girl got there she started screaming at her, like I haven‚Äôt heard her scream at anyone like that before. I hadn‚Äôt worked with the new girl for a few days but today when I was counting drawers she came in. My manager came in the office laughing and telling me about how she told her to stand in the back and not to go towards the front because she doesn‚Äôt want customers to see her. My manager seems extra short with her for no reason at all. Today I found out that she has a learning disability (I was trying to cheer her up by telling her she was doing really good in kitchen and she told me it takes her a little longer to get things because of her learning disability. The manager she lured as being autistic was recently fired like right before she hired the new girl. Tom (the old manager) was constantly a target for her, like every chance she could she alienated him. To get him fired she said another girl and I said he was inappropriately touching people (even though we didn‚Äôt and he wasn‚Äôt). Long story short this manager constantly lies and targets vulnerable people. She makes everyone in the store hate one another and has made this new girl her new favorite target. I feel like she hired her just to torment her. We tried bringing up her telling everyone Tom is autistic to the district manager but nothing was done about it. When we brought up how she lies and bullies people nothing was done again. I don‚Äôt know if I should confront her and find a new job or just find a new job and leave it as that. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do, going to work just makes me sad now because the new girl is trying so hard and the manager bullying her makes everyone uncomfortable and upset but she gets anyone who says anything about her fired so if I speak up idek if it‚Äôll get taken seriously ",10Mar2019,1

My friends tell me how ugly and shit I am. They told me to go through with it when I was 16 but I was too afraid so was institutionalized instead when I told my parents. Now they continue to give me that idea, and my girlfriend does too.

She keeps hitting me or yelling at me when I forget something or do something wrong even though I have a lot of stress between working and being a math major so I sometimes forget to get the right stuff from the store. Last time she threw a knife at me and made me cry because I forgot to get her new tampons on the way home from a 16 hour day.

She keeps telling me how shit I am as a person whenever I do these mistakes and it pushes me to cry almost every night. I try to work hard and be a good bf but I can't necessarily always keep everything in mind and deal with everything that's on my plate.

I'll be getting my bachelor's in chemistry and will soon start applying to places so I can start work or an internship over the summer while I work on/ write my final research paper. There's a parade on St. Patty's day and people usually walk down the street all day long near my restaurant and we usually make jello shots and green beer and all that mess and sell it for 5 bucks. I have worked this day every year for five years and because they insist on making everyone work on it we have way too many people on with hardly anything to do because it's not super crazy busy like they always think. And every year I make less and less money. Last year I worked from 10 to 8 and left with 25 bucks, making 2.15 an hour mind you. I asked the assistant manager if I could have it off this year to go on a camping trip since my spring break starts that week but we got a new general manager yesterday. And now he's making the schedule and says that I didn't ask off even though they have it blocked off so you can't and I've asked the other manager several times.

163,"So I'm a junior at my University and last semester I met this girl in a club I'm in and I never talked to her. Her Beauty is intimidating so I just basically ignored her. Around December she tried getting me to go to an event a few hours away from campus and said she wanted to get to know me better but I had to bail 30 minutes before we left because I ate some bad subway. She also kept trying to talk me into going on a  Trip with some mutual friends and I lied and said I couldn't afford it. Fast forward to this semester I tried to pretend I never noticed her around campus because I felt bad about bailing twice on her.


 Finally a few weeks ago I saw her in the hallway and talked to her and we have been texting on and off since. One day I finally asked her through text if she wanted to eat some time at  one of the campus dining halls. She replied with I'm always down to eat together as friends,or did you mean something else? And out of nervousness I said"" ehh I just get bored of eating dinner alone"". So our club finally started back up and I tried to ignore her  again after the whole friends thing.


 After our meeting she came up to me and asked if I could walk home with her because it was dark and snowing. I said sure. It was a nice walk and we just talked about our fields of study and she said she'd like to eat together sometime and I stopped  at the door of her lobby and said"" well see ya later and she then asked if I could walk in with her so I did. She then went into her dorm and I left. I messaged her a week ago  and told her I hope she had a good spring break and she thanked me and said she's been stressed and she's glad I care
How should I take this?

I literally ignored her forever then when I showed interest at first she pulled the whole just friends thing but then asks me to walk her home? It's confusing.

166,"Sorry if this post is way too long. I'm confused, stressed and just depressed about this whole situation that's going on with me at work

&amp;#x200B;

So let me start from the beginning, Iv'e been working retail as a cashier at my store since thanksgiving of last year. I was still learning and they threw me on a register by myself thanksgiving day (yes i was working that day.) when my manager tells me that I need to scan faster and keep up because they keep having to help me over and over when I'm still trying to learn how to do everything on the computer. I blow this over my shoulder as it was a stressful day and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to the February of this year, We have 5-6 different customer leads in the store, My coworkers usually gather around or hang out when nobody is in the store or is still shopping and talk to others. I thought I would get to try and talk to some people as i'm socially shy and don't like talking as much, I walk over to where my other coworker's are standing and I ask ""what's going on?""  as I just hopped into the middle of the conversation. Coworker A tells me it's an A B conversation and that I have no reason to be in it and the customer lead tells me to go back to my register and stand at the front and wait for customers. at this point I was a bit shocked that they were so rude. All my customer leads were like this and being rude to me for no reason everyday.

I do nothing except scan items and on rare occasions ask for help if something doesn't scan or a coupon on something isn't working right. I guess that isn't enough for them, I told my store manager about this and she said she would talk to the individuals I mentioned. (she didn't.)

Flash forward to today, I told someone I would switch schedules with one of my coworkers because they couldn't make it into their shift. It was around 7 AM and I get drove to work by my parents and they had no problem taking me until around 10 PM they texted: ""My schedule has been switched you're gonna have to redo your normal shift and ask someone else to cover"" SO I call the store, NOBODY picks up. I text one of my coworkers that were in the store at the time and they said they would let one of the managers on duty know so that they would have an opening cashier tomorrow.

 I come in today, 1 PM to 9 PM and I get immediately bagged on by one of my customer leads arguing with me about how I didn't show up to my morning shift and that she had to open all morning by herself until 9 AM (we open at 7 am.) I tried to explain to her what happened and she kept cutting me off and kept arguing with me and then she went to my other coworkers and started talking to them about it and laughing about it, but I didn't find it funny as she wasn't saying it in a joking manner. 

What am I doing wrong? I constantly do everything I can to help my coworkers in the store and all I do is get treated terrible by them, and it's only me. They don't treat anyone else like the way they treat me. 

I'm tired of working everyday 8 hours a day trying to satisfy everyone and make sure nobody gets upset and every single day I dread going into work because I know it's just gonna be another day of constant hatred between my coworkers and customer leads.

167,"First time doing this and on mobile so forgive me for any wrongdoings also let me know if I'm on the wrong subreddit a little lost. 

So a little backstory, we got together straight after she broke with her ex (also old friend) which is not the smartest idea but whatever. I agreed to keeping the relationship between us and our families so at least someone knew. This started about half way through 2018  year 12 and about 3 months in she went out clubbing (I'm not old enough) and ended up sleeping with my best mate( don't know if anything happened probably did but... Again shouldn't have stayed but I was already so emotionally attached) he let me know not her. I said I forgave her but it's always been on my mind. About 5 months in I went to a party without her and she stayed at her house messaging another guy and myself. The next day she comes to pick me up and I noticed scratches on her legs which I assumed were from her cat, but they weren't. She ended up cutting herself and so I've never really enjoyed her leaving my company or going clubbing with friends which is pretty shit. 

So a couple days ago she and I were laying in bed and she was being a little secretive over her texts so I asked who she was messaging. She replied her brothers fiance and another girl, so I didn't really care too much. About an hour of her just messaging and not even acknowledging me I ask what she's talking about, she says she is talking about personal shit and doesn't want to tell me(which has never happened before except for when she slept with my best mate) so I got worked up a bit and said can you please show me I don't understand why it's so important ( which was probably wrong of me) and we got into an argument about me not giving her enough freedom, both cried a lot and she ended up leaving and going to hers. That has been pretty much the end of it she has only been messaging my cousin who lives with me and so I packed her shit up and helped it into her car when she came ( only came because she thought I wasn't there) grabbed her shit and left. 

I can't seem to shake the feeling of her from my head or having her company because she's been here everyday for a long time. Also my cousin said that when they went out clubbing she told him I wasn't comfortable with him going out with her and told him I didn't like how he treated girls which both times is BS but whatever and my aunties bf even asked him if they had saved because she wouldn't stop looking at him. That's just got into my head and I don't know what to do at all. Suicide seems like such a good option just to escape all of this but I know I can't do it. So, advice?

It isn‚Äôt because I just don‚Äôt want to go, but I‚Äôm afraid of getting the regular treatment I do in school at an event where I‚Äôm supposed to be happy and look nice.

My parents made me switch to my current school in pursuit of having more time to practice a sport I love to do three school years ago (8th grade, I am currently a sophomore). I‚Äôm a introverted and quiet person but I still enjoy having people to talk to so for two school years I tried very, very hard to make friends with people at school. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm a quiet person who can‚Äôt just think of a response very fast, so I often get talked over in group conversations. In addition, my interests/way of being are different than the general population at my school which makes it hard for me to relate, and I can‚Äôt really laugh at stupid jokes everyone else finds funny because I don‚Äôt laugh easily (and my fake laugh fucking sucks).

This year I still make some effort to talk to the kids at school, but I basically gave up on everything because even though I put in my all in the past, it feels like they just don‚Äôt want to talk to me. Nobody ever picks me for partners or group work, asks me if I want to hand out after school, asks for my social media unless I ask for theirs, and nobody ever talked to me unless I come up to them (or unless certain people want to pull a mean girls thing and give out a fake compliment where they really mean it as an insult). My mental morale has greatly depleted and I‚Äôve lost a lot of confidence in myself as a social being. I don‚Äôt think I will ever to truly make friends at this school, and I‚Äôm completely torn with either having a social life, or pursuing everything I‚Äôve been working for since I was seven years old.

This affects my decision to go to prom because I am sick and tired of being left out of everything, especially when I try to join in. I now pack lunch and sit in my school‚Äôs library studying to keep my grades up because I al always talked over or ignored at lunch anyways. I hate the treatment I get and want to avoid it at all costs. If not for this, I would want to go to prom but I don‚Äôt want to because I don‚Äôt want to sit alone the entire dance, which would probably happen, or I stand with the group of gorls from my grade and then they talk about what little I did behind my back after prom. My Mom and Dad want me to go to prom ‚Äúto hang out with my friends‚Äù but if they treat me like this do I still call them friends? I know that‚Äôs a hard no but I have to make it seem like to my parents that I‚Äôm not a loner so that‚Äôs what I call them. I would rather sit at my house and play video games online with my internet friends (who actually talk to me!) than go to prom and receive the regular treatment. How do I convince them to let me stay home WITHOUT telling them that nobody would talk to me?

I guess this also turned into a post about my ‚Äúsocial life‚Äù‚Ä¶ what should I do?",10Mar2019,1

She keeps telling me how shit I am as a person whenever I do these mistakes and it pushes me to cry almost every night. I try to work hard and be a good bf but I can't necessarily always keep everything in mind and deal with everything that's on my plate.

176,"This story involves two of my best friends: Emma and Olivia. We all go to the same college and became close our freshman year. We are now juniors. I realize that this whole situation might seem petty, but I don‚Äôt really have anywhere else to go for advice. 


TODAY

So I spent most of today running errands with my friend Emma. We had a really great time. When we got home, I had Emma‚Äôs phone in my hand and I went to her messages. (I know that this is not a cool thing to do, and I should not have done it). I scrolled through her messages with Olivia. I don‚Äôt know why I decided to do this. I guess I was curious. I really wish I hadn‚Äôt. 

As I was scrolling, I saw a conversation about me. Emma was telling Olivia about a conversation Emma and I had earlier this week. 

THE ORIGINAL CONVERSATION

I remembered this conversation well because I could tell that Emma was acting weird afterwards.

Basically, the conversation was me asking Emma about the ethical standards of industry she‚Äôs going into. (For reference, she‚Äôs in digital art - and my question was what the ethics are when it comes to tracing reference photos.)

I was only asking this out of genuine curiosity. Especially because in my major ethics are constantly being brought up - as I mentioned to her during our conversation. 

I‚Äôm a naturally curious person and sometimes I get pretty excited about asking questions, which I think comes off kind of strong. But, I would expect my best friend to understand and accept that about me. 

Our conversation ended when I could tell Emma didn‚Äôt really want to talk anymore. Which honestly, is just a tough feeling to get from your friends. 

As I said earlier, I could tell that Emma was acting weird after this conversation,  but I also knew she was stressed from classes so I chalked it up to that. 

THE TEXT MESSAGES

Ok now fast forward to me seeing the text messages today. Emma told Olivia that they needed to talk because I had hurt Emma‚Äôs feeling really bad. Emma tells Olivia that I was accusing her of stealing other people‚Äôs art. She even adds that I thought this because of my major. (This really got to me because that was the exact opposite of the point I was trying to make). Olivia responds in support of Emma - which I can kind of understand because DUH she doesn‚Äôt steal other people‚Äôs art. 

Here‚Äôs where I was hurt in reading this: I have had a conversation with Emma in the past about coming to me when something I do hurts her in any way. She is a sensitive person and I‚Äôm pretty blunt - but I would never want to hurt any of my friends. I have told her this in the past and she agreed to tell me when things like this happen. It also bothered me that she would ever even think that she steals her art or that my major makes me better than her in any way. I was asking out of genuine curiosity and I thought she would have the answer. That‚Äôs it!

THE DILEMMA 

What I really need is some help figuring out what I should do from here. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should even bring this up with Emma because I know I shouldn‚Äôt have seen the messages in the first place. But at the same time, my feelings got hurt and so did hers. I think it could be a good thing to talk about. 

Any advice appreciated. 

TLDR 

I read my friends text messages about me (without permission). She was telling our other friend that she was hurt by something I did. I didn‚Äôt do this intentionally and am hurt that she didn‚Äôt reach out to me first. What should I do?",10Mar2019,1

184,"A friend of mine recently got hurt. She had an appointment to get the injury looked at again next week. Her injury has gotten worse over time but until she saw her doctor and found out if this would prevent her from going back to work or a simple fix she was keeping it private. It's a scary injury for her and the idea of the test and possible fixes have literally kept her up at night. Well her HR decided to reach out to her PCP and request an amended work release so she could do light duty. Trouble was not only did this light duty involve use of her injury her doctor was not aware the reason behind her next visit and my friend had no clue her HR was contacting her PCP. She then got a nasty gram from her HR because she declined the modified work citing there was ""no medical reason for her to be unable to do this duty"" and she would risk losing her job by not doing it. Now shes frantically moving up her appointment and get a note stating the amended note was made in error due to unknown factors. 

My question is is what her HR did legal? I know HR can reach out to doctors to confirm notes or clarify notes but I have never heard of them being able to ask the doctor to amend a note on behalf of an employee without the consent of the employee.

185,"I graduated with a master's degree around 3 years ago. I was never good with exams/tests and that coupled with my own laziness I was a pretty underperforming student. It took me about 8 months to get a job and by that time all of my peers had one. But I got a great job and I'm getting great reviews from my managers for the past 2.5 years.

I came across the information of the job offers received by my classmates in masters'(whole another story about how I got it, don't want to make this post longer if anyone's interested to know about it I'll answer in the comments). I found that a majority of them had a salary 10 to 15 percent lower than mine.

I wish I never got that info but since then I feel like I don't deserve what I have. They were all definitely much smarter than me and definitely worked harder. Some of them are changing jobs now and a 10 to 15 percent increase in salary is the norm in my industry when you switch jobs so they might have reached my level just now.

Since it's been a couple of years at my current job and though I really like it, I want to try out what else is available and maybe get a better salary since you get major increases only when you switch jobs. But I have zero motivation whenever I think about their salaries. I feel like I punched way above my level already and it makes me queasy to even think about getting more than them again.

I do have some self-esteem issues since I was a kid but this is getting too much when it's preventing me from going forward in my career and life. Can you please give me some advice to get out of my own head?

186,"I created a Reddit account specifically to ask about this possibility. Sorry in advance for the length. I (22F) started volunteering at a women‚Äôs shelter in town this month. I helped out in the kitchen for the first time today, and I got to know the other volunteers in our 4 hour shift. One of the other volunteers (23F), works there regularly with her Aunt. So this girl, let‚Äôs call her A, is absolutely gorgeous, and she‚Äôs completely barefaced, hair in a bun, homemade apron on, absolutely stunning, super fit. We stood next to each other, serving dinner one plate at a time. As the line went by, I was trying to get to know each of the guests and start trying to remember all these new faces. During little breaks, A would ask me questions about myself and I‚Äôd ask them back, we chatted, etc. She is super sweet and I could tell all the guests really enjoyed her food and her time spent with them. As the three of us (me, A, A‚Äôs aunt) cleaned up and wrapped up leftovers in the kitchen, she was loudly telling her aunt that she started a new spin class, she told her the name, the crossroads, and even said that it was at 8 am and full of women roughly her age. That was the first and only time she had spoken up in the kitchen, completely unprompted. I didn‚Äôt really butt in or anything but I was right next to them we were all handing stuff to each other, I was just politely listening along. Now at the time, I didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt think twice about this, I was really pumped about this shelter and went from that situation to sitting with one of the directors discussing the future of nonprofits for an hour, it was a really amazing conversation so that‚Äôs what I was focusing on. Skip to 4 hours later, I‚Äôm home, smoking a joint in my backyard, looking at the stars and listening to music, totally relaxed, clear headed, and smiling about my lovely day. I jolted up straight and thought, WAIT. Was she making sure I knew when and where I could see her next?? I can be pretty socially unaware at times, subtleties and hints go right over my head.

187,"I fucked up.  And I only realized it now.

&amp;#x200B;

I (M15) was once friends with this girl, we'll call her T(15F), and I was being friends with her around October and November 2018. This mainly due to my actions. When we first went back to school, we were still pretty close friends from last year, though not as I would have liked it. It remained that way for awhile, though it was hard to hang out with her and feel like an equal due to her intelligence, I still wanted to stay close to her. Early into the school year and were told to do a project along with two of our other friends. An impropmptu speaking where two of us would speak in gibbrish while the other two translated what we were saying to the class. We were going through the usual motions of arguing since that's a common theme with us. Eventually I decided to suggest that we pretend to do a lover's quarrel kind of deal, to which she respoonded,

&amp;#x200B;

""I would never go out with you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was mildly surprised when she said that but I was able to keep up my calm and go along with the situation, eventually we did the project and I tried to put those words into the back of my mind. Which led to those words taunting me for a good amount of time, those words had struck me in a way that I stopped talking to anyone for the whole day, I came to the conclusion that maybe it was because of her attack on my ego that was the cause of my pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the more time passes I begin to change in my mannerisms towards her, sure we would still argue and do light teasing but I was more quickly to agree with her on her stances, as well as more willing to help her when a problem arises, even with some issues regarding helping with artwork, something I really detested doing. I also began to look at her actions differently, her constant arguementative behavior that I found respectable if mildly irritating at times turned into her being unyielding to her stance and knowing what she wants, the fact that she called people out when she helped them became, to me, her giving people the equivalent of tough love. If she asked for my stance on something I'd be much quicker to agree, and while we still snarked at times, I would more often than not point the joke towards myself just to see if she would laugh more. Said jokes were usually hit or miss. And I even admitted to myself that yes, she was pretty.

&amp;#x200B;

By September, I came to the conclusion that yes, I was smitten with T. And I enjoyed thinking of the what-ifs and hated the way my thinking caused me to act around her, though I thank her for influencing my study habits after a mutual friend told me she liked guys who were smart. I even let her borrow a book after I finished it and she really liked said book that I let her keep it, I even joked that I would give it to her if she wanted. I probably would have given it to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually it got so out of hand that I began to do anything just to see her laugh or smile, it was cute. Though I began to see less and less of it as time went on. Apperantly I had become somewhat narcissistic in my attitude that school year, though this was mainly because I consistenly joked about being superior. If anyone was superior in the classroom it was her. By October i had planned my undoing.

&amp;#x200B;

I would confess to her on the day before sembreak so if it turned awkward I could heal for the week instead of sitting in school feeling like shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

And so I confessed in the morning.

And she just said okay, followed by stating that she wasn't allowed to date.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hurt, and I didn't really want to see her for the rest of the day so I avoided her. Eventually lunch came and I was greeted with a sight that forced me to believe what I do believe. The book that she had consistently kept around her most of the time, the one bookmarked to a chapter she read religiously, was left on an empty chair, not even the chair where I sat at everyday. My mind began to come up with lots of reasons as to why she'd return the book like this. In the end I came to the most bitter of conclusions. That she wanted nothing to do with me after that confession, the fact that she didn't even place the book on my chair just drove it home.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I stopped talking to her. And she didn't even talk to me, even after sembreak, it was awkward since a good number of my groups usually had her and me, though I feel that we were good at hiding the reason why we didn't talk, it was still difficult for me. I don't know about her but I believed that I would have to stop talking to her altogether after that day, I truly believed that she wanted me to keep my distance. Well that was until today.

&amp;#x200B;

A mutual friend of ours brought to light new information regarding her thoughts. According to him she does hate me, but not because I confessed to her, moreover it was due to the fact that I decided to stop talking to her after the confession. According to him she believes I was petty.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do, I want to apologize yet I don't know how, maybe I had fucked up in reading into the symbolism of that book and maybe I should have just let it slide. I need helping in doing this, I definitely hurt her by just cutting of ties with her and I want to apologize, the crush is gone but the bitterness at destroying a friendship is there, and I hate it. How can I go about apologizing to her after all of these mixed signals.

189,"Hi, 
I'm a 17 year old girl and I've got a bad infection in my toe. It started about 6 or 7 weeks ago when I cut my toenails too short and it started to get ingrown. This has happened a few times before but never this bad. I'd usually just wait about 3-5 days and I'd be back to normal but this time it's been bleeding and pussing from about 5 places and red raw for about 6 weeks.

It doesn't cause much discomfort unless someone hits it or I bang my toe on something. It hasn't healed and it keeps getting worse, my mum has given me colloidal silver to put on it which I used for about a week with no improvement before looking up what I was using. It doesn't seem to have many benefits and could cause skin discolouration (is this true??).

I've looked up when to go to a doctor and with my symptoms I should have gone about a month ago, which I told my mum.

Now, she's not interested in taking me. She's not very inclined to use modern medicine (antivaxx and very into essential oils, homerpathics and home remedies).

Today she finally gave me some antibiotics but they were prescribed to her to use as a cure for conjunctivitis she had a while ago. It's unopened but I don't know if it is safe or helpful for my condition? 

I really need advice for this. Do I demand to see a doctor? Should I wait longer to see if it heals? Should I use the colloidal silver or the antibiotics? Or none? Is there anything worse that could happen?

191,"Over the last year I went through several major transitions in order to improve my mental health. One of the main changes involved stopping communications with several of the friends I once was close with, which went well and I don‚Äôt regret. However, one of the closest friend groups I have (myself and 2 other girls I have known since high school) is still intact. One friend (we‚Äôll call her M) is sweet and sometimes teases me, but is never seriously malicious or harmful. The other friend (let‚Äôs call her L) who lives close to me on the other hand, has always had a ‚Äòhabit‚Äô of making very rude and hurtful comments like insulting my personality, family, and making fun of personal secrets I have shared with her, among others. 90% of the time these small comments don‚Äôt bother me too much, as they aren‚Äôt usually too frequent or as hurtful. 

For the most part, I am not one to confront anyone and do not get insulted easily; I‚Äôm a huge fan of being kind to anyone, and have never gotten actually upset with a friend to the point I say something. However, we all met up over spring break and were together for a full 5 days plus travel, and L not only made these  rude remarks thinly veiled as ‚Äòjokes‚Äô throughout the vacation but embarrassed me quite a few times over the 5 days. It was so bad even the roommates of M  noticed and remarked how mean L was being to me on multiple occasions. I for the first 4 days of the vacation did not say anything mean or offensive to her, so this was very much not provoked. 

I am at the point I feel like I need to say something because I know I do not deserve to be treated this way; L has said numerous times she only does it because she knows I won‚Äôt fight back. I have not said anything to her yet but want to in order to stop this issue. after repetitive insults I feel like something needs to be said.

193,"I (18) went out tonight to see captain marvel with my friends, and after dropping off one friend, I went home. I got home at around 1:15 AM or so. I pulled into my driveway, slowly entered the house so not to wake anyone up, put a bottle of water into the fridge, and went to my room. When I entered my room, I saw a really fast flashing white light coming from the street for about three seconds. I did not see anything like this on my drive home, and I didn't notice it through the downstairs windows.

I was really worried that it was a cop that was following me that I didn't notice until I got into my bedroom, but there's no way I wouldn't have noticed the bright strafe lights. What could it have been?",10Mar2019,2

196,"I'd go to relationship advice but they're just gonna tell me to drop him like it's hot and that's not the advice I'm looking for. Sorry if this is all over the place, it's like 2am. TL:DR at the end.

Something's up with my boyfriend. He's been tired and grumpy and gives off this depressed vibe. 

He's not as lovey now either: walking away from me when we talk, ignoring my texts for hours/days (I don't text him daily or bomb him with texts, my anxiety would never let me), no longer hugging me/whatever, etc. I know I'm probably just being clingy and dumb, but our relationship was fine and equal like 2 weeks ago so this is confusing me.

I don't want 24 hour attention, but I don't want to have to start every conversation and ask for every hug.

I thought bringing it up would be abusive, so I haven't. I did ask if he was happy in the relationship and told him I didn't think he like me anymore, he said he was happy and gave me the first hug I didn't have to ask for in weeks. 

So that's partially solved. He's still having a problem, seperate to us, but when I ask him he tells me it's nothing and that he's fine. And he doesn't have to tell me anything if he doesn't want to, but the little to no affection and no communication are getting to me.

TL:DR: relationships are supposed to be 50/50, but I feel like I'm the only one of us trying most of the time and it hurts. My boyfriend is having issues seperate to us, won't tell me, and I'm sick of the lack of affection from his end. I'm afraid telling him while he's obviously upset would be emotionally abusive and cruel.

215,"Okay so,

my neighbors upstairs (I live in an apartment) have lived here for around a year and constantly fight,

They got evicted and have 30 days to get out. They've stole from us, owe us money, lots of things.

Like for example, just the other day, he yelled and said it'd be the worst 30 days of my life.

I live with my grandparents, who are like 67 and I was at school. He came in and asked for tinfoil and when my mom was in the kitchen getting it he stole all the default info for our router and now we can't use it.

My girlfriend messaged him and told him how shitty he was. He came to my window and was like i didn't fuck up your shit, and so on, and i asked him about the stuff i let him borrow that he sold. he was like part of growing up is realizing you never get your shit back. sorry bout it.

They pick up furniture and throw it down really late at night just to make noise, today he punched out a window, and they fought all day.

The guy has threatened me before, saying something like ""If you wanna get your ass beat by a 27 year old man, thats fine, I don't give a fuck if i land in jail""  
(keep in mind i was 15 at the time, 16 now.)  
I told the cops and they said since he didn't state that he'd be the 27 year old trying to kick my ass that it wasn't considered a threat.

I can't sleep and I'm failing in school.

Tonight he came by my window and asked if I'd seen his girlfriend after everything he's done to us, acting like nothing happened.

I said no and he just stood there. 

I was like what do you want go away

he got pissed and smacked my window and ran off and said ""It's on now motherfucker"".

The cops have been here at least 30 times. Like 5 in the last 3 days.

They never do anything. 

The last time they were here they came out and said they were sick of getting calls from here, chatted for 20 minutes about a farm, then left.

They're standing in the parking lot screaming as I'm typing this.

I'm scared for my safety, and I cannot sleep.

They throw furniture and break glass just to keep us awake.

I can't do this for 26 more days. I have nowhere to go and there is nothing I can do.

I've talked to police, school counselors and other people, and no one can help.

A few days ago he stole someones phone and a group of people came out looking for him to kick his ass in front of the building and they said he had a machete (I couldn't tell what it was.) and told them to go around back.

I haven't slept and he keeps trying to talk to me or start shit. I have cp so obviously I'm a terrible fighter.

What the hell do I do?

Keep in mind that I'm very personal with my personal property, and I get very paranoid whenever someone messes with my stuff without my supervision. So, I had my headphones under my register at the drive-thru, taking orders and charging people. The McDonald's cook finds out that I recently got a new phone, and I show the phone to her. While looking at my phone, she catches a glimpse at my headphones and calls them out. I show them to her, teacher how they work, when all of a sudden, the manager comes out of nowhere and looks at my headset. She asks how they work and I gladly show them off. She then asks, ""How much are you selling them?"" I told her that I'm not selling them right now, and they were already used.

218,"Ok, first of all sorry for the sloppy writing. I'm tired and on some amphetamines right now.

So I've had intense brain fog, can't get out of bed sort of depression for almost 10 years. Severe trauma in my childhood, emotionally neglected drifter living off an inheritance. To be honest, I never really feel anything at all most of the time. Just kind of get stuck in my head reflecting on the past and repeating the same day over and over. Most days I just pace around my apartment or lie in bed playing video games. Pretty much I just feel dead. Completely disassociated.

However, there's been a handful of times in the last 10 years or so when I've ""snapped back"" to reality and have actually been able to feel something. My eyesight sharpens, the fog lifts and BOOM I'm back alive for a minute or two. I don't think it has much to do with drugs (although I've experimented) but rather things that remind me of unhashed out trauma. Or maybe being around certain people who validate/trigger certain emotions? 

I'll probably be put into a mental hospital eventually but I want to know what you guys think could be going on with me. Or a way that I could ""make"" myself actually go out and get help instead of living in perpetual denial.

\&gt;The strangest, most confusing time that I can remember is this--I'm pretty straight, but I had a Gay ""Friend"", who over the course of a few months, began to subtly trying to emasculate me. he'd start with little jabs at first, then escalate into straight up insults, and he tried getting our friends in on it, kept escalating until one day i pieced it all together. Eventually i figured out that he was trying to manipulate me and ""turn me out"". I didn't want to seem toooo crazy so when I confronted him about it, I was pretty chill and implied that I knew what was going on. He basically said ""What're you going to do about it?""...So I told him to fuck out of my life for good. Later, I went into the parking lot to smoke, and I saw a random guy (not even that attractive imo) and felt this lightning bolt sort of zap in my stomach. I wanted that Man to be my Dad and take care of me. It happened a few more times that night because I kept sitting out there to people watch. Eventually, my eyesight sharpened and **the fog lifted.**

\&gt;Once I was going out to get a cup of coffee and this girl I met off Tinder texted me. Boom. The whole world sharpened. I was alive again. Where did all the time go? When I met up with her in person later, we made out and she gave me a handjob and it was the best sex I'd ever had. She kept talking about ""energy vampires"" though and eventually stopped meeting up with me. When I was around her once **the fog lifted.** I remember thinking she was so much like my Mom.

\&gt;Back in High-School I got into a brawl in gym class in front of a huge crowd of people. Shit was intense and me and my boys lost. I remember looking at the crowd and feeling extremely humiliated. They were in shock and some of them were laughing and hooting at us. At that point, a shiver went up my spine, and I felt the ""**fog casting over me""** . I then became super focused on making sure everyone was okay, and drove everyone home, completely numbed out but highly competent in a weird way.

\&gt;Recently had to call an Attorney to help me with some random shit. Googled ""attorneys in atlanta."" First guy I called seemed really nice, and I was drawn to him. He was ""mirroring"" me. It was weird. Like when I'd say something, he'd verbally mirror back a summary of the situation/or of what I was feeling and it was 100% accurate. Like I'd tell him a story about how I went out with my ex-girlfriend to buy some weed and i miss those times and he said ""sounds like she was all you had back then."" And when he said that, it's like I could finally FEEL the emotion that I was trying to express verbally. The Fog didn't ""lift"" but I felt on kind of a high all day, even after I hung up the phone. No fog quote here, lol.

So what would you guys think I should be looking into? I know you'er not Doctors and I won't take this seriously but I'm thinking it's some kind of Dissassociative Disorder? Or am I a collapsed Narcissist? Epilepsy? Schizophrenia?

219,"I‚Äôm in my early 20s. I live in a big city, I work in an office, and most of my friends are also young and in their 20s.

Every time I drink alcohol I feel disgusting from a health perspective afterwards. I also get mean and nasty and ungrateful towards the people I care about. And I just have a hard time controlling my drinking / not overdoing it in general. Because of these reasons, I want to stop drinking all together.

However, this has proven to be a lot harder than I expected it to be. Drinking is such a normalized part of everyday life. 

People at my office pour happy hour drinks, stick it in my hand, and expect me to participate. If I say ‚Äúno thanks,‚Äù I‚Äôm instantly labeled as an outcast and labeled as someone who ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to participate‚Äù or ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know how to have a good time.‚Äù I feel that it genuinely has a negative impact on my workplace relationships when I choose not to participate, even if I still join and socialize with everyone else without drinking. I‚Äôm seen as a ‚Äúwet blanket‚Äù or a loser.

Same sort of thing happens in my social circle. Because I used to drink regularly, people feel comfortable shoving drinks into my hands or ‚Äúpressuring‚Äù me into drinking with them. People act negatively towards me if I choose not to participate. I instantly feel like I‚Äôm seen as a ‚Äúloser who can‚Äôt hang‚Äù when I choose to drink water or kombucha or something instead.

However, I constantly feel socially pressured into drinking, and I‚Äôm having a hard time fighting back against that social pressure without seeming like a total loser / wet blanket.

First one was another guy who went to my gym. We live in a small town and after finishing we'd both walk home the same way. We'd talk the whole time, and our conversations seemed reciprocal, i.e. it wasn't just me putting in all the effort. One time we realized we'd started walking way too early to the gym before it had opened. He said he was going to go home and then meet me a block away half an hour later and then we'd both jog there. I asked him for his number (so if he was late etc. he could send me a text, I thought this was normal) and he acted funny and gave an excuse not to. Ever since that day, he'd still greet me and act polite, but after gym he'd put his headphones in and walk much further ahead of me.  
Another guy who I talked to regularly at the gym invited me to his birthday party and I agreed. The day before he didn't even mention it to me despite me talking to him several times.

Ive been thinking a lot recently and came to the realization that my bf just isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm looking for in a relationship and that I may have gave into my feelings when I was at a low point. I feel so guilty trying to leave him because I know he loves me a lot and one time I tried to break up with him before because I‚Äòm having such conflicting feelings (a side note, I definitely have feelings for him but I feel like they‚Äôre more platonic than anything and he‚Äôs just not what I want compared to the love I felt for my ex and how happy my ex made me feel all the time) and the attempt went really badly because I just let myself feel guilty and stay with him because I don‚Äôt want to make him upset especially since I‚Äôm pretty much his first everything (Gf, kiss, virginity etc) and he said that I was having conflicting feelings made him feel like he wasn‚Äôt good enough. 


I guess what I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm just not the happiest I could be because of this relationship and want to break it off but I really don‚Äôt wanna hurt him and I‚Äôd really appreciate if some of you fellow friends could lend me a word of advice. &lt;3",10Mar2019,1

Hello, so as some background i take care of the cats in my community -- well not ""take care of"" per say but I give them food an shelter. I have around 15 right now and they are not a bother I love cats so its a win for me. They are feral so I leave them be but the most affectionate ones i do take to the shelter.   


Now to my main point, Along time ago around 2 years ago i think maybe even longer there was a black kitten i was taking care of because the mom stopped caring for her. I took care of her until she was able to roam free outside and She became quite big (around teen years i guess??) so i didnt think much of her but more so her being the fruits of my labor. Suddenly she became ill and I was really busy so I couldnt do anything so i left her be thinking it will subside. A couple of days later I find her covered in ants thinking she died -- she was still breathing. However, what I did was horrible. I get nightmares thinking about what I had done Some days when im doing work or studying she crosses my mind and I just cry over and over again on what I did.

Basically, I did nothing. Days had past and I just see more ants overtaking her body as she still breathed slowly. I still remember her faint breaths and I knew i should have ended her life but instead I let her suffer and die. Just thinking about it makes me cry. I didnt know what had gotten into me in that moment because normally i would have acted instantly but instead I did something disgusting. I didnt even bury her. I am filled with so much regret. I have migraines too.

238,"So this is going to be worded badly because it's currently 4:30 am, and I'm beyond exhausted, but I need other opinions on this.

So my friend, I'll call him Eli, messaged me at 1:30am saying that his friend who I'll call Jess, just committed suicide while he was on a discord call with her. He said she told him that she didn't think he loved her, and then jumped off a bridge, and he kept saying he heard the crunch of her hitting the ground, which was the first thing that struck me as odd. How would he hear her hit the ground if the phone was also hitting the ground? He said he left the call when he heard that, but wouldn't the phone be smashed if she fell from high enough to kill her? That would disconnect her automatically, right? The logistics of this all seem slightly off so far, but maybe I'm overthinking it. Moving on.

So the first thing I tell Eli to do is call the police. If the phone didn't disconnect itself, maybe it's not broken the cops can track her with it and find her, right? So after some persuading, he says he'll call 911 after I say there's a chance the fall didn't kill her. People have survived falls from bridges before, so there's a chance they can get to her in time. He messages me back 3 minutes later saying that he couldn't give them helpful information, and that since she lives in a different state they couldn't do anything to help anyway, but they sent some cars out looking for her which doesn't make any sense to me because she supposedly lives in California, and why would they send people out looking for her if they have no idea where she was in this huge state? 

I press for further information, but Eli goes silent for about an hour. I message him asking for more details and letting him know that I'm really stressed about this situation, and he eventually responds saying that they found her body. I found it weird that they found her that quickly with so little to go on, but Eli explains that apparently he told them enough about the house she lived in for them to find it and then find the closest bridge. Apparently that's where they found the body. This feels weird to me too because he was only on the phone with them for 3 minutes or so, and apparently in the hour he was quiet he had fallen asleep so somehow despite only knowing the state Jess lived in and the basic description of her house, he gave enough information in 3 minutes for the police in a different state to find her. That feels off to me, but again, maybe I'm overthinking things. 

I have this gut feeling that Eli is lying to me about this for sympathy, and that he didn't expect me to take it as seriously as I did so he had to make up a story on the spot to fit the narrative. He's always seemed like a sympathy junkie to me, but apparently he doesn't have close friends, his family isn't super supportive, and he's dying of cancer so I felt like he had a good reason to have sympathy. This puts me in a difficult position because if this girl is really dead and I accuse Eli of lying, that could destroy him, but if he really is lying and I continue giving him sympathy I'm hurting myself. I mean I'm currently up at 5am worrying about him, and if I have no reason to be, I'm going to be pissed. 

So, questions. Does anyone know what the police would do in this situation? What would be their course of action for someone calling about a friend's potential suicide in another state? Could the phone call realistically last less than 5 minutes? Does his story make sense? 

I'm sure I didn't explain everything all that well, so feel free to ask if something doesn't make sense or of you need more information.",10Mar2019,1

So I've had this feeling more and more last weeks. I(18m) enjoy watching movies on a wide topic of subjects. Law, action, comedy, singing, etc. Anyway, in movies people often have skills or talents that they can put to great use.

Lately I have been reflecting that to myself, and I realise I don't have any skills or talents as far as I know. I am mediocre at everything I do, I study software engineering but get mediocre grades and I find the logic very difficult. I enjoy drawing but I am really bad at it, I have been trying to get into piano, I enjoy it but I'm still very bad at it (cant play with two hands)

I have come to realise that so many people have done amazing stuff whereas I achieved nothing. I even feel like I really tried and inveated lots of hours in stuff to try to get good, but they don't really seem to pay off.

I now realise this might be why I love movies so much, I can get away from who I am and for a brief moment feel succesful, enjoy someone else's succes. And I hate having to go back to 'me'

 It makes me feel like shit because deep down I'm afraid I'll never have something to be truly proud of, and that's been really really tough on me.

To top off the cake, sometimes my family tells ms they're proud of me, but that makes me really sad because I don't think I've done anything to be proud of.

253,"Backstory: I broke up with my girlfriend a week ago (both females in our late 20's). She's a textbook narcissist and it's a godsend I got out when I did to say the least. My roommate and very close friend, someone I consider a big sister figure,  was there for me throughout my entire 2 month relationship with this person, and eventual breakup. We'll call her Kate. Kate encouraged me to leave, validated me in how horrible this girl treated me, and has always come off as a very very loyal friend to me. We both had to move out of our apartment sadly a week ago as well and we got into an argument about something regarding the apartment. She was very hostile and demanding with me and we didn't speak for a couple days. I found the whole thing to be shocking because her and I only ever got along amazingly well and had never fought.  I figured she was just stressed with moving, but then noticed she followed my ex girlfriend on instagram days later and that my ex girlfriend followed her back. I confronted her curiously about it on the phone and she said it wasn't a big deal and that she had messaged her because she was quitting her job and thought my ex would be a good fit for the restaurant. According to her, she told my ex something like ""hey, I'm sorry to hear about what happened with you and \_\_\_\_ I don't exactly know any details, but I heard you might need extra work"" and that my ex replied saying only ""very nice things"" about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find the whole thing a bit strange. Because for 1, this particular ex was really toxic and treated me  awfully. 2, if  it were me I would have asked permission from my friend first before contacting their ex, or at least let them know that I would be doing so, and then potentially following them.....it just feels like Kate sort of went behind my back and unintentionally gave my ex girlfriend validation that she really never did anything wrong to me. We actually broke up because she wouldn't stop her intimate relationships with her exes and would text inappropriate things to girls but was convinced her behavior was normal and okay and refused to respect my boundaries. So I left, which is something Kate encouraged me to do. Kate is also very straight and has a boyfriend, so this isn't anything to do with that. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: someone I consider a trustworthy close friend contacted my ex behind my back and followed them on social media a week after we broke up and I feel a bit betrayed by it. Am I overreacting or is there something to me not feeling right about it? ",10Mar2019,1
254,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible because I have typed up a summary previously and it came to well over 10 thousand words.

I have been the target of an extensive campaign to smear my name and take away my voice, beginning when I was around 16. I was abused from an early age til my early teens, I covered for my abuser until my mid teens at which point I confronted them which saw them happily admit what they did but say they wouldn't admit it die to the stigma society puts on child abusers,(not exaduration, this is close to exactly how it was said).

I am now in a situation where my name and  face has been spread throughout my city and beyond. Among the things that have been attributed to me are abuse of a woman,(supposedly in my late teens), stalking a family member to the point where she had to leave the country,(have not talked or seen this family member since I was child except for a few christmas' when I was younger), selling drugs and much more. The worst thing is that because of the culture here nobody will suggest going to the police when these things are spread, but will themselves go a different route, (regardless of other factors if these accusations were brought forward properly I could easily clear my name as they are literally impossible to have happened).

There have been multiple attempts on my life, one of which has left my face mildly disfigured. I have had death threats from a 'terrorist organisation' active in my country,(much more complicated than this but here is not the place), from business owners and from vigilante groups. 

I tried to contact a politician to explain the situation and had my account deactivated for 'suspicious activity', I have tried to leave but had to flee an area after I was pursued with a guy me for a while who then pulled a knife,(only got out unscathed by sprinting to and hiding in the front of a church), I have tried going to authorities and was told before I had even said anything that, (they) could not do anything, (I) was responsible for my own safety, (members of my family have an extensive relationship with intelligence and police in this country going back many years including collabratively covering up things). 

I have been struggling to just survive for over 5 years now, having spent almost all of my time locked in a residence for my own safety,(during this time I had someone break in and destroy my intercom, break the security camera in the hallway completely off the ceiling and have had people who assaulted me previously stand looking up at my window and throw things at it). I have plans to move and told my abuser as much but from her reaction I can only imagine that this will not help, probably quite the opposite. I have allies here and will be completely alone if I move, I have also had a family member who is very much involved with goings on here tell me that I will be 'got anywhere'. 

I have reached the end of my teather, the worst crime I've commited is smoking a bit of weed, I have spent the majority of my life in either work or school and have always been dedicated to treating everyone everyone equally despite radicalisation attempts by my own family. This isn't a third world country or a war zone, I don't understand why this is allowed to happen. 

I truly believe that the main reason the character assasination has been so severe and concentrated is due to the things I know about what happened to myself and others and also things that are still ongoing in this country. People in positions of authority and trust,(including my own family), have collaborated to ensure that I do not have a voice that will be heard.

I'm posting here because soon I won't have a secure residence and I know I won't even last the night here. I am surrounded by people who have constantly lied about and abused me and done this so efficiently that they made the world think I am a deviant and intoxicant.

255,"I met my girlfriend via LDR, a year ago. We met on an online game known as adventure quest worlds, which neither of us play anymore. We took some time on Facebook to get to know each other and we became BF/GF on valentines day 2018.

She admitted that she was spoiled and wanted many things that came to mind but she never was the type to ask for BIG MONEY... then around August she told me her parents wanted her back to North Korea and if that happened, we should break it off.

Instead, she found friends to split rent of 575 USD a month for each of them. Problem is... her parents didnt allow her to work while she lived with them. So I worked 2 jobs within that time period and sent her rent money, while she found an under the table job that gave shitty wages and shitty hours (I'm aware that many people may be judging me... feel free to I guess... :/) but just recently my parents found out about me sending her all this money (my chequing account is 1 main family bank account to prevent fees) and didnt take too kindly to it (as expected). They're locking many of my funds up to make sure that I'm saving for myself and not sending my money off to someone who I never met in person. (Just to be clear I've seen her on vidchat and have talked to her in voice chat too)

Of course I dont blame my parents, I also understand they want what's best for me. Breaking the news to my girlfriend, she seems set on killing herself and is giving me 2 days to figure something out. I've tried suggesting that she live with relatives or even JobCorps but her only options seem to be prostitution, suicide or me providing. Apparently her brother is living off of her parents and if she lives there and they find out, they could both go homeless, her cousins apparently dont want her there either... Of course, I'm not stupid, (though I'm sure many of you would argue against that) this is a red flag to me... but looking back at everything, things seem to kind of click.

I dont wanna turn my back on my parents or disrespect them, but I get sick thinking that if this situation is real, I could potentially be losing the person I love... shes giving me 2 days to make a decision... she told me she'd get her brother to send me the hospital address after that. Is this all a scare tactic? Was this all some sick fucking plan? I just dont fucking know anymore... all I know is I gave my all and to this point keep on trying and I'm breaking myself apart goddamn it!

257,"I have trouble walking, have had this my entire life. I can walk a bit but there's a limp and I use a wheelchair every now and then. 
I think joking about it is fine - it's a way of dealing with it and I can't fix it anyway so might as well laugh about it. I make a lot of jokes about my disability myself and everyone in the house loves it. Some of them join in lightly which is great, I don't want it to be taboo at all.

However, one of them doesn't know when to stop and what's funny and what's not. We'd both be walking/running to our rooms and he'll start making it into a race and be like HA I'M BETTER AT WALKING THAN YOU!!!! and I jokingly said that was pretty mean and he just went ""well it's true right? so?"". It's just.... not funny at all and his jokes are always centered around him/able bodied people being better than me.

How do I ask him to tone it down without making it sound like I don't want anyone to join in on the jokes? I love how casual we all are about it but he's taking it too far. I'd hate for people to be scared to bring it up or joke about it, but his are quite hurtful and it gets old real fast.",10Mar2019,2
258,"So I finally got my first job and starting training on Tuesday. I had 2 interviews, one with the office that found my CV and a second one with my employers. 

When the first office (the one that found my CV) called me to announce that I was hired they told me that my employers would call that day or the next day to let me know about the details of my training (encluding the time I have to be there) and also talk about my payment. I waited a whole day and no sign so the second day I called the first office. they told me I shouldnt be stressed and that the employers would call during that day. they did not. 

now I have to point out that phones don't work in my house. there's no reception and that's why my CV always has other two house phones  just in case they cant find me on my cell phone. The first office always calls at my home when my cell phone isn't working so I thought my employers would do the same? I found 2 calls when my phone finally worked so I called them back. even though I told the lady that she had called me on my cell she said they're closed and will be open on Tuesday (the day I'm supposed to have my training). I tried calling the first office again but I guess it was also closed cause no one answered. 

I don't know what to do here. I thought about going to work without knowing the hour I have to be there but it's also kinda far from home and a little pricy to get tickets for the bus and It might be pointless cause I haven't really talked to them you know. the other choice would be to stay home and call the offices again to ask what the fuck I'm supposed to do and possibly ""miss"" the training if they really have a training scheduled without me knowing shit about it. 

This is my first job and I have anxiety in general and this whole thing is torturing me since Friday and even before since the interviews were really stressful as well. I really feel like laying on the floor and crying about it but that won't do shit in the end so I'm desperate for some help.

My group of friends consists of 8 people, all female (we‚Äôre also all 16, so if this sounds like playground drama.. that‚Äôs because it kinda is, haha..)

Unsurprisingly, we like to talk about guys and crushes and stuff, but when we do, this one girl in our group likes to try and tear us down about it. (We‚Äôll call her Ella for this) That‚Äôs not her real name. 

For example, recently my friend‚Äôs crush added her on Snapchat, and we were all very excited and happy about it, until Ella showed up in the group and started making sarcastic comments, being nasty, all in all just raining over our parade completely unnecessarily.
I know it‚Äôs kinda a stupid thing to get excited about, but we were all just having fun and there was NO reason for her to be nasty about it. 

And one time the same friend was talking about a conversation she had with said crush, and Ella just butted into the conversation with things like ‚Äúwhy are you bothering with someone who obviously wouldn‚Äôt like you‚Äù and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you see him hanging out with [popular girl]? You don‚Äôt have a chance‚Äù
I just don‚Äôt understand why she has such a problem with guys, WHY she feels the need to make us feel like shit when we‚Äôre just trying to have fun and chat about something we‚Äôre interested in???
She‚Äôs done plenty of other stuff like this but I won‚Äôt list it all because this post would be like 10090000000 words long :/ 
She only seems to target me and this other friend, and only when we talk about guys (though she likes to make offhand comments about my appearance, but I think she‚Äôs just joking about that) 


She‚Äôs usually a cool person, but whenever we start talking about guys she just morphs into this negative, snide and nasty person. Honestly, I‚Äôm sick of me and my friend being torn down every time we‚Äôre happy about something boy related.. 

How can we deal with this? Why do you think she acts like this?? Maybe if I know the reason she does this I can help her with it? Idk. Anything helps.

274,"
So idk exactly where I'm going with this.

A lot have been on my mind for few days now. 
You know these moments when you think about something cringy you did years ago and all you want is just to instantly jump out of the window, I've been having those moments for a week now and all I want is just to disappear. 

And because of these thoughts, I'm kinda afraid to meet someone.
First, because I don't want to have those cringy moments anymore. 
And second, because all I can think about when I'm talking to someone is ""What they think of me? Do they see me as THE awkward girl?"" 
And those questions arose too because of some posts that I read on here, saying that everybody sees a different version of ""you"". So who am i exactly? Does everybody sees how cringy I am? I think they do and it's blocking me from having a nice casual conversation. 

Well, no need to say, people's opinion about me has always been important for me. In such a way that if I think I've been awkward with you once, I will probably not talk to you anymore, unless you make the first move. 

So my question is: I'm not the only person to feel like this right? Is it something serious and does anyone has any advice to change this way of thinking? ",10Mar2019,1

278,"So I‚Äôm in a relationship and it has been almost 1 year. He makes me very happy and i see myself spending the rest of my life with him.  

However, i feel the differences in our cultures might be creating issues. He (25) is Armenian (middle eastern) and i (19) am half Puerto Rican half white. Something that drives me crazy about his culture is how the women are treated. It‚Äôs very much like the man does all the work, and the women doesn‚Äôt ask questions or talk back and is expected to be the stereotypical housewife. At get togethers or vacations the girls are always the ones expected to clean up all the mess the men make. It‚Äôs looked down upon if we smoke or drink, so he‚Äôs always getting mad if i want to drink when were out with friends, even though he‚Äôs allowed. 

And something that is really putting a strain on our relationship is how bothered he gets if i try to ask him questions about his work. He is involved in many different things in order to make money (some which is a bit sketchy), and especially recently if i try to ask him about his work he gets very angry and starts yelling. During arguments he would sometimes hurt me. I feel like he has no sympathy for me as when i cry he will get even angrier. 

He knows hurting me is wrong and he mostly keeps it to a minimum ever since a situation where he made my nose bleed and his friend had a serious talk with him. He does still squeeze my neck sometimes when things are really heated.  I feel as though i can‚Äôt blame him because when we are sexually intimate, we sometimes like being rough like choking or slapping, so i feel it has transferred to our fights. He is changing though and this is a not a common occurrence so i don‚Äôt feel as though it is an abusive relationship, at least not now. 

Overall he is a very good man and does so much for me. But this is putting a serious strain on our relationship to the point of us almost breaking up. 

Is it normal for a man to want the woman to not care what he is involved in work wise? How do i let the intense need to know what he is involved in go? I want to make him happy and stop always questioning him but it is so damn hard. I hate not knowing the details of his life and i have never had a boyfriend who feels as though i am ‚Äúnosy‚Äù for caring and wanting to know these things. I feel like as his girlfriend he should be able to share those details with me but he feels the complete opposite. 

Please don‚Äôt tell me i need to leave because of the violence because he really is putting an end to it. Please give me advice on how to handle my questions and what i should do to make this relationship work. 
I‚Äôm not sure how to handle his attitude and am so confused about what‚Äôs right and wrong. Thank you. ",10Mar2019,1

283,"Today me and my mom had a dissagreement about how communication works, I still think that my point makes more sense, but she was very persistent so I want to hear other opinions before I try to talk with her again. (Also english is not my first language, so I apologize for mistakes in spelling, grammar etc. in advance)

Sooo... Basically the argument was about communication. We were sitting at the table and I was saying how my fist driving lesson is today and talking about how anxious I am. She responds nothing and continues eating. So I look at her too see if she has any intention to answer, (she often takes long befor responding). But instead she gets mad, because me looking at her makes her feel like I expect an answer. I calmly ask her why she is raising her voice (big mistake) and say that I didn't say anything, but surely think that normaly the other person would respond. She disagrees, because i didn't ask a question, so she doesn't need to answer. The discussion goes on with pretty much the same arguments, just louder.

Her point is that when it's not a question, responding is unnecerssarry and she wasn't able to say anything to what I told her. I should have asked her a question ( not sure how exactly I could have formed my fear of driving into a question), instead of looking at her expecting a response

My point is that a conversation dies quickly if there is no resopnse and normally a person responds whitout questions asked (of course there are exeptions, you dont always need to add your opinion, but a conversation between to people during breakfast is not a political debate). And I feel like there were many options for a response. Which in my opinion, I dind't force to by looking if she had intention to answer or not

We alredy had the same argument before, exept the 'looking at her demanding a response' part. So I guess, considering she already was aggraivated, she just snapped (still not nice imo, but kinda understandable)

Also I don't always stay calm during arguments, but I can promise you I really asked her calmly, because I knew where this conversation was going to lead and wanted to prevent that.

looking forward to your opinions and thank you.

290,"Hey Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to give you a small backstory before i continue to my main problem. I have a past of social anxiety and negative self-image. Last year i started to work on my problems and with the help of yoga/meditation and psychotherapy i have managed to overcome most of my social anxiety and now i'm working on my negative self-image. This really was a blast for me because i'm more extroverted, happy and calm in my life. Thanks to life circumstances i was raised up in an environment which didn't really gave me the opportunity to work on my social skills which still has it effects till today.

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes this friend, we shall call this friend X.  X and i met in a time were things weren't as good as it was today. I was overweighed and more mentally unstable than i am today (i've lost 20KG in a year, i really decided to turn my life around!).  X was the first person to listen to me, to actually give advice and to correct me when what i said made no logical sense. We had a lot of contact and X really motivated me to change my life around and to be were i am now. So for that i am really grateful.

  
However things changed around 6 months or so when our contact changed. Some events put a strain on our friendship but i was happy that we overcame that. But, as the time passed i felt more and more to be treated with less respect than i was used of X. Sometimes when i had sent him something i was ignored (and i mean really ignored and not just that he didn't respond in a short period of time). This gave me reasons to confront X and say if he still wanted to maintain the friendship which he wanted, in this period we had lots of arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

Now is the time were my backstory is very important. As i've said before i'm currently into psychotherapy, the therapy which really helps me at this moment is EDMR (it's based on rapid eye movement). This gives me the chance to bring back memories and to make them less emotionally heavy. This friend X came up to my surprise in my EDMR and i found out that i have lots of tension in my body regarding X.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of the EDMR i have not talked to X for 2 months because i really don't know what to do with this situation. He is in my extended friendgroup so that means that i will see X when i am around my friends. What should i do because i feel like i'm really at a crossroad and the options that are before me don't really benefit me at all.

292,"I was in a phone call with my girlfriend, and shit was getting pretty deep.

Turns out she trusts me enough with her life (which i'm so thankful for; I love her so much) to tell me the things that she's gone through, which involved her being sexually assaulted as a 6 year old by a family member.

I don't know how to react (i'm pretty shocked right now), but I do know and have expressed to her that I want to be there for her, whatever she goes through.

Any advice that anyone has for me, on how to process &amp; deal with this, and what I can do to help her through this all? (she said she's suffered from PTSD from this). I want to be there for her as much as I can, except I don't want to overwhelm her.",10Mar2019,2
293,"Hi, I'm a 18 Yr old male this year. 

Ever since last year, my life's been going downhill. I went into college, I made new friends but I didn't feel as happy as I was in my secondary school.

I've made friends but I still feel lonely. This year, I confronted my friends on why they're still on about a girl in their class when the problem started last year and I told them to let it go. It escalated to me being fake towards them and they didn't want to be my friend anymore so they all left me. I still have friends, but I don't think my problems are worth their time. One of them is a foreigner studying in my country, working her ass off to pay for her monthly house bills and has family issues. The other one was diagnosed with depression and anorexia before. 

I don't know whether I have depression or whatsoever. I just feel so down lately and everything's not working. I always tell myself tomorrow's a better day but honestly it's just been stagnant. I feel like it's such a hassle just to be here. Not to mention I have a very bad habit of thinking that I'm not living life to its fullest. 

I think I'm so ugly sometimes to the point where I just don't want to look at myself in the mirror. Not to mention I noticed my jawline disappearing the past few weeks. I feel like I'm fat and everything but my friends said I'm fine because my body's a stick. I feel I'm so ugly sometimes I just don't know why I exist here. I feel its a punishment from a greater being or God or whatsoever. I have suicidal thoughts and I don't know what went wrong. I just don't fucking know and I'm frustrated and I'm sad. I just want to feel happy again not waking up and expecting hours to fly by to do the same exact shit the next day. ",10Mar2019,3
294,"Before I start with my main story, I'm going to begin with details about my friend to try fill in the blanks telling the story alone might cause. (Also excuse my grammar, English isn't my first language) Anyway, my friend Anakin (F17) is homeschooled. (Excuse me again, but to get into a bit more backstory, I'm comparing her to her sister, Leia, because they were both raised by the same way) So, back on track,
 She has been homeschooled since middle school. She graduated through ged last year. As far as I'm told, she couldn't even handle homeschool, and was preferred to be a self learner. I don't think she's dumb by any means, but she's just off of that makes sense. I first started coming over to her house frequently when we were 12. She was normal for about a year. You could talk to her about issues, gossip, girl talk, blah, blah, blah. (Keep in mind her red flags slowly emerged over the span of 4 or so years) One more detail is that she was always pretty chubby, since mid childhood to early to mid teens. She was always pretty shy, and kept to herself, but once you got to know her She was just like your average teen at the time. Ever since she turned 13, she changed drastically. She would have weird mannerisms, like walking on her tip toes, and randomly talking in a stutter. She would refuse to go out, and it'd just be her sister, mother and I going out and having fun. She had gotten heavily into politics, and talked about that pretty much all the time. It seems like every time I would talk to her would be an arguement. Overtime, she tuned down more and more. She began to get a strong hatred of politics, and never really talk about politics after that. We still argued, but nothing too bad. Until, I would try and talk about personal stuff, like my colorblindness. She wouldn't believe me, and could explain why other than she doesn't believe that. A bit more time passes, she would be afraid to do a lot of things, because she would claim it to be a sin. She refuses to do yoga with her sister, and I ,because she claimed it to be satanic. She would yell at me if I said a curse word, because she said that I was hurting jesus. I noticed her bibles pages have been frayed, because she would read it a lot. One of the last times I visited her, I remember the power went out, and she walked into the room to tell her mom that her earners ringing like whistles and trains louder than ""normal"". The last time I went over, I remember she picked up my phone case, smiled, and started tracing her fingers around, claiming it was changing colors (Which it wasnt). I should've took those as red flag, but she just angered me a lot of the time. I didn't come over to her house until a year later, until she was 16. She still was chubby, but her personality flipped. She was flamboyant, and talked kinder, and listened to me. I noticed, she developed a twitch, and twitched, and shook a lot. She seemed more jittery. She reminds me of Willy wonka from the 2005 version. She seemed so weird. She'd talk, but her off topic or Make little sense, and the whole time her look seemed kind of expressionless, and distant. she's a very awkward person. When talking to her, she takes a moment to answer, and she sometimes darts her eyes to the corner of the room and looks as if she's looking at a person. She talks like an old film, but more monotone if that makes sense. I've noticed she became Mormon in a way. She never used things like computers. For music or talk shows, she has her record player or radio, for her educating or general entertainment, she has books, she even uses a type writer to write down whatever. It may seem like a weird thing to add about her, but it really goes to show her hatred for a lot of the modern tech. She makes at least 70% of her clothes by herself, because she hates modern fashion as well. That's irrelevant, but I just thought I might add in something positive ish about her. Anyway, I didn't come over again for about a month. I came back, and she lost a bit of weight. Came back a few weeks later, she lost even more weight. Now, she's no anorexic, but she is very thin. She hasn't dropped more weight since she weight (What I assume to be) 85 or so pounds (Also, she 4'9, s o compared to an average height, it's not that bad). I've noticed she has a bit of a schedule. In specific, she wakes up around 4 am, and does what she needs to do in the bathroom, and she get out, and practices piano for 4 or so hours. She then cleans the house, and works in her hobbies and whatever. She goes to bed around 10 at night. She's a person that seeths. She's say offhand remarks when she thinks her mother, father or siblings are using their phones too much. She'll be holding a ruler or something, and she'll pretend to bash it in her head whenever they turn from her onto their phones. She seems light hearted and joking about it, but it still is concerning sometimes. Now, in contrast to her sister, her sister is completely normal, and acts nothing like Anakin. I'm closer to her it seems, because we relate to each other so well. Anakin is like an alien. One more thing, is that on can never talk about boys around her. She isn't interested in them, and I used to think it was a phase, and I even used to She was asexual, until I noticed she acts even weirder in front of girls. She blushes, and can't even look them in the eye, (She already can't with people, but you can tell she forces herself to) and she gets all stuttery, and you could see her face turn red. Still, she refuses to admit to anything. She seems very mysterious, and weird. I figured adding that last but if detail would add a bit of distance between her, her sister ,and as as of interest to show how much of a sore thing she is in our group. I don't know what's the matter with her, and I'm not asking for her diagnoses, but what do you personally think she has? What should I do to help her? Or is she just being herself? ",10Mar2019,1
295,"i‚Äôm on mobile + a throwaway acc + this post is a mess bc i haven‚Äôt slept since 3am and it is now 8am bc of her and her friends + bf sleeps like a rock/is drunk so he isn‚Äôt aware of anything that happened yet + other roomie isn‚Äôt here rn

a little bit of background info, i currently live with two roommates, one is 21 the other is 19. the one that is 19, we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúA‚Äù, started off as a really fun roomie to hang out with. the first few months were fine but recently she‚Äôs been pushing too many boundaries with me and my other roomie.

A‚Äôs thursday-saturday ritual is having some friends up from her hometown, going out, and coming back around 2am which is perfectly fine but she is so loud. the first few times me and my other roomie (lets call her ‚ÄúB‚Äù) asked her to be quiet she complied but recently shit has hit the fan. about two weeks ago she had her friends up, B said two of them tried to use my room to have sex while i was at my boyfriend‚Äôs, but i had my door locked so they fucked on the couch, which kept her up bc her room is right next to the living room. B walked in the next morning to the living room trashed and A‚Äôs friends buck ass naked on the couch. A‚Äôs friends left back for their hometown and our place was still trashed. B and I tried to talk with A about how disrespectful her friends were and how she was being disrespectful too by not doing anything about it but she just gave us attitude and fake remorse. 

tonight my boyfriend and some friends went to the club, and my bf and I got back at 2:00am. A and her friends come barging in at 3:00am. They start blasting music and talking super loud. I texted A and told her to lower the music, and she did but not even five minutes later it was loud again. I called her and asked her to please turn it off, to which she replied, ‚Äúi would but i cant u know i have people over.‚Äù so i said fine just keep the volume low. 4:30am rolls around and nothing changes so i go out to the living room and tell her please lower it. we have an argument in front of her friends, the volume was lowered again and i go back to my room. i still cant sleep bc her friends are talking so loud so i thought fuck it, ill just keep browsing reddit and snap stories. i get to her snap story and A and her friends had drawn on my fish tank with expo markers but i didnt know they were expo, so i went into the living room again and asked why the fuck they thought it was ok to draw on my fish tank. they explained it was expo markers but i didnt even care at that point, they were being disrespectful of my property. they wipe my tank clean, lower the music again and i go back to bed and drift off to sleep. i wake up AGAIN to loud music and voices and its now 6:30am. i lose my cool. i barge into the living room and tell A she needs to shut it down bc its nearly 7am. I then tell her we‚Äôre going to the office tomorrow and transferring to different units next semester because i‚Äôm not going to keep dealing with her shit. she just rolls her eyes, tells me im making a big deal over nothing and says she doesnt care. at this point im angry and hurt because one, she has no respect for me, and two, i thought she cared. rinse and repeat the above usual process. it is now 7am and her friends are being so loud. ive barely slept since 3am. i walk out to the living room once again and now shes tripping acid. i give up, her friends left and she‚Äôs in her room but it is now 8am and ive had no sleep. 

what should i do in the mean time until we can transfer to different units? i‚Äôm going to talk to her but it is going to be useless, she‚Äôs not going to listen to me or B. I‚Äôm so tired of this cycle and I don‚Äôt know what I can do.",10Mar2019,2

Flash forward an hour he‚Äôs getting drunk and then his friend adds to his story I click on it thinking I‚Äôll get to laugh at my boyfriend being an idiot. But no, god no, instead I get to sit and watch multiple videos of my boyfriend grabbing his friends face and passionately kissing him, I joke about it with them at first but it was hurting, a lot. So time passes boyfriends now posted a video too and his friends messaged me saying he‚Äôs staying at his tonight and not coming to see me. Now at this point I‚Äôm in tears because it hurts watching him kiss someone else even if he‚Äôs joking around, so I tell them.

297,"To preface this, I have a history of sexual abuse. When I was 5-7 I was sexually abused by my older cousin for years in various ways. Later on at around 8 or 9 an uncle used made me give him a hand job. My first ‚Äúconsensual‚Äù act of sex was when I was 14 and my older brother‚Äôs 20 year old friend encouraged me into a friends with benefit‚Äôs (without being friends) arrangement. He was also having sex with my 12 year old cousin and was trying to convince others. My first real boyfriend would have sex with me while i cried and would get mad at my if I said no. At this point in my life i had no positive interactions with sex. 

Here comes my confusing rape. He was a family friend, about a year and half younger than me and he relentlessly begged to be my boyfriend for a month. Eventually I accepted. I allowed him into my home and we were making out. He tried taking off my clothes and i told him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex. He told me we wouldn‚Äôt, he just wanted to do other things(fingering, dry humping). I accepted but made sure to keep my underwear on. We kept kissing with only my shirt and underwear one and I felt him begin to enter me. I began to cry and he stopped. I stopped crying and then we kept kissing and he did it again and i started crying. The third time he started kissing me again and entered again. This time i didn‚Äôt cry, I just let it happen. I still didn‚Äôt want it, but I figured since he already entered twice, it was already too late. Whatever happened, happened. After he finished I told him I loved him. I didn‚Äôt, but I was trying to convince myself it was love. Because I just never again wanted to have sex with someone i didn‚Äôt love. Who wasn‚Äôt my choice. I just wan


A little over a year ago I was dating a family friend. We met in person, then he went back to his state and we kept talking. About a month later he came to live at my cousin‚Äôs house permanently. Somewhere throughout that time he asked to be my boyfriend and I accepted. About a week or two after he moved to my cousin‚Äôs house, he was at my house. I wasn‚Äôt ready to move into any sexual just yet, but I did want to kiss him. So we were making out. He tried taking off my clothes and I said I didn‚Äôt want to have sex. He said we wouldn‚Äôt, he just wanted to touch me. I said okay and allowed him to take off my pants but didn‚Äôt let him remove my underwear. We kept kissing and suddenly I felt his penis enter me. I didn‚Äôt want it. But I didn‚Äôt stop him. I started crying silently. And he stopped. He hugged me and eventually i stopped and then we started kissing again and then again, with my underwear still on he entered me again and again I started to cry. Again he stopped and hugged me and I stopped and then we went back to kissing, and then the third time I didn‚Äôt cry. I just accepted it. When he finished I told him I loved him even though i didn‚Äôt. I just didn‚Äôt want to accept the fact that even in adulthood, even being the older person, I still couldn‚Äôt stop something i didn‚Äôt want. It hurts so much to this day. 

But the part that can cause doubt is that after that day, I let him do it one more time. Then I broke up with him. After I broke up with him I started to desperately ask for him back. Desperately. Eventually I gave up and came to terms with the fact that i did not love him, or even want him in my life,  i just needed to to be love so that it wouldn‚Äôt be rape.

I have to see this person every family gathering and now he and my cousin are dating. It‚Äôs been very very hard. 

But I‚Äôm not sure that I can‚Äôt even tell anyone. I told my boyfriend who I‚Äôve been with for a year and my brother. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to even tell my cousin who‚Äôs dating him. I‚Äôm pretty sure he told her we had sex and I was desperate for him. And I‚Äôm afraid if I ever bring it up to anyone in my family they‚Äôll tell me it wasn‚Äôt rape, that I didn‚Äôt say no and even had sex with him again. 

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this, any advice or opinion would mean everything. 

TLDR: a year ago I think I was raped, I didn‚Äôt say no but I was crying. But I let him, and then I let him one more time before we broke up. If I tell anyone, would they consider it rape or my fault? ",10Mar2019,1

I'm a 20 year old male and I'm kinda worried. The problem is that  I'm not attracted to any girl. I once had a girlfriend for 4 years and I really loved her, she was really cool back then. I also had interest in other girls at that time, everything seemed normal. We broke up and since that moment I just don't feel attracted to anyone. I find a lot of girls attractive sexually, but there isn't a single girl I know that I would like to enter any relationship whatsoever. Whenever I have, let's say a crush, on any girl and I start talking with them, I immediately loose any interest. I don't want to sound awful but even though those girls are fun and cool, there's nothing I find interesting in them. They just doesn't seem interesting and I never feel any connection, even though few girls said they felt it. Also all the intimate stuff seem so repulsive to me. I suspect it's because I was raised in a very religious environment and everything connected to sex was viewed as sinful and unholy. So there's that. I just want to know if anyone had a situation like that. Is it normal? Am I going to be alone forever?:(

304,"To start off, I want to make sure that everyone knows that I have not been hazed nor has hazing been an occurrence during my time in the fraternity. I am currently temporarily inactive from the fraternity as I am studying abroad in another country. What this means is that I do not participate in greek life events and I do not pay dues for the fraternity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here, I want to give a brief background as to why I joined the fraternity, and why I want to leave the fraternity. I am asking for advice, maybe an alternative to dropping, or why I shouldn't drop. For those of you who have been in greek life, your advice would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I joined the fraternity during the fall semester of my second year at university, and I was the first of a small group of friends to join the fraternity. Within a couple weeks of joining, I had convinced the rest of my mates to join the fraternity, resulting in the entirety of our friend group to be a part of the fraternity. Over the first several months of joining, our small group of friends had expanded to include another smaller group of friends, and we bonded almost instantly. My goal for joining the fraternity was to expand our friend group and to potentially make new friends along the way, and that is what happened. By the end of our second year of university, we had decided to find a house to live in during our fourth and final year of university. We had become so close, that we were willing to live with each other for the duration of an academic year. Our fraternity participated in various greek life events including sorority relations and philanthropy events, and my mates and I were always at each event. At this point in time, I thought that this was why I joined: simply, to make friends and do things with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem now is that I am not enjoying myself in the fraternity life anymore. Since the start of the third year, everything our friends have talked about is about the fraternity and the politics of greek life; who we dislike and which sorority has the hottest girls. Several of my mates have had high positions in the fraternity and I can see the power trip they get when they want the fraternity to do something and it happens. Events with sororities and philanthropy events are now a chore, because the time spent with friends is usually time spent setting up for these events. More often than not, the 'setting up' of an event is just so we can look good on campus and get recognition from everyone. Many of those who have positions on the executive group of our fraternity abuse their power just to get what they want and to impress friends outside of the fraternity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I love my mates to death and I would do anything for them, but I do not want to be part of the fraternity anymore just so I do not have to be involved in the politics and 'corruption' of greek life. Another reason why I wouldn't want to stay is the fact that I just don't want to pay dues anymore. It's not that I don't have the money to pay, but I feel like I could be using this money to pay for other things. I have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that you have to pay to be part of a mens group, and I just brushed it off when I first joined. I do not find enjoyment in the things I used to do a year ago when I was in the fraternity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am just so happy to abroad at the moment so I can spend some time away from fraternity life. This wasn't the main reason why I decided to leave, but ever since I left the country, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I want that weight to stay off. The thing holding me back is the fact that I am just 6 months away from reentering the states and living in a house where all but one tenant is part of the same fraternity. I feel like my mates would just ask why and convince me to stay in the fraternity. I am easy to convince, but I feel like I've made up my mind for this specific situation. I want to leave, but I don't know how. ",10Mar2019,2
305,"in the past year i've met a girl in some online music group discussions. we just talked casually about music and so on...

After a while i trusted her and gave her my real account in a social media that had my real name and info on it.

I think she kinda trusted me because of this. so we got talking about more personal stuff, like depression and so on(i have it, she has it).after a while she mentioned that she was raped 2 years ago. i asked her if she wanted to talk about it and said that i'm here if you needed anything. but she said she was over it and moved on.i didn't pressure her and told her it's ok and if she ever wanted to talk about it i'm here.

fast forward to the past week we and some other people from that group wen't to a cafe for meeting each other(including her boyfriend).

when most people left and it was just the 3 of us with another guy which is my friend of 3 years, she started talking about the incident and told her story, again i said i'm there if she needed anything.the other friend didn't seem much touched by it because she mentioned again that she was over it and it was allright.

now she is one of the nicest people i've ever met and because i'm not really social and i'm extremely lonely, the way she treated me and trusted me upon first meeting led me to be really really devastated by her story(i'm not gonna share it but it was really really sad and violent.)

for the past few days i've been feeling like literal shit and i feel so angry and sad by what happened to her.

i'm looking for some advice about what i should do in this position. because she and i aren't too close i can't really offer too much and i don't want to put any pressure on her but i really really feel so bad i can't sleep.

is there anything i can do to help her or help myself feel a little better?

It went to the point that i was so sad , i tried to cut myself , and succeded ( for those of you wondering , i'm an unpaid night guardian for my curch , and i allways have my dad's hunting knife with me for any situation ) . Now i have this big-ass scar that hurts and everytime i see it it reminds me of my state. I joked all those years about people crying themsleves to sleep , but now i'm seeing myslef doing just that. I was a very cheerfull person and often helped people with this sort of problems , but now i'm facing that problem myslef.",10Mar2019,0

310,"hey! the things that have caused me to think so are:

I‚Äôve noticed a male teacher always calls me ‚Äòdarling‚Äô or ‚Äòsweetheart‚Äô all the time when he rarely does to other girls and doesn‚Äôt do it to any boys.

He also uses a way softer voice and a slightly patronising tone sometimes I feel, like you‚Äôd speak to a toddler asking a silly question which annoys me because I‚Äôm 17 years old (he‚Äôs 32) and I‚Äôm certainly not stupid. 

He always uses his hands to guide me to things ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what to call this, but for example if he wanted someone else to go in front he‚Äôd just tell them so. If he wanted me to go in front he‚Äôd put his hand on my back or arm and then say it. 

He asks if I‚Äôm alright quite often, as if I‚Äôm doing something to suggest I‚Äôm not? Also, he doesn‚Äôt ask others, just me, once again with a concerned soft-ish voice.

I think there are more things I can‚Äôt think of right now but I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy! Does it seem like he treats me like a small child to you?

The general consensus in askwomenadvice was that it was grooming and even if it wasn‚Äôt I should say something to either him or a trusted adult. However I don‚Äôt have the confidence to speak to him and I have no trusted adults :/ I‚Äôd love some other opinions. ",10Mar2019,0
313,"My mom kicked my dad out in 2011 and cut off all ties with him, so I grew up thinking I‚Äôll never see him again and was fine with it since the last few months he was with us he was very mean and cold. Well in 2015 my mom kicked me out of her house and I was living with my aunt for a few months and then I lived with a friend for a few months and then I was homeless for a few weeks. My friend told me I should call my dad who I haven‚Äôt seen in four years and see if I can live with him. He has a new girlfriend and two kids so when I met him for the first time again, I met his girlfriend and two kids. It was amazing seeing my dad again and his girlfriend and two new brothers, but a lot of buried emotions came up and I think I‚Äôm still dealing with it now. It‚Äôs been over two years and I‚Äôm still living with him, but it doesn‚Äôt feel right. Idk why, it‚Äôs like I block out my past when I‚Äôm in the house and once I go to my moms all the memories that made me ‚Äúme‚Äù come back. I‚Äôve been having bad anxiety and depression a lot which goes away when I leave the house for the day. My step mom speaks spanish(they got married last year) and she is so nice to me (through broken English) but I‚Äôve always felt like I was left out and never got to really see m dads relationship with her because they speak in a different language about 98% of the time. I‚Äôve told them how I felt and he said that she will speak English more, she hasn‚Äôt. I gave up, got an Airbnb for a few weeks but couldn‚Äôt afford it so went back to my dads. Idk why I don‚Äôt feel comfortable. Could it be because I‚Äôm used to not being with my dad anymore and my mom was constantly telling me that he hates me and never loved me..it just doesn‚Äôt feel right here so just the thought of him makes me nervous sometimes..I literally been having bad insomnia, depression and some anxiety through the days. I don‚Äôt really think the Spanish talking is the problem..it‚Äôs part of the problem of me feeling left out every day of my life but it‚Äôs more so or me having a hard time of accepting the fact my dad has a new family and family dynamic that I don‚Äôt really fit into.

314,"I'm still in high school though, but I can't help to think. I want to be an ophthalmologist. I'm Asian, and I don't really trust my country when it comes to education. I can be an ophthalmologist here for sure but the level of education is more advanced in America and also i've always wanted to go abroad. If ever I finish high school, i'd fly somewhere in America. I'd enroll for a university that offers a course on ophthalmology. However, I also wanted to be an actress. You may think it sounds crazy but i've been interested in performing arts. Schools that I know offer a 4 year course on music, drama, and performing arts. While ophthalmology, a branch in medical science, obviously would take longer and 8 years to finish. So what do you think? Should I go for being dual-enrolled or just go for the performing school first? I don't want to start learning about arts when i'm already 30. I'm concerned of my age by the way. When i'm 34 atleast i get things done. Although dual enrollment would be 4 years less and i'd enjoy most of my 30s. So what do you think?

318,"I'm going to preface this and say that I haven't got a clear structure in mind for how I'm going to write everything down. I figure I'll go from childhood and then work my way up to the present day.

So, some background: I was born in England in the early 90's. My parents are white and I was raised in pretty much poverty. I, obviously, can't remember my early years but I know that we went without quite a bit.

I was raised on a farm about two miles from any kids I went to school with, and I was an only child. The only kid near me was one who lived across the street. That kid was what you'd call a, 'problem child' who'd yell, and I mean yell and screech at his mum almost every day. Even when I was there.

My dad was mostly absent during these times. He just wasn't there. I don't know where he was. I do know one story about him, though. Apparently my mother's foal died on the farm. She buried it out back and he got into an argument with her or something. Either way, his reaction was to do fat doughnuts over the grave of the dead horse.

I was diagnosed with two lazy eyes around 1995, and had to be taken out of school for about four months. More isolation for me. When I returned, I was playing catch up, and the teacher insinuated to me that I was stupid, dumb, a total waste of time to teach. Somehow the kids in school picked up on that vibe and I was bullied pretty horrendously. Now I wasn't just alone at home, I was more alone in school, too. Again, my only friend was the kid across the road who would shout at his mum, and sometimes, I'd return home and see the shouting there, too. I grew up around a lot of shouting.

I remember playing alone a lot. Falling into my own head, my own imagination, to make things fun. I would go off to the nearby footpath and just dive beneath hedges and play. I remember being excited for sponsored bike rides or cool events near me, like book fairs to science museums, and my dad turning down all of them. There was a family friend who would come to eat with us every week who played more with me than my own dad.

I eventually made it to secondary school where the bullying scaled down, but was still a feature. My brother was born in the early 2000's, so my dad's attention was focussed on him. We also moved from the farm to a different farm. I was given a generous sized room, but it was still far from any other people. I did make a new friend in the village, though, and his home life was much more healthier.

With GCSE's coming up, I developed OCD. OCD is of course paired with anxiety, so I would find myself doing rituals. I would do something a number of times, just to make it ""feel"" right. I would wash my hands a number of time, leaving the hot tap on, scolding my hands on purpose, just so I could get the number right. All this to feel some kind of control. It doesn't take a genius to see that up till then, my life hadn't had much control. The conflict, the yelling, the anger from other people. I think I just needed something that I could define, rather than other people doing it. I got help with the OCD. An Argentinian doctor talked to me every week with my mum in the room. He asked me if I resented my dad. I can't remember what I answered, but my mum was quiet on the drive home.

I took Prozac for a little while, but it was actually comic books that helped me the most. I've deconstructed this in my head and I theorise the fact that they're about underdogs; people overcoming a faceless big bad enemy, or about finding friendship or a meek and mild person finding power, meant that I naturally gravitated towards them. I'm not saying that every comic book fan is the same, but for me, I think it's clear that I projected a lot of my life onto those heroes (especially Spider-Man and Hellboy, both heroes who have complicated relationships with friends and family).

I joined YouTube in 2007 and started making videos. With them came validation. I got comments from people all around the world saying that they laughed. Finally, I got the support that my father didn't provide. I was addicted. I'd make a video every day, just to get some form of attention. It felt like a mission, like I was important and had a duty to entertain.

With this determination to make video after video, my grades slipped. I failed my first year of higher education and I felt nothing. I just wanted to make more videos. Grades weren't telling me nice things, so why bother? About this time, my dad bought a Range Rover. His dream car. He came home with it one day and was boasting about it to everyone. I was editing a video at a time, and he demanded that the whole family went out in it. I said I didn't want to, I was neck deep in a video and I wanted to edit it. I didn't yell, I didn't cry or scream, I just told him that I wanted to stay and enjoy what I enjoyed.

He ripped my shirt, the first comic book shirt I ever bought, and held me down on the ground. He put his hands around my neck and applied pressure harder and harder. My eyes stung and and face felt like it was going to explode. I could see blackness coming around the sides. I could see my mum watching and I hoped, I mentally begged, that she would do something. That she would shove him off and kick him out. I blacked out. I came to as he was dragged me, bare foot, across the yard and threw me in the back of the car. He told me that if I cried, if I made a single sound, he'd do it all over again.

I got expelled from school shortly after. During a retake of the second year, the head of higher education took me into his office and said that he just didn't want me in the school anymore. I was distracted, failing classes, but most of all, he didn't like me. 'You're nothing,' he told me, 'you're nothing and you'll always be nothing.' You may think that I made that up for dramatic effect, but hand on my heart, those were his words.

YouTube wasn't fun anymore. Nothing was. I stopped my passion and took up a low wage fast food job. I hated it. My friends completed their higher education and moved away for university. I was left behind.

Depression came along and I was down to one meal a day and sleeping for 18 hours at a time. I got into comics fervently and whatever time I spent awake was reading more and more. I've heard that depression is, 'self-limiting', and after a period of time, so long as you're doing something, it'll pass. Time heals all wounds. I tried six sessions of counselling and it didn't do much. A woman with short grey hair sat in a chair and said, 'that must be tough' over and over.

I started to use sex as a vice. I wasn't rich enough for alcohol, smoking or gambling and drugs scare me, so I went for sex. I was chained to the feeling that someone would like me. They wanted me and they found me attractive. Flirting, romance, seduction were all things that made me the centre of attention and the person I was talking to wanted me to talk to them. It was unhealthy.

In 2011, I found out that my dad had cheated on my mother. Not physically, so I was told, but emotionally cheating. I knew something was up because he smelt like perfume once. It kills me that I knew something was up and I let it slide. After hearing that, I refused to eat with the family. I still don't go to any, 'family' events. You may see this as me being stubborn and unforgiving, but I'm a firm believer that once trust and commitment is broken, unless a large show of remorse is shown, and apologies are handed out, it's meaningless.

My parents decided to have their vows renewed and commemorate it with a ceremony. I didn't go. It felt false. It felt like it came way too quick and my father didn't mean it.

That same year, I got into a relationship with someone who cheated on me. Her family, I later found out, was totally unaware of my existence. She had hidden me.

I had, miraculously, found a circle of friends. They were from the local area and there was about twenty of us in total. We did a lot together, and for once, I felt like I had more than enough people to confide and have fun with. One person in the group started a rumour. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a miscommunication, but I'm human, so maybe I'm wrong. The rumour made me lash out. I became defensive. I couldn't handle the thought of losing the people around me, which made me even more irrational when people tried to talk to me. I ended up isolating myself. I chose to burn bridges whilst trying to save them.

On the 29th of October 2013, it happened again. There was an argument with my father. My brother was due to go into secondary school and my parents were looking to put him into private education. I was furious and jealous. On reflection, I should've been happy. He has borderline Asperger's and the help he would've got could've propelled him further. But I was young and I was angry. I'd spent my whole school life told by the teachers that I was dumb, bullied by kids, struggling internally and then my younger brother was going to be supported?

It hurt enough that my dad would audibly say to my brother, 'I love you' every night. I couldn't, and still can't, remember when he said that to me last. My brother was like a do-over for raising a kid. I was the failed prototype. The first car you get when you pass your test. Who cares if it's got dings, scratches and bumps? I'll treat the next car much better.

With my anger, built up from being alone, from unhealthy relationships with women and now my brother being treated better, I lashed out. I screamed and cried. I wanted to be heard.

My father put his hand on my throat again. This time he gripped harder than before. I felt my face get hot again. I scrambled my hands against his arm and his face, but he clamped firmer. I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I grabbed my phone, left out an open window and ran down the street, calling the police. I kept repeating, 'I thought I was going to die, I thought I was going to die, I thought I was going to die'.

The police talked to me and they talked to my dad. No proof. Just me and him in the room when it happened. They didn't investigate and they didn't ask if I wanted to press charges. I don't know what he told them in the interrogation room, but it must've been some top grade bull.

I left the house for a while and stayed with my friends in the city for four or so days. When I came back, I was woken up one morning by my dad choking me, again. He had his knee on my chest and his hand on my throat. 'This doesn't f$$king happen in MY house', he told me. 'The police do not come into MY f$$cking house'. Message received.

I tried to leave. I went to college to learn media production, to try and reignite my love of making films. The course fell apart due to a lecturer resigning and I got my money refunded. I tried to run different businesses. One where I was selling shirts and another walking and looking after pets, but they both dried up. The business orientated people of the world would say that's on me. Money is out there. I'd agree. My heart was never in it. My self esteem isn't high enough for a self-made business.

Earlier this year, my maternal grandfather passed away. He was the only male grandparent I really spoke to. He was nice enough company. I spent three weeks preparing a eulogy for his wedding when I then found out that he had done 'something' away from home. I've been told by different family members different things. Some people confirm that he kissed another woman, some people say he was just tempted. I, personally, don't know the true concrete facts. Again, things were hidden from me. All I know is, it trashed my opinion of him. To learn that my father had emotionally cheated was enough, but now my grandfather too? It made me feel like I was cursed. Like I'd be borne from a lineage of men who just do whatever the f$$k they want to women. I'm not a huge social justice crusader but to see, first hand, patriarchal belligerence crushed me. These were men that were supposed to teach me how to act, how to be good and kind, but all I really had for that were superheroes.

I didn't go to his funeral. I had texts that day from people, some from family members, some from people who aren't related at all, saying all sorts of things. I had Facebook messages, informing me that I'd declared war. My family had turned their back on me because I didn't want to support a man who was, at the least, tempted to cheat and at most, did cheat. I felt, and still do feel, like my reasoning is ignored. I've grown up, all my life, around people who cheat. From the kid's dad across the road, to my father, to the women who have cheated on me. It is all infidelity and secrecy. I couldn't support that. I still can't.

The two main takes I got from my family were, 'it happened years ago, why are you bothered?' and, 'it was nothing to do with you, why are you upset?' My emotions are being smothered and censored because I am not toeing the line. I'm being told that if I just accept it, if I just acknowledge that people cheat, that everyone is a monster, that everyone's evil, life will be much easier. Everyone does it! Just relax! I feel like I'm going crazy when people say that to my face. Are we just accepting this now? Are we all that defeated?

But the thing that hurt me the most is that me and my brother weren't told about my grandfather's actions. It only came out by a slip of the tongue. We weren't supposed to be told. We were never supposed to know about any of it, but now we do and I'm the issue. What else is there that we don't know? What dark secrets are out there that me and my brother aren't privy to? When I see my family, what topics are they avoiding when I'm in the room? What's an off-limits topic? I don't know. I suspect I'll never know.

I'm told, by my mother, that it was done to protect me. I'm in my late twenties, I am an adult. She confesses that it was selfish of her to not say anything, but she wanted to preserve the status quo of the house and see me as support, but I wonder, what is the status quo? Being ignorant of another man's sin against a woman? I also wonder, where is my support in all of this? You chose to use me, to take me at who I am, just to make yourself feel better, but when I find out about my grandfather, I am rejected. I am told that I am wrong, my feelings are wrong and everything I feel is due to misinformation and you should really be like everyone else.

I found out just days ago that my father had another affair. A full blown one. Do you remember how I said I never went to the wedding vow renewal because I knew it was bull? I hate being right about things like that. I knew he'd do something. You could argue, 'but you didn't support him, so he didn't feel like he was believed in, so that's why he did it' but I disagree. Men like him do what they want, and he didn't ask for my help to stop him in 2011 the first time he did it.

When I confronted them, he did a half smile, a snort and said, 'what do you want me to say? I'm sorry? Well, I am'. It took me to find out, to confront him, to say it. It wasn't off his back, or because of a feeling of guilt, or a need to do the right thing. I had to demand it.

I was angry. So angry. I still am. This is a man who would go and do things with another woman whilst my mother was nursing her sick father. He would then come home, during the weekdays, and get fed, his clothes washed, his chores done and then do it all again on the weekends. The disrespect staggers me. The ability to just take and take and take and take and consume the love from others but give none of it back. It's the ultimate evil.

The news of this affair didn't reach me first. My grandfather, the one who passed, knew. So say, he wanted to tell me, but he didn't. Another secret held. People who aren't even in the family knew. Friends of the family, other family members. Anyone who wasn't me and my brother knew. I have never felt so embarrassed. It feels humiliating, like I'm being wrapped with bubble wrap because I can't handle the adult table. When I lash out, like I have, the answer is, 'well, we knew you'd react like this'. How observant of you to note that someone who is excluded would be upset. If only you didn't exclude them, then they wouldn't have gotten upset. It's like you're so close to the answer, but you just don't get it.

And, then, of course, because I've reacted badly to two secrets being dropped, more are going to be kept from me. It's a circle.

I've been trying to get out of the house lately. I started going to the gym and doing yoga there. My membership was a gift for Christmas. But after learning about what my father did, I just lost interest. I feel like it's bankrolled by him and if it's paid for out of his pocket, it's debt. That's how it works with him. It's something to hold over you. It's a, 'if it wasn't for me...' card. I also felt like the gym was a dress routine. I was there for two hours or so just to say that I was doing something. Sure, I looked a little fitter, but I didn't feel some crazy change.

I go to a board game night at a local pub on Thursdays. It's pretty much the only physical interaction I have with other people. This past Thursday, I played my games, laughed, joked, got into my car and had to physically fight the urge to not slam into into a wall. I got home, passed the very man who caused me to feel those things, went downstairs and sat at my desk and wondered what I should do. I packed a bag, went to the hospital and told them I wasn't feeling well mentally. I stayed there overnight and in the morning I had a psych evaluation with a mental health specialist.

He told me that I'm not depressed, I'm not psychotic, I'm not crazy or schizophrenic. I have deep, piercing emotional trauma that has never been touched. I'm in my late twenties and it's not even been remotely addressed by any doctor, and that means that it's just out of control now. I've lived these past years trying to keep it in check, doing what I can to distract myself, but now I can't.

This is, I have to remind you, after my father has been in my life every day. I suffer with generalised anxiety disorder, so my work life has been varied and short. I can't hold down jobs and I can't hold down relationships without suspecting something is wrong, I'm trapped or I'm going to do something wrong. This meant that the only way I could get money is with the man who abused me doing manual work. I had to make an actual deal with the devil just to make money in my life. I would plug in my headphones, wear ear protectors, do anything to drown out his voice. Sometimes we wouldn't actually speak to each other during the entire day, which I loved. Sometimes we'd have to, and the insults and put-downs would be like a chain gun. It makes me feel sick that I had to do that. I had to compromise my stance just to make money. 'Just remember who pays you,' I can imagine him saying. Sometimes he'd withhold the money I was owed for a week or two at a time. I don't know why. A power thing, I think.

My mother won't have any of it. She herself suffered from a sprained arm at his hand. He's smashed her glasses, yelled, poked, shoved and intimidated her into thinking and speaking a certain way. He's hidden invites for social events from her, making her more isolated from people. My hypothesis for this is that he doesn't want her talking to other couples. He doesn't want her finding out that this isn't normal. This isn't how husbands and fathers behave. He wants to keep her as blind as possible.

She categorically maintains that she loves him and divorce is off the table. She is not leaving him. She wails and moans that she has no idea what she'd do if she leaves him. Divorce, living alone, sleeping in a bed with no one else are all terrifying things to her, which I understand. I get that. But where is the line in the sand? Does my father need to cheat again? He renewed his vows with her, he promised to never do anything again, and yet we're here. In front of everyone, all of her friends and family, he said he would be a good husband and yet...

Is it humiliation? Is it a pride thing? Is it ego? Is it admitting defeat to file for divorce? I don't understand. Who would sneer at a woman walking away from a man who destroyed her trust? Who would see it as failure to abandon the man who took her for granted?

By staying with him, she condemns me and my brother to living with the monster who has done so much harm. He is the root cause of all the hurt in this house. The lying, the cheating, the physical harm, the financial games he's played with me. Every single problem comes back to him.

But when I say this, my mother makes excuses. 'I'm not so great to live with, either' and, 'he puts me in my place when I need it' are lines I've heard. She's so convinced that he's a good person underneath and that he's just, 'born that way' or, 'he doesn't know how to say things' that any and all issues can be hand-waved with an excuse. Everything can be forgiven, apparently. There can be no punishment, no prohibition or warnings. Even though I can remember her saying to me that if he committed another affair, she'd leave. Yet we're still here. We're all here. Stuck.

She's convinced that if she leaves him, she'd have to leave this farm and live in a house somewhere alone, without her animals. She seems to think that she won't have any friends around her, that her aunties and uncles will disown her for getting away from a toxic man. It couldn't be further from the truth. If everyone knew, and I mean if everyone knew about all the stuff he's done to her, to me, they'd understand. They'd celebrate her power to walk away.

I've said some awful things to her the past few days, which some of it, I still believe. I think she's selfish for not telling me and my brother, I still think she's selfish for living here just because it seems like it's the easier option, but if she left him... If she actually said, 'you know what, your actions, your inflictions on this family have gone on too far. Your child seriously debated killing himself over your cumulated actions over the years. You have hurt me, you've hurt your children, you have done it time and time again and I can't let you keep doing it, because your behaviour does not change, even with vows and ceremonies,' and left him, I would cry with happiness. It'd be the best day of my life. I'd do anything and everything to help her. I would even listen to and attend whatever religious event she wanted.

But I know it won't happen. He has too much control.

For those wondering, I don't know how my brother feels. My mother will deny it, but I remember my father dislocating his shoulder when he was a newborn. My memory is hazy, I must've been a preteen at the time, but I remember hearing shouting and crying. I think my brain is trying to cover something up. She says that he did it whilst dressing him, and it's some kind of known thing, but I've done research and every article says that you have to apply a eyebrow raising amount of force to do it. After his history with anger, I therefore have to suspect that there was something happening. Again, my memory of the event is clouded, but I remember shouting.

So, to recap: bad enough anxiety that holding down a job is an actual struggle, isolated emotionally, minimal social life, trust issues on a wild scale and a family that's turned their back on me, or keeping secrets.

I am talking to someone who will get me onto the road to volunteer work, but it's tough. I keep losing my motivation. After my first meeting with my case worker, I almost cried twice on the way home. I finally felt hope. But now, after learning about the affair, it's knocked everything down. I can't be bothered. I can't be bothered with any of it.

It feels like I have to work twice as hard to just escape this pit, meanwhile my father can just do as he pleases. He won't go to therapy, he's not the one wanting to kill himself, he's not doing anything to change his behaviour, which makes me feel like, what's the point? I've lived up until my late twenties, almost three decades, and he hasn't changed his attitude towards me ever. He'll happily say I love you to my brother, but me? Never had time. I keep wondering what I did that was so bad for him to hate me so much? What was it? What did a child do to inflict so much pain on them, and then a young adult, and now me? What did he want from me? If he just said he wanted me to enjoy rugby like he does, or want me to work on the farm, or learn engineering, why didn't he just say? Why didn't he take me to rugby classes as a kid, if he wanted that so badly? He did less than minimum in his efforts to shape me, but is apparently upset that I'm nothing like him. Or maybe his anger is from the fact I'm nothing like him. That I actually have morals. That I feel more than bad when I hurt someone.

I'm posting this here because I just wanted to get it all off my chest. I'm not begging for someone to swoop in and save me (although, don't we all wish for that?), I just wanted to say it. I wanted to make sense of it. 

I'll talk, if you want to talk to me. If you want to ask questions, I'll answer them. I'm not dropping this and leaving.

If anyone does have any epiphanies about this situation, I'd love to hear them. As you might have guessed, I don't like being here.

Thank you, if you read all the way to the bottom. I bet there's some people who've finished this and said, 'f$$king hell, glad that's not me' and to that I say, I'm glad I made you look at your surroundings and appreciate it. Appreciate everything you have. If you are lucky enough to have a loving father, go and f$$king call him, or text him. Let them know how great they are.

319,"2 days ago I dropped my phone into some ketchup, I wiped it off but didn‚Äôt get much of the inside. Yesterday I realised I could only hear music from one ear, I thought it was just my earphones so I tried to adjust it and turn it around, then I went into settings and tried the volume slider and it still wouldn‚Äôt work, then I remembered what happened the day before so I tried to use a toothpick and take whatever was inside it out but it just made it worse. I couldn‚Äôt hear from the other side at all, I could only hear from one side. 
Today I tried fixing it with a paper clip but it wouldn‚Äôt work, then I tried the earphones on a different device (my iPad) and it wasn‚Äôt working, so then I thought it was just my earphones, I tried on my second pair or earphones going for it to work, but it didn‚Äôt work, music only came out of one side, I tried it on my iPad and I got the same result, I should‚Äôve tried it on my iPad first to make sure it works and it‚Äôs just my headphone jack. Now both of my earphones are broken because of that, I don‚Äôt know how to fix it even though I‚Äôve searched on YouTube looking for a solution.

322,"Hi,

I'm a 17 year old dude from Nebraska. I have quite a few mental health issues that trouble me but the one thing that makes me happy is just being in a new place. It's absolutely what I want to do with life, to be able to go wherever I want.

The problem is, I have no money. I don't come from a family of money. Nobody here has any money to do this. Working long hours to make money is a huge drain on my mental health especially since all the jobs at my age require standing up the entire time so I don't know if I can do that. 

I feel like if I'm not able to accomplish my dream I'll just end up ending it all and I don't know how I'm supposed to be able to do what I want with life given my upbringing and family.

Is there something I'm missing? Is there anything I can do to help accomplish this?",10Mar2019,2

326,"So, the title is basically my issue. My 19 yo brother ran away from home. Got in a minor arguement with my mom and I called him out on being a little shit. He left for school the next day like any regular Monday. But he hasnt come home since.

A little background, we are first gen immigrants and there are culture differences I guess along with language barriers between my parents and him because we came to canada when he was so young. Us siblings are really close. Due to this, he thinks we are a super disfunctional family and he hates the parents. He blames all his mental issues on primarily my mom. Through this though, my brother, sister and I are pretty inseperable most days and even if we do get into arguements, it quickly dissolves when either of us want to go on a late night mcdonalds run lol. He is a highly academic kid and I know he doesnt do drugs or drink cause he is either at school, or he is always home studying his head off.

Since he has left, he blocked everyone on his phone so there is no way to get in touch with him. I tried emailing him but I dont know if he reads them or what. We are not even friends on facebook cause he would rather keep his social life private from his family for some reason. He has been gone for a week now. I really miss him. I have been losing sleep and on the odd times that I do fall asleep, Ive been having nightmares since he left. I know he is safe and he wouldnt do anything to risk the academics he built up. My mom said give him his space when I suggested going to his uni and looking for him and she is surprisingly understanding about his situation. This doesnt mean that she isnt worried. She is worried sick. And I miss him so much. I just wish he would tell me where he is. I feel even more betrayed cause any hard times he would go through, he would tell me about it and now it seems he put me on the other side of his world. I miss him to death.

Do you guys think he will come back. I want to give him his time so Im not actively looking for him. Calling the cops will make him hate the family more and that will just make sure that he never comes home again. But I just want to know if anyone has gone through this before.",10Mar2019,1
327,"Just a bit of background, I'm a 19 yo in my second semester of my second year at uni. I was a stellar student in high school and I essentially got enough smaller grants and scholarships so that I'd have a full ride through college but my whole life went to shit starting from a year ago. I want to preface the rest of this post by saying that I know full well that I'm in my current predicament because of the stupid decisions I've made until now, and I accept full responsibility, but I really need advice on what to do starting from this moment forward.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a good relationship with my parents, as they are super strict and fully expected me to become a doctor or something in the medical field, and I kinda just rolled with it. My first semester of uni went great, 4.0 gpa, long distance dating my highschool sweetheart. The next semester (last year) gf broke up with me through text on valentine's day. I was incredibly stressed and sad for quite a long time after that because she was pretty much the only person I had a really strong bond with since things with my family were so rough. I skipped a lot of classes for the rest of that semester, I just couldn't bring myself to function as I really thought hard about what I wanted out of life. Until that point, I was working hard for my pre-med degree to keep my parents happy, and I thought that once I graduated I'd be able to go back to my gf and have a nice happy relationship, but being cut off from both of those external influences really made me realize that I wasn't happy studying what I was studying. Still, I had a lot of credit for the medical degree due to taking several dual credit courses in high school, so I pulled my self together somewhat and barely passed the semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to barely scraping by, I was put on a pseudo-probation for my degree and several scholarships. I had to bring my GPA up by taking summer courses so I pleaded with my parents to just pay for a few summer classes, which they did reluctantly. Unfortunately, I couldn't reach the required GPA to retain my degree by the end of the summer, so I was forced to pick a different major for the fall 2018 semester. Now this should have been my wake-up call. I was kicked from my degree, but I was still receiving a majority of the scholarships so I still wouldn't have to worry about paying for my tuition. But I just couldn't handle the thought of disappointing my parents even more, so instead of exploring with a degree that I might be fully motivated to study, I chose what was essentially a ""pre-med lite"" sort of major, where if I excelled I could get back into the medical program. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I just couldn't do it. Yet again, I performed incredibly poorly and that brings us to the start of the spring semester of 2019. I haven't been telling my parents how much I've completely bombed my academic career. As far as they know, I'm doing ""fine"". Yet again I couldn't bring myself to disappoint my parents further so I scraped up the last of my money together and registered for classes anyway, although my entire savings put together would only pay for about 1/5 of my tuition. This whole semester so far I've doing incredibly poorly, I couldn't even afford all the textbooks and online resources necessary for my classes, and I've starved so much over the past 3 months. There absolutely no way I can pass with the grades that I've got now, and to make things worse I'm literally out of money, behind on rent payment, behind on tuition payment, and I was due to start the 12 hour drive back to my hometown today for spring break, but I've bought some time by telling my parents that I'm tired and going to start the drive tomorrow, even though I literally can't even afford the gas it would take to drive the distance. I can not bring myself to tell them about my situation, I'm literally so afraid of disappointing them that I've starved till now to avoid asking for money. I'm the only person from my hometown to come to this uni, and so none of the friends I've made here I feel comfortable enough asking money from. I can't get a loan because I don't have a job, and I can't get a job because I don't have a degree. I've considered suicide so much for the past year now, and I'm in my last 24 hours before I just off myself or come clean or do something that changes my situation. ",10Mar2019,2

337,"Hey. This is kinda a last resort I guess because I don‚Äôt know what else to do or who to talk to. I‚Äôm a 25 year old female. I‚Äôm finishing up my first year of my career (teacher), in a great place mentally (mostly), and am looking for a place to live on my own and start my life as me. I have always been the kind of person who didn‚Äôt have a set group of friends and could go between different groups, and after college I still do that, but I have some friends that I am more consistent with than others in terms of hanging out. However, lately, it feels like not a single person I‚Äôm ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with gives a shit if I‚Äôm around or not. They do stuff without me (and will even send me snaps of them doing this), they are never available if I ask to hang out, and I am always the first one to text or reach out. I don‚Äôt remember the last time someone asked me to do something. To add some detail, two very close friends of mine from different groups started dating each other. These two are the kind of people who, when in a relationship, only care about their SO and kinda forget everyone else. When they started talking and stuff I was super supportive but just kinda said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt leave me in the dust please‚Äù and they each were like ‚Äúwe would never‚Äù. Well now they have. I had a really great friend who always made sure to include me in stuff, and he was usually the one to get people together to hang out. He passed away a little over a year ago, and after he passed my group and I hung out all the time and stuff. Now, it‚Äôs like we barely talk or see each other. And it terms of my friends in other groups, same thing. I‚Äôm the one who reaches out. They are always ‚Äúbusy‚Äù or just don‚Äôt even answer.

344,"TL;DR at bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot that has happened to me in the past year, and I feel like taking a year of community college and then transferring is the best thing for me at this point. I'm hesitant to do this, however, because I am very ""school"" smart and I've been expected to attend a 4-year college right out of high school since I was young. The first problem with this is that I had no idea what career I want to pursue, or even a field in which I am most interested, I like mostly everything. The only thing I've been able to conclude is that I can't do something computer oriented like programming because that is one of the few things I haven't been able to learn, even by a private instructor. The second problem is that I don't think I can deal with another big change. Last year I started my transition from female to male through hormonal transition therapy and I am now settling into the developments in my body and the changes of family and society, passing isn't the problem, but of course this change has consumed my attention for the past 3 years. The third issue I've had is my parents separating. This happened a few months before I started hrt. My parents were having issues before but they told my brother and I on valentines that they were separating and the next day my dad moved out to live with his girlfriend. That also took a lot of my attention and has hurt me mentally, I began going back to therapy because of this and the fact I don't like my dad's girlfriend. With all of this combined, I don't think moving away to go to a school that costs a 20k a year and to try and navigate without a somewhat more clear vision is that right decision for me. I want some feeling of normalcy and the community college I'm looking at is only 20 minutes away. This would give me room to get a job and stay with my parents if I liked, or look to a friend for a room mate to see how living on ""my own"" would go. Any advice or suggestions are welcome :).

The worst part is that she is dating my friend and has been since about mid April last year, and it‚Äôs my closest friend that I‚Äôve known for 9 years, so I have to sit back and watch while he dates the girl I had a crush on and got rejected by. That on top of the fact that I have no male support in my life has given me a major confidence drop. The only thing I‚Äôm good at is video games, I was top 100 on console for fortnite, I was top 50 for bo3 for a while, and I was good at other games as well, but no girls in my school play games, and that is my only real passion, so it gives me the mentality of why try, the interesting girls will come in the future, but that mentality has really made me let my self go, making my confidence even lower. Any advice on how to heighten confidence would be greatly appreciated.",10Mar2019,1
356,"So, background, I'm currently 16, uncircumcised, with phimosis. I HAVE seen a doctor about my foreskin, and am now on the NHS waiting list for circumcision. I can, however, pull back my foreskin a bit, and noticed some of the head is white in colour. Did a quick google search and came to the realisation that because I masturbate a lot and am somewhat sexually active, this is likely smegma. The problem is, I haven't washed it thoroughly for most of my life due to the pain from the phimosis. 

So, 2 questions: 
1) How bad is this? None of my sexual partners have complained about a foul smell, so I don't think it's THAT bad.
2) Can I fully fix this by cleaning properly post-circumcision?

357,"So I'm a competent and good person with a lot to offer, I'm fairly intelligent given that in the past I managed to get a full scholarship to my (and others') dream college.

However after college, I've had it super rough. I've been bouncing from shitty job to shitty job with long stretches of unemployment. I've been unemployed now for about a year now. I decided to take the risk and apply to grad school - twice - but was rejected. I can barely hold a job because I've been told I seem like I don't want to be there and am bad at hiding my true feelings.

I apply to a lot of stuff but it's almost like everyone makes excuses why NOT to hire me/accept me, even when I tailor my resume etc. I look at people from high school who were all in lower level classes than me and many of them are engineers/coders/bankers etc. People always wonder why I can't seem to have any luck at all and frankly I don't know either.

358,"Hi people of Reddit,

I've been driving for one and a half years now. When I passed my test I was fortunate enough to be doing my apprenticeship and was able to get a 2017 Volkswagen Polo on PCP finance. At the time it was a good choice. I'm out of of my apprenticeship in September and will be in my second year of driving. There is nothing wrong with me car, I just want something bigger. So I have found a Vaxhuall Astra that is a 67 plate (2018 registered though) with a 1.6 litre diesel engine with 136 brake horse power. It has more power than the polo (as it was a 1.0 litre petrol with 75 brake horse power). At has more tech than the polo, and due to the safety features of the Astra the insurance is only ¬£100 different. 

The Astra would be on HP finance so in the long run it would be better as I want to save for a house. The monthly payments would increase by ¬£100 (which I can easily manage) and with my girl friend going to Uni it allows me to do as many Miles as I want with out fee. As well as this a diesel is better for motor way driving. 

The fact and figures in my opinion point towards the Astra, but I feel attached to my Polo. And I don't know why? I think it's because I have experienced so much with it, made so many memories and it was my first car. I feel like I shouldn't let go yet. But at the same time I feel like I've out grown it. 

If you was in my position, what would you want to do? And if your answer is to swap cars, how would you deal with the emotions of saying good bye to the car?",10Mar2019,1

364,"I'm a 27 y.o. woman with a master's degree in music. I have some debt, it's manageable, but it does loom over my head sometimes. I'd like music-making to be a big part of my life (writing and playing), even though I still don't know if I have that much to offer. Making a living in my home country (the US) wasn't going that well. Currently teaching English in China, which I've been doing almost nine months. Need to make a decision of where I'm gonna go next soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I have four options that I'm looking at right now.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Go to graduate school and study music therapy. It's a three year course, I'll get further in debt and I dunno if I really want such an all-consuming endeavor for a day job.
2. Go to NYC, do a service year (which would pay of a nice chunk of debt) to get connections to a solid day job. Might end up overwhelmed by the amount of hustling I need to do to stay afloat and forget about my goals. I wish I could just forget about NYC as an option, but all of the music I love comes from there and mostly nowhere else and part of me feels like there's gotta be a benefit to surrounding myself with such great music. Thinking I may have to try living there at some point, so why postpone it?
3. Go to Germany and au pair for this mom and son. The mom is a professor, the son is surprisingly mature and self-directed, and they live a five minute walk away from the woods. Seems like a grand place to really step into writing music (I'm kinda new at it). I just worry I'll feel like I have no momentum. Also wish I could pay off more debt.
4. Go to another city in China and teach for an international school that I got connected with. Pay is great, job sounds easier than my current one (so more time for writing music), music related which is a plus. But makes me sad to stay in China but move cities away from my friends-- I'd have the pain of moving home but not paired with the novelty of a new country.

367,"Ill make a quick cast to simplify it

Me: Me

A: Best Friend

B: Friend who I offended

C: Other ""Friend""

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been best friends with A for nearly 5 years now, I've known of his other friends but only started talking to them back in November 2018. In late 2018 we were playing Fortnite playgrounds and everyone was trash talking and joking about others, So I said a pretty unfunny joke:  


""B sounds like someone who would have Erectile Dysfunction.""

I have never met B in person, and only knew him for about a week. I guess he was a bit taken back, Nobody pulled a joke on B that entire time. he most likely didn't deserve that (C was the one being super trashy.) and I almost immediately apologized, including in the voice chat and through XBOX pms. I can't fully remember but I'm sure he apologized and said it was fine, We never really played after that, but occasionally partied up with A.

Later in maybe December, A came and told me that they were making fun of me behind my back (Something I never did with them, of course.) and other insults, I never really cared about insults but I immediately knew I had made a mistake. B's friend C was there when I made the joke, and now he hates me for it as well.

Fast forward to 2019 and they STILL have a grudge, even after apologizing. I reached the breaking point today when I was in a party with A, C joins and mentions he has me blocked on party. A asks why, and C just says: ""You don't remember?"" A just says No.

&amp;#x200B;

What are my options here? I've considered privately confronting him about it, and apologizing to B again, and hopefully better. I'm tired of the awkward silence and the lack of resolving the issue.

3. In one of my classes she sits in front of me and will constantly turn around to talk to me.

She will take it and hide it all the time so I don't have a pencil and I usually mock complain in a sad way and we usually laugh a lot about it.

5. We will constantly text to each other.

376,"Hi, everybody. I'm in an extremely bleak emotional space and need as much insight/advice about this situation as I can get. Be warned that is post is extremely long, which I'm deeply sorry for, but it's all so complicated and I figured the more context I can provide, the more sense it will all make.

Background on me: I‚Äôm a 32 year old male and live in a major city in the Northeastern U.S. I‚Äôve recently come to accept that I have suffered from intense depression and anxiety for well over a decade but have seldom acknowledged it or attempted to treat it, despite its demonstrably deleterious effects on my life. This will be important later.

I‚Äôve only ever had one long term girlfriend of two and a half years, and we split up almost nine years ago, when I was 23. Since then, I‚Äôve drifted from casual relationship to casual relationship, and a ton of first dates that went exactly nowhere, and long stretches where I didn‚Äôt bother with dating at all. A couple of women captured my attention but never enough to inspire me to fully commit and pursue them. That is, until I met Liz.

We met on Reddit, in one of the pen-pal subs. It was a lonely Saturday night in August of 2017. I learned she was 24 (so seven years younger than me) and lived in the southern U.S. We moved our conversation to another platform and quickly realized shared the same sense of humor and appreciation for classic rock. We exchanged photos (nothing sexual) and I was taken by how gorgeous she was. We chatted late into the night. By the time I fell asleep, I knew I needed to speak to her again as soon as humanly possible.

Checking her Reddit the next day, I discovered, much to my horror, that she was married. Devastated, I asked her about this and she confirmed yes, she was married, but rather unhappily, as it turned out. We initiated a long-distance friendship anyway. Phone calls and FaceTime chats confirmed her to be exactly who she presented herself as, which was a tremendous relief. We became intensely close and long conversations became the norm for us. We both shared our individual struggles with mental illness (she has bipolar disorder). I listened to her talk about the problems with her failing marriage and offered as much advice as I could to help talk her out of what sounded like a rotten situation (her husband sounded like a real ass who was always mean to her). There was a lot of fun and laughing too; talking about our respective days, our crazy families, pop culture stuff we loved and hated. I had never met someone who ‚Äúgot me‚Äù as much as Liz, and she told me the exact same. After a little while, she was talking to me more than she was talking to her husband. Frankly, I didn‚Äôt care. We were already falling for each other. She even sent me a birthday gift a month after we started talking.

In November of 2017, Liz and her husband moved into their first house. He did not yet know of my existence. Overcome with guilt for what she was doing, Liz decided we couldn‚Äôt speak anymore. I was shattered. This end was brief, as we began communicating again a week or so later. Liz cared too much about me to just forget and ignore, and I was relieved she was back. We decided it was finally time to meet in person. She would fly to me on a weekend and then back home in time for work on Monday. I was apprehensive and freaked out about impressing her (I‚Äôm pretty broke and was concerned I couldn‚Äôt show her a good time) but she didn‚Äôt care about any of that. She just wanted to spend time with me.

Liz flew to my city in December of ‚Äô17. We‚Äôd been speaking for only four months. It was her first time ever being here and we spent the entire weekend together, me showing her the sights. She even met my family. It was during that visit that we first kissed, and had sex, and realized we were completely in love. But she wasn‚Äôt ready to leave her husband; she couldn't yet bring herself to do it. I felt no guilt in being ""the other man"" because he sounded like such a bad dude and obviously didn't deserve her. My memory here is slightly hazy, but I remember he found out about us around this time. He was pretty pissed, but nothing major happened.

Enter 2018. Liz and I continue voice and video chatting using alternate means that her husband was unable to track (Kik and Skype). She frequently expressed intense guilt about deceiving him but loved me with such an intensity she had never experienced before. She was deeply unhappy in the marriage but so hesitant about leaving and throwing her life into chaos. There was another brief period where she stepped away out of guilt, but she came back again because we simply could not pull out of each other‚Äôs orbits. We were completely keyed into each other. But remember the mental illness I wrote about earlier? Liz had been imploring me to let her help me to find more professional help for what I was dealing with. I was so deep in the hole that it had become my home, and it blinded me. Kept me distant from all the things I really wanted in life. This had always been the case, and as much as I loved Liz, I was terrified by all the work her love would inspire me to do; I‚Äôd have to do to claw myself back into the world and I did not see myself fit for the challenge. I kept promising to get help, never following through, always trying to deal with it myself because I was petrified of revealing the extent of my illness to my family (we don‚Äôt really ‚Äúdo emotions‚Äù in my family). I thought I could talk myself out of it. Sometimes I even succeeded. It grated on Liz when I would lose myself, but we were still there for each other when our respective mental illnesses got the better of us (she went through a very rough patch early last year due to problems with meds).

Liz and I visited in person again last May, this time in her city, while her husband was on a business trip. She paid for my airfare and put me up at her mom‚Äôs apartment (she was also out of time at this time). We spent the entire time together. I pushed through a hellacious fear of flying to make it happen, but I had to see her. Nothing was going to keep me from her. We spent four days together down there, and Liz was distraught by the end, wondering when we were ever going to see each other again. Quite wrongly, I tried to ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù and serve as a stoic pillar of strength for her. I hate that I did that. I was as torn up and uncertain of the future as she was. Of course, her husband figured it was me who had come down to see Liz (not just ‚Äúa friend‚Äù as she had told him), but the marriage shambled along like a zombie, deteriorating and rotting but never actually dying. Nothing changed.

We attempted another break that summer, but by now you know how well that worked out. My depression/anxiety continued to eat away at me and Liz threatened to leave if I couldn‚Äôt enter treatment. I promised her I‚Äôd get better but I could never find the bravery to open up to my family. Surely I could finally find the magic words, some archaic incantation, to talk myself out of it and avoid shame and embarrassment! Liz hung around, and we had our good days and our bad days. She went back to school in the fall to finish herdegree, and with this and her persistently ****ty marriage neither her nor her husband seemed to be able to leave, her own life became highly stressful, but we continued to remain as close as we could in kind of a ‚Äúholding pattern.‚Äù

In September, Liz asked me what I thought about moving down to live with her, if she got herself out of her marriage. Me being me, I freaked out and instinctively said no. The hole was home, remember? I‚Äôm too stupid and helpless to do something like move to a completely unfamiliar part of the country! I didn‚Äôt want to say no. My brain was screaming ‚ÄúYES! YES! YES!‚Äù through the frantic cacophony of my anxiety. The damage was done; Liz rightly interpreted this as a rejection of her. I knew how wrong I was but I was so terrified by the idea that I reflexively ran from it. I spent days and weeks breaking myself down to remove the fear, and told her how wrong I was, how I wanted to do it. Things settled down, but Liz hangs on to that initial rejection to this day. I can‚Äôt blame her for being wounded.

In October, her husband caught her talking to me via Skype. He flipped his lid and Liz once again terminated contact. I was already beginning to feel numb to it by now, almost expecting it to happen, but it neverfailed to obliterate my heart when it did. You already know what happened next. The holding pattern continued, then she started spending more time trying to buckle down and be ‚Äúthe good wife.‚Äù Our communication became dramatically limited but we would occasionally chat about how much we missed each other. She had planned a trip here with her mother and cousin which was due to happen in January, and we both dreaded it because we didn‚Äôt quite know what to do with each other at this point.

Liz did come here in January. We met and spent a lot of time together, and our love was reaffirmed. She told me her marriage had finally collapsed during Christmas and she was unofficially separated from her husband. She ended the trip with a promise not to leave my life again, and there was optimism that we could finally move forward with her marriage out of the way.

When she got home, she texted me that she suddenly realized she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt do it‚Äù (be with me), how deeply unhappy she was, how she wanted to be alone, etc. All these doom and gloom ideas. Communication fell off for a little while. I entered into a dark and painful period of depression wherein I kept trying to force myself to seek therapy, having finally accepted this was bigger than me and I couldn‚Äôt do it myself.

Liz and her husband officially separated early this month. And this is when it all comes back to Reddit.

I stalked Liz‚Äôs Reddit account one night, two weeks ago. I hadn‚Äôt heard from her in a few days and was worried. I wanted to see if maybe she‚Äôd been active on here. My world ended. I discovered she had met another man on r/r4r only a couple of months ago, and they've already made plans to meet up, entirely behind my back (they actually had their first meeting this weekend). I confronted her about it, and she came clean. She said she was afraid to tell me because of how devastated I‚Äôd be but had planned to do so when she ‚Äúcould explain it better.‚Äù She told me she could not wait anymore for me to get better. In a flash of suicidal ideation, my defenses broke and I finally admitted what I‚Äôve been going through for years to my dad and my brother. They‚Äôve actually been extremely helpful and supportive.

Liz didn't want to hear anything about it, though. She‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs heard it all from me before, after all the help I refused from her. She told me flatly how ""she was burned"" on being with me, how taking me back would be ""setting a bad precedent"" and ""anybody can be gung-ho for therapy after a couple days."" She said she ""needed a life she could be proud of,"" and even after wishing me all the hope, health, and perspective in the world, she didn't want to hear any of it, like a switch had flipped in her head and I was the last to know. When I reminded her of how we were supposed to be soulmates, she replied, coldly, ""I'm not sure I believe in soulmates anymore"" and she was ""tired of men who didn't do anything until she was done"" (lumping me and her freshly separated husband together).

Even though she decided she was done without telling me first. Even though this had finally made me tell my family I was sick. Even after they had helped me secure an appointment for therapy, the most she could muster was a half-hearted ""Proud of you"" e-mail. After eighteen months and all we had been through, after all her love and support and encouragement, she was cold and distant and couldn't care less. It was like talking to a different person entirely. Maybe she thought I was only trying to get her back, but it's for me. I don't want to live like this anymore, and her cruelly going behind my back to make me realize how bad I was and how bad I had allowed my life to deteriorate. Even when I cut finally contact a few days ago, she barely responded or cared after such an intense year-and-change.

The thing about Liz is she was the first person in nine years to make me believe I could be a good person, that I could have a future, that maybe I did deserve to be happy. And I wanted it to be with her. She‚Äôs the first woman I‚Äôve ever actually loved and wanted to climb out of the hole for.

In January, she looked me in the eye and told me she loved me. It wasn‚Äôt until after she left here that she ‚Äúrealized I was never going to change.‚Äù Did my depression destroy this relationship? Is it all my fault?

Somebody please help me gain some insight and perspective here. I‚Äôm in desperate need of it. This was my first time dealing with a married woman, and will most assuredly be my last, as it only adds to my general guilt and shame. Thank you for reading.

TL;DR: Met an unhappily married woman on Reddit a year and a half ago, we fell madly in love, met in person three times, I never took the help for depression she offered/wanted for me, now she is divorcing her husband and has already started another Reddit relationship behind my back. Is it all my fault because of my depression? What can I do now? What *should* I do?",10Mar2019,2
377,"I have a friend I've known for 8 years. We met through a fandom online and we don't live near each other, so we mostly text but we get together about once a year. We found we have things in common so we usually have a good time together.   


Last summer she came to see me and it didn't go well. We had to work around my husband's and son's schedule and she was irritated that my son had to hang out with us sometimes and that our plans one night were cut short because we had babysitter issues. Overall it just wasn't exciting because there isn't much to do around me. She wrote me a long e mail afterward about how disappointed she was, not directly in me, but still implying I planned poorly. I wrote back to her defending myself and my planning decisions and she said I didn't need to defend myself. Well I felt attacked so...

Since then it feels like our online conversations are strained and we don't talk nearly as much. Should I confront her and how? I'm supposed to go see her in June and I'm just not looking forward to it. Maybe I'm just reading into it too much but it's hard to tell over text.",10Mar2019,2

Hey everyone,

I'm stuck with something i need some advice on and i can't ask my family.

A few weeks ago i broke up with my South-korean girlfriend. But that's a different story..

Since i was going to visit her in two months i took some weeks off of work, but now that i broke up with her i'm obviously not visiting her anymore and i found another asian country that i still wanted to see. Thailand.
I've been to Japan, South-korea and Taiwan before and i am really fond of those countries.

Now my question is:

When i'll be staying in Bangkok for about three weeks, i'll probably be feeling a little bit lonely from time to time. so i was considering hiring a gogo bar girl to spend time with me, i like cooking, not only for myself but for others too.
So i was planning on just hiring her to stay with me for the evening and following night since i miss someone to keep me company.

I know it's not a good solution but it's always better then getting drunk.

Here's my question: how big is the risk of the gogo bar girl stealing my stuff while i'm in the kitchen or bathroom etc.? or while she is sleeping at my airbnb?


Thanks in advance,

389,"So let me start of by saying that I love being in a relationship, I love all of the ‚Äústupid‚Äù parts of a relationship and most people would describe me as a hopeless romantic in ways.

The problem is, I‚Äôve realized after much meditation and thought, that I can‚Äôt be in one ever again.

The very short version of this story goes like this. I grew up in an abusive household. My dad was physically, verbally, mentally and emotionally abusive to me. and my mom pretty much enabled him to do so. Unfortunately, at the same time, my older half sister (my mom‚Äôs daughter and his legally adopted daughter) was being sexually abused by him from the time she was 13. When she was around 22 she got pregnant, under the guise that it was artificial insemination, and it wasn‚Äôt until she got pregnant again that she let everyone know what had been happening. I unfortunately was too busy trying to protect myself from my father that I never caught on to what was happening until I was told. 

Anyway, my mom kicked by dad out for like a week but then eventually my sister and my mom both decided to let him back in, causing me to push back because I refused to act like everything was just going to ‚Äúpass over‚Äù. After much arguing I was basically forced to leave the family and for the past year they‚Äôve done nothing but bad mouth me to my own friends (who all know the true story) and family and make it seem like I‚Äôm some little asshole kid who left the family for no good reason. Legally there is nothing I can do because my sister refuses to testify against my dad and in my state, since they have no blood relation, it‚Äôs not illegal to have had kids. 

Basically that puts me where I‚Äôm at now. My only family are my super awesome friends who have been nothing but supportive. 

I know most of you are going to tell me to report it or maybe call me an ass for focusing on my own problems, but there are a lot of details left out of me trying to get my sister to do something to protect her children, which she refuses to do, she‚Äôs in therapy and every time I tried to talk to her she would just immediately get hostile and start pushing that I‚Äôm a bad person for leaving. At some point I had to give up and focus on my life, sorry if that makes me a bad person. Believe me, the guilt is there.

So anyway, I‚Äôve had to come to terms with the fact that at some point, those kids are probably going to look me up and find me when they‚Äôre older to either ask why I left or ask about their genealogy. At the same time, at least once a month I‚Äôm still dealing with life changing levels of drama from my family as they refuse to just let it go that I‚Äôm not going to come back and play pretend.

The problem comes where, I constantly fantasize about having someone romantically. I haven‚Äôt dated since this all came out, and with the loss of my family, and pretty much any love or support other than my friends, the fantasies of finding someone to be with have gotten worse.

But, I know I can‚Äôt be with anyone. I‚Äôve decided not to bring anyone into my life, because if I truly love someone why would I bring them into drama like this? Why would I expect them to take emotional hits maybe even years from now when the kids (my niece and nephew/half-brother and other half-sister)  show up?

The point is, I can‚Äôt get it off my mind, if I meet someone cute and we talk and stuff, it just invades my brain. I‚Äôm constantly having to remind myself that I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just looking for a way to stop that, any tips or tricks or meditation or anything to sort of change that part of me and force myself to understand.

I know most of you will tell me to go to therapy, but I don‚Äôt really know what if he trying to do there. I don‚Äôt need medication of any kind, and I‚Äôve talked this through enough times with my friends that I‚Äôm just tired of it and trying to move on.

Any help is awesome. 

Tl;dr: grew up in an abusive family that has forced me out but it still harassing me. I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic who wants to have someone but I also don‚Äôt want to pull them into this and instead would just rather anyone who is interested in me find someone better.

393,"1993- my parents divorce when I'm 4 and I move out of state with my mom and brother.

2002- my mom sends me out of state to visit my dad and disappears, telling my brother and I not to come back. I never see her again. She is addicted to pain pills, and they've become more important to her than her family. My dad and I suffer a rocky relationship, due to me being young and blaming him for my mom's disappearance. My dad struggles financially to support us.

2004- I try my first yoga class in high school after depression and suicide watch from abandonment issues, spawning a lifelong passion that saved me, which I still carry and practice today.

2007- I graduate high school and move out of my dad's.

2009-2013- I enroll in, and complete college, with a lot of student debt but make it on the honor roll and graduate with a 3.8. During this time I build a fantastic relationship with my father, who becomes my best friend.

2013-2016- I try out a couple jobs that relate to my degree, never finding my ""niche.""

2015- My dad doesn't answer the phone. I need to talk to him. I drive to his house to check on him, let myself in with his spare key. I find his body on the floor. He was an alcoholic since before I was born. His heart failed, and he died. He was my best friend and my only parent.

2016- I was diagnosed with PTSD early in the year. I lost interest in everything. Left my job because I cannot focus. Later in the year, I move out of state because I cannot be reminded of my dad anymore. I find balance and comfort in outdoor recreation. Got a sub par job in a restaurant, but slowly get my PTSD under control.

2017- My finances fall apart due to debt and the lack of financial advice my dad used to give me, and lack of jobs in my industry in my new region. A friend tells me I should ""become a webcam girl."" And I do. 

2017-2019- I cam into brief financial success, and quickly learn to hate it. I have become reliant on it due to debt, and continue to cam based on a lack of options and an immediate need for money, but ""work"" for the bare minimum, never exceeding what I need.

2004-present- I've done yoga this entire time. It keeps me sane. It keeps me healthy. I still cam. I still can't bring myself to do it beyond what I need to pay my debts and survive.

Present- I am still in debt. I still cam. I want more for myself. I am back to needing an ""entry level"" job in the field that I studied, but I support myself and cannot afford that pay without another form of income. I do yoga every day, and I eat healthy, I work out. I feel like I'm ""okay"" despite being in my late 20s and not having either parent for support or advice. I am not proud of myself. I hate camming. My mind is meant for more. My college years showed me I'm capable of more, but I'm lost for solutions at this point. I only find relief in yoga class. I want so badly to share yoga with others who need it. I want to be a yoga teacher, but my debts keep me from taking the courses I need. I reach out to Reddit, seeking advice. I want to make a career out of the only thing I love, the only thing that keeps me sane, and the only thing that sets my soul on fire when I share it. 

Reddit: how does an intelligent mind with a lot of internal pain, lonliness, and debt, who has made too many bad choices for her wisdom, turn her life around? How does this mind break through the boundaries she set for herself, and finally, finally get a grasp on the only passion she has? How does she find the means to take the first step into turning her lifelong passion into a career, and breaking free of the horrible job she has in order to better herself? How does one fund a passion, when she can barely fund her life?

394,"I think I found my soulmate.
But people around us are questioning the timing of things. 

I‚Äôbe been friends with my coworker for almost a year now. We were both in relationships super respectful of each other‚Äôs boundaries.
In December I left my 9 year relationship after he physically abused me for the first time ever.

When my friend asked how I was doing a few days after my break-up I told him what had happened and he gave me the strength to officially leave that situation. 

5 days later his gf broke up with him- she never appreciated him and they had been on the fritz.
We were living the same exact life.

He had to find a new place to live, and we really helped each other and supported each other a lot through our breakups. I got him boxes for his move, and he emotionally supported me the first time I went back to my apartment alone and scared. Again, no boundaries were crossed.
We had been texting to keep each other strong and to check in. He later confessed to me he had a crush on me a long time ago and that he developed feelings for me in October that he pushed aside out of respect for our relationships. And there was a period of time where we even didn‚Äôt talk that much.

Well I had developed feelings for him too at that time. I knew he would be significant in my life but I did not know how. I started to see 11:11 everywhere. We started talking about how weird the timing of everything was. How it feels like the universe is conspiring to bring us together.
We went out after work one day and neither of us were drinking but I gave him a ride home because he had ubered. And we kissed.
When we kissed I knew we were in trouble. Like we both say we have never ever been kissed like this before.
He then said he really wanted to date me but wanted to slow things down. And I respected that decision and we agreed we would let some time pass and come back to each other. 
Then his dog got sick, he called me freaking out. I offered to accompany him to the hospital I used to work at so he could use my discount, and be seen sooner.
He was so appreciative of my help. And said how much we have helped each other through rough times and how much my friendship means to him.  We kissed again even though we had agreed not to because we are just drawn to each other.

A week later he said ‚Äúyeah, I can‚Äôt wait anymore. I want to be with you. When i think about my future I see you there‚Äù

So we have been dating a couple of weeks officially. He is so wonderful to me. Takes care of me, lets me be myself, introduced me to friends and his brother. Sticks up for me, made me breakfast this morning. Just treats me like a queen.

People are questioning the timing of our relationship, but we can‚Äôt help the way we feel. I think he is the love of my life. I see and want a future with him and he wants one with me too. 
He is everything I want and treats me like a queen.
Knowing all this, do you guys think it is too soon? Like I said, we were friends for a year before this. And we make each other soooo happy, there were genuine feelings a while ago, and now that we are together we continue to see we are perfect together.

395,"While I was still at school I discovered another girl (who we'll call Alice) was applying to study the same degree as me at the local college. I was working my summer job with a mutual friend of Alice who suggested that we should share lifts to save money. A few days before starting college I messaged Alice to organize the lift. This is where the problems begin...

The college is a 40 minute drive from my town and we had to be there for 9:30am. To leave time for traffic and getting lost e.t.c I suggested that we should leave at 8:30 which would give us plenty of time. Alice didn't like this idea and instead said we should leave at 7am! I immediately said no and she offered 7:30, but no later, 'just in case.' Anyways, the first day approaches and she picks me up. We drive in almost complete silence after my many attempts to make conversation were shot down with one word responses of 'yeah' in various tones. It took her over one hour to get there as she was driving at a snails pace but again I gave her the benefit of the doubt thinking she was maybe just nervous.

From what I knew of Alice at school she was painfully shy and didn't speak to many people. I found it strange that she chose to study my degree (Speech Pathology) as it is based around speaking to people, but I figured she must be more outgoing than I remembered.

Fast forward to the present and the very mention of her name makes me want to rip my hair out. She still can't make conversation and won't answer anyone except me which has led to me being isolated from the rest of my class as she follows me everywhere and people assume I'm like her as if we're some weird Siamese twins. She is the most socially backwards person I have ever met in my life and blanks everyone - including the lecturers - that speak to her because she is too nervous to answer or look at them. Alice is also ultra reserved/Christian e.g. doesn't understand why gay people should be allowed to marry because the whole purpose of marriage is procreation, which makes me feel like I have to tone my personality down around her and avoid certain songs with swear words from my playlists in case I offend her.

It's 2nd semester now and I've had enough. I had a horrible time in high school (very bad bullying which led to me moving schools for my final years) and so I wanted college to be my fresh start where I could make friends and be outgoing like I used to be. I know what it's like to feel anxious and so I've given her the benefit of the doubt and tried to be nice and a friend but I realized that I shouldn't have to sacrifice my happiness for her. I want to be able to sit with and have friends in my class and for once in my life not be in the weird kid group. 

We're doing a lot of group work sessions in class currently and we got placed in different groups. She told me she had to stay late one day and so I said I would take my own car up to College so I wouldn't have to wait after class. This seemed to annoy her as she sent me a passive aggressive text saying that she wouldn't care about waiting after classes for me. Two weeks later it was her turn to drive and once class finished at 1pm she told me that she had 'forgotten' that she had to stay late. I knew this was a lie because she had remembered all of her notes for the group work and it was clear that she just didn't want to drive up to class on her own. Anyways, we didn't get home until 4pm that night and she never even apologized for the incident! The other issue is that when we are placed in the same group I have to do all of the work and talking because she's too scared to put her input in or present to the class. This obviously puts double the strain on me and I've found myself feeling nervous for her when someone tries to ask her a question.

So the question is, what should I do to separate myself from her? Driving together saves me $50 every other week on gas so should I just rough it out for another 2 years? How would I even suggest not sharing lifts anymore? I know she would be very nervous about driving alone everyday but I feel like I need to stop thinking about her feelings and concentrate on myself now. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't even have a problem with her nerves and she just doesn't want to speak to other people because she doesn't like them.

Any thoughts or am I just being a horrible person?

397,"When I was younger (I am 29F) I always thought I was perfectly strong and healthy and fine. I always felt pretty good apart from the occasional breakup or what have you. Recently though, and about 3 semesters into me going back to college at university, I‚Äôve just not felt great. When I had my last full-time job I felt really good. Financially and emotionally I felt pretty stable and was really appreciative and happy with how my life was going. My boss at that job was a monster and I made it an entire year before I finally put my 2 weeks in and left. I was able to ride on my school money for a while but I think the stressors of life, living with a terrible roommate and not having any income coming in are really impacting my mental health. 

When I really think back though, I think I‚Äôve had high functioning depression for a while now. I get my stuff done, am getting really good grades in all my classes (online student) and take care of myself. But I don‚Äôt FEEL anything. I realized there was something wrong when I took a trip to see my mom for spring break and I didn‚Äôt feel anything when I saw her or when I left, which is really weird because I usually cry or feel sad and I just haven‚Äôt felt happy or sad or anything for a really long time. 

I know everyone suggests therapy but I guess I‚Äôm just scared it won‚Äôt help. I worry about everything, believe I‚Äôm developing anxiety.

399,"I grew up in a financially unstable household. I never experienced extreme poverty but I did got home to an empty fridge and wore clothing that I grew out of fairly often. Rare family activities outside of just watching tv in the living room.....
My parents were very open about their financial struggles with me from an early age. I think this influenced a lot of the decisions I made in my life. 

I‚Äôve always had the heart of an artist. Singing, dancing, drawing, exploring are things that have brought light to my life from a very very young age. In retrospect, I realize I pushed those things away partly because my family always pushed me towards financial stability. I gave up more and more of my artistic outlets as I grew older and got out of school. At 19, I decided to go to college, I changed my major like three times. I finally settled on a career path. But I only settled on this because I felt like it was the only way I could survive in this world. I thought reaching this career goal would make me happy.

Now I‚Äôm about to turn 26, recent undergrad, working a mundane government job for now. Recently, got out of a 6 year abusive relationship that slowly sucked the life out of me even more. 

I feel like I am in a crossroad in my life. My values have changed again with the help of my traumatic romantic relationship. I want to go back to school and work on a graduate degree in my field but I‚Äôm also not motivated by this goal anymore. I spent so much of my adult life worrying about surviving financially that I completely abandoned the things that I truly find motivating, like making art.

I feel like a mess. Everyone around me is settling into their careers and finally becoming financially stable adults. Some are even balancing their corporate lives while still working on things that serve as creative outlets outside of their careers. Yet I‚Äôm here making 40k a year (I live in a large metro city), in a dead end government job, really regretting everything I‚Äôve done in my life. Wishing I wouldn‚Äôt have listened to anyone but myself on what I thought my career goals should be. 

I haven‚Äôt worked on creating anything in so long. I want to start drawing and making music. I feel like this is what will truly bring happiness to my life whether I‚Äôm financially stable or not because of it. But I have this feeling of ‚Äòit‚Äôs too late‚Äô. I‚Äôve worked so hard to get to where I am right now and I haven‚Äôt drawn or played music in years. I feel pathetic talking to people about this. I still don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing with my life and people stay away from people like me. 

How do I deal with this crisis I‚Äôm having right now? I don‚Äôt plan on leaving my job because it is a good job but I‚Äôm worried that if I redirect my energy to this new completely different career path I‚Äôll be stuck making no progress in life and that scares me. 

I understand this is a crazy long post but I appreciate if you stuck through and read all the rambling.
Thanks.",10Mar2019,1
400,"First of all I‚Äôm still at an age where I‚Äôm dependent on my parents but I‚Äôm definitely old enough to go places by myself, especially when there‚Äôs parent supervision and I‚Äôm going with a lot of other friends. 

Basically for a long time my parents won‚Äôt let me go anywhere if it involves seeing my friends. This has nothing to do with my current friend group because they are all amazing, they aren‚Äôt at all toxic, they all do well in school and are super polite and encouraging. 

So why won‚Äôt they let me go? I genuinely think it‚Äôs because a few years ago I was kind of a terrible person. I was going through the worst ‚Äúteenage‚Äù mood swings and I was under a lot of stress because of a heavy courseload at school and I took it out a lot on my parents. I would argue with them a lot. That was back when I was like in middle school, and now, a few years later, a lot has changed. I‚Äôve learned to control myself and I‚Äôm really working on being the best person I can be, and I really think it‚Äôs even working out for me. 

However, my sister is absolutely not here for it. She told me to kill myself a long time ago and since then I‚Äôve just stopped talking to her, and she‚Äôs since been set on basically ruining my relationship with my parents. She JUMPS on every opportunity to get me in trouble, she tattles on every little thing I do (and they‚Äôre not even important things - it‚Äôs like, if I leave my clothes in the dryer and forget to take them out) and she makes a humongous deal about it until my parents eventually get angry at me. 

Because of her repeated efforts to get me in trouble, my parents now have a permanent opinion that I am the bad child, that I never listen to anything they say, even though my sister has done things just as bad if not worse than me. For example, she wastes all the space on her super expensive computer downloading movies instead of studying like my parents tell her to. She got held a year back in school (university) because she doesn‚Äôt want to study. 

On the other hand I study a lot, and that means sometimes I don‚Äôt get time to talk to my parents as much as my sister, who just stays home all day talking and getting super close with them because she failed her classes and she‚Äôs just sitting at home doing nothing now. 

For this reason my parents like my sister a lot more than they like me. 

In fact, I just heard that they‚Äôre going to be letting my sister go out with her group of friends or eat. Now THIS got my angry. I‚Äôve had to beg and beg my parents for DAYS to let me go out with my friends ONE time, and my sister asks all passively and they just let her go! 

I‚Äôm so done with it. I want to be with my friends. I won‚Äôt be young forever and I won‚Äôt have time like I do now. My friends just  asked me to go to the movies with them this Wednesday and I don‚Äôt have the heart to make up another lame excuse because I just don‚Äôt know how to explain my family situation to them. They have amazing families and I don‚Äôt even think they would understand. I want to spend time with them so bad and I‚Äôve been keeping this whole thing from them for years, I just don‚Äôt know where to begin. 

So now I‚Äôve got two options as far as I know: I can bring up to them that my sister gets to go out with her friends and therefore they have no excuse to deny that to me. I feel like to this they might say something like, well she‚Äôs older so she gets to go (which makes no sense because what does age have to do with any of this?). 

Or I can lie. I can say I have a project to work on and I‚Äôm going to her house. My parents will most probably let me go if it‚Äôs for schoolwork. I can ask my friend to pick me up from my house and they will never know. However if we end up staying a long time at the movies they might come looking for me, and if they ask my friends parents or something then I‚Äôm in big trouble. 

Either way I REALLY don‚Äôt want to say no to my friends, not now. I havent told my parents anything about this yet and I need a way to approach it so they won‚Äôt say no. 

How can I ask my parents to let me go out with my friends? 

Thank you so much for any advice.",10Mar2019,1
401,"TL;DR at the end

There‚Äôs a girl who I have been friends with for about 4 years. Now that we‚Äôre in  high school, everything (and I mean *EVERYTHING*) for her is so goddamn serious. I can‚Äôt make a joke without her ranting at me but when she makes a joke she gets really upset when I don‚Äôt laugh. 

Me, her and two others have a dance group and we enter competitions and do shows etc. One day, we were giving eachother constructive (*CONSTRUCTIVE*) criticism about the routine and our performances. After me and the two others gave her some improvement advice, she was red and her lips were quivering. She then ran off and started crying because of what we‚Äôd said. The thing is, everyone in the group received some criticism so we can build our skills and nobody was harsh with her because we KNOW what she‚Äôs like. 

What‚Äôs really frustrating is that, in our opinion, she‚Äôs the weakest dancer and needs to improve on fluidity. She‚Äôs so stiff and shows no emotion when she‚Äôs performing. We can‚Äôt tell her that though! With anyone else I could give improvements and advice and then their dancing would get better, but with her, we can‚Äôt! She‚Äôll get offended and cry. It makes us feel guilty but we know we‚Äôve done nothing wrong. So, we are basically stuck with her weak standard of dance and there‚Äôs seemingly no way we can get her to change.

Another thing is her unwillingness to have fun. The next few paragraphs are stories.

We were sitting in German and there was a supply teacher. Everyone finished the assigned work pretty quickly so it left us some time to have a break. During this break, a few boys on the table in front of us decided to start that viral ‚Äúpause challenge.‚Äù It‚Äôs pretty stupid but its something to do while we‚Äôre all bored. Then, from across the classroom I see the girl scowling at me like I‚Äôd just ran over a cat (I did not.) She comes over and asks why I‚Äôm being so ‚Äúimmature.‚Äù She said ‚Äúthis is a classroom environment and we can‚Äôt be messing around.‚Äù I was SO confused because our supply teacher was cool with it and she was acting like I‚Äôd committed a heinous crime.

There was a fight in the next grade up and everyone in my grade was really intrigued so a group of people ran to see what was happening. I didn‚Äôt want to get involved in the swarm so I asked the nearest person what was happening. He explained but the girl cut him off. She said ‚ÄúOh my god I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre interested in a stupid fight you‚Äôre so immature.‚Äù Thats not even an exaggeration. She then said I should ‚ÄúStop getting so tRiGgErEd‚Äù when I told her it was ok for me to have SOME interest in a MASSIVE CROWD TAKING OVER THE CORRIDORS. 

Lastly, my class had a supply teacher for dance so we couldn‚Äôt do practical. We were doing a questionnaire about the previous lesson when my other friend made the boy sitting next to her laugh (which is fine seeing as the supply was allowing everyone to talk.) The girl turned to us and looked DISGUSTED. She looked like we were arrested for necrophilia or animal abuse. That‚Äôs how mortified she was at us making someone laugh. Then, she turned back to her page and continued to write in silence.

That‚Äôs all really. She has done other stuff but I‚Äôd be writing a novel if I told you everything. Please note that those three stories happened over the course of two days and I can‚Äôt straight up tell her to stop because she‚Äôll guilt trip me. I need some help ;-;

TL;DR

My friend can‚Äôt take constructive criticism so we‚Äôre stuck with her weak standard of dancing and we can‚Äôt give her advice on how to improve. She cries whenever we try. Also, she can never take jokes and makes me feel like a bad person for having fun.",10Mar2019,1

You‚Äôre immediately love struck. Over the course of the year you become close, and by the end of your first year of sixth form you end up kissing him in the park. 

The two of you become inseparable. You meet each other‚Äôs families and stay together all through university. You begin to notice, however, that he doesn‚Äôt like you to go out without him too much, and you miss out on the social aspect of university life. It doesn‚Äôt seem like a sacrifice at the time because you adore his company. He decides to pursue music, and has no earnings to speak of.

When you‚Äôre 21, you mother dies following a short but vicious battle with cancer. Your boyfriend is by your side the whole time, and you eventually move in together while your boyfriend is supported by his student loan.

Once he graduates he is determined to pursue his dream, and you‚Äôre happy to support him in that. He becomes almost entirely financially dependent on you. You work 50+ hours a week to make ends meet, while he plays guitar and tries to find teaching and performance work. You‚Äôre exhausted and stressed all the time. 

You get a new job and there meet a lovely man who you have a deep and meaningful friendship with. The type of friendship you come across only a handful of times in your whole life. Over the course of two years, you come to consider this person your best friend, but your boyfriend despises them purely for being a heterosexual man. He become jealous and resentful every time you go out. You leave things early or decline invitations because you want to avoid a fight.

Now imagine your friend resigns to pursue his ambitions. One day you look at your friend and realise that they‚Äôre not only calm and smart and kind and funny, but kind of hot too. 

On your friends last day you go to see them, and receive 17 missed calls in 20 minutes asking where you are and accusing you of lying. In a state of real distress your friend comforts you, and you end up kissing.

I will be attending a church service later along with my brother who will try to either call out of work or find a replacement.

416,"Okay so for some context, I am in high school so there is going to be a lot of unique problems in here that deal with ‚Äúhigh school‚Äù topics. 

Background:
My first ex left me back in August of last year and I was very distraught. She told me a thousand reasons to why she broke up with me and none of them really held up. I‚Äôve always liked her, and still do. It doesn‚Äôt really go away. For the sake of this story I‚Äôll call her A. 

My second ex is a girl I started dating back around January. I had to move on somehow and I needed to just dive headfirst into something new so I could forget about the past. Although I chose to brake up with her and you will see why. Let‚Äôs call her S. 

Ex A‚Äôs close friend that we‚Äôll call K. Makes poor decisions, very influential in the wrong ways. Explores drugs. 

As of last week, S revealed to me that over the weekend she was planning to go to K‚Äôs to ‚Äúwatch‚Äù her smoke pot. I was becoming pretty suspicious and asked her if she was going to do it. She said she wasn‚Äôt going to, but told someone else that she was going to do it. This means I‚Äôve been lied to. She knows I absolutely hate drugs and alcohol. I stayed with her and K after school just to talk. We got into the topic of weed, and she tried to coax me into thinking it was okay by saying that it was ‚Äúcute‚Äù to do it. I had enough, and quickly switched topics. The rest of that day doesn‚Äôt matter, because I made up my mind that I was going to leave her the next day.

Friday last week:
I met with her in the hallway and promptly told her that I didn‚Äôt want to be intimately involved with someone who is getting involved in drugs and that it‚Äôs breaking my morals to do that. She didn‚Äôt really react, she just said okay and went on to class. 

I got into science class and met up with my lab group and we started talking. It was my ex, A. Who I was in semi-good terms with. Her friend, and one of my best friends. I told my best friend earlier that I had planned to break up with S, so she already knew what was going on. I started talking to A, and eventually I revealed that I broke up with S. She was surprised and asked me why. I told her about the whole drug thing that S was pushing on herself with K. Just a minute later with the weirdest timing, S messaged a group chat that A was in and said ‚Äúso he broke up with me‚Äù. A told me she was going to play dumb and ask why just to see what she‚Äôll say. S responds with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I didn‚Äôt do anything!‚Äù A replies back VERY defensive and says ‚Äúbullshit, you are going to go smoke pot! I FUCKING know it!‚Äù S just replies back with ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt even going to do it.‚Äù A gets fed up and stops replying. 

A and I started talking about it, and she said she would try to figure out what S was trying to pull. She asked me who else was going. I told her that K was providing the weed. That bursted A‚Äôs world and she almost didn‚Äôt believe me. Because K was soo close to her. I gave her some screenshots, that kind of sealed it. 

I get home later, school ends:
I get a text from A for the first time since September. We started talking about how S was being stupid, but we couldn‚Äôt do anything to stop her and she eventually called off the plan to smoke over the weekend. Not because it was wrong but because it was EMBARRASSING. We dragged into the topic of K and how she was heart broken that K wouldn‚Äôt trust her. I told her a bunch of uniquely worded things that directly came from K about A. Which later all came into the picture when A started arguing with K over text. At this point, she really believes me. (For good reason, I‚Äôve been telling her the truth.) 

She offered that we should get into a FaceTime call or something that night, she said she wanted to explain why we broke up. Eventually we got into a call and a lot of old memories, gifts, pictures and such resurfaced. Trivial stuff that we remembered, birthdays and such came up too. Anyway, she explained to me that this person who got her into a sport she‚Äôs been playing for years overdosed back in August. Her mom got the call and ended up telling her that night. I didn‚Äôt know any of this, and she took all of her frustration and anger out on me. She wasn‚Äôt emotionally sound and cut me off. I asked her a pretty hard question. Did I actually ever do anything wrong? She said that I was just a little overprotective but in the normal way a guy should be. Hours later I asked if she still liked me. She confessed a bit about positive stuff about me and just had this smile on her face. I then told her that I still really liked her and was wondering if we should try again. She said that she regretted giving me up and said she was stupid. We agreed that we would wait until the S drama faded so that way we could get back together. 

Saturday:
A texts me a screenshot of S saying that she‚Äôs happier now with this other guy B. ‚ÄúI am smiling a lot, I am with someone else. I won‚Äôt mention the name tho.‚Äù I told A that I was relieved that S was out of my hair soo quickly. A and I already knew the name though. This was the second reason why I broke up with S, I knew she liked someone else. It was either dump, or be dumped. 

Questions:
I‚Äôve got soo many questions now... Should I even try again with A? Is it wrong that I‚Äôve moved on soo quickly? That I am actually ECSTATIC with A? How might this cause more conflict?

* by roommate i mean freshman college dorm roommate. one room, two beds, no privacy/ not shared spaces. 

Okay so... In November 2018, my roommate went on a Tinder date with a guy we‚Äôll call E. E gave her a thing called a Pax and she got VERY high. She told him prior to going over she wasn‚Äôt interested in hooking up, he agreed. She comes home that night and breaks down to me and my boyfriend that he forced himself upon her and the next day one of our mutual friends takes her to the hospital. 

Over the next few weeks E starts asking her to be his girlfriend, he told her that for Christmas he bought her a necklace and wrote her a poem. At this point, my roommate is completely turned off and tells her parents about him over Winter Break, they make her block him. I think it‚Äôs over.  (i‚Äôm wrong)

Come February she texts me and asks for the room (annoying cause she‚Äôs literally always in the room) and I say sure. She tells me a guy is coming so to try and stay out for at least two hours. WELP two hours became six before she finally texted me back to tell me it was safe to come in. I‚Äôm curious now because well SIX HOURS!!!! She confesses it‚Äôs E. She tells me she thinks she just freaked out because it was the first time she‚Äôs had high sex... here‚Äôs my issue with that. 
-i‚Äôve had high sex, it isn‚Äôt terrifying the ways she described. 
-she told me, my boyfriend, our mutual friend, and at least 6 other people that he RAPED her. Her words. 
-the way she described the experience, she physically couldn‚Äôt move because he pinned her, she couldn‚Äôt speak, her body went into shock. 

She‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs processed what‚Äôs happened and that she think she projected her fears about drugs and one night stands onto E. 

Here‚Äôs where I need advice. If she‚Äôs processed things that way and wants to date this guy, fine. She‚Äôs an adult, that‚Äôs her choice. I don‚Äôt want him in our room and he‚Äôs in our room now A LOT. like for 11 hours at a time. I don‚Äôt think I can tell her flat out i‚Äôm uncomfortable with him because I know that she‚Äôll say it‚Äôs unfair because my boyfriend is in our room often as well. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be able to see the difference. 

I don‚Äôt want to report this. I‚Äôve been in her shoes and I know reporting is scary and ultimately it should be her decision to report. I brought it up in a beating around the bush type way to our area coordinator and she cut me off and warned me that if I told her that my roommate was raped by this guy she would be forced to report to the school and the police. I don‚Äôt want to force her to do that. 

I need help, I can‚Äôt have a rapist in our room constantly and I don‚Äôt know how to tell her that in a way that won‚Äôt start tension. Any advice is helpful, thanks. 


TLDR: my roommate is dating the guy who raped her and i don‚Äôt know how to tell her i‚Äôm uncomfortable with him being in our room.

426,"So we have a family friend that I‚Äôve known for almost 10 years . For most of that time, we have had a good relationship and I have enjoyed his company. He‚Äôs a good kid. He is our next door neighbor, and we have formed a group of friends in our neighborhood over the years. 

However the last year or so, he has changed a lot. He is very disrespectful to everyone, but no one worse than me. I traditionally have been the ‚Äúleader‚Äù in the group, so maybe that‚Äôs why. He has burped in our/my face, farted in our face, mocked us, insulted us, and purposely tries to egg us on. He will connect to our Bluetooth speaker in the house and play his music on full blast. Of course, when challenged about this, he plays it off as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù. And that I need to ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù. (I‚Äôve never raised my voice at him once). 

In short, he does a lot of little irritating things that add up. I really am starting to think that only fists will handle this situation. However, I am over 18 and he isn‚Äôt.

428," I dated a girl in at my college for 3 months. We used to hangout alone by ourselves before we dated for along time and bonded very well so we thought we should give dating a try. The first month of dating was fantastic and well I really liked her. Going on hikes with her and car trips. We had a winter brake and afterwards everything changed. When she came back I rarely saw. In fact it didn't even feel like we were dating. She kept saying she was busy and needed to get work done(which is fair since she's taking 16 credits). But I didn't trust her since her friends and my suite mate(who's friends with her) kept saying how she was hanging out with them or went out, you get the picture. She was not doing work as much as she telling me me she was. So I was sitting in my dorm room wondering after 3 weeks barely seeing her doubting her reasons why she was busy. I began to think maybe she didn't like me anymore. But every time I did see her that seemed to be false. So after a month of college being emotionally tortured she came into my room, sat down on my bed and said""you are not gonna like what Im going to say"". So we talked. She began to say how over winter brake when she saw her ex(with my approval since she kept repeatably saying how she doesnt like him anymore so I thought it would be fine) she realized that her feelings for him still existed. The ex was basically talking to her over brake and well she was now conflicted with the feelings between me and him. So instead of talking me she admitted that she has been purposely not seeing me since she was thinking the situation over for an entire month. She didn't contact the ex during this time and like I said I barely saw her. And so we decided to brake up. I understand her logic, since she was contemplating about her future since well in a semester she's leaving college and after that me and her would not be able to see one another. But honestly the way she dealt with the situation was terrible. All the lies and leading on from her. I mean it didn't even feel like we were dating when we ended it. After this breakup. We took a month off from one another. In the beginning I missed her a ton. But after awhile I began to hate her. Fast forward to now. In a week our month is over and this is where I ask you guys for advice. Should I become friend with this girl again? At the moment I'm frustrated with her, angry and at the same time I still like her. Which all these emotions are not good for being friends with a girl. The reason I want to be friends with her is she is a good person at heart(just sucks at dealing with situations). She also used to be my best friend at college. Not only that but we share a lot of friends so it has been a bit awkward this month. I just seem to be feeling a lot of anger and frustration with the girl for lying and ignoring me all of that time while I was head over feelings for her and wanted to see her all the time. Now I'm not sure if I'm prepared to see her as a friend again. I think Im gonna talk with her and tell her my gripe with the whole situation.",10Mar2019,1

431,"Background..I grew up in chaos and violence and drama. Grew up withdrawing and being alone most of the time.

I ended up raising my brothers child..she's 16 now and we fight constantly. I end up going off on her because she's a brat at times and I get really mean and rude to her. I hate myself for it. I know I'm mentally and emotionally harming her. But she says mean things to me a lot, doesn't respect me or want to follow rules. Basically, I lose my shit. I never wanted to be a parent..I don't have the motherly genes for it. I'm very selfish and self absorbed. But I've tried so hard..she's always been great but got in high school and became a nightmare. Every day is some sort of battle with her. I'm so tired of dealing with it. I love her more than anything, but she doesn't think I do because I I totally lose it sometimes and go off on her.

I dealt with my brothers violence and all of his drug use and shit my whole life...then I ended up taking over with her without ever getting to deal with my trauma from childhood. Now I honestly feel like I'm at a breaking point. I'm mentally not in a good place..I'm aware of it.. I know I'm causing her pain..I don't know what to do.

She plays a lot of sports but I'm so exhausted from life sometimes I can't even muster up the energy to attend a game or something. Her mood swings are constant...I never get a good word. She treats me like shit. I get so tired of being the bad guy.

But I know I'm crazy and I know I'm not a good parent to her.

I have no emotion anymore besides sad and angry. I can't feel anything. I never enjoy anything. I don't feel happiness, or joy or excitement, I can fake it on the outside, but inside I feel nothing. I just feel like I'm existing and I'm exhausted and don't even want to be here. Every day is the same old shit. Get up, fight with her, go work work, come home, fight, go to sleep.

What worries me the most is that she was gone three days on a school trip and this will sound awful because I truly love her so much...but the break from her felt good. It felt amazing to get three days of peace. It felt amazing for three days to not have any responsibility or to argue. I'm absolutely a terrible person because I felt that way. I love her and yet being away from her feels good..why is that?.

She has no parents to be involved in her life..I'm it. And I'm failing her.

And the very minute she got back, the fighting starting again.

She tells me constantly when she's eighteen she's moving out and she can't wait to get away from me. She acts like I'm so mean but we always had a great relationship until she hit high school. I go batshut crazy on her times so I know I'm pushing her away and ruining her life.

I just wish I was normal and healthy. Or that I'd die. I don't even care if I die. I'd welcome it. In fact I've prayed to die before. I just feel so empty and bored and sad and angry all the time.

I've tried therapy it didn't help..the therapist made me feel like shit so I never went back.

I can't get the courage to suicide.

I hate being mean and selfish and awful.",10Mar2019,1
432,"I work at vape shop (we get it you vape), a bit of background. 
My friend who is also my coworker = F 
Me = Me
F has been working for the shop for about half a year now. He started work around the same time that he started shopping here. He‚Äôs been super slack on regular duties of the job but that‚Äôs besides the point. The shop has three locations with an interconnected POS system. All of our sales are tracked or can easily be looked up in the system. Rules are when you ring up a customer you have to get their number and email along with DOB and verify it with their ID. He does not do this, much at all if any. Some purchases are fine to not put in to the system, such as little spinner batteries for those ‚ÄúCBD‚Äù cartridges.  Some customers will get sketched out when we ask for their info, so we just check ID then put the purchase under our own name or another employees. If a customer purchases a mod or any juice or anything to do with nicotine we HAVE to put it under their customer profile or create one for them. Okay enough background. 
I was on the POS system passing time looking at whose sales are the best. I noticed something was off. F‚Äôs profile has almost 12,000 points in the reward program we have which the points are almost 1$ per point. So that means he must‚Äôve spent 12,000$ in a six month period at a Vape shop...so I looked through his sales and F is constantly running customer purchases like mods and juice/coils that should all be under their account as his own. Using the 25$ off rewards from all the points to basically get free juice and coils. So basically he is stealing points from the customers and using it to get free juice from the company and not following one of the biggest rules for the employees. Not only is he basically stealing he‚Äôs creating a major problem. (Scenario): customer comes into one of our shops with a defective device they swear they bought here yesterday. We have NO record of the sale and therefore are unable to give them a refund or exchange causing them to leave a horrible review. So in conclusion he‚Äôs basically stealing and I don‚Äôt know if I should report him to the manager or just let it be and if I should report it how do I go about bringing it up to my boss. 
TL;DR: Friend is basically stealing from customers/company and I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up to my boss or whether I should bring it up at all or not. ",10Mar2019,1
433,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know if it is
Also, I‚Äôm on my phone, so I‚Äôm sorry about any format issues
Before I get into the bad stuff, I want to say that I love my sister very much. We are extremely close and I would do absolutely anything for her. So please don‚Äôt bash her or anything, I just want to help her.

Sister - S

Mom - M

S can be hostile. Really, really hostile. I didn‚Äôt notice it much growing up because it was simply normal. She will scream and cry and yell and be extremely violent and agressive with me often. My mom and I call these ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù. 
There have been countless episodes throughout my life, but here are just a few examples so you get the idea:
One time we were walking to school together and I guess? I was walking a few steps ahead of her

S: stop walking so fast

I slow down a bit and go to walk closer to her.
She then takes her Hydro Flask (a big, metal water bottle) and swings it around to hit me on the side of my head. 

Me: what the hell? 
My head starts like ringing. I look over at her and she‚Äôs sobbing, yelling at me about how I always have to be before her and how I can never let her win. People begin to look at us and S looks very angry and confused. I take her back to our car and she calms down a bit there. I was dizzy for the rest of the week. Her Hydro Flask has a dent in it from my head. That was maybe six months ago.

Another example would be about a year and a half ago. Then, we shared a room. My bed was closer to the bathroom door. She was up and moving around with the lights on. It was maybe 10:00. I had earplugs in and my pillow over my head trying to sleep, so I couldn‚Äôt hear her or anything. I notice it gets darker and assume she‚Äôs turned the lights off.

S rips off my blankets and climbs on top of me, she tears the pillow off my head.

S: I TOLD YOU TO TURN THE BATHROOM LIGHTS OFF!!!

Me: Okay! Okay, I‚Äôm sorry, I couldn‚Äôt hear you. 

S puts her hands around my neck, basically choking me, and again screams about how I didn‚Äôt turn them off when I needed to. She was sobbing as well, her tears dropping onto my face. I managed to get her off me and turned off the lights. I had bruises up my arm and one on my neck. I‚Äôm not scared of her, but it‚Äôs painful to see someone you love so distraught and angry. She looked so confused. 

One more so you can see how my mom deals with it. 
This was a couple of week ago. You should know that my mom is remarried and my dad is sort of a sore subject for S and I, so whenever my mom brings him up S has an episode. 

M (talking to me): Your father needs to pay for at least some of it, I can‚Äôt handle it on my own. 

Me: I know, I‚Äôll call him about it. 

S: who? What are you talking about?

M and I were both hesitant to tell her, but she assumed before we got the chance.

S: Dad, right? Mom, when will we get to see him again?

M: I don‚Äôt know, honey. He won‚Äôt comply with our plans.

S: We should get to see him when we want to!!! I can drive!! I can see him!!! We‚Äôre not babies!!

S goes on, I try and calm her down but she shoves me away and keeps going. She begins to cry and scream and my mom looks visibly distressed. I try and calm her down again, telling her that we can figure it out. S hits me and shoves me into a shelf.

M: I can‚Äôt put up with this from you, S. You need to stop right now.

S doesn‚Äôt stop.

M: nothing happening with your dad is my fault!

S: You won‚Äôt let us see him!

My mom absolutely hates when S says that, simply because it‚Äôs not true and my dad is the only one causing the problems. However, S idolizes him. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, I guess.

M: You disrespectful and insolent child. I do everything for you. He does absolutely nothing. Give me your keys (car), phone and computer. You cannot act like this.

S just screams and cries and looks terribly confused and disoriented. It‚Äôs awful. I hate seeing her like that.

My mom thinks it‚Äôs just that S doesn‚Äôt know her place. That she‚Äôs a brat and thinks she can do whatever she wants.

 The problem is I‚Äôve ruled out her just being bratty and not knowing her place. S is responsible and mature. She‚Äôs kind and funny. The only time she is ever out of line is when she‚Äôs having an episode, and during those episodes, she looks like a different person. Like she doesn‚Äôt even know what she‚Äôs doing. It feels like there‚Äôs someone or something that‚Äôs possessed her, and that someone or something is making her not my big sister anymore. 

I would say that S has an episode two or three times a month. She‚Äôll take whatever situation she‚Äôs in a blow it way out of proportion. 

My mom, thinking to help her, puts strict disipline on us both, but more on her. S is often without her phone or computer, rather doing chores and things of that nature. S does this without resistance, but her mental state continues to worsen and she still has episodes.

Last night, she had another one. She barged into my room, pushed over my bookshelf, and broke my lamp. She also threw my desk chair at me. I don‚Äôt even know why. I called one of my friends and just spilled everything out onto her. I don‚Äôt really talk about it that much. My friend was appalled and said that S needs help, saying that it was borderlining domestic abuse. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad, but I listened anyway. I went to my mom about it, and she said we could try counseling, but I knew she was just saying that. We just moved and there‚Äôs no way we could afford therapy. 

All I want is my sister to be okay. 

I‚Äôm sort of new to reddit but everyone on here seems to be pretty great, so I thought ‚Äúwhy not?   Maybe they could help.‚Äù

So, is it as bad as my friend says it is? What do I even do in this situation? I‚Äôm 14 and I don‚Äôt have a lot of power or anything. I just can‚Äôt do this anymore.

Anything at all is appreciated! :)

434,"Hi,

Just wanted to ask for some advice, even though I don't think there's anything anyone can really say. 

I had a friend that I met at a gathering, after the gathering I took him home twice because I drive and it's not too much trouble for me. We had some deep conversations, but altogether probably only 2 nights of 2/3 hours each. We also met for coffee once, so I didn't know him *a whole lot*. He was a sweet person, very positive and always happy to help and give advice (I was especially confused at the time due to having gotten out of an abusive situation). 

Last Wednesday, I found out that he had killed himself a week previously and that his funeral and rememberance was on Thursday. So I thought, even though I didn't know him really well, I'd like to go pay my respects because he was always so lovely and kind. 

These last few days I've just been annoyed at myself for feeling sad, even though I wasn't very close to him. I think I'm just mourning the loss of a person that's close to my age, and I'm just very confused and unsure how to untangle everything in my mind - there's not much to accept really, he's passed away and we weren't very close. I spoke to my boyfriend and bestfriend and they reassured me that they won't do anything like that and would definitely talk to me if they were feeling like that. 

I have a background of abuse by my stepdad and currently getting psychotherapy and started EMDR recently if that's relevant I'm not sure. I'm just very confused. :( ",10Mar2019,1

436,"I've been working with Jason\* for around a year now but we used to rarely get scheduled together. He always seemed like a nice guy and everyone else at work loved him until a few months ago, when my roommate Mikayla\* (who got me the job there) told me that she heard he sexually assaulted a girl. She didn't hear this directly and doesn't know if it's true but, unlike me, she grew up in this town so someone must've either told her or it was a rumour that was going around.

Anyways, fast forward a few months and no one really talks about it anymore, with even Mikayla acting like her and Jason are best friends again and saying what a great guy he is. Now, Mikayla is (frankly) a little dumb and not very socially aware so I wouldn't put it past her to just not think it's that big of a deal but everyone else at work still treats him normally. Jason and I have been getting scheduled together more often lately and we've been joking around/talking a lot at work. He's been acting like a genuine friend to me even though we don't know each other that well and has started giving me rides home, inviting me to smoke weed (it's legal here) with him and his friends after work and defended me to my manager after she got mad at me for something that wasn't my fault. Note: it's all been 100% friendly and platonic.

Now, I have no way to confirm whether or not the rumour is true. Mikayla heard it at least secondhand and the fact that everyone at work still treats him like their best friend might mean it was just a misunderstanding or a rumour that turned out to be untrue. I don't really know anyone in this town outside of my college friends and coworkers so I can't ask around and none of my coworkers know if it's true. I don't want to stop talking or hanging out with someone who's been nothing but a good friend to me if the rumour isn't true but at the same time I know how easily this kind of stuff can get swept under the rug. If it is true then I wouldn't feel comfortable being friendly with him him anymore, both because it would make him a terrible person and for my own safety.

450,"So I'm really bad at making new friends that I actually like. What happens is I find the first people who accept me and then stick to them, only to realise a few months later that we don't have that much in common and I don't like them that much. And now I'm living with them in a house for all of next year. They're not horrible people, and we get on ok, but I know I could have made better friends when I got to uni. My plan was to join a few societies or clubs or something so that I can attend the activities and have reasons to not be places with them and at the same time have an opportunity to find new friends without them being there. The problem is this year is almost over and joining societies is a bit silly because there's basically 5 weeks left of my year. At the beginning of next year I'm definitely going to sign up to a lot more societies and branch out. But for now I'm left feeling lonely, and limited to spending my free time with people I don't really want to. I'd rather stay in most of the time because I don't enjoy myself whilst I'm with them, simply because I don't add much to the conversation because our mutual interests are limited. I can't sit with other people in lectures either because everyone has their own groups now - and my group is the ones I'm living with.

What can I do? I spend my free time playing games and going to the gym, but I can only do that for so much of the day before I either have free time or feel lonely again. Its making me want to go back home on the weekends to be with my family but I live very far away. Any advice? Do I just stick it out until next year?",10Mar2019,1
451,"So I have a friend who is near and dear to me.
She used to be very lost with direction in her life, and almost to the point were she was suicidal.

Then she found her faith in christianity, and seemed to be ok And I was happy for her.

It seemed to mean a lot to her and I respected the kind of turn around mindset it gave her and helped her move on from those dark times.

However I am not religious and I she is aware of that so she does not push it like the stereotype of ‚Äúbible beater‚Äù.

But now I‚Äôm starting to grow concerned because it feels that when things get tough she becomes ‚Äúunsure‚Äù again and seems less faithful to god, and just is so lost(this usually occurs in times of high stress). But once she gets a moment, her conviction to god becomes very...intense, and I‚Äôm wondering if god is a crutch to her instead of a belief, and if it is unhealthy.

As an atheist friend, I want to help if it is an issue, but I‚Äôm not sure if it is one and if it is, I don‚Äôt want to make it seem like ‚Äúoh religion is bad you shouldn‚Äôt‚Äù.

454,"So I've been having quite a horrible time lately. If you're interested in the hole story here are parts [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/agok1w/so_theres_this_girl/) and [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ajqp92/so_theres_this_girl_part_2/) of it.

If not, here is a (long) TL;DR: a girl from class started talking with me (we're 17), and we hit it off pretty good, we seemed to connect and had a lot in common. Long story short, I didn't ask her on a date or anything, two weeks later, during christmas holidays (I traveled to a different country) we talked a lot via text for a week, then the second week she seemed to have gotten tired of me. When we see each other for the first time it gets akward, then we almost don't talk face to face, and just sporadically by text, which she seemed to answer out of pity tbh.

So a month after the holidays I decided to tell her again I liked her (the first time was during holidays, and she didn't reject me \[which she made very clear\], but told me ""it was too soon"" and to ""get my thoughts straight""), this time she told me she was with someone else, and that she was very sorry. (I told her this just so I could be actually rejected and move on btw).

The guy I always saw her with was my main ""suspect"" of course, but some days after this guy started dating another girl, and around that time, just when I sent her a video on Instagram, she suddenly texted me again. So we kept texting for like a week, but I was dumb enough to let my social anxiety take over and not actually talk to her when I saw her in person. So she obviously progressively texted me less over time.

So next thing you know we have another two weeks of holidays. The last day of school she called me in the school hallways just to say goodbye (which surprised me tbh) because she was the one traveling this time. Then for a few days we exchanged a couple of texts, just to stop talking at all mid the first week.

So today it's the last day of holidays. I said hi to her and asked how she was doing two days ago, but hasn't responded (I actually was just planning on asking her where did I fuck up just after that). Also, I've been so depressed I haven't been able to study practically anything, and I have now a few hours to do a lot, but I still can't.

So that's it. I'm not really sure of the purpose of this post because I know I'm lost case. But if someone has some advice on how to deal with an ongoing feeling of guilt and loneliness, I would gladly read it. Also I don't know if I should tell her something, or even say hi to her when I see her tomorrow.",10Mar2019,1

456,"Alright so I'm pretty sure some people at one point has jokingly thought about getting a sugar daddy. But I've thinking, it honestly is a good idea kind of. I mean like I'm not attracted to 40 years old (which is basically a sugar daddy's primary age or older), but I'd rather have a 27-30 year old. 

It's heavily shunned upon IMO but sometimes it's a way to go. If they were young like the ages I mentioned up above, I'd gladly have sex with them if I liked them...but could be a change of feelings being caught when it's strictly business. I'd be flattered but imagine if you're 18 and a 30 year old fell in love with you. Yikes.

457,"Right now I'm really dissatisfied with my life, but particularly with my friendships. I met a girl in college a year ago and we became best friends. It was all peace in love at the beginning, as with every type of relationship, but now there are several things that bother me about her that I don't know how to approach. 

1. Whenever we go out, she comes first to my house to get ready. She never brings her own stuff, so I always have to borrow everything from clothes to make up to her. I was okay with it at first, but now it really, really drives me crazy. The make up is what bothers me the most, because she doesn't even ask before she uses it and all of my make up is expensive, and she just puts it on to go to casual settings that don't require make up, like going to a mutual friend's house to chill. I don't even wear my own make up as much as she does. I don't know how to put an end to it without being an a-hole about it.
2. The other day, I borrowed her a naruto t-shirt that I use to sleep. She put a picture of her in the shirt on her instagram story with the words ""Best purchase"" LIKE SHE BOUGHT IT?!?!?!? and when I confronted her about it she was like ""ahaha I just wanted to say that"" like it was nothing but I honestly thought it was super creepy and out of place to act like my shirt was hers. 
3. Whenever she asks for something and I say no she pouts and acts all sad and annoying to make me feel guilty about saying no. More than making me feel guilty I want to knock her teeth out. Example: We usually take the bus to go to our houses after class, but the other day I wanted to take an uber. She started doing her gross pout and saying ""but I don't want to go alooooneee"" And trying to guilt me into going in the bus with her. For her it's only a 20 minute ride, for me it's 1 hour, and if I wanna take an uber I should be able to just take it without her being so annoying.
4. She said something mean to me one time and when I called her out she said that I got offended to easily, that she was only joking, and that I couldn't take a joke. After that I feel like I can't say anything that bothers me to her because I feel like she would react in an immature way. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't want to completely cut her off because despite all this she still has some good qualities and is otherwise a good friend, and also I have to see her every day in class, so I just want to know what to do about this. Like I wanna push her away a bit because I'm starting to see her manipulative nature but not completely. How do I approach this?",10Mar2019,1

467,"Hi there, I am currently going through my final year of college. I live away from home for college and have being doing so for the most part of 3 years except for summers when I go home. So my first year down in college I met a whole bunch of new and very interesting people, a whole new world of people who i would never have met otherwise, one of which was a girl who was an international student. The only reason I met her was that I was in one of the same societies that she was in, we spoke once in the first evening that society was on we got along, and then every so often we would chat in the hallways when we seen each other. It was nice I always enjoyed meeting her and simply chatting, I remember one evening before the end of semester exams my class at the end of the canteen me and my class were in discussion about the exam she taps me on the back and wishes me a merry Christmas really cheered me up, she later told me the first semester was to be her last semester here, but the next semester she was back again, her reason to be down here was to work on her English and she felt she hadn't done enough yet. 
My second semester ended early becouse I had work placement, but we said goodbye and that was it she wished me luck and I wished her luck as well. But then I asked myself why not send a Facebook friend request, just one problem I did not have her name, the full name and she was gone and I wouldn't see her again, so I gave up on it and moved on but I always wondered the odd time, when I was around college what would have being. One day though I was looking at old photos from the college's fb page and I found her tagged and now I can send a friend request, but a year and a half has passed since she was down here, and I didn't get her name I found it, and that probably comes across as a very creepy thing to do.

I go to this new lounge that opened not long ago, a few times a week, and I've noticed this girl who works there that caught my attention. She'd wear her other work clothes while working at this lounge. Never spoke to her, but we've exchanged glaces many times. This one day I noticed her (and her parents?) looking my way while talking, as if they were talking about me.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to balls up and try to talk to her, but I never found it conveniant, so I went to her other workplace to ""buy"" something omw from the gym and noticed she was working. We started talking, the convo went well, then later got her number, then I hinted that I had to go and she said ""see you later"".

&amp;#x200B;

I text her the next day, no answer. The day after that, I get a 2 emoji reply. I reply later that day, no answer for 1 day now. The past week I haven't been at the lounge cause I was busy, to see if I'd get any more hints (of her being interested or not).

&amp;#x200B;

I've played hard to get with many chicks before, but man... From what I can think of, she either gave me the number out of pity (which I seriously doubt), or is playing REALLY hard to get.

She also has issues sleeping (waking up multiple times every night) and eating (food is unappetizing, gross, she doesn't eat much, etc). She recognizes that she has problems, but she does nothing to fix them and doesn't listen when I ask if I can help.

She apparently got yelled at by her family and sent me a text just now with the following message: ""I'm ugly. I'm so ugly. I'm not smart enough. I'm not athletic. I'm not fast. I'm not strong. I'm weak. I'm a pushover. I'm useless. I'm a waste of space. I'm a waste of time. I'm a waste of money. I'm a waste of energy. I'm a waste of oxygen. I'm talentless. I'm not kind. I'm not loving.

I'm a mistake. I'm insignificant. I'm worthless.""

So I believe I have feelings for my friend, let's call him S, but I am scared they aren't genuine. A little background: we've been friends since our first year of college, we met through a friend of a friend. I was hopelessly into a different guy at the time (a situation for a different post lol) and didn't really know what I wanted. S and I went on a date  and I panicked due to a fear of committing. Flash forward to the summer and we road tripped together to our friend's, let's call her R, house. Again, there was a lot of chemistry and definitely a possibility of us getting together but I just couldn't commit. Quite frankly I was scared of getting hurt. I know he would never do anything like that, I just haven't been treated well in the past by other men. R then tries to match up S with a different girl she's friends with, they've been dating for awhile but it sounds like things are falling through because S doesn't have feelings for her (and really hasn't from the beginning). Every time I'm with S i'm happy. I love being around him. R wants to set him up with another one of our friends and, selfishly, I don't want it to happen. I just want him to be happy in the end but the selfish side of me wants him to be happy with me. I'm really bad with processing my emotions and usually just put up a happy front so no-one really knows what's going on. I want more time to think about it but i'm worried that my friends are just going to match him up with another girl again in the meantime. Do I tell my friends how I feel? Do I tell him?

489," 

I‚Äôll try to make this short and simple as could be, but I‚Äôm on mobile so please bear with me. FYI, I tried posting on r/needadvice first and it got autoflagged, so trying here instead.

My SO and I bought a house in December and we already have two adopted cats. They are both about 2, give or take. These cats are indoor only, the house is on the smaller side, but nice and works for our current family. No kids, or other pets, I might add.

I have a three pet limit, enforced by my SO because I‚Äôm an animal lover haha, and I used to have a hedgehog. She passed of old age a few months ago, and we recently decided that adding another cat would be a good choice.

Yesterday, I went to a local shelter and I got another cat. The cat is around 2 as well, and was picked up as a stray with other cats, believed to be abandoned because she‚Äôs super friendly to humans. The lady and I had an open discussion, we thought this cat would be a good fit and I took her home yesterday around 3 or 4.

Already having two cats, I did everything the way you‚Äôre supposed to. Brought the kennel with new cat in, put a blanket with her sent in the room, letting everything sit for a few hours before releasing her into a small bedroom. Again, let her sit for a few hours before introducing existing cats. I took away free feeding and have been feeding them together, as well as doing things I know my cats like when new cat is around to form positive association. Everything has been going as decently as can be expected with less than 24 hours, no one is buddies, but nothing hostile or bad beyond a warning hiss when anyone gets too close. With that being said, onto the problem!

I was in the room with cat, which is cat and computer room, and I happened to look down and saw that she had left a HUGE puddle of pee on the floor. I emphasize the amount because I have a feeling she was holding it for a long time and couldn‚Äôt anymore and let it go. She is a long hair cat, and she had tracked through it so she also had pee on her. I wasn‚Äôt angry, I got some paper towels and Clorox wipes and cleaned it up, and dunked her pee soaked feet and tail in some war soapy water with a little protest. My concern is that the litter box was just a few feet away, and there were no other cats in the room, and she still didn‚Äôt use it. I called the woman and she insisted that she used a litter box when they picked her up and suggested putting some pee soaked paper towel in the little box. This is a great suggestion, but my concern are the following:

1. New cat peed by SO computer, VERY close to the tower and plug ins. This is like a $2000 custom built gaming computer. No damage seems to be done, but now that she‚Äôs peed there my concern is that she will continue to, or that my existing cats will try to mark over it. (FYI, moving her to another room is not an option because there is no other room except bathroom with door we can close, and it‚Äôs way too small)
2. I don‚Äôt blame the new cat, I think she‚Äôs scared of my current cats and didn‚Äôt want to come out to the litter box, which I want to make clear I‚Äôm not mad or hating on her for, I understand accidents happen. I don‚Äôt have the week off though, and with this being a new house with new floor I don‚Äôt want to leave her in the room all day to come home to pee that‚Äôs been soaking into the floor for 8 hours, or got on expensive stuff. Cat pee is next level and will ruin shit, and while it thankfully didn‚Äôt this time because it was on a mat, it could easily do that if it sat on the floor all day.
3. It‚Äôs been less than 24hrs and this is a 10 day trail per the lady who was adopting her out request. I‚Äôm concerned to hold onto her and learn that this is a persisting issue, and then be attached and upset to give her back in a week. Also, if this is a persisting once a day issue, because of my schedule I‚Äôll have to hold her all the way until next Saturday before giving her back, and like I said I don‚Äôt have anywhere else to put her, so I‚Äôd be gambling.

So basically, at this point I‚Äôm at a delemia of feeling incredibly bad for confusing not only this new cat but my own cats, as well as getting my SO emotionally invested only to give her back... while on the other hand feeling like I don‚Äôt have the time resource required to give this new cat the coaching and attention she needs for her issue, and that she would possibly be better in a house without other cats, at least until she‚Äôs more familiar/comfortable being indoors in a home.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do, and would like advice. I also did text my SO (he‚Äôs at work) to see what he thinks, but haven‚Äôt heard back. Wanting some outside opinions in the mean time!

**TL;DR:** Bought a new home, have two indoor cats already. I got a third cat yesterday, believed to be an abandoned pet, and did all the introducing properly but I found she peed all under my SO expensive gaming computer despite having litter box access. I‚Äôm conflicted between feeling like I‚Äôve yanked everyone around, confusing new cat, existing cats, and SO emotions, and feeling like I don‚Äôt have the time resources required to properly help new cat, while also question if she would be better in a home environment without other cats until she‚Äôs comfortable with homes in general.",10Mar2019,0

493,"Hey, all! First time poster here. 

I am moving for grad school and met a roommate on a university roommate/subleaser search page. We‚Äôve been talking a lot but for all intents and purposes they are basically a stranger, as they live near the university and I am moving from out of state. We agreed on a 2br 2bath apartment and are signing the lease soon. 

The layout of the apartment has one of the bathrooms attached to a bedroom and the other bathroom is in the hallway directly next to the other bedroom. Otherwise, they are exactly the same size, even the bathrooms appear to be the same size and layout. 

Here‚Äôs my dilemma: I have IBS and GERD. Unfortunate side effects of these involve vomiting and some less than pleasant #2 related things. It‚Äôs pretty embarrassing and I don‚Äôt like talking about it. Sometimes when I have a flare up, I end up laying on the bathroom floor until I get the energy to get up or shower. The honest reason I don‚Äôt want the hallway bathroom is because I don‚Äôt want my new roommate or their friends to hear me if I have an episode. As I said, this is really embarrassing and I really don‚Äôt feel comfortable disclosing it to a stranger. 

I was thinking about using a different reason to ask for the bathroom. My new roommate has a dog and I have a cat. I was thinking about saying something along these lines but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it sounded like complete BS, and was hoping for some feedback: 

I‚Äôve been reading up on how to introduce dogs and cats. A lot of what I‚Äôve read suggests to keep them in separate rooms for the first few weeks, especially if no one is home. I was wondering, if it‚Äôs okay with you, if I can please take the room with the bathroom attached. This way I can leave the cat box in there until the animals get used to each other &amp; I can move it to the laundry room. If you are really adamant about taking that room, it‚Äôs totally okay and we will work something out! I just thought it‚Äôd be easier to keep my cat in the smaller space than it would be for your dog (he‚Äôs a 75 lb lab).

496,"I have quit a few jobs before. I‚Äôm known to be a bit of a job hopper. Some jobs I feel fairly stable in then I leave for something else then find I‚Äôm unhappy and leave. I quit 2 jobs last year and one this year. Tbf 2 of them were volunteer and I virtually got told I should leave as I got so much time off. I don‚Äôt know what happened about the other one. It was a supermarket job and I dreaded it every day then after about 6 weeks of unemployment I left because I literally couldn‚Äôt make myself go in anymore.

I had what is known as a ‚Äúmanic episode‚Äù and embarrassed myself to the point I either couldn‚Äôt go back or they told me it would be in my interest to leave (I had a disciplinary due to my behaviour). I have quit one other job on impulse, nothing really mental health related. I was walking to work one day and realised I fucking hated my job and quit and didn‚Äôt return. 


It‚Äôs important now that I have some income flowing because I live by myself. I am on some sickness pay due to some of my manic episode. The rest of the time I‚Äôm pretty fine. I don‚Äôt think I always quit due to mental health. Maybe it effects my tolerance to bullshit jobs though. I know no jobs perfect but I can‚Äôt seem to get into the swing of sticking at work in the long term. I am 29 and I am scared for my future.

499,"I‚Äôm 18 and a college freshman, currently on spring break and remembering why I hate being home. 

I‚Äôve never had a good relationship with any of my family members, and it feels like every time I‚Äôm home it worsens. 2 and a half years ago I attempted suicide and my parents, instead of helping me get help, just started to insult me and deny therapy. Even now, every time I walk downstairs from my room the first thing out of my mom, dad, or older sister‚Äôs mouth is an insult, usually to my appearance or quirks that I have. Being home to me is just staying in my bedroom and only leaving if I‚Äôm going to the bathroom, getting food, or leaving the house. Every second I spend with my family just makes me want to spend time with them even less than before because it‚Äôs so consistent. I‚Äôve voiced all of my concerns with all of my family members and each time I do they just get mad that I have a problem with them and keep doing whatever it was. Every time I come home on break, I start to get suicidal again.

Basically, what I‚Äôm asking is if there‚Äôs a way that a currently unemployed 18 year old with very little money has any way of not being at home for 3 months. I know there‚Äôs probably not a good solution, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy for me to spend that much time with them.",10Mar2019,1

501,"My first relationship went well for 6 months, since we were hooking up constantly yet we weren‚Äôt dating. Similar to a fwb situation but we both had feelings for each other. Fast forward to just before my birthday and he finally asks me out, comes to my house on my birthday as our first real date, then never comes over again. We dated for 5 months with just enough contact for me to stay but not enough for me to be okay with the relationship. We did keep hooking up during our relationship but it was rare. I ended it eventually, but he led me on as if he regretted everything and wanted to try again. He‚Äôs constantly tell me he loved me and wanted to be with me, then we‚Äôd hookup again and he‚Äôd be distant for about a month. This went on for another 6 months before I finally broke the cycle. He admitted he hadn‚Äôt liked me since a few weeks after we started dating but didn‚Äôt want the sex to end, so he kept acting as though he did. 

My second relationship ended in pure disaster, as the boy I‚Äôd been dating for five months revealed he‚Äôd been in love with my best friend the whole time. She admitted that she‚Äôd loved him too, and then they suggested polyamory and both got mad when I said I wasn‚Äôt into that stuff. I eventually dropped them both and they got together. 

My third was with a boy who liked me for a month, then lost interest for the last three months of our relationship. He was so sweet and caring for a while, but that dwindled down to mainly text conversations and seeing each other every other week. By the end he was blatantly disinterested.

My most recent relationship ended a few weeks ago. It was a lot of back and forth recently as he seemed indecisive as to whether or not to stay with me. He‚Äôd been like that before, but we‚Äôd been able to fix it. We were dating for ten months. Today I talked to him because I wanted to know what his true feelings were and why he‚Äôd been back and forth so much. To sum up what he said, he hasn‚Äôt loved me since October when he first had what he used to call an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù.  He hasn‚Äôt left because he felt trapped in the relationship, although from October to February he never once mentioned anything about breaking up so I don‚Äôt understand how he could have felt trapped.

I‚Äôve loved all four of them and hate that for the most part it‚Äôs been one-sided. It‚Äôs made me lose my trust in dating and caused me to turn down opportunities I‚Äôve been presented with in the last few weeks due to my being unable to trust their feelings. I have no idea how to approach this in the future. I‚Äôm afraid if I bring it up they won‚Äôt want to try a relationship anymore, but if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôll come off as uninterested while I learn to trust them. In fact, after this last blow I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôll react to being in a relationship it all. It scares me. I have no idea how to fix this and any help at all would be appreciated.

TL;DR - All four relationships I‚Äôve been in have been one-sided. I was in love with them, and they later revealed that they didn‚Äôt love me for varying reasons. It‚Äôs made me lose trust in romantic relationships completely and I have no clue as to how I should move forward.",10Mar2019,1

Last night I was a little fucked up and I decided to go on chatroulette. I don't do it often and I've never gone this far before so I'm freaking out. I want to be sure I do everything I can to make sure it doesn't go around the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I was mostly just on there to show my tits to guys who obviously just wanted to master bate. I had a little fun, didn't show my face or speak at all so I figured I was fine. Not so worried about those videos because it's almost impossible for anyone to recognize me from what I showed them. However, there was this one guy and I don't know why but I decided I wanted to talk to him a bit. I didn't show my face at first but he seemed nice so I started talking to him normally. I ended up showing him my tits and then he showed me his dick and then we started master bating together. He did say it was like his second time on there and he doesn't seem like the type to record it, but who knows! He's a stranger and he could have just been pretending. There was only once where my face and boobs were in the same shot (it was an accident so it was like a second), but other than that the video was either just my face or just the rest of my body.

I've also tried the reverse image search in google and no videos or pictures of me pop up so that's good but I'm still so so worried.

509," I'm sorry for the format. I'm on my phone. (Also pretty long) 

  This girl has been my,, Best friend'' for almost 5 years. I hate her. When we hang out, she always makes me look after her 2 little brothers while she texts on her phone. She also makes me pay for her food/different things. Not to mention I spend a lot of money on her birthday gift but she never gives me a gift back. 

   Yesterday I snapped. I hate her sm. I asked a friend of mine (F) if she wanted to go at McDonalds  then hang out at my place. Then my,, bff'' (We'll call her C) found out since she and my friend are classmates in my old class). 

    Somehow F accidentally told her and C invited herself, since we are BFFs. Without telling me.

     We were at McDonald's and suddenly she remembered she,, forgot her wallet' '. I was like : 

   ,, That' s unfortunate. Let's just go at my place then. ''  She then asked me if I could just buy her food too. I excused myself saying that I only have the exact amount of money for the menu I wanted, but she kept insisting that I get a smaller menu. I told her I was really hungry and we'll wait for her to get her wallet(we were really close to her house) , but then she started asking F.

     C told F that she would later give her the money back. Finally, F bought C a small menu. (Not including juice, she had water with her .)
     
     
    I saved my McFizz for later, for after I finished eating. Then C saw me and started saying that she was very thirsty, subtly telling F to buy her a juice too. 

    F ignored her, pretending not to know what she wanted. 

    Later, when we got to my place, we thought it would be fun to sing (I have an old karaoke mic) 
    When we started playing the songs, she complained about how old and dirty my mic was. I ignored her, I always do that. 

    I started singing, (not to brag, but I participated in some local competitions and won, not a very big thing but that means my singing wasn't the worst). 

    She then started telling me it was her turn(which wasn't) and how I was horrible at singing and to just give her the mic. 

    At her turn, I returned the favor by telling her to just pass the mic to F, because she didn't know the lyrics. She got offended since she thinks she's the best at everything. 

    Later, she made a song about me and sang it. I snapped. She started singing about how I look like a pig and should lose weight. (she thought it was funny) 

    So I just snapped. I told her to stop complaining about my mic since she couldn't even afford a Happy Meal. Then I told her she looked like a boy and should stop styling her hair the way she did today. I also told her that she's flat (she told me I was fat so idc) to which she got really offended. 

    F just watched in silence. Excused herself to use my bathroom. 

    C told me that atleast she had a boyfriend (I just broke with mine, my biggest insecurity) to which I responded,, Maybe in fourth grade'' then she started insulting me on my looks and how I was undesirable. I then told her she could herself be someone' s boyfriend since she looked like a boy(her greatest insecurity). 

   She then started crying and telling me how much of a jerk I was. I admit I was pretty rude, but idc about her anymore. This friendship was always about her only. 

  She then left, leaving F with me. F sided with me but since she was friends with C couldn't insult her (she's a really nice girl, I'm glad that she's my friend) 

  The day tommorow, I found out she has been spreading rumors about me at my old school. She told everyone that now that I dyed my hair I'm a thot and always get bad grades.(I was the best in class, no one was stupid, just unmotivated). Not to mention she lied to them about me smoking and drinking. 
 
    I didn't react to the rumours since I cut ties with my old classmates (a lot of new ones came and my friends moved too). 


     How do I get rid of my toxic friend without completely hurting her feelings and spreading shit rumors about me again?

Five days ago i went to the interview, well dressed, i had everything together and i hit it off with the HR lady and her boss!!

He said it was great that I didn't have experience and we had a couple laughs and I apologized for my nervousness but they were all around really friendly.

Towards the end of the interview the HR lady smiled and told me her boss asked her to offer me the job!!

I got really excited and said yes! The hours were perfect for me and they were willing to help me out with scheduling because I'm still a student.

She took my ID, Social Security and Basic life support license and I walked with her to get them printed she talked to me a bit more about the job.

She said her assistant would notify me with more information about the job,""usually we call at the end of the day.""

Cool.


It's been five days and I dont know whether I should call and ask if I still have the job or it was offered to someone else? Should I have gotten a call notifying me that someone else got it? Am I freaking out over nothing?

512,"I'm 27, female, and it was discovered that I had a tumor growing on my prefrontal cortex about 2 years ago. We were monitoring it for a long time, and my doctor is just completely perplexed. It largely has remained consistent in size and hasn't grown, but there have been times that it was inexplicably enlarged or inflamed and then gradually shrunk again.   
At this point, doctor says we can try either a high dose of radiation or have surgery, and he wants to treat it soon, but told me I can take my time for a few weeks to decide as long as nothing happens in the interim.   


I've been sorta procrastinating to see if it would maybe shrink, and also because the anesthesia makes me nervous, but I've been having mental clarity and behavioral issues. There are times of high stress that it feels like my brain is going into panic mode and I have trouble with impulse control and remembering things, and remaining calm. There is some higher intellectual reasoning somewhere within that system and I guess the best way I can describe it is of that reasoning trying to put out the fire of panic I feel but theres not a clear winner.  Usually, in those instances I have intense headaches to the point of tears and I get nauseous and sometimes I cant eat for 24-72 hours afterward without throwing up. So all that being said, whether or not there is any growth in the coming weeks, I do want to remove it. I dont know if I can attribute all of it or any of it to the tumor (I've also recently had a really bad breakup and one of my closest friends died 2 months ago), but I literally think I can feel the swelling and throbbing of something pushing into my brain when this happens and I'm overly stressed out. Other times, though, I feel totally fine. It doesnt seem like the way a cancer patient would feel. Either way, it's messing with my head and I've got to do something.   


  
So the doctor said radiation is an option but I am freaked the f%$# out by that. Surgery is way more invasive but I was told the odds of remission are much better. I dont have to be awake, and I might not have to shave my head, but the surgery takes 3 hours and according to what I read online, women only have a 31% chance of survival if they have surgery and the tumor isnt completely removed, and some studies seemed to suggest that surgery could exacerbate the problem.   
My doctor said he cant go forward with surgery unless I make a living will and ""get my affairs in order"".  I've known for years but I only recently told my family.   


so tl;dr 

has anyone had experience with either of these methods of removal? What was it like? What do I do? ",10Mar2019,1

518,"Some background. I've worked for said company for 4 years now. We deal with a lot of outdoor stuff so naturally the winter months are really slow. This past dec is the first time in almost a decade that they had to lay off the warehouse workers. The day we were let go we were all told, verbatim ""as incentive for you guys to come back in February and not find jobs else ware we will pay you double the first week you're back"". 

Come mid February all 8 of the warehouse workers come back to work. I ask on Wednesday if we'll be getting our double pay this week and management says they'll look into it. Friday comes and I learn from another employee that payroll is already in and it will be on our next check. I'm pissed but mistakes happen so I swallow my anger and decide to wait it out. We get paid biweekly so after another week I ask management again if we will be getting our double pay on the upcoming check. They never get back to me and I learn from the same employee as before, who is the son in law of the owner btw, that they don't have the money to pay what they promised back in December. So not only am I'm not getting the pay I was promised, I was bold faced lied to by management at least twice about it. I was relying on that check to pay rent and now I'm being evicted because of it. 

Every morning we have a little meeting about whatever may be happening that week but usually it's just ""get back to it"". So come monday, tomorrow, my plan is to call them out on they're bs in front of everyone. If there really isn't the money why was I told twice it would be on the next check? I went 3 months turning down interviews to come back to a place just to be stabbed in the back? I really do enjoy the work and especially the people I work with but management is a different story.

520,"Sorry if I do this wrong or formatting is a little bit weird. I‚Äôve never posted before and I‚Äôm on my phone.

Tl;dr I have no financial support and can‚Äôt afford to go to college anymore. I need to know if there are resources to stop this from happening.

So basically, two of my parents (my father and stepmother) who I lived with for about a year before I started college have completely cut me off financially and they‚Äôre the only people I could really rely on for that right now.

Prior to living with them I, my mom and my two younger brothers were homeless for a little while but never received government assistance of any sort hence why I began to live with my father. Up until I began living with him, my father was in and out of my life and offered very little financial support to me anyways (my mother never pressed him for the child support payments he was supposed to give, as she got remarried very quickly afterwards to someone who was fairly wealthy, however, he is dead now and my mom is in financial ruins), however, for college his wife co-signed my student loan.

Late last year, around thanksgiving, after a rather tumultuous September and October, we had a falling out after his wife said to my mom she didn‚Äôt want me in this house for thanksgiving lest she ‚Äúlose it‚Äù and hit me. So I didn‚Äôt go home for thanksgiving, which pissed off both my stepmother and my father despite what my stepmother said. They then decided that I was going to be cut off until I ‚Äúlearned my lesson‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to really even speak to them ever again, based on what was going on as I was living with them.

To provide clarification:

- for a full year they took my checks from work (while I was 17-18) while only giving me $20 for every few days because I didn‚Äôt know better and was unaware of how to open a bank account and was too afraid of angering them to do so myself. When I finally did get a bank account it was because they were going on a trip to a different country and I needed to be able to access funds, and my father forcefully made himself the primary account holder. 

- while living with them, I had to ask for permission to go ANYWHERE or even to stay at school longer than a half hour afterwards. If I didn‚Äôt text my father by 4pm telling him I was home, he‚Äôd get upset and I‚Äôd get yelled at. 

- they also essentially forced me to work at my father‚Äôs work place over the two summers I lived with them for below minimum wage for 12 hours a day almost every day of the week. I would then give my father the money I made. The only exception to this was THEIR days off or when I had to work at my other job, and then I‚Äôd usually work half days with my father.

- they went through my phone by unlocking it with my finger WHILE I was asleep on at least one occasion, and on other occasions would take away my phone while I was talking to someone and then demand I unlock it because they didn‚Äôt believe me when I said that we were doing something totally innocent like me telling them how to cook something (even when the camera was on and there was a literal PAN with an EGG on it on the screen). 

- my father‚Äôs wife would scream at me if she came home and the dishes weren‚Äôt done or something even if she never asked me to do them because she was tired after an 8-10 hour workday even though I similarly went to school for 8 hours a day, was taking 5 AP classes that year and a college class at a community college that year.


This was among a lot of other things that happened, but are some of the biggest things I‚Äôve experienced with them during my one short year and is what makes me very hesitant to ever live with them or ask them for anything again.


Fast forwarding though, I applied to be an RA at my college recently but didn‚Äôt get the position, which I really needed desperately as the majority of what I pay is room and board. I‚Äôm currently paying all my bills myself (about 240 for student loans every month, 130 for my cell phone bill, all my transportation costs to and from work, my textbooks and all other school related costs.) and am also helping my mom pay her rent every month, which often causes me to have to overdraft my bank account since i don‚Äôt make that much money working my current job. Since my father and his wife won‚Äôt be co-signing another loan for me, and probably wouldn‚Äôt agree to let me live on campus anyways since they believe I‚Äôve become ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù since I started living at college, I‚Äôll have to find a way to pay for college myself.

I‚Äôve thought about commuting and finding roommates and living off campus, but housing costs in the area I‚Äôm in are really high so even if I got an apartment with several other people, minimum rent is usually about 1k per person, but even that low is really hard to find. Given all these things, I don‚Äôt think I can afford to go to college anymore, and will probably have to drop out before the Fall 2019 semester even starts.

I‚Äôm at my wits end and really don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôll take all the advice I can get.",10Mar2019,1
521,"Hi everyone, I really need help right now cos I‚Äôve been lost thinking about this everyday for months. Sorry for my English I‚Äôve just recently learned to speak it.
I‚Äôm not going to go into too much details, just enough for you to understand the struggle.
Basically: I spent my 6th and 7th grade in a big school, I HATED it. It was a very hard environment to work in. I hated the people there, I barely had any friends and they weren‚Äôt even good friends. I am usually a good student but this was so hard even my grades in some classes went down (nothing too bad, they still stayed excellent, especially in maths and physics).
My parents saw I hated this school, so they moved me to another one. It was way smaller, it got time for me to get used to but when I did I liked it way more there. Fast forward to now, approaching the end of my 9th grade year, I have now spent 2 years in my old and almost 2 years in my new school. I have friends here and my grades are back up in most classes. Now here‚Äôs the dilemma:
My brother is a senior, and he is choosing for his future. He is in my old school but likes it there. He is currently looking where he is going. This made me wonder what I am doing. Since I am very VERY young, I‚Äôve always wanted to be in the military. Not just a vague idea, but since my 6th grade I‚Äôve been looking at how and through what schools it is possible to achieve my goal. When changing schools I didn‚Äôt really think about it, but I have been ever since more and more. I have researched it, called and mailed everywhere and the conclusion is strict:
The only way for me to do what I want is to go back to my old school for the following 3 years.
I have been killing myself (metaphorically) over this question everyday for months, and my parents are pressing me to take a decision. I don‚Äôt know if things are gonna be any different if I go back to my old school, but I know that right now and for the previous 4 years, I haven‚Äôt been interested by ANYTHING other than that. Everything other sees unsatisfying and I just can‚Äôt see myself doing anything else.

Sorry for the essay, but thanks a lot if you read it. I really appreciate it.

TL;DR: For me to achieve my dream studies and then job, I have to go back to my old school which I hate.",10Mar2019,1

If you are reading this and entertaining the idea of chiming in with advice - THANK YOU. I do not have anyone in my life who I can turn to for this kind of advice, so your time is very much appreciated.

Some quick background:

Last summer my roomate, let's call him Steve (his name is not Steve), went off the deep end with his alcoholism. It got so bad I would routinely find him passed out or moaning unintelligibly on the floor in the middle of the day. He flunked out of grad school. Fell behind on his rent and bills. Lost his clients, etc. Bad bad stuff. I worked with his (now ex) girlfriend and father for weeks and weeks to try and get him help. Trips to the hospital. Calls to area rehab centers. So much time spent negotiating with a drunk person. Ultimately he refused to get help.

Instead of owning up to any of this, he doubled down and laid the blame for this on me. The last several months since have been living hell. It has been daily acts of aggression or yelling with crazy incidents peppered in. Here are some ""highlights"".

1. Caught him trying to defraud me by over reporting the electric bill by hundreds of dollars, multiple times. Alcohol does not make you better at math, or a good liar.
2. Reacted to getting caught over reporting bills and passing his late fees on to me by threatening to kill my cat, multiple times.
3. Stormed up to my room drunk at 2am and trashed my stuff that was in the hallway. As I calmly asked him to go away he continued throwing my stuff around and tried to get me to fight him. This was all caught on video thanks to my mom. She heard I was having roommate issues and mailed me a Wyze cam for my hallway/door. When I pointed out he was on video we went wild, breaking my stuff and taking ""half swings"" at me, again unsuccessfully trying to goad me into a fight.
4. Complained about me on Facebook for leaving my AC running when I left for the day. Apparently our mutual friends were telling him it looks worse that he's a 35 year old complaining on facebook than it does that I left my AC on, and he deleted it.
5. Tried to dump an entire litter pan of rancid litter down our sewer drain in our backyard causing a massive, cat turd filled back up.
6. Is constantly calling the police on me for smoking pot in my room while listening to music. We live in a big city, so the cops never come obviously, but it is really stressful dealing with the constant threat of it. I work from home so I'm usually here working, listening to music and smoking pot. My therapist tells me I'd easily qualify for an MMJ card for PTSD from childhood, but it would adversely affect my insurance so I haven't gotten one yet.
7. Constantly running up on me with his phone camera pointed at me while I'm doing menial tasks in our common area, grilling me about being messy or the pot or the music. Nothing I'm doing is bad enough to warrant that kind of treatment. It feels like he's using the threat of the camera to intimidate me or imply the threat of legal action. He's clearly unstable and my main goal is just steering clear of him as much as humanly possible.

SO. This brings us to today. I'm planning on buying a house and moving out early. I've started working with a realtor and once my taxes are back from my accountant, I'll start the preapproval process with my lender. Yay first time home buying!!! My girlfriend will also be moving in together in this house so there's even an extra layer of excitement!

My lease here doesn't expire/renew until September. 1st of this year. But I've budgeted to be able to afford the downpayment and ride out my rent until September. I will of course offer my landlords to vacate earlier if they are willing to fill my place early, but they are busy people and don't have any incentive to do so, so I'm not planning on it. Also I would feel terrible moving a friend or acquaintance of mine in, knowing how bad it has been for me.

My main concern is ***how do I insulte or protect myself from him in the meantime?*** I have the Wyze cam my mom sent me, but that honestly seems to make him more paranoid and angry - he literally yells at it, to me about it when we leaves the bathroom at the end of my hall. I want to never see this guy again after I move out. But his ""videos"" (my girlfriend thinks he isn't really even recording) make me worry that he would try to sue me or further harass me to settle his own vendetta/shame/who knows. He keeps saying he has ""over 75 videos of my messes or me having/smoking pot in my room"" and it feels like a threat with legal implications. Especially given how he's always threatening to call the police on me. My therapist and girlfriend think he's capable of losing it and hurting me/us.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My drunk roommate won't stop harassing and filming me. I'm worried he is going to try to sue (not sure what for) or me or attack me before I manage to move out.

533,"I'm 20[M], have been through two relationships. Still have yet to come close to sexual activity. I don't care that people know I'm a virgin, I could care less. I just feel like it's this secret club I'm not apart of. 

People constantly say ""you're not missing out on much"" but ffs that's not helpful at all. They'll say that, then they'd talk about how great it is. I constantly come across reddit posts talking about it as if it were some regular thing that kills me inside, I've been with friends that talked about it and the sheer awkwardness of not being able to relate at all. It's literally everywhere, and you want to tell me 'I'm not missing out on much'? 

--you can skip this this is just me ranting tbh--
I'm not unattractive. I have a decent build, not overweight in the slightest. I have two skin conditions that I have to regularly deal with that sometimes pops out, my teeth are a tad bit fucked (not horrible, but I have a dentist appointment soon though thank god), but other than that I'm not ugly. Tinder at least gives me a glimmer of hope, I get a respectable amount of matches, and I've been on a fair share of dates.

My personality kills it. I'm awkward as hell, I'm weird, and honestly have nothing really going for me (key word here) at the moment. This isn't in a self depreciating way, I've made a hell of a lot of progress the past 5 years. I've chosen jobs that challenged me, I've been in therapy, I've fleshed out my style a bit so I look presentable. 

But after all this fucking work it's still not enough. My first SO went from ""I fucking love you"" to a ""welp nevermind I want to leave"", broke off 'mutually'. my last SO went on for 6 months with no sexual talk/activity at all outside of a kiss to end the night, eventually ended when we did talk about it and she said she thinks she's asexual but she wasn't sure. Broke off 'mutually' but I didn't expect to break up that day. Can't help but think it's the same deal as the first, an 'oops nevermind you're weird' kind of deal and jet. Although I kind of noticed her lack of affection so I believe her.
--end rant--

I worked myself up with the last SO, told myself I would finally do it, then it ended. Honestly it's getting so bad any sight of a happy relationship just brings me to tears. I can't watch regular porn because it just makes me sad (writing it out makes it seem hilarious tbh), skip past romantic scenes in movies because I can't handle it, I constantly am off and on Tinder because it makes me feel horrible but it also gives me some sort of hope.

But it‚Äôs barely visible in low lightning, I never have my phone outside with me.

I try taking photos that can make it visible without making it obvious to send to her so she can tell I have bad acne.

But no dice.

I feel like going outside, and taking a selfie to send to her just so she can see.

539,"For a little backround last year i was friends w this girl for about 6 months or so and i liked her but she was in a relationship. I realize now she might have liked me kind of at the time but never did anything. By the end of the year she seemed really weird with me in the fact that she would talk to me like her best friend one day and ignore me another. I decided she was sick of me and stopped talking to her in the summer entirely. Around August or so she followed my instagram and liked all of my posts and commented on them. I assumed maybe she was just messing w me so i forgot about it. A few weeks later when school started she was talking to me daily but again i thought nothing of it. Soon she heard i was having a bday party and she told me she really wanted to go. I figured at this point she may just wanted to reconnect with me so i agreed and we had fun even though it wasnt really her crowd.

 Later that year i planned to ask her to Homecoming but i was too late so i went back to minding my own business. A mutual friend of ours asked her if she would have gone with me and she said she would have loved to. At this point i liked her again and for a few months we talked daily but she was too busy to ever hangout. 

Suddenly she gets another boyfriend and i feel really bad cuz i had never admitted to liking her. I decided i needed to get it off my chest regardless of what happened and i told her how i felt. She said she felt very bad about it and that she was sorry she didnt give me a chance. I figured at this point it was stupid for me to stick around for an awkward friendship so i split for a few days. For no reason at all she was more flirty than ever and talked to me more. She started trusting me with stuff she wouldnt tell others and i did the same with her, assuming we could just be close friends. 

A few months later the same mutual friend as before asked her if she liked me and she said she would date me if she didnt have a boyfriend. Fast forward a few weeks and they break up, i ask her if she is ok and she said she is. She told our mutual friend she wanted a relationship with the right person so i asked her if she would try one with me and she rejected me. I wasnt too mad about it because maybe she was emotionally shaken from it up until just a few days ago when she starts up a relationship with another guy. I decided to just to stop talking to her cuz this was just another bad thing going on in my life. She realizes that im going through a tough time and tells me she is always gonna be there for me and trust me. 

My actual question is what do i do? After discussing this with my friends they say i can find someone else and everything but she just keeps coming back. I wanna be her friend but it seems like im trapped in a cycle with her. I cannot tell if she is a genuine friend or not and if i cut her out of my life she could very well find another way back in.",10Mar2019,2

543,"Dating someone who tries to force your friends to be their friend? Sometimes even excluding you in the trio?

There are three people in this story, excluding myself (24F). My partner (25M) who we‚Äôll call Jack. My roommate/best friend (24M), who we‚Äôll call Steven. And my visiting friend, (24M) who we‚Äôll call Tom.

I moved away from a city where all of my friends lived, and found it incredibly difficult to create real friendships through college and the jobs I did. So I really kept a tight friendship with those out of town. For the record, I have equal male and female friends, just the women tend to be either too far, or have kids so I don‚Äôt see them quite as much. Just a disclaimer for anyone bagging on me for having ‚Äútoo many guy friends.‚Äù

So, I haven‚Äôt seen Tom since High school, and we want to hang out. The thing is, he lives 4 hours away and our schedules conflict a lot. He finally said ‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù and came over for a few days for me. I was working almost the entire first day and a half, barely getting to actually hang out with him.

The moment I finally do get to hang out with him, Jack comes back from a trip. A little bit of insight on Jack, he has a habit of making me the 3rd wheel when I‚Äôm hanging out with my friends and I include him.

I love having my friends and my boyfriends meet, I want to have the people I love and the people I like all around me. But he can get possessive and rude to me around my friends. Also, not very many of his friends care to get to know me. I just don‚Äôt fit in with his crowd I suppose, being rather quiet and introverted in comparison.

Anyway, I finally get out of my work clothes and relax about to go actually hang out with my friend who‚Äôs visiting me. Tom, Steven and I are sitting around talking and Jack comes up and asks Tom if he enjoys this specific game Jack loves. Steven and I never play the game with him because we don‚Äôt prefer that game type. We‚Äôre both RPG-ers. Tom is kind of a ‚Äúlittle bit of everything‚Äù sort of guy, so he says ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs alright.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs face lights up and says ‚ÄúSweet, lets play!‚Äù I said ‚ÄúActually, Tom and I were going to go and do something together.‚Äù Like, Idk play a game together.

Jack gets pretty mad and says ‚ÄúSeriously?! Why are you taking this from me???‚Äù I just paused, as did Tom and Steven.

Steven then says ‚ÄúDude... you know he‚Äôs HER friend. He came to hang out with HER.‚Äù 

Jack gets upset and goes to play his games. And I‚Äôm just sitting there a little embarrassed and feeling like maybe I was wrong.

TLDR: I‚Äôm dating someone who got upset that my friend who visited from out of town was hanging out with me instead of him. Blamed me for basically trying to take my friends attention from him.

I‚Äôm curious as to what others think. Is this a red flag? What kind of behavior is this?",10Mar2019,2
544,"This happened in Massachusetts.  Crossposting from //r/legaladvice because the automod says there is not a ""clear legal question"".

&amp;#x200B;

I moved in with my friend, S, in the beginning of January to live off campus at the university I was attending. She had lived there since August and had been friendly with the other 3 tenants living there. One moved out, leaving a room open. Another tenant, H, who had also been living there for a time, began acting cold toward us. She began trying to run the house like a mother (She is 28, other tenants are much younger, as we were all attending university).

Unbeknownst to us at the time, H had been becoming jealous of how close my friend and I were (we have known each other for 7 years), and began trying to sabotage S's life. She apparently called S's mother figure to complain that S and I had come become close, leaving her out of our friendship and plans, etc. (keep in mind she is almost a full decade older than us). She also called my friend's DCF worker to claim that S was ""doing hard drugs and assaulting other tenants"", which was obviously false. It seems that the only way she could have gotten the DCF worker's contact info was by going through S's mail, but we have no way to prove this. We have also learned about that development far too late.

When contacting DCF did not provide the results H wanted, she decided to provoke S using tactics that she knew that S's past abusers have used. S then responded by yelling at H. The one thing that I wish hadn't happened was that S said ""I'll fuck you up"" in a fit of rage. However, she immediately removed herself from the situation in order to cool down and remove any threat. H sat through this straight faced and unafraid, because she knew she was getting what she wanted. Apparently H contacted police after this. She then provoked S again several days later, after S had written a handwritten apology for losing her temper (H was not speaking to us). After provoking S a second time and refusing her apology, she contacted police again. This time, she requested an emergency restraining order, despite S removing herself from both situations after losing her temper in order to deescalate the situation. She also said that an arrest warrant would be needed because ""S would not show up for court"". For context, she has literally bragged about doing this to another roommate (RED FLAG).

S was unexpectedly arrested from our home, and was informed of what H had filed/said before being given a court date. However, they presented the court dates to her in a confusing way, and said that ""her next court date was Feb. 1st"". Apparently the court date for the restraining order was a few days before that, unbeknownst to us. H took advantage of me and S not being there and extended the restraining order to a year. S got diversion for a simple assault charge.

We did not even present a case, S's DCF lawyer was adamant that she speak directly to the DA with her to get diversion. The DA himself said that it was ridiculous that the case got this far, and it really shouldn't have. Despite that, he could only do so much at that point in the case, and gave S diversion as planned.

Now, S cannot live in that residence, and I feel unsafe doing so. We went back to our hometown to regroup and figure out a plan. We asked our landlord, who I'll refer to as P, for at least S (and hopefully me) to be excused from our leases. She refused, but offered to help someone to take over our leases or let us sublet. S has been working tirelessly to find tenants, but now P does not want anyone to sign a new lease or take over our leases. Also, no one wants to sublet for 2 months (how long until our leases are up) with no guarantee that they can stay beyond that. So now, S and I are paying 800 dollars a month for a psychopath to rule that residence, and we are both very tired.

Sorry if this is long winded, it's a convoluted story. If there's any advice anyone can give, I'd appreciate it. At this point, the living situation and not having to pay are our biggest concerns, because the diversion is minor and we just want to continue on with our lives. We feel that the landlord is keeping us at arms length until our lease is up, when it is her tenant who forced us out in the first place. We may have no standing, but I don't know.

Is our landlord within her legal rights to continue to force my friend to live there if she legally is not allowed to step foot in the house? Is she required to find a new tenant? Since I am not legally involved with H, does that negate any right I have to work something out with her?

I've been friends with this girl for about five years now. She's celebrating her 18th birthday this week, and I invited her for ice cream to celebrate, but there's more to it. Like I said before, she's been in the best relationship she ever had, but her parents don't like the guy, because he's Mexican, and they're racists. They've taken away her phone's SIM card and her home internet access. She can only talk to him before school starts, and it's putting a damper on her demeanor.

I've liked her for a long time, and she even asked me out after we knew each other for a year, but I'm Christian, and my parents disproved. I wanted to say 'yes.' For the next four years, she's been in countless failed relationships, where the guy stopped talking to her, formally broke up (only a few did this), or sexually assaulted her. Every time she told me about this, I wanted to try after she cooled down from the event. I can't though. My parents have already said 'no' since five years ago. It kills me that she was settling with people that abuse her, and I just want to give it a shot.

I'm 18, she'll be this week. I think 'screw it, I'll try when I get the chance,' but she's been taken for 7 months now, and I doubt it'll end.

567,"Hi everyone, 
I've always been a little bit of a jack-of-all-trades and performed pretty well in school. I found that art+design and languages interested me the most so I found myself having to choose between them when deciding on a college course. 

I wanted a balance of art AND design so I majored in Textiles. Reason was, I wanted to have the independence to express myself whilst being able to apply it in a design context (with purpose/target market etc). As a highly creative degree, I found myself balancing it out by reading about basic philosophy and psychology in my spare time. Psychology (and emotions) have always fascinated me but I hated the way it was taught at high school so I never pursued it.

Whilst I loved the course and got high grades, I felt that it wasn't making the most of my strengths. I'm worried that by pursuing a career in textiles, I'm not pushing the 'academic' side of me that has so much potential. 

Right now I'm 6 months out of college, working in retail, and I want to get out soon. I'd love to have SOME sort of career direction.

I've started looking into things like UX design, or maybe trying to go down the Graphic Design route. At this point I'm just looking for some idea of a career direction that suits me as a person and would pay reasonably well. 

Over the last 6 months I've done all those career-for-your-personality quizzes and have researched careers in Buying, Marketing, Merchandising, Design (textiles), Graphic Design, UI, UX, Consumer Behaviour/theory ... and I can't decide on one route (I know, careers aren't linear)

$20k per year where I live, and in my current position, is more than enough for me. I could find a place to rent for $500/mo, and I do not have any other expenses aside from paying off debt. At $20k, I would be able to pay off my debt in a single year, and still have money saved after all of my expenses. After that, I would be in the position to start looking at going back to school, or finding something that pays more. $2k per month would be literally life changing for me right now. 

So, I suppose my question is, what are my options for finding something part time that pays 15-16 dollars per hour? Is there anything I would be able to do from home? I am a writer, but freelancing hasn't been cutting it. It's difficult finding consistent work. I am a very creative person, and I do have a lot of experience with graphic design. I also enjoy altruistic work. Sorry, just kind of ranting to get my ideas out of my head.",10Mar2019,3
574,"I'm 15 and want a kid really bad, I know kids are hard work, I've been babysitting since I was 8 (obviously it wasn't proper babysitting back then but I did start proper babysitting later on) I won't be living off of my family for money as once August comes this year I can legally work (I turn 16) I won't be getting a lot of money but it would be enough to take care of a baby. So basically I can provide a child with all of their needs.

I have a fear due to my depression that I won't live long enough to get married and have kids properly and all, but I know that even one kid is going to keep me motivated and happy because the last thing I'd ever want to do is abandon my kids.

Personally I know that I can give my child the best life they'll ever get and in return they'll help me, even if I have hard days with them or because of them.

575,"Basically, I've been engaged for a few months to a Russian man (I'll call him V) whom I met online a few years ago.   
V has always been incredibly kind, supportive, and helpful in my studies of his native country and language, which started long before we met, and in January we decided that we'd like to get married somewhere down the line.

Things recently started to get weird. I can't decide if things are actually bad or if I'm getting hung up on small things that I consider to be red flags. 

The big one is that V has started opening up to me about his ""past"" drug use when I ask for advice, then posting photos of himself drinking lean on instagram all of the time. It's not the drug use that bothers me; I am very open-minded about drug use, but the fact that V tries to tell me he's ""matured past all that"" when he wants to tell me how I should be living, but posts publicly on social media that he's still using, is worrisome to me. 

Then there's the possessiveness. V seems to get really worked up when I don't text him back fast enough, even though we're separated by an 11 hour timezone difference, and I'm often asleep when he texts me. Recently, he's started calling me 3 or 4 times every time I don't answer a text within an hour. I guess part of it is that I've heard about Russian men being sort of possessive, but I don't know if this is a normal cultural misunderstanding or if this is really a problem?

The last thing is that V keeps telling me that I don't need a doctor for my depression and that I should be taking a probiotic, which really just annoys me. He almost refuses to acknowledge that I have an actual, serious mental illness, and I keep trying to explain that he needs to support me, but he keeps trying to be the *only* person that I need. It's almost an endearing sentiment, but it's also isolating and invalidating.

577,"I work in a law firm. I‚Äôm actually training for office manager when she retires next year. Paralegal (‚ÄúP‚Äù) that is a good person but not amazing at her job. I cover for her, I pick up more work because she cannot keep up. 

I called out sick. Attorney asked P to pull something off my file on shared server. P doesn‚Äôt know how to access the shared server (I‚Äôve shown her dozens of times) she asked office manager (‚ÄúOM‚Äù) for my computer password, this was at 9:30 a.m. She states that our team chats ‚Äúpopped up‚Äù and she read conversations between me and another associate. We chat about work projects, and vent to each other, mostly about P because we both pick up her slack. At 11:00 P used the call feature in chat from my computer and called associate but hung up. Around 12:30 P sent a message, from my computer, to associate how if we have a problem, we need to say it. I was informed that P had been on my computer off and on all day. I called OM to see what was going on, and she began to yell at me on the phone. 

The next day at work, P didn‚Äôt shut down my computer. The chat was expanded and folders were left open, even my printer was jammed. I went to talk to P, she ended up yelling at me to ‚Äúget the fuck away.‚Äù So I did. The rest of the day P and OM ignored me. One of my attorneys told me to go home because I was sick. I left and went to doctor to be diagnosed with the flu. While in the doctors office, I hear that P went into another attorney‚Äôs office. I got a note not return to work until the next week. 

That weekend I was able to speak with the attorney. He told me I need to work on the relationship with P &amp; OM. I also learned that P told attorney and OM that I was telling others about law firm workings. In fact, someone was talking about their salary to another person about 3 weeks prior, which I told OM. 

Monday, OM, tells me ‚Äúwe need to be on the same page and P was not snooping.‚Äù I don‚Äôt own the computer and my bosses could‚Äôve read what I said but the reality is: 1. THEY own the computer, please feel free. Not P. I stand by what I said. 2. Everything I ever said about P has been brought to their attention. There was no attack on her personally just discussing work product. OM brought up knowing I‚Äôm excited to take her position but she‚Äôs still there and I need to realize that. I knew this would be a long year since she‚Äôs been (to quote my attorney) ‚Äúthe priestess of the temple‚Äù for 25+ years. 

This was 2 weeks ago. There‚Äôs tension in the office, P insists she‚Äôs not upset but feels trust is broken. Which it is. OM isn‚Äôt speaking to me and doing petty things to make me feel pushed out. Before this, OM and P were clicky. 

I feel privacy was violated, and angry with how OM is handling the situation. I fully acknowledge I‚Äôm an asshole for venting my frustrations.

I thought  it was over until I found out that the ceilings paper thin and I can hear everything they do (walking, talking, etc..) And that's fine but their daughter is constantly screaming, running, stomping, and jumping on her bed. Her room is right above mine and it's absolute hell. 

She's awake from 7 to 10 doing this and it's driving me insane. I have insomnia and getting to sleep is already difficult enough. I've asked them to keep it down before and they never do and the landlady won't do anything. Today was the last straw.

587,"*tl;dr I told my fiancee that I thought she was sent by god to help me and she's okay with it, now I'm worried I'm messing her up psychologically.*

&amp;#x200B;

So I was / still am having a really rough time with a health related anxiety disorder so the best thing I could come up with was to marry a nurse / doctor. Now I suck with women and before I met my fiancee had never had a relationship before. I made a vision board with a picture of a hot nurse on it and prayed a lot for one too. I then had an arranged marriage to an aspiring nurse and when we were going through a break up I told her this story in an attempt to say ""it's not you I'm just crazy"" and she just accepted it and in the end promised to be a nurse for me and assured me she was cool with it because she wanted to be a nurse anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Then when she failed her first nursing interview I was really worried and she could tell and when she asked me what was wrong I tried to dodge the question but when she pushed I just basically told her I was worried she wasn't gonna be a nurse then the whole story in my mind would fall apart.

&amp;#x200B;

Because she's religious too she ended up believing this whole story as well. All the atheists are gonna say this is transferred psychosis or *folie a deux* and I wouldn't really blame them but this story is 100% true.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to feel about this because I never expected to pull it off it was just a coping mechanism at the start. Obviously I'm happy that I got my hot nurse, But I feel like putting such a huge burden on her by telling her she's my savior or something might hurt her psychologically, like I only want her because she's a nurse and that's her only value to me. Was it wrong to tell her?

If not, here is a (long) TL;DR: a girl from class started talking with me (we're 17), and we hit it off pretty good, we seemed to connect and had a lot in common. Long story short, I didn't ask her on a date or anything, two weeks later, during christmas holidays (I traveled to a different country) we talked a lot via text for a week, then the second week she seemed to have gotten tired of me. When we see each other for the first time it gets akward, then we almost don't talk face to face, and just sporadically by text, which she seemed to answer out of pity tbh.

So a month after the holidays I decided to tell her again I liked her (the first time was during holidays, and she didn't reject me \[which she made very clear\], but told me ""it was too soon"" and to ""get my thoughts straight""), this time she told me she was with someone else (she didn't who it was), and that she was very sorry. (I told her this just so I could be actually rejected and move on btw).

The guy I always saw her with was my main ""suspect"" of course, but some days after this guy started dating another girl, and around that time, just when I sent her a video on Instagram, she suddenly texted me again. So we kept texting for like a week, but I was dumb enough to let my social anxiety take over and not actually talk to her when I saw her in person. So she obviously progressively texted me less over time.

So next thing you know we have another two weeks of holidays. The last day of school she called me in the school hallways just to say goodbye (which surprised me tbh) because she was the one traveling this time. Then for a few days we exchanged a couple of texts, just to stop talking at all mid the first week.

So today it's the last day of holidays. I said hi to her and asked how she was doing two days ago, but hasn't responded (I actually was just planning on asking her what had happened, just after that). Also, I've been so depressed I haven't been able to study practically anything, and I have now a few hours to do a lot, but I still can't.

So that's it. I'm not really sure of the purpose of this post because I know I'm lost case.

Also I don't know if I should tell her something, or even say hi to her when I see her tomorrow.",10Mar2019,1

When I first met his family, he was going through enough as it was; his biological parents divorced and his father at one point had a tumor, but he got it removed, yet still suffers some effects from it.

About 5 months ago, his mom and his stepdad (the two parents he lives with now) confessed that stepdad went to the ER from having seizures, and it turned out he had Glioblastoma, a rare and deadly form of brain tumor. What they told me and my family in secret confidentiality, but not their son, is that the doctor gave the stepdad an estimate of about 12 months to live, even with chemotherapy.

Things have only gone downhill from there. The mother of my friend has gone severly religious in a desperate attempt to find ‚Äúa miracle‚Äù for her husband‚Äôs tumor, and gets physically violent with him and the kid when things aren‚Äôt going her way.

The stepdad, in return, only intensifies every argument in the household. My friend knows the true fate awaiting his stepdad but doesn‚Äôt let his parents know that he knows.

Last night, I went to spend the night at their house, and after them constantly arguing and preparing to fight with each other (not me but still), I got out of there and back to my house as early as I could this morning.

I‚Äôm feeling the urge to report their abuse, verbal physical and recent reliance on drugs, to CPS. I know that if I call CPS to report, the family will be separated, but 1. I need to know if I‚Äôm fully justified in doing so for my friend‚Äôs long term safety and 2. What exactly I say on the phone to CPS.

603,"For a little backround last year i was friends w this girl for about 6 months or so and i liked her but she was in a relationship. I realize now she might have liked me kind of at the time but never did anything. By the end of the year she seemed really weird with me in the fact that she would talk to me like her best friend one day and ignore me another. I decided she was sick of me and stopped talking to her in the summer entirely. Around August or so she followed my instagram and liked all of my posts and commented on them. I assumed maybe she was just messing w me so i forgot about it. A few weeks later when school started she was talking to me daily but again i thought nothing of it. Soon she heard i was having a bday party and she told me she really wanted to go. I figured at this point she may just wanted to reconnect with me so i agreed and we had fun even though it wasnt really her crowd.

 Later that year i planned to ask her to Homecoming but i was too late so i went back to minding my own business. A mutual friend of ours asked her if she would have gone with me and she said she would have loved to. At this point i liked her again and for a few months we talked daily but she was too busy to ever hangout. 

Suddenly she gets another boyfriend and i feel really bad cuz i had never admitted to liking her. I decided i needed to get it off my chest regardless of what happened and i told her how i felt. She said she felt very bad about it and that she was sorry she didnt give me a chance. I figured at this point it was stupid for me to stick around for an awkward friendship so i split for a few days. For no reason at all she was more flirty than ever and talked to me more. She started trusting me with stuff she wouldnt tell others and i did the same with her, assuming we could just be close friends. 

A few months later the same mutual friend as before asked her if she liked me and she said she would date me if she didnt have a boyfriend. Fast forward a few weeks and they break up, i ask her if she is ok and she said she is. She told our mutual friend she wanted a relationship with the right person so i asked her if she would try one with me and she rejected me. I wasnt too mad about it because maybe she was emotionally shaken from it up until just a few days ago when she starts up a relationship with another guy. I decided to just to stop talking to her cuz this was just another bad thing going on in my life. She realizes that im going through a tough time and tells me she is always gonna be there for me and trust me. 

My actual question is what do i do? After discussing this with my friends they say i can find someone else and everything but she just keeps coming back. I wanna be her friend but it seems like im trapped in a cycle with her. I cannot tell if she is a genuine friend or not and if i cut her out of my life she could very well find another way back in.",10Mar2019,1

It‚Äôs very much like the man does all the work, and the women doesn‚Äôt ask questions or talk back and is expected to be the stereotypical housewife. At get togethers or vacations the girls are always the ones expected to clean up all the mess the men make. It‚Äôs looked down upon if we smoke or drink, so he‚Äôs always getting mad if i want to drink when were out with friends, even though he‚Äôs allowed. 

And something that is really putting a strain on our relationship is how bothered he gets if i try to ask him questions about his work. He is involved in many different things in order to make money (some which is a bit sketchy), and especially recently if i try to ask him about his work he gets very angry and starts yelling. During arguments he would sometimes hurt me. I feel like he has no sympathy for me as when i cry he will get even angrier. 

He knows hurting me is wrong and he mostly keeps it to a minimum ever since a situation where he made my nose bleed and his friend had a serious talk with him. He does still squeeze my neck sometimes when things are really heated.  I feel as though i can‚Äôt blame him because when we are sexually intimate, we sometimes like being rough like choking or slapping, so i feel it has transferred to our fights. He is changing though and this is a not a common occurrence so i don‚Äôt feel as though it is an abusive relationship, at least not now. 

Overall he is a very good man and does so much for me. But this is putting a serious strain on our relationship to the point of us almost breaking up. 

Is it normal for a man to want the woman to not care what he is involved in work wise? How do i let the intense need to know what he is involved in go? I want to make him happy and stop always questioning him but it is so damn hard. I hate not knowing the details of his life and i have never had a boyfriend who feels as though i am ‚Äúnosy‚Äù for caring and wanting to know these things. I feel like as his girlfriend he should be able to share those details with me but he feels the complete opposite. 

Please don‚Äôt tell me i need to leave because of the violence because he really is putting an end to it. Please give me advice on how to handle my questions and what i should do to make this relationship work. 
I‚Äôm not sure how to handle his attitude and am so confused about what‚Äôs right and wrong. Thank you. ",10Mar2019,1

608,"Throughout my educational career I found all the work pretty simple and could achieve decent grades with little effort or revision. I was always in trouble throughout school, being put in isolation often. However despite this I had a great relationship with almost all of my teachers.  I would often stay behind having long conversations with teachers about life and what not. 
So overall I have enjoyed education even though I know that it‚Äôs made to normalise obedience and robot like behaviour to prepare children for the working life in a factory or whatever. However I feel like university is a waste of my time. The statistics on employment following university are terrible, it is rare for someone to actually get the career they aimed for with their degree. I don‚Äôt even know what career I want, i am at uni simply because I thought it‚Äôd be in my best interests to take up the opportunity. 
Now I‚Äôm regretting my decision. University life is known for being a financial burden and the most stress many people will ever endure. I just feel asif putting myself through years of stress and putting my self in so much debt is pointless. 

The only reason I could see myself doing a degree is for the knowledge gained rather than the degree id get. I‚Äôm considering doing a philosophy degree rather than psychology but even then I can see it being more stress than it‚Äôs worth.

611,"Tuesday night I was in a biology lab from 5-8pm. I couldn‚Äôt use my phone during it, and when I got out there were a bunch of messages. My friend (we‚Äôll call her N) had messaged me asking which floor advisor was on duty that night. Another friend that lives on our floor messaged me about half an hour later asking if I knew why N was leaving in an ambulance. 

N has struggled with depression her whole life, and I noticed things had been especially bad for her lately. We had had the previous week off from classes, and when N got back to campus Monday night we got dinner together and she seemed like she was doing a bit better, so I don‚Äôt know what triggered her the next night. (And when I say she was doing better, I know she people make the decision to end their life they can be very happy, but she wasn‚Äôt at that level, she just didn‚Äôt seem completely miserable.)

All I know is that when she got in the ambulance she was walking on her own. I don‚Äôt know if she actually attempted or if she was just feeling like she was going to. I haven‚Äôt heard from her since, so I‚Äôm assuming she got committed to a psych ward. I have no idea where she was committed, since it depends on where a bed was open. I‚Äôm close with her family, and I don‚Äôt know if they know. N doesn‚Äôt have a great relationship with them, and she‚Äôs 25 with her own health insurance so I‚Äôm not sure if she wanted her family notified. I‚Äôm pretty close with her family. My own disowned me over my sexuality, and N‚Äôs family has pretty much adopted me. I spend holidays with them, and was planning on spending spring break there. (My birthdays a couple days before break and her family‚Äôs insisted on throwing me a party.)

Most of her issues with her family stems from her own mental health, but I don‚Äôt want to tell them about what happened if they don‚Äôt know. If they do know, they could probably tell me where she is and what‚Äôs happening and it would make me feel a lot better. 

I‚Äôve been a bit of a wreck since this started and it‚Äôs just been weighing on me more and more everyday. I know she‚Äôs safe wherever she is, but I can‚Äôt get over the fact that no one knows where she is or what happened. I have nothing to worry about, and yet I still can‚Äôt stop worrying. I don‚Äôt know how long she‚Äôs going to be away either. I‚Äôve been an emotional wreck, and it‚Äôs only getting worse, I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

How do I deal with this?  Should I contact her family?  Is there any other way to find out where she is?  Advice from anyone that‚Äôs been in a similar situation would be appreciated. 

TLDR: my friend was committed to a psych ward, but I don‚Äôt know where. I don‚Äôt know if her family knows since she‚Äôs 25 and on her own insurance. I‚Äôve been an emotional wreck since she left and I don‚Äôt know how to cope with all of this. ",10Mar2019,1

613,"Context:

My friend is currently in an relationship of around 3 years. We both study at the same university and have known each other since high school. We have been going to parties regularly pretty much since we've known each other. His girlfriend is not going to university so she can't go to student parties.

The girlfriend, my friend and me are together in a club for young adults that organizes events and goes out partying regularly. She and me also play music instruments in different music clubs, despite them not being the same, we have a lot of common acquaintances through them.

I live in a dorm room and let my friend stay overnight when we go to student parties.

The friend in question has a reputation of having a lot of female acquaintances and just in general knows a lot of people.

&amp;#x200B;

Incident:

My friend talked to a girl at the student party, she went home with us, stayed at my apartment and they fucked in the morning while I was laying in the same room pretending to still be asleep (we agreed to get up at a specific time and he set a few alarmclocks in 15min intervals in advance so it should be pretty obvious that i was awake but with closed eyes).

I am disappointed in him and mad at me allowing the whole situation and also kinda mad at him for thinking that I'm that stupid to not notice. How do I handle the situation, do I just tell him that i know what happened? How is he gonna react if I tell him? Do I just wait and see what happens?",10Mar2019,5

Problem number 1 is my family's control. They are well-off, but their help is conditional. I went to college for four years because they told me to (I don't regret it because of the social interaction there). But after college they told me to just figure it out. I was controlled and never got the chance to ""figure it out."" 

Problem 2: When I told my family that I love writing, and that I want to go to trade school because I enjoy working with my hands (cooking, hair design, electrician, etc.)...they disapprove and discourage me by saying that I would fail anyway. My self-confidence is destroyed. I feel like a failure no matter what. My family wants me to be something like a lawyer or teacher...Those aren't the paths I want to take. 

Problem 3: 3 weeks ago I had a mental breakdown and quit my job at a hotel. I saw a therapist 2 times. I confided in 3 close friends that I nearly ended my life. I lied to them and said that I was totally better. In reality...I've been struggling. I feel like I can't talk more about this with them. I hate that I would worry anyone and be a nuisance. I could tell they were worried ...and I don't want them to worry again or stop trusting me.

But while actually studying, I dropped partying (and drinking) that much and with that lost the habit of alcohol. 

That of course normally won't be problem but:
I fucking forget I cannot drink that much anymore. I basically go back into combat drinking mode, end up being stupidly drunk and waking up with an awful hangover and a lot of shame about whatever I did in my drunken stupor.

She will not stop knocking on our door at fucking 5:30 AM in the morning, despite discussing every night the night before exactly what to do when she wakes up, putting a visual schedule on our doors, and assuring her that we have alarms set and will get up when the sun gets up.

At age 17-18 I found a group of people at school that I played games and had fun with. Unfortunately, I was probably the only one who did not have friends besides that little group of ours so when I went to university and we stopped seeing each other frequently, the group stared to break up and eventually everyone found some new people to hang out with except me. At this point I'm 3 years into university and it's killing me that I spend all my days either at home or uni and I miss having someone to just hang out with. The people at my uni aren't bad but I highly doubt I would become friends with them, even if I wanted to. In addition, most people I hung out with were guys, which means I don't have a lot of experience in talking to girls and I've never been in a relationship.

It's hard to get to know someone there and I'd hate to go alone.  Some public events? There's a lot of people and I'm a bit too intimidated to just come up to someone and start a conversation. Maybe I'm just over exaggerating and it's not really that bad? I know that I might sound clumsy or lazy but I really dream of having a group of good friends, going to parties once in a while, travelling, having a girlfriend but I need this start, this push that will set things in motion. And here's where I go back to the questions in the title. Any ideas where else you can meet people? Have you had any similar experiences and would you like to share?",10Mar2019,1
643,"Any insight is appreciated, I just thought a man's advice would possibly make more sense since my situation revolves around ... well, a man. 

I am pretty clueless when it comes to dating. I recently broke up with my boyfriend, who I had been with for almost 5 years. I am a 21 year old woman. He is the only person I had EVER dated, slept with, etc. The breakup was amicable, our futures just didn't line up. 

Now, here is my current situation:

There is a guy in my university in the same program as me, let's call him Shane. Last semester, we were in the same class and met at the end of the year class party. I had never really spoken to him before, he came over to me, I was pretty drunk and we had a fun time talking and playing games. After that, I was actually still working on an essay for the class, and he visited me while I was writing in the library to give me moral support. I didn't talk to him over the Christmas break, but I remember feeling a bit attracted to him at the party. Of course, I was still with my boyfriend, so I didn't really think much about him. 

We ended up in the same class again this semester, and spoke briefly a few times. We both found out we like board games and D&amp;D, and so I organized a group that included him to come over to my place and play stuff. He would frequently message me to ask if I wanted to hang out and do stuff, I was pretty busy and was unable to most of the time. He started offering me rides to the school since we both had the same class, and so we both do that for each other now. 

Here is where it gets...well, interesting. 

There was a break in February for a week. We both are from the same city, and we talked about possibly meeting up to work on ideas for a D&amp;D campaign. He didn't message me until one night, where he invited me out to this arcade-bar thing with him and his friends. I have been trying to be more social lately, especially because just a bit before that my boyfriend and I had talked about separating, and so I accepted and went. 

It was not my type of environment at all. Loud, filled with drunk people, just all around an anxiety inducing space for me to be in. I messaged him I was there, and he found me and hugged me hello. That surprised me, I am not a super touchy person, but I could tell he had a few drinks so I didn't say anything. 

He bought me a drink, introduced me to his friends, and the both of us went off to play some arcade games. I just felt like I was under a spell the entire time. I never intended to get drunk, or drink much at all. In fact, I wanted to be able to drive back home! But I just suddenly wanted to be around him. 

He was so nice, talkative, funny...he would hug me a lot, grab my hands, grab my waist, etc. However, he was very affectionate with his friends too, so I just assumed that was how he acted when drinking. 

I had a few drinks myself. He kept buying them, I felt bad, I gave him some money for them. He kept getting really close to me, it was REALLY loud in there, so to talk to him I had to lean in right by his ear. At one point, I was so tipsy, so happy, feeling so good that I leaned in and kissed him. We played some games, then after that I did it AGAIN. I do not usually act this way, I have never kissed anyone other than my ex boyfriend, but something just drew me in to him. 

I realized I fucked up because after the second kiss, he said he didn't want to get in the way of my relationship. I told him my relationship was dissolved at this point, and we went on playing games. 

Eventually we were getting tired, it was late, and he got an uber and we went back to his place. He offered to let me stay since I had so much to drink. There, we talked a bit, and fell asleep in the same bed. He was really affectionate the whole time, kissing my head, cuddling me, etc. It just felt so nice that I didn't think about it at all. At one point he said he ""really liked me"". 

The following morning, I went back to my car, thanked him for inviting me out, and I guess I am just wondering about how he has been acting lately. We haven't spoken about this at all. In fact, he seemed to have withdrawn a bit. We still give each other rides to class, but he doesn't invite me to stuff anymore. I am still figuring out my living situation with my ex, and figuring out where he is going to stay. I have mentioned this situation to Shane because none of my other friends have been through an amicable break up, but he has, so he offered advice. 

So now I find myself thinking about him a lot, just worrying. Why has he not been talking to me as much? Was his behaviour that night just him being really drunk? Is he actually not interested in me? Should I ask him? How do I ask him? I really like him and don't want to mess this up. 

Thanks so much, sorry it is so long!

TLDR: Guy and I go out with his friends, him and I both really drunk, he is super affectionate, says he likes me, but now he hasn't been talking to me as much recently and hasn't mentioned that night at all. What do I do? ",10Mar2019,1

646,"Ok so, 22M here never had sex or a relationship. Ive kissed girls before but im pretty certain every time I have ive been intoxicated and she initiated it. I know girls find me attractive and have literally told me this, but I just have no idea how to go beyond casual conversation. Every time I get close to having sex I actively end it, eg at a party a girl was quite obviously wanting to get with me and I left. Honestly just venting a bit but what do you guys think? Ive never texted a girl first and tbh it terrifies me. I guess what im asking is... how do you have a relationship, sexual or romantic, as honestly I have no idea and theres girls I like that like me back but I just dont know what to do!! 

I only began to get noticed by girls around 18/19, I think the lack of experience up until this point along with my anxiety issues is what is causing my problems now but idk..... any advice/insight/anything is appreciated.

649," I am looking for advice on how to get into PR from a political background that is not specifically focused on communications. I have impressive accomplishments and experiences on the legislative side of politics but doubt that translates over to PR? I also have some political communications experience. Simply put, I have created all of the content for different levels of political media campaigns and have some media contacts, but I have not been responsible for managing the day to day social media accounts (analytics), or the primary contact for journalists/media people. Ideally I would not have to start over at the ground level for any PR position, but I am open to anything at the moment.

**BACKGROUND:**

I graduated a top 25 University and have 5 years experience in politics and political communications.

Aside from the hard legislative skills and accomplishments, I have placed stories in national media outlets, such as the NYT, CNN, and CNBC, I have facilitated numerous national media interviews and helped facilitate and guide the narrative of hour long national TV specials. Furthermore, I have worked on content creation and national media narrative formation for one of the two major political parties during a presidential election, and I have created talking points and briefed members of congress to prepare them for both TV and print interviews. Finally, I have experience writing press releases and op-eds for members of congress and governors.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Also, do you think I will have to start at then entry level for a PR job/firm?",10Mar2019,1
650,"Hi Redditors,  

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm F/young adult and i'd like to request some advice and help to this situation. I recently started my new job in a firm, mostly my time is spent near other Female coworkers, either dividing chores or completing processess. I've been feeling like the odd one out, since I am not the most social butterfly out there.  Mostly, I sense a sort of hostility towards me, either to my answers or interactions and a overall disinterest from them. I find it very hard to mix up with them, can't really go along the overall feeling of their conversations and I find myself getting one or two answers that I can't really tell what they mean by what they say. Sometimes, due to my social awkwardness ,I end up being the ""clown"" of a certain subject, being reminded of such awkward moment in later similar events. I've been trying for a while to friend one of them, but I feel like there is already a ""group"" formed in which I have no way inside.   


 I don't know if it's relevant, but i'm the only one on the more heavy body size.  
 

Has anyone gone through this situation or a similar one and has some advice? It's a very stressful situation and for me it makes my work harder and my overall mood worsen.

651,"My best friend from school that I've been friends with for like around 9 years now suddenly became weird. Let me explain.

We know each other from school and we stayed friends even after he moved to another school, city and then country. Then we ended up both in different cities in russia. One day I asked him to move to canada with me for uni, we met up in moscow, the capital to take the IELTS test. I get a pretty good result, he gets like literally just under the required test result. Anyways, without telling me he ends up in another uni, not the one we planned to attend, in a completely different region of canada. Anyways, he gets his visa and travels, I don't. Visa issues. Whatever, I plan to go next semester/year. Basically while in Canada, he lives with a random family that ""adopted"" him, but not really, to stay and feed and look after him for money. From what I know he got emotionally fucked up (depression) and tried some drugs there. Definitely weed, but not sure if that was his 1st time, but some shrooms and fuck knows what else. During all this we kept in touch, but he did make some good friends and we eventually talked less and less, but the love was there, planning to reunite again and do some shit. Now this is where it all starts. Sometimes we talked while he was high on weed (from what he said) and he started saying how aware he was about everything. Every hair in his body, everything around him etc. Not that weird, whatever. Over time he started saying how aware he is of life, how we can picture anything and momentarily see the path to it. Like he can picture himself as a millionaire and boom, he knows every step to it. No, hes not a millionaire, he barely survives. He got lonely there and moved back to his small town in Russia. We talked like once a month there. And every time he would tell me how he figured shit out And cant wait to see me to explain it all. Every time I asked literally anything about anything, he would answer: it's a long story, will tell you when we meet. Now 1 month ago I moved to moscow and I have a pretty big apt here from my parents, and I told him he can come and stay and help me pay down the loan on it. Its ""some services loan bullshut"", not the point. He agrees, come with his gf, all good. He starts shoving all this awareness of life, past life, astral projection, energy chakra whatever down my throat. To be honest, no offense to anyone, but that's a load of crap to me. And he says hes not hindu, he just has his own beliefs, which are practically identical to Hinduism. Which is pretty stupid. He says that he knows people from his past life, symbols from past lives and loads of other crap. He acts completely normal otherwise, just all of this came out of nowhere. He was 100% atheist before. And every time I try to ask him to prove that he can feel souls through walls, walk through astral projection and all that shit, any and every excuse comes up or he gets mad. Is this some kind of mental, trauma shit? I don't mind it honestly, but I cant wrap my mind around him ending up that way. I hope it's not a cult thing.",10Mar2019,1

653,"I work for a small company (under 30 employees) and have a co-worker who has turned into what can only be described as a bully. She insists that everything be done her way, and only her way.  Normally, we work around her demands, but it has been escalating and I'm at a loss about where to proceed (apart from finding  another job).  I actually really like the work I do, but she's making doing my job impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

Within the past year she's been given a new responsibility which means she looks through the logs of what we do during the day, and she signs off on them.  My other co-workers and I also have this responsibility. When my other co-workers have a question about this log they just ask the person and often the person explains what they meant or corrects a typo and that's the end of the interaction.  It takes all of 5 minutes. We all make mistakes, but they're usually minimal and always easily corrected in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I put into the log a set of data that she didn't understand.  She sent me a 2000+ word e-mail CCing my manager about it, complete with screenshots.  I explained the data as best I could to her, as did my manager,  and I thought the issue was closed.  She signed off on the entry. And she had signed off on an identical entry a week earlier, without any questions.  On Friday (a full 3 weeks later), during an all team meeting she put my log on the screen to tell everyone everything that was wrong with it and to use it as an example of how not to make a log entry.  My manager and my other coworkers explained to her that what I had done was correct, and that she just wasn't understanding the point of the experiment as it was very different that the typical entries she was used to seeing. She refused to let it die and this went on for over an hour. It was incredibly uncomfortable for everyone. All of the others in the meeting all explained to her that she was incorrect, the data was valid, and that the experimental protocol was different from what she might have expected.  None of this seemed to matter to her and she continued ranting until time literally ran out.  

&amp;#x200B;

After the meeting, I went to the bathroom only to hear her complaining outside the door to my manager that I was wrong and needed to be ""punished"". WTF? When he didn't agree with her that I was wrong, she grabbed all her stuff and left work an hour early.  I know she's going to be making my life hell next week and for the foreseeable future because if she doesn't get her way, she escalates like this. I'm honestly afraid she's going to go after me physically since she often tells stories about how when she doesn't get what she wants in her day to day life, she resorts to violence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had my monthly meeting with my manager after this meeting. He agreed that it was rude and bullying behavior.  I told him I have severe anxiety and this is making it very difficult for me to do my work, as she's picking apart everything.   (Plus, it's not just me she's picking apart, it's all of us, but if we ask her to make a change to her log she flat out refuses.)  He said he'd talk to her, but he's not one for confrontation, and she's been told a few times to tone it down already. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should my next steps should be?  My manager is on site part time and we do have a part-time HR person.   Do I wait and see if she calms down after my manager talks to her? How long do I give it?  Or do I go straight to HR?  What's the best way to cover my butt?   (FYI: this is a throwaway)",10Mar2019,1
654,"This might be kind of long, but please I really feel I need some neutral, objective advice here.

I moved this last Fall for a new job with the company that I've worked for for the past few years.  I worked in a call center in financial services and I hated it.  I stayed in the job for years and gradually just started to hate it more and more.  The people I worked with were cool, the hours were reasonable, I got paid about 60/yr, but just the day to day of it drained me.  I needed to get out of there.

Everything outside of my job was cool though.  I lived in an apartment with 3 room mates, one of them was a really good friend and the other 2 were guys I recently met and were really chill as well.  We hung out a bunch during the week, would hang out at bars on the weekends, etc.  I also had a few other friends in the area and was only like 30 minutes away from my home town friends and family.  The area (NH) was perfect for me as well as I love to snowboard in the winter and hike in the summer, it was super easy to drive a little north and get to the mountains. 

I applied to this job at my same company which was more back office operations, got away from the call center, but it was about 2 hours away from the city I lived in in RI.  I was so excited to get away from the call center but stay with this great company to work for that I didnt really think it through what I was leaving behind.  A lot of people were shocked that I was just gunna move away for this job but to me it felt like I needed to, everything happened really fast.

I'm 6 months in and I'm pretty miserable.  The job isnt too bad but I miss how chill my life was.  I've made no friends here.  I've had a few hookups from tinder that have made me feel kinda depressed when it didnt lead to anything more.  I basically leave every weekend to see my friends ( in the winter I kind of had to so I could snowboard since they dont really have mountains down here.)  My weeks are just mediocre, I just kinda work, go to the gym, go home.  The weekends I leave and have fun with friends but I feel so depressed when I need to come back on Sunday (I have the feeling right now).  I'm excited about the job opportunities down here but it feels like theres absolutely nothing else for me here.

So my choice is coming when my lease on my apartment runs out in 2 months.  I could talk to my current boss about trying to find a job back in NH with the company.  Shes really chill and nice.  I think she can tell I'm miserable, I do fine at my job and everything but I think its just really obvious.  She basically brought up that she wants to help me get where I want to be within the company, ""whether thats this department or else where"".  She brought up shadowing with the next level up  from my current job as well which I think I'm pretty close to being able to move up to if I wanted.  This job seems like I'd enjoy it more, but I'd have the same problem of being lonely down here, having to drive forever to see my friends and do the things I enjoy.  If I ask to go back to NH I'd probably get in on a job on the phones, but I think I'd have a few choices to find something I would hate less than the old job I left.  I'd live with my parents for a while if I did this, save a bunch of money on rent, and then maybe look to move back to my old city down the line.  Also, its important to note that staying with my company until next june at leats is improtant, as I lose about $25k in 401k contributions if I leave before this time, so either way I see myself staying here until next summer, and beyond that I'd probably quit altogether if I went back to NH once I get this 401k money vested and figure out the rest of my life from there.",10Mar2019,1
655,"Of course looks matter, but let me offer you a refreshing perspective, LITERALLY EVERYONE, has worked or altered their looks in one way or another. Think for a second how ugly society would be without orthodontists, braces, make up, so on and so forth. The gym has really helped people too! Having a nice body kind of compensates for being ugly. And if you‚Äôre tall, then you‚Äôre in luck my friend.

Males are just as indifferent. My phone is dry, unless my mom calls. So believe it or not you‚Äôre in the same boat as plenty of people man. Trust me. We always think we have it worse than others until another poor bastard comes along and makes your problems seem so insignificant. 

‚ÄúThe people who are happy are those who rule their thoughts.‚Äù 

Go into everything with boldness and confidence. I get turned down by every girl the first time and the second time they come around. We all want something normal, but guess what? It DOESN‚ÄôT EXIST. 

What I think it comes down to is, society‚Äôs standard of what‚Äôs attractive has risen. We live in such an integrated world, especially a sex-saturated society, that we as a whole, have inadvertently heightened our expectations. Stop being so hard on yourself man. Honestly, I‚Äôm telling you what I should tell myself sometimes. And if you want to change your looks, remember you‚Äôre just altering your exterior (this being said, might want to start with something small, like getting Invisalign to correct your teeth. Ever since I got Invisalign I‚Äôve been smiling a lot more and people take notice of it. Women tell me I have really nice teeth.) I‚Äôve met plenty of people that are outwardly attractive but absolutely vapid that I‚Äôm turned off. I‚Äôm not saying go out there and get treated like a door mat. What I‚Äôm saying is, keep your cool, mind your own business and don‚Äôt be so servile. Work the whole assertive thing to your benefit. If I can do it, you certainly can.

Just like there are black people that wish their skin was lighter, there are white people that wish they weren‚Äôt so pasty and pale. Just like there are some short people that wish they were a bit taller, there are also people that wish they were a bit shorter. Just like there are overweight people that wish they were thinner, there are thinner people who wish they could gain a little more weight.

I had depression for years and now I'm finally coming back around, but I was sacked from my last job, not discriminatingly because of the depression but more from me refusing to cooperate with them etc from anxiety.

664,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about 3 years. We started out long distance and she moved here with her child (now age 8) to be with me. We had an apartment together and things didn't work out the first time around. This was mainly because she has PTSD and had a drinking problem at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved out and we became more and more distant until one day she broke up with me through a text message. I ended up moving back into the apartment for a while but bought a house while we were broken up (breakup lasted about 7 months).

&amp;#x200B;

She tried reaching out to me many times until she finally tried moving on. I decided that I couldn't live without her and reached out. It turned out that we both missed each other every day and we had a conversation to clear the air a couple days after getting back together. I told her how in the last couple weeks of our relationship I hung out with one of my good female friends from highschool. I honestly couldn't remember if we ever hung out alone until we were officially broken up (my other male friend from highschool was over there to my knowledge both times we hung out and I tried explaining this to her). She got really mad thinking that I was trying to line someone else up before we broke up. This could not be further from the truth because it was only platonic. I never pursued this woman for a relationship even after my girlfriend and I broke up. I was just trying to be honest with my girlfriend so she would trust me. I was never in a place to move on even if I wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

During out breakup my girlfriend also moved her mother out here and right before I reached out to my girlfriend she found out that her mom has terminal cancer. I've done what I can to help like taking time off of work to take her mom to chemotherapy appointments, bringing dinner, etc. Just trying to be the best version of myself I can possibly be.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the issues. We started arguing because my girlfriend was becoming increasingly moody. She wouldn't tell me what was wrong. I finally got her to open up to me and she said she said it was a number of things. She didn't want to go on dates with me because she thinks I check out other women (which I don't think I do but said I would be extra sensitive about that), she thought my body language was indicating I was looking at porn (I informed her I haven't looked at any of that since we've been back together), and that she still didn't believe me that my friendship with the other girl was platonic (mind you, I told my friend I couldn't talk to her anymore and it was bad for my relationship and blocked her when I was hanging out with my girlfriend). My girlfriend was short with me and didn't want to hang out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a couple more weeks and she said she was upset about the other girl still, that she didn't think it was platonic, and didn't hang out with me for about a week and a half.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were better for like 3 days until I said I was going to stay at my house for a night or two because I own a house and need to be here sometimes etc. The next day she said she was in a bad mood and I told her if she wanted a little space I'd come over the next day. I actually ended up asking her if she wanted to hang out anyway that night but she said no that she thought I was staying home and didn't  prepare for me to come over (it was kinda late when I asked). Well the day came and she was being very short with me. I called her on my break at work and she said she was in a bad mood. I asked if she wanted to hang out she said maybe and we decided to play it by ear.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted her when I got home asking if she wanted to hang out and she said something like ""idk what do you wana do?"" I said I didn't want to pressure her into hanging out if she needed some space and we could hang out tomorrow. Well the next day rolled around and she said she didn't feel like she could express herself to me. I told her that I didn't want her to feel that way and to lay it on me. She said she felt like I do more with my family than her and I'm embarrassed of her or something. My sister had been in an altercation and she was basically jealous I was trying to help her out. She said I never take her anywhere (I went to dinner with mom because I hadn't seen her in a while and my girlfriend even made the suggestion). She was mad I didn't text her all day when I was with my mom and I pointed out that she could have reached out to me too. I asked her if she wanted me to take her out that weekend (mind you, she recently told me she didn't wanna go out with me). She changed the subject and got mad about the girl I hung out with right before our first breakup, yet again. Then just completely stopped responding.

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't respond for 2 days until I finally told her I was concerned about her well being and she coldly replied that she was fine no worries. I asked her if she wanted to talk and she said ""at some point, yeah"" and went on to explain about how she won't tolerate any dishonesty in her life etc. I told her that's fine to talk when she's ready. I kept texting her goodnight and that I love her and only received silence in return. I didn't text her for 24 hours and then I said I'd like to talk when she's ready and that I'm not trying to force her into conversations when I'm reaching out and that I just want to make sure she's ok. I said I hope she's doing ok and that I miss the sound of her voice and her family. She said in her reply she's not trying to be dramatic or mean. I said that's fine and to take her time and that everyone has their own process (when she talked to me last week she said she has a mental illness and get stuck sometimes). I told her to talk to me when she's ready and that I'll be here. She said ""thanks miss you too"" and I left it alone. I texted her goodnight and that I love her and received no reply.

This afternoon I sent her a funny YouTube video to try and lighten the mood and still haven't got a reply.

What do I do?? I love this woman with all my heart. I'd never cheat on her. I want her to trust me. I have terrible anxiety and I'm trying to not put pressure on her and be a man but it's so hard.

665,"Hey, Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I am incredibly anxious about posting anything like this so please bear with me if it's excessive or long winded. 

I'm 19 and live in the UK. I've recently had an influx of news about family members that has caused a bit of an emotional strain, but it's not something that I've not dealt with or at least been made aware of before. I just seem to be handling things very, very poorly, and it's taking a heavy toll on me.

I'm currently medicated for depression and anxiety and have been through a lot of therapy, finishing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy a little over a year ago now which has been a great help. Right now, though, it doesn't feel like my medication or the things I've learnt from CBT have been doing very much to help and I'm reaching the end of my tether. If someone responds slightly negatively to me, or doesn't do something in the exact way I'm expecting, my mind instantly jumps to the worst conclusions and it's just making everything feel extremely overwhelming.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do at this point. Being 19 means I'm not a priority when it comes to additional therapy. Being on medication and having already gone through CBT, which I was referred to by my doctor, makes me even less of a priority. I can't afford to go into private therapy right now since I'm on minimum wage and trying things like 7 cups of tea doesn't work for me. I've been looking at drop in centres to see if there's anywhere I can go but all of the places I've seen are for minors. I feel like I've exhausted all my options and I really don't know how to get myself out of this right now. 

Any advice or tips or tricks or even just a kick up the ass is welcome, I'll take all the help I can get right now. Thank you",10Mar2019,1
666,"I'm a 16 year old dude, people have always told me that I was smart and that I got a bright future in front of me and all that, but I'm never motivated to do anything these past 2-3 years.

I got into the best school in the region (med school) and have started failing my classes, cause I never study, and most of the time in school I'm asleep or on Reddit. The only reason i persued med school is 'cause of my parents who more or less forced me to. It was my decision in the end, but they pressured me into it.

I'm constantly feeling depressed and suicidal, but I don't have the balls to just go and do it. I went to a therapist but he just told me I gotta suck it up. And no matter how much I try to make my parents take me to a different one, they just say no, or guilt trip me.

My mother has multiple sclerosis, and is also constantly pushing the blame on me for it. Whenever we get into a small fight, she says ""My eye is hurting again because of you."" She also screams at me for every small mistake I make. I honestly think she's bipolar cause her mood changes very drastically often. When she's in a good mood she's okay but that happens rarely.

My father is even worse. Recently he bought me a Graphics card, and now every day when he sees I'm not studying he starts threatening me that he will take my PC and my phone away. This wouldn't be the first time, in elementary school, he took my PC and phone for over 6 months, even though my grades were okay.

My sister is just an annoying cunt who constantly sets me up by lying about things she know's will get me in trouble. She once, when we got a new bed, took a marker and wrote a small P (First letter of my name) without anyone noticing. When my father did notice he slapped me as hard as he could a few times while I was screaming I didn't do it. He then went and did the same to my sister.

Like 3 years ago, 2 months before enterance exams, I was preparing for the regional chemestry competiton. He came into my room and asked what I was doing so I said that I was preparing for the competition. He started yelling, saying ""You should be preparing for the enterance exams, the competition does not matter."" When I said that I wouldn't listen to him one bit, he left the room and didn't speak to me for the whole day.

Earlier today my sister came into my room screaming (just to piss me off), while i was trying to study. I kicked her in her thigh and she ran off. Minutes later my father came into my room, asking why had I kicked her in the stomach a few times. I immediately figured out that she lied, just to set me up as usual. He screamed at me how he wanted to murder all of us. He said that if he went to prison at least he would rest from us. I said that we would rest from him as well, and he threatened slapping me. As he was leaving the room he called me a piece of shit and told me I should be ashamed of myself. About an hour ago my mother told me: ""He's been like this ever since I didn't pick up when he called today. I just didn't hear the phone ringing."" I responded by saying: ""So he's taking it out on me?"" and she said: ""He's taking it out on all of us, there's nothing we can do.""

I also have Diabeted and Celliac disease, making my life even harder.

I have absolutely no appetite, just looking at food makes me sick, which reflects quite poorly on my health. I eat two meals a day at most just so that I don't die. They feed me well and all that, its just that i don't have appetite.

My grades are also awful, but I just can't force myself to study.

This is only scratching the surface, but sadly, I don't remember every time he did something bad to me.

I can't call CPS, cause this is Serbia and they wouldn't do anything. Also considering he doesn't beat me all that often, I'd have no proof, and he could just deny all my accusations of mental abuse. Also I'm scared that my life would be worse afterwards, if I do get taken away or whatever. This option just scares me and I don't want to do it.

I told one of my professors at school who I'm close with about my parents, but he just never gives me any sort of advice or anything, just brushes it off.

I'm just hoping of surviving for 2 more years and then moving out and finding a job and all that, that's when I'll finally be free.

667,"I'm a local government employee, and have been in my position for a few years. Part of the problem, is that there have been six supervisors that have been placed in charge of my job (and other jobs) in the time that I've been there.

My current supervisors are new enough that they don't understand what my specialized position requires. More importantly, I do not think any of them care to learn, or understand that there are budgetary restraints that they feel they cannot fix.

I am being questioned by others in more superior positions as to why things are not getting done. I'm telling everyone, at every level, the truth. I cannot keep up. I need help.

I am worried about the perception that I am simply incompetent. I'm worried about the perception that I just can't hack it. I'm worried that for some reason, I am being set up for failure.

668,"We started talking on reddit when I was in high school and had no friends. I was 17 and it was definitely as romantic as it could be considering it was online. He ended it before I went to college because he thought I was too young and he wanted me to experience life.

I realize how fucked up that was. I was underage, he should have never replied to my message asking for friends. 

We started back up about two years ago and have met in person 3 times now. Two of which I had told nobody where I was going or who I was meeting. The third time I told my parents, said we were just friends and it was the first time meeting. But I stayed with him one night, so obviously they know somethings up. I just avoided questions. I did live with my parents then. I‚Äôve since moved out.

671," I dated a girl in at my college for 3 months. We used to hangout alone by ourselves before we dated for along time and bonded very well so we thought we should give dating a try. The first month of dating was fantastic and well I really liked her. Going on hikes with her and car trips. We had a winter brake and afterwards everything changed. When she came back I rarely saw. In fact it didn't even feel like we were dating. She kept saying she was busy and needed to get work done(which is fair since she's taking 16 credits). But I didn't trust her since her friends and my suite mate(who's friends with her) kept saying how she was hanging out with them or went out, you get the picture. She was not doing work as much as she telling me me she was. So I was sitting in my dorm room wondering after 3 weeks barely seeing her doubting her reasons why she was busy. I began to think maybe she didn't like me anymore. But every time I did see her that seemed to be false. So after a month of college being emotionally tortured she came into my room, sat down on my bed and said""you are not gonna like what Im going to say"". So we talked. She began to say how over winter brake when she saw her ex(with my approval since she kept repeatably saying how she doesnt like him anymore so I thought it would be fine) she realized that her feelings for him still existed. The ex was basically talking to her over brake and well she was now conflicted with the feelings between me and him. So instead of talking me she admitted that she has been purposely not seeing me since she was thinking the situation over for an entire month. She didn't contact the ex during this time and like I said I barely saw her. And so we decided to brake up. I understand her logic, since she was contemplating about her future since well in a semester she's leaving college and after that me and her would not be able to see one another. But honestly the way she dealt with the situation was terrible. All the lies and leading on from her. I mean it didn't even feel like we were dating when we ended it. After this breakup. We took a month off from one another. In the beginning I missed her a ton. But after awhile I began to hate her. Fast forward to now. In a week our month is over and this is where I ask you guys for advice. Should I become friend with this girl again? At the moment I'm frustrated with her, angry and at the same time I still like her. Which all these emotions are not good for being friends with a girl. The reason I want to be friends with her is she is a good person at heart(just sucks at dealing with situations). She also used to be my best friend at college. Not only that but we share a lot of friends so it has been a bit awkward this month. I just seem to be feeling a lot of anger and frustration with the girl for lying and ignoring me all of that time while I was head over feelings for her and wanted to see her all the time. Now I'm not sure if I'm prepared to see her as a friend again. I think Im gonna talk with her and tell her my gripe with the whole situation.",10Mar2019,2
672,"So... I'm a young teenager. I know about things like sex, and sexual activity. What nobody wants to know about is what their parents get up to. However, over the past few months, I've been semi-subjected to knowing, and I'm too awkward to say anything.

Basically, my parents have lube sitting out in their bedroom. They commonly leave the door open, so whenever I walk past, I am forced to see the bottle. It is right at my eye level. They also have some sitting out in the living room, albeit a lot higher up, and unlikely to be noticed easily.

Honestly, this makes me extremely uncomfortable. I don't want this to continue much longer. Could somebody please help me overcome my awkwardness and guide me through the process of how to tell my parents to please either move their sex stuff, or close their damn bedroom door?",10Mar2019,1

I am already halfway done with the book, and I'm pretty confident and proud of what I've done.

However, with all of this hate going around about the anthro/furry community, I've figured this: I want to do a lot of things when I grow up...is this *really* what I want to start off with?

Right now I am actually worried about my reputation if I ever were to publish this book. Everyone will see me as that ""messed up guy"" and call me a furry. (I'm not, by the way) On top of that, the book could probably garner a lot of hate and everyone would want to see me killed.

So my question is...should I go ahead and publish it when I'm done, or should I wait a while until the furry hype dies down (even a little bit)? If I give a little info on this book in the comments, what can I do to my book to make it less ""hated"", so to speak?

683,"I work for a small company (under 50 employees) and have a co-worker who  insists that everything be done her way, and only her way. Normally, we work around her demands, but it has been escalating and I'm at a loss about where to proceed.

Daily, we put the data we generate into an electronic log. Someone from within the company has to sign off on these logs.  When my other co-workers have a question about this log they just ask the person who created the entry, and often the person explains what they meant or corrects a typo and that's the end of the interaction. It takes all of 5 minutes. We all make mistakes, but they're minimal and easily corrected in general.

I put into the log a set of data that she didn't understand. She sent me a 2000+ word e-mail CCing my manager about it, complete with screenshots. I explained the data as best I could to her, as did my manager (who agreed with my conclusions), and I thought the issue was closed. She signed off on the entry. 

Now, three weeks later, during an all team meeting she put my log on the screen to tell everyone everything that was wrong with it and to use it as an example on how not to write a log. My manager and my other coworkers explained to her that what I had done was correct but she didn't let it die and this went on for an hour. It was incredibly uncomfortable for everyone.  When she couldn't get people to agree that my log was incorrect she grabbed all her stuff and left work an hour early. 

I had my monthly meeting with my manager after that. I told him I have severe anxiety and this is making it very difficult for me to do my work, as she's picking apart everything. (It's not just me she's picking apart, it's all of us, to the point that one of my co-workers won't put anything into the log.)  My manager said he'd talk to her, but she's already been told a few times to tone it down, due to other people complaining, and he's pretty new at managing.

What should my next steps should be?  Do I wait and see if she calms down after my manager talks to her? How long do I give it?

693,"I met my best friend last July. Since day one, she‚Äôs been there for me, and she‚Äôs been the reason I wake up with a smile on my face. She‚Äôs like a sister to me and I truly think she‚Äôs the most amazing person in the world. 

I tend to slack off when it comes to getting people presents. She ended up being the only person I bought a Christmas present for, because I genuinely forgot to buy others. I don‚Äôt want to do this for her birthday, and I figured I should start prepping now. 

What are some thoughtful ideas for gifts? I have a few things for her already, but I want to do more. She‚Äôs turned my entire life around and to be truthful, I want to give her as much as I can. 

Money is no object. That‚Äôs not saying I‚Äôm gonna go out and buy her a car, but I‚Äôm open to any suggestions as long as the price is within reason. ",10Mar2019,1
