0,"I have this friend. I wouldn’t say she is one of my best friends because we haven’t known each other very long but she’s my only friend where I live currently and if I wasn’t moving soon then I could definitely see us becoming very close. 

Anyway, I think she is making one of the biggest mistakes of her life and I don’t know what to do about it. 

She is married to a guy that is absolutely horrible. A couple months after we met he ended up cheating on her when he was out of town for business. She was venting to me about it and let me know that he had sent sexual messages to women in the past but to her knowledge, this was his first time physically cheating. Red flag number one. 

Time passes and we don’t hangout for a while because I go to visit my family in another state. We get back together for lunch after I’m in town again. While we’re hanging out she lets me know that she has recently caught him sending sexual messages to other women yet again. Red flag number two. 

At this point I let her know that I think she should seriously consider leaving him. She says she knows that that would be a good idea but they have been together since high school and he is the only man she’s ever been with and he promised her that he would change. Plus, they have a child together. She says that his excuse for cheating is that he isn’t attracted to her physically anymore after she’s given birth to his child. Red flag number three. 

Everything was going ok for them for a while and then fast forward to these past couple days and she has found out that he physically cheated on her with 5 different women since they got married 2 years ago. One of which was in their house, IN THEIR BED, one was their neighbor, and the other one is his best friend’s girlfriend whom my friend has hung out with several times. Red flags number four, five, six, seven, and eight. 

Today she told me that while they were arguing last night he went into the bathroom and sent dick pics to one of her friends (whom he didn’t know was her friend) right after they had “made up” and he promised to do better. Red flag number nine. 

Oh, and she also said that he hit her in the face last night while they were arguing. She swears that this is the first time he has ever gotten physical with her but I reminded her that there always has to be a first time in physically abusive relationships but that usually doesn’t mean it’ll be the only time. Red flag number ten. 

How can she stay with him after this many red flags?! I told her how I felt about it and that she needs to leave him asap. She says she knows what she needs to do logically but her heart is telling her not to give up on him. I can see where she’s coming from because I’m married and have children as well so I know its got to be hard to give all of that up. I keep trying to remind myself that she is very young, only 19, and this situation would be hard for anyone to endure, much less someone who’s technically still in their teens. I’m just getting so frustrated because I know she deserves better than this. 

I had another friend who went through a similar situation of domestic violence and I finally convinced her to leave but it took over a year. If I do anything, what should I do? Has anyone dealt with this? How can I help her? ",08Feb2019,1

I've known this person for a long time over Xbox but we talk through text as well. When I first met him he was a little ""off"" I didn't think much of it as not much bothers me and I didn't have many friends at the time, but recently he has gotten more aggressive to the point that I'm the target of he's having a bad day. So basically he's not a nice person, and I think if I didn't talk to him my life would be better. What I need help with is HOW to remove him. He is a bit of a stalker so he added all my friends on just about all social media. I've tried just removing him but he always comes back later saying ""sorry for before"" and since I'm a forgiving person and don't have many friends anyway I've let him back in before. I need a FINAL way to get him out of my life for good. Someway that he won't contact me later and I won't let him back in. ",08Feb2019,1

So I'm 14 years old, and I know this might sound cliche or even stupid. But I don't know how to make friends. The idea of meeting people makes me feel scared. 

There's this girl that came from another school and we became friends easily. She's awesome and it's the kind of person I wanted to be friend of since years. She invited me to her birthday party and I met her group of friends.

They were awesome. As I said, they were the type of people I wanted to meet since years. They are so easygoing and funny and I want to be like that. But in the party I just got stuck in a chair and didn't talk to no one of them. I just kinda was there. They started playing Truth or Dare and asked me to play and I just froze and didn't answer. Since the party I've been anxious because I don't know if they liked me o don't want to see me again. I want to be more extrovertive and learn how to be their friend but I don't know where to start.

9,"So my mom is taking something called DigestaCure that she claims is fixing her health problems which includes stomach pains, asthma, and probably some other things. I believe this has been going on for more than a year and I think it's above $200 per month she's spending which isn't terribly bad, but I fear that she'll be taking it for the rest of her life and I have serious doubts that it's doing anything. I've confronted her about it several times, but she guilt trips me, telling me she would be in terrible pain or kill herself if she stopped taking it. She has conversations over the phone regularly with the people who sell the stuff for support and it seems there is a Jesus-type figure that she thinks will cure her illnesses. My mom feels a disdain for real doctors and real medicine, claiming it's all a racket and that they don't really want to cure you. She has had many doctors visits and tried many medications, but she claims she has developed an allergy to a vast number of them.

I believe her condition has improved, but I'm concerned it's due to a placebo effect and/or other improvements she has made in her life such as diet and exercise. I'm concerned she's getting scammed and will for the rest of her life in a never-ending suck cost fallacy, chasing the belief that enough of it will eventually cure her.

However the company I interviewed with takes forever to process applications. After the interview for the second position they told me I would hear back in a month; I forgot to ask the first interviewers about the timing though, so I have to assume the same timetable.

Instead the coworker brings the child TO WORK. The child wasn’t in just one area, they were running around and even put their hands on my desk. We have elderly people, pregnant women (MYSELF INCLUDED), and people that otherwise may be at risk of getting sick that just don’t want/deserve to be.

Do I have a right to speak up about not necessarily being comfortable about this situation? I don’t want to start an anti-vax debate.

As long as I can remember I’ve regretted losing the genetic coin flip.

I will never be a comedian. I will never be president. I will never achieve any athletic feat worth setting goals for. No one will ever respect me and everyone will automatically think less of me in any position life could possibly offer me.

Everywhere I turn I’m bombarded with sexist jokes and comments. Women have been oppressed for centuries and it’s still happening because we have always been viewed as lesser beings. Even if you think you don’t believe it; on some level you probably agree that we are.

I don’t necessarily disagree either. Some days I want to scream my way into a male body, one that isn’t constantly belittled and one with potential.

24,"I've been living in this studio-type house for four years now. Here are some problems that have occured within the third year: the tiles have risen up(thanks to the compression of the floor during hot weather), making the ground I walk on uneven in my room. I've had some joint problems in the past months(not sure if this has anything to do with the uneven level of the tiles). 

The bathroom switch for the ventilation and lights are broken, and I now only use my phone's light whenever I go in. I just open the bathroom door and my bedroom windows to get air out whenever it gets smelly in there. 

A part of the kitchen tile has fallen off, but it doesn't impair kitchen chores. Water gets in during rainy season, and floods the edge of my room, not really affecting any appliance. But it does soak some of my things. Lastly, black/red ants invade my room, depending on the season. The red ones only dominate a few spots of my room, but the black ones are everywhere, even if they don't bite, it's pretty annoying. 

I've told my landlady about these, and yet no action has been taken after almost a year. These problems aren't too serious, and I can still live with them, but I want to save more money, so I'm looking to reduce the room rent.

I didn't get paid or anything. I love to teach.  However, I'm worried that since they were my solutions (on a relatively simple project but still) it might get construed as academic  dishonesty. I know that I'm probably nervous for no good reason, but I had to tell her a lot of the things to do because she didn't have the same familiarity with concepts from the class or Java that I did. I never coded anything for her but at times I had to dictate how to do certain things. My code for the project is way more complex so I don't think it'll look like I cheated off of her, but still.

28,"TL;DR: Poor mental health made me unable to work. I was a leader and I didn't tell my team I was unable to function as one. Instead let my dysfunction drag down the team's chances at the competition. What do I do? 

I am a student at a 4 year university in the US. Near the end of last semester, I was given the chance to be a leader of a team. I asked around for interested people and put together a team.

I was traveling over winter break when my mental health spiraled. In the first two weeks, I was extremely suicidal and it translated into actions. I'm better now though and I'm getting help.

During this period, I didn't call any meetings.

I began calling meetings in the following week. I was unable to do any work because of the pressure of academics (incomplete work, and I'm taking 18 credits in a 126 hour degree).

Recovery is taking longer than expected. I stopped calling meetings and wasn't able to follow up on my teammates work. We've had about 5 meetings. I always thought I would begin to feel good enough or finish enough work to make the mental space for the team soon enough. 

So here we are, near the end of the competition's preparatory period. We haven't had a meeting with all the team members participatinbg yet. We haven't written a single line of code. Some of the basic administrative stuff isn't done yet 

I don't blame myself for my poor mental health or how long recovery is taking. However, I know it's my fault that I didn't tell people I couldn't lead the team and encourage them to go on without me. I understand that I've brought the team down by remaining a leader and not asking for help when I was ineffective. I have wasted other people's time. I don't have any qualms in accepting that I'm the asshole here.

I do believe that my teammates have a right to know that I cannot continue as a leader, or maybe even as a teammate. However, I don't want to be the person who bails when things get tough when it was my fault. I wanted to know what your opinion on what I should do next was.",08Feb2019,1

33,"This is my first time posting, so I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post it, but I am not sure what to do.

First off, I am a soldier stationed pretty much on the opposite side of the US in relation to my hometown. My mother has been in a steady financial decline since I left home, for reasons I just can't comprehend. It had gotten to the point that she was forced to move back in with her parents at the age of 40. She had no car and no home of her own. Things that she had just a couple of years ago.

I've tried my best to help her where I can, sending a bit of money home where I can, visiting when I can, and trying to stay in contact. There wasn't much I could do beyond that though, since I was pretty much just starting out with my career, and we don't exactly get paid the best.

When I got orders to be sent overseas for a year, I decided that I would let my mother use my car in my absence. I still paid the loan and insurance on it. All she had to do was keep it fueled and do routine maintenance. The situation was perfect. I didn't have to have the car sit idle for a year, and my mother would have a reliable means of transportation back and forth to work since at the time, her parents weren't adamant about her using their vehicles. I made sure that she understood that I was not giving the her the car, and that she would need to work on getting her own money together to get her own car for when I would eventually need to get the car back. 

While I was overseas, I checked on her progress periodically, and no advancements were made. She couldn't keep down a job, and constantly was at odds with her parents for them being ""controlling."" It culminated into her being kicked out on at least two occasions, with this last one being the final straw, my grandparents won't take her back anymore. They have said that she hasn't been doing anything around the house, has let people practically live there with her, let strangers in at all hours of the night, and has possibly been stealing their mentally handicapped foster child's medication, among other items.

When I came back to the states, I was having some financial issues of my own trying to save money to get my car shipped to me, which allowed my mother to keep the car for just a few more months. She knew that once I did get the money together, I would be wanting to get it back. When I last spoke to her on Christmas, I told her that I would soon have the means to ship it by this month. She was living with my grandparents still at this time.

I called her on Tuesday, the 5th, to let her know that I would be having it shipped in the next couple of weeks and that I needed her to prepare for that by getting her stuff out, only for her to tell me that she had been kicked out, and was now apparently living out of my car with her dog.

I had to take a minute to collect myself. What was I supposed to do now? According to her, my grandmother's controlling tendencies had driven her to lash out, resulting in a big fight that ended with her eviction.

I called my grandmother to confirm the story, and she informed me of how unruly my mother had been when living with them, and how needy yet ungrateful she had been the entire time she'd lived there. They also are suspicious of whether or not she is truly ""living"" out of my car. My grandfather has remained in contact with her, and has seen her with other people in the car, and sees no signs of her going without a shower, or not eating. Even the dog seemed fed according to him, and there were times he had seen her and the dog was nowhere to be found.

I don't know what to do. I know I have every legal right to get my car back, since I signed  nothing over to her, and its in my name. But morally I question it. What if she really is homeless and me taking the car really does put her on the streets? She says she has a job now, and that me taking the car would make her have to quit since its house cleaning. She can't stay st a shelter cause they don't allow animals, and even if they did. She would only be allowed to sleep there.

I can't afford to pay for another car, and neither could she afford to pay for it if I signed it over to her. I'm currently stuck on post and having to rely on other people to take me to work. If things go as planned, I'm supposed to be promoted to a leadership position soon, and I can't very well lead someone when I have to rely on someone just to go to the store. 

To top it off, my mother has understandably been very angry with me for ""being selfish"" and ""wanting to do this to her"" and ""abandoning her."" But I dont know what to do. She had it for 14 months rent free and seemingly understood that I would need it back. It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid that if I try to take it, she will refuse and I'll have to get the law involved, and that even if I do, I'd only be condemning her to living on the streets.

I can't help her financially aside from sending money to her for food and necessities. If I could, I'd buy her another car and get her a place to stay, but I can't even do that for myself. I'd take care of her if I could, but I dont have the means to do it. Am I suppose to let her keep it for another year and be without my own means? Is it selfish of me to tell her that I've given all the time I can? What do I do?",08Feb2019,1
34,"People seem to like me, they generally seem to want to be around me and take me along to activities. I know some of my friends looks at me as one of their closest, while I never let them in so far they can hurt my feelings. Some probably notice, some definitly does not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fear allowing someone so close to me that I care about what they say about me, and thus get emotionally vunerable. I want to trust my (new) friends, I want to be emotionally vunerable. I am strong enough now to get hurt, but it seems my mind disagrees. Whenever I get too close with someone I get cold, and then I get warm again as soon as my fear of getting too close fades. I can't imagine how confusing this can be for my peers. I can see them trying to get close to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Supressing the trauma has kept my mind occupied to such a degree I've never felt lonely, despite never talking to a living soul about what I feel like. A scared, vunerable, pathetic, stupid, weakminded, weakhearted, unlovable, depressive, anxious, little kid that never could move on from some stupid words that were said a decade ago by some kids that didn't even know they were hurting me badly. Ofcourse I put on a act that portray the opposit of every trait I just mentioned. And I seem to do a great acting job, because noone treats me as any of the previous mentioned traits. It does not change the way I feel though. But I have decided that my time for supressing emotions are past, and are now for the first time since being bullied experiencing crying because of sadness. And I feel I will encounter lonelyness next.

&amp;#x200B;

I am tremendeously ashamed over being bullied, I really don't want anyone in my life to know (,irl). Probably because it would shatter the act that I have portrayed since the bullying started, and I don't know how I socialize without my strong act. If I told my family they all would have to get to know me all over again.

35,"So quick summary. I've been watching my two friends' cat while they're out of state on vacation.

Well yesterday I found piles of feces in their bedroom and stuck to her butt. Obviously I gave her a bath and cleaned it off, and cleaned up the mess, and closed their bedroom door as to not allow her to do it again.

When I was drying her off, halfway through she ran off, apparently into her litter box. She now has small clumps of litter stuck to her paws. I found this out today, mainly because she's been running from me since the bath. I tried to remove the clumps but she went into attack mode and wouldn't let me.

Now here's the question, should I let my friends know because they need to know if something is wrong, or do I let them enjoy their vacation to visit family? They are returning home in three days.",08Feb2019,1

41,"Hello everyone, thanks for reading and hopefully someone has some good advice!

Back Story:

I was working for a company in California and was unhappy with the constant burden of the state (high income taxes, high cost of living, generally unpleasant people) and started looking for work elsewhere. I had reached out to a previous manager of mine who had moved out of state and he informed me that the company he was at was hiring and was located in Tennessee. I submitted my resume and was almost immediately replied to with ""when can you come out to interview?"". I flew out in June 2018, was put up in a hotel, and even given $100 cash to spend while visiting and all was on the new company's dime. I loved (and still do) the company, loved the growth potential, and definitely loved the area. I've been working here since the end of  July 2018 and have loved it since. They also offered me a good amount of money for relocation and paid for a 3-month lease at an apartment while I looked for a new house for my wife and I. As with any other company, after a few months I started hearing about all the rumors and everyones story with the company. One of the rumors I had heard was about a previous employee, we'll call him Tim, who had left after working here for a few years and started his own company. I had heard that there was bad blood between our company owner and Tim, but that was about the extent. The guys I worked with had developed personal relationships with Tim while he worked here and some had maintained these relationships outside of work. During my initial 90 days, I was riding along with some other employees and we would occasionally go to lunch while at work together. For two of these lunches we met up with Tim at a local restaurant and whoever I was with would chat with Tim while I sat quietly (abnormal for me, but I didn't know the guy so I wasn't really involved with the conversation) about family stuff, his other business (real estate), and random other things but he never asked us about our work and I never heard anything mentioned about what we were doing. It was strictly personal conversation. I didn't think anything of it until today. 

I was walking through the office to go meet a coworker on the other side of our facility and was stopped by the company owner. He asks me to join him in his office and proceeds to grill me about Tim. Asking me how I know him, how ""close"" I was with him, what I've talked about with him, and why I wanted to talk to him. I tell the owner that I met him with other coworkers and I was specific that it was only twice, that although I never really spoke to him I was friendly because everything I heard was rumor as it had all transpired before I came to the company and I was unaware of the gravity of the situation. He proceeds to lecture me on how he's the enemy because our company had trained him from a zero-knowledge, zero-background field and when he left he took our customers thereby hurting our bottom line. I apologized and stated I had no bad intention and stated again that I was unaware of the situation because of the timeline. He tells me he's concerned about my invitation to him for a social media page for our field and how he is worried that he may be able to take more of our customers because he can see where we're working and bid against us or go in and try to take the customer altogether. He calms down after my explaining of my ignorance of the situation and calmly asks me to be very careful who I'm friends with because it will hurt the company and inevitably hurt my paycheck (not in a threatening manner, just that we would have less work to do and I might lose some overtime).

With everything that happened and how accommodating this new company has been, I feel like I've unintentionally betrayed the owner. All of this happened this morning and I haven't been able to shake the feeling all day, like that pit you get in your stomach when you're on a roller coaster. I want to show him I'm dedicated to our company and explain that I am not the type of person to do something like that intentionally. I'm a very honest and loyal person and would never do something like this, especially to someone who has helped me tremendously. What can I do?",08Feb2019,1
42,"This has been worrying me for a while now and I feel like I could really use some advice from people who don’t personally know me. If I’m posting wrong or something, let me know and I’ll delete, please don’t ban me mods 

I’m in the UK. I finished sixth form (college) June 2018 with A*BB a levels. I applied for university and got accepted into Brighton to study Media, but decided to take a year out with the intention of going to Canada for just over six months. 

However, there’s been a lot of complications with my application for a work visa. The goal was to be out there late December, mid January latest. Now, I can’t picture me going before April because of delays. With the fact I’m meant to start university in September, I feel like I’ve wasted so much of the gap year and that I may as well have just booked a holiday for a couple weeks instead with how short of a time I’m currently looking at being out there. 

I’m not sure How id do it (call up the uni and ask if I can delay my place again? Not sure if I’d have to go through the whole ucas application again or not) but I’m considering delaying university til September 2020 start so I can properly go away and enjoy my time in Canada as I had intended to, rather than stressing and worrying and being out there for five minutes. 

However, I’ve always been a highly academic student. The thought of starting university at 20... I feel stupid. Like I’m behind. A couple friends started uni this academic year (sept 2018), and all the rest of my friends will start next academic year (sept 2019). I feel so behind. Like in 2020 I should theoretically be nearing the end of my course had I started now, not beginning it. It makes me feel lazy and I know my family will worry I’ll not go at all. I really want to go to uni still, but I want to enjoy my life. But 20 feels too old to go. I’ll be 23 by the time I’ve done my BA! 

Should I delay my uni start again, or should I just start September 2019 as I’m meant to? 

TL;DR- I’m due to start uni sept 2019 after already taking a gap year, but my year out honestly hasn’t felt enough and I’m considering delaying my start by another year, but feel like a failure if I don’t start uni til I’m 20. Help ",08Feb2019,1
43,"Okay, we just started talking a week ago. She's graduating medical school and I am about to enter medical school. We just started snapchatting each other every day a couple days ago, and she's always snapping me stuff about her clinical rotations. Usually, I don't mind it and am kinda ""meh"" about the whole thing. But today, I don't know what came over me, but I just got really annoyed by it. We're long distance so she didn't really see my reaction, and she has a test on Friday, so I didn't want to bother her with my qualms.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a theory about why acted that way. Here's the context. I'm going to be taking the MCAT soon and I work as a medical scribe and am starting to fill out medical school applications. All three of these things are extremely stressful. Maybe I'm just projecting my frustration onto her? Another thing is I just asked the doctor I work for for a letter of recommendation last week and this week, he seems to be trying to pile up more work for me to do (I'm now ordering and pending prescriptions for his nurse practitioner's patients along with his patients and am now booking surgical cases for him starting next week. Both of which I was never trained to do before). He's probably the nicest doctor you'll ever meet, but I can't help but think that he's either doing this to be an asshole and ""teach me about how hard medicine is"" or he's helping me ""get exposure"" in his mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I dunno. I love medicine as much as the next guy. But do we really have be snapping about it so much? I would rather have work stay where work is supposed to stay. Every snap she sends is of her in the clinic. Am I being the asshole? Should I talk to her about it? Is this a deal breaker? I don't want to seem like an unambitious lazy head. But at the same time, this could get annoying if it persists.

52,"Hi Reddit! This is my first post and something that has been weighing heavily on my mind. 

A little bit about me: I am a 24-year old female currently enrolled in an extremely demanding graduate school program. My program is relatively close to my parents' home, which is where I am currently living. I lived away from home during college, but have never lived independently in a permanent way. I am the first in my family to graduate college.

The older I've gotten, the more I have realized the dysfunctional communication style that exists within my family. We get along fine, but relatively superficially. We don't talk about interpersonal feelings or conflicts much at all, and if we do, there is awkwardness. My parents are both relatively introverted and do not have a lot of friends or hobbies, outside of working (I believe this is part of the problem). Since starting school, I have noticed and/or sensed a growing tension between us.  I often stay late at school to study and on the weekends, I spend time out there with friends. I have a significant social life in addition to my busy schools schedule. Although my parents won't come out and say it, I can TELL they want me to be at home more and are sad when I'm not. They are bothered when I am not around for dinner, which I am frequently not. I feel somewhat pressured to spend at least one night of my weekend with them going out to dinner. I feel that I am most of their social life and it has begun to feel burdensome. I feel irritated when they ask me what time I'm going to be home, what I'm doing, etc. I have an increasingly strong desire to be independent and living on my own but that is not financially feasible. They do a TON for me and are very loving in that way, and I am extremely appreciative of that, so I try to keep my frustrations in perspective. My main issue is that I feel that they are having an extremely difficult time letting go of me and my brother (who is slightly younger than me, living on his own) and viewing us adults. 

If I haven't seen them in a 2 days or so due to our schedules, they will often act very distant and almost passive-aggressive. They won't make an extra effort to talk to me. I will walk into the room and they will barely if at all acknowledge me. I will try to converse but receive very little back from them. This is SO FRUSTRATING because I feel that they are lashing out at me for living my life, which I should not be made to feel as a 20-something ADULT. 

The way they've been acting has made me feel extremely guilty and I hate that. I recognize that this is something that all parents must go through, but I feel that this has been more of a problem for me than it was even when I was away at college. The solution I've settled on is just continuing to go about my life and letting them work through that process. But it is extremely frustrating and has made me start to resent them. On top of this, we don't have a ton in common, ESPECIALLY politically. My dad's politics are repulsive to me and we just don't talk about it. This has also made feel distant from him. 

I love my parents and I want them to be happy. But I also have an intense yearning for independence and living my life how I would without the burden of feeling like I'm upsetting my parents. Once I graduate in 1.5 years, I will be fully financially independent and living on own. That is not very far off, but I still struggle with the guilt and the way they seem to be affected by me leading a relatively independent life. 

Any thoughts or advice? Thank you SO much if you took the time to read all this.

TLDR; Currently in graduate school but living at home, parents having trouble letting go and are ""sad"" (this may not be the best word... bothered perhaps) when I'm not around-- have started acting somewhat passively aggressively towards me and as a result I've been feeling unfairly guilt-ridden and burdened.

Now the problem comes in that the first week of the month is hard on my mom because of the rent and car insurance immediately comes out. And because of it my mom tends to ask to borrow money from me to make sure she has gas in her car until she gets paid. 
(Her car takes a more expensive gas I can't remember what it is)

And she always puts it back when she gets paid. Because we have the trust between us. And she did it again this money and I don't know why I got so upset over it. I just snapped.

Mom: Can I borrow 50 dollars?

Me: Again?
Fine I don't care.

I then asked for him to please pay me for all of the postings I had done up until that point that I hadn't been paid for yet, which totalled $100.

I eventually figured out who it was and made a point of taking his food out and putting mine in and I think he realized what I was getting at and gave me a passive aggressive reply like ""what are we 10 years old now? Calm down bro"" and he took his stuff and walked away. 

It stopped for a little bit but started happening again to other people. I suspect it's the same person again. Like I said, I work at a big company so I don't know where the guy works. I've never been much of an HR person anyway and I'd hate to report over this. But it's really annoying.

68,"Hi. I’ve been playing piano for about 3 years. Recently, I’ve been messing up at concerts. My hands twitch when I play in front of people, and I always forget where I was. Does anyone have any tips/advice for me?",08Feb2019,1
69,"Right, so the title is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever written but I need advice. So my ex broke up with me two weeks ago and it has been the hardest time of my life. We just spoke pleasantly for the first time in two weeks and it was great but on the call, she told me that I raped her several times.

I started freaking out. When had I done it? How could I have done it? Why didn't she tell me before? I felt crippling anxiety come over me with panic and fear that I could have done this to someone. I also felt a bit betrayed, that I had been living a lie for the past few months (this is how long she said it had been going on for) as she hadn't mentioned it to me previously. 

I discussed it with her and she told me that it's fine and that she didn't see it as rape until after the fact. She had told me that because of how I initiated it, normally with my fingers or by kissing her that it wasn't always wanted and was sometimes rape. However, before now, I had asked her how she wanted me to initiate it and she had told me exactly that, not to ask for it because it felt planned. 

During sex, she would never tell me no or that she didn't want it and would welcomingly reciprocate the act and tell me that she enjoyed it. Now she is telling me that sometimes it was rape. As said, I am freaking out despite her telling me that she would never dream of pressing charges against me for it but told me that if I'm with anyone else then to make sure every step of the way.

TL;DR: thought I had been having consensual sex with my girlfriend for two and a half years, she doesn't see it that way but tells me it's okay.",08Feb2019,1
70,"I posted about this on offmychest, however, this time I am asking for advice. So I am female, and I’m a senior in high school. I have a boyfriend who is also a senior. My problem is: I’m pretty positive I’m gay and I’m freaking out. 

I have dated one girl in the past and it went better than the boys I’ve dated, even though she and I never did anything intimate besides cuddle. I think I have been lying to myself for a long time. I don’t want to be with my boyfriend anymore but there are so many reasons why I can’t just break up with him. For instance, and I’m not exaggerating when I say this, literally all of my friends have a significant other. They’re always with their s/o and they always chose them over a friend, which I get. But that means I won’t have anyone to hang out with and I need my friends to survive, I don’t deal with being lonely very well. I also will probably never talk to his friends, which are also my friends and all of my best friends boyfriends, (yes we are one giant group of friends). I will literally lose my lifelines. (Okay maybe I’m being a little dramatic but I don’t really care)

I was thinking about waiting until I graduate and then breaking it off. But I don’t know if I can keep lying anymore. I made a fake account on twitter with a fake name to make friends elsewhere because I have no one to talk to about this and it’s eating me alive. What am I going to do??? What should I do?

Friends.
When they’re hers:

A. Somehow, I got food/makeup/etc all over her belonging that I haven’t touched all day if I’ve ever touched it at all

B.Im a bitch (ex, she said I’m a c*nt to our entire family and her friends behind my back because she didn’t like my tone of voice when I woke out of my nap to tell her where her important papers were and pointed to the light switch [which she said was the door in her version of the story] I cried in public when I realized she was being serious and she had the audacity to point out the fact I was crying and ask why)

C. I stink 

Boyfriends/crushes
A. She’ll always wait until I’m around a guy to say I again, got something all over her belongings 

B. I stink, my hair/makeup is messed up 

Whenever we get into an argument I’m never right and when I am she’ll wait until weeks later when I barely remember them bring it back up and switch it around so that I’m wrong and she’s right then tell everyone 

She lies about everything important or not. 

She has a smell to her which makes me believe a lot of this is projection (she literally smells like toilet when she opens her mouth ): and her body odor alone isn’t too good. I know she cleans and uses spray but I don’t thing often or thoroughly enough) and no matter how many times she tells me I smell I wouldn’t tell her she literally stinks ): I tried to bring it up before and she looked completely distraught, 

She doesn’t clean up after herself and on the occasion that she does do something she’ll get upset for not getting credit even when it’s been days after she completed said chore

Family

They know how she is because she’s... family most of the time they’re reluctant to believe her stories but she still exaggerates things I’ve done or said to her to get me in trouble. Her family’s even warned her to not say something about a coworker (a story she exaggerated) she said it anyways and got said coworker fired and complained to me about it for weeks.

She’s very soft and sensitive but what she’s doing is really mean and it’s becoming harmful. My self esteem was poor for a while but I understand it’s not me now (I think??) ",08Feb2019,1

75,"Hey Reddit 
I've been unemployed for the past 4 months struggling for cash and now I have an opportunity at two different workplaces 

The first is an hour and 15 minutes travel one way and pays $34 an hour however it's only casual work it will be full time Monday to Friday but I don't get any benefits like sick leave annual leave etc or overtime rates which they have specified there will be likely alot of overtime 
This means this job will likely leave me with 12 hour days and I also have a baby on the way so I will be fairly sleep deprived but the money is quite good 

The alternative is a local ISP I have a friend who works there and he loves it, their pay is somewhere between 20-25 an hour but you will be part time which means I will get a hell of a lot more benefits than if I was full time or casual I will also be working full time hours in this role and the drive is less than 15 minutes away I will be working a rotating roster of nights days and weekends which is ideal for me 

My problem with jobs in the past is getting along with co workers I'm very anti-social but have met some of the people at the local ISP and they seem to be pretty nice people I believe that this role would be best suited for me but it's hard to choose if I should turn down the extra $400-$500 a week as me and my partner have alot of debt to worry about paying off and this would certainly make our life easier ",08Feb2019,1

82,"I am a film student. At our film school there are two majors, production and animation. I am currently an animation student, but i am thinking about switching to production. A choice which must be made by summer semester. I have some time but it is a difficult choice. Here is the reason why: as a production major you make 5 movies, all live action. You have your F1 (film 1), Documentary, F2, F3, and thesis. As an animation major you also make 5 movies, an F1, Documentary, F2, F3, and thesis. The similarities between the two majors are that the first three movies, F1, F2, and Doc, are all live action. But if you are animation, the last two have to be animated. Although I have a great passion for animation, I found I quite like production, and want to make a live-action F3 and Thesis. The problem is, due to me being in animation, I can’t. So here is where the pressure comes in. I specialize in 2D animation, and the animations I have made so far in the school have been acclaimed by the faculty and my peers. But when I mention that I would like to try my hand more at production, by switching majors, they are shocked and call it a poor decision. So far we have made the F1, and mine was not great. It had its issues, which I am happy to admit as I was new to the process of live action filmmaking and was really testing ideas to see if they’d work or not. I do feel if I have grown since then as a live-action filmmaker, but still people push me to stay in animation. My parents stand with me on any decision I make, but the teachers state that I have so much better chance at a successful career if I stay in animation. I honestly at this point just want to prove that I can do live action just as well as animation, but still I am fearful that I could be jeopardizing a bright future as an animator. A job which, isn’t necessarily exactly a bad thought to me. But the idea of working with actors on sets, filming live action movies excites me too. What advice do you have for me?

I’m a 14 year old white kid in 8th grade. I have great, supportive parents and grew up middle class. Im fairly popular at school and haven’t really had any problems socially for a while now.

School was always pretty easy. Until 7th grade I got mostly A’s and some B’s without really any effort but in 7th grade my grades slowly started to get worse but I still managed AB honor roll on my report card and 5s on all of my EOGs. I’m in all advanced classes but 8th grade is going awful. I’m at a new school and although I’m doing great socially but I’m I’m failing lots of classes. I’m getting mostly Cs in classes and on tests and I believe this is my fault, not the work being harder or the assignments being heavier.

  Some habits-
•I get distracted SO SO SO easily
•I always forget about assignments
  and when I remember I’ll be like
 “It’s too late now what’s the point”
•I put my social life, and pretty much  
  whatever I feel like doing before
  my school work
•I’m always judging other people
•I can’t sit down and do work for
  more that 10 minutes without 
  getting anxious, so I’ll just sit in
  front of my work and not do it
•It’s difficult for me to focus on class
  and take in the info but I also tend
  To miss a lot of info while taking
  notes, that will dress me out so I’ll
  stop
•I eat awful, never get exercise, and 
  go to bed late (I am skinny, and am
  faster and stronger than many a
  Pretty decent amount of kiddo though)

I can go on and on about my bad habits but really, I need help. I try to get better but everything I try doesn’t work. Agendas feel like another assignment, the only time I work good is late at night and at that point my parents are saying to stop working and get some sleep.

Basically, leading up to this, he had told his mom that he was moving like, a week ago. She didn't believe him because the rent was ""too cheap"" (he was moving into my mom's basement, she was just being generous). She doesn't know that we are in a relationship because his mom is known to be somewhat homophobic (saying that he isn't gay and that's just what society wants him to be). My family knows and is very cool with it, but I digress. A few days after telling her, he tells her that the ticket is purchased and when the date is. Now realizing the move is actually real, she goes kinda apeshit. She is throwing things at him, and yelling at him.  


Today, she made him refund the ticket. She wanted him to do it on his phone in front of her. She didn't say what would happen but considering how she has responded to this already I bet he was just scared and did it. It's being reviewed currently and he left in the notes to not refund it because he is being forced to, though I have no clue if that holds any caliber.

I'm just not sure what to do next. It's hard to plan around his mother because a lot of what she says are just scare tactics. She threatened to kick him out at times and every single time it didn't happen. When she threatened to make him live with his dad on a farm in Alabama that never happened either. She makes things tough to deal with.  


What I do know is that he needs to get out of there. Hopefully, he has some friends around town that he can stay with for a bit. Also, I'm gonna see if he is okay with taking some of the meaningful things he has in his room and put them in a storage unit, making sure she can't have access to it. He already has his own bank account, so I'm hoping he is willing to try and stay independent from her. Maybe he can venmo me the money and I can pay for his ticket or something, and then he can dip without her knowing. I'm not sure.  


My question is mainly just what else can he do? Legally I'm not sure if there is much leverage since he is an adult, and I don't think she has \*technically\* done anything wrong. Any and all advice on this situation is welcome.

A female co-worker of ours figured out what was going on between us with her intuition several months ago and on multiple occasions has confronted each of us about the relationship.  He wants to keep it a secret and has still only told one person in his life while I have told family and friends.

Anyway, a couple months ago I finally broke down and confirmed her suspicions.  I trust her or I wouldn't have done it.  She knew I had moved out from my family and saw me in an apartment complex and never said a word to me or anyone else.  She could have and earn s my trust in doing so.

So he suspected that I told her and I lied to him and said no on several occasions.  The last time he asked me in person and I lied and then called him a little later and admitted it to him.  He is absolutely furious, saying I'm a liar and betrayed him and he doesn't think he can ever trust me again.  I'm heartbroken and severely depressed over it.

She also was afraid that she'd lose me ""to a relationship like she's lost, other guys"". I respected that, but was still a bit bummed so I kind of stepped back. I sent her a text letting her know I respected her feelings, she then responded stating that she felt bad for saying it and was still wanting me to be around. Then no more messages. 

&amp;#x200B;

After about 2 weeks, She just sent me a message a few days ago elaborating on what she meant. Saying that she didn't want me to think that she'd never date me, and that if some ""personal"" stuff wasn't happening that she probably would have. I had no clue how to respond tbh. I haven't yet but don't know what to tell her. 

I'm not comfortable hanging out any longer, because I cannot turn my feelings off just on a snap. I stepped back because I thought it was the right thing for me and respectful towards her decline. But now that she's contacted me again, I'm not sure whether to remain silent and let the last message I sent her to be the final one, or reply, but risk hurting her by doing the very thing she didn't want (namely, ' losing me')

99,"I’m studying to be a nurse but every time I have to go to the hospital I feel sick. Tomorrow I have my clinical at 7am and I already have a headache. I can’t tell if it’s me over stressing (I’m a very anxious person) or if I just genuinely hate the idea of doing this for the rest of my life. I want to do something fun and creative but so does everyone else and their mother.

I have nothing in life that interests me. I chose nursing because it’s the most practical and safe option. I figured I’d make myself like it because this is the only future I can secure for myself. I’m already 22 and I wasted an entire year of my life not studying or working because I was depressed. I did nothing. I just slept and cried and felt tired all the time. Even when I would try to put in effort I’d feel too weak to continue and stop halfway every day. But I’d always think the next day would be better. It didn’t.

I had to go back to school in 2018 because fuck if I didn’t I never would’ve. I don’t know if it was the right choice. I need a little over a year left in my degree to finish. But...

Everything makes me fucking sad and anxious. Any slight change in a routine or something makes me nervous. My 2 friends used to call me nearly every day and just because they got busy these past few weeks I start to feel nervous like our friendship is falling apart.

I don’t think I’d even be able to handle nursing because of how bad I am under stress. I hate the person I am. I’m so easily stressed and agitated and I never feel genuine happiness. Any minor inconvenience gets me all sad. I always get headaches and I don’t even know what I like to study as a career.

It’s too late to change I’m already 22 and this deep in my career idk what the fuck else I’ll do.

What am I? Is this me being emotionally unstable? Is it me having low self esteem? Is it me being incapable at handling life?

The only thing I like about myself is that all this suffering I’ve put myself through to this point has made me empathetic and kind. I wasn’t like this before. But it’s not enough to thrive in life. I want to be free to do what I want. But I can’t. I’ve tied my own hands down. Limited my possibilities.

Every day the only things I look forward to are talking to my friends and doing my skin care routine. Nothing else.

I feel so confined not only in my head but my own house. It’s so small with too many people. It’s suffocating. 

I see my nephew and I think of how I’d wish I could be a child again. How I could start over and do things differently. How happy I was as a child. So innocent and free of worry and stress and anxiousness and depression and fear and emptiness.

I want to do things differently but don’t know how or what.",08Feb2019,1
100,"I'm a senior accounting major who is supposed to graduate this spring but so far I have barely studied and skipped some classes. I currently hate my life, I have close to no friends besides one from high school who mocks me when we hang out, and I spend all of my time alone. Even when I'm in class, the only time I would be socializing I just sit there and don't talk to anyone. My actions have gotten stranger and more erratic starting this fall semester, I would make rude jokes to the professor and avoid doing any work. I think these are just a cry for help because I crave attention. 

I'm mainly in a rut because I hate my face and height, and feel like people in general, not just women disrespect me for it. I hate my small close set eyes and huge forehead, as well as my short height (5'7). I was made fun of in high school for these more than a few times. In most of my classes everyone is so much better looking than me and it makes me feel like I'm an outcast for it. When it comes to women, they all seem to not want to do anything with me, and I can sense it. I would off myself but I'm also afraid of dying, but I just want a goddamn escape. My viewpoint of the world has gotten uglier and uglier as I've aged.",08Feb2019,1
101,"Today I invited my friend over to watch movies and whatnot, as we've both graduated and were bored out of our minds. He also happens to be one of my boyfriend's closest friends, and the three of us have been close for a couple years. He also has a lovely girlfriend, who I have met on a couple occasions.

Anyways, the visit started out with us just talking normally and stuff like that but then he kept trying to touch me. He'd poke me and at one point, whether he realised it or not, he touched my boob. I told him to stop it and said it wasn't a good thing to do because we both have partners. He backed off after that and I got him to leave earlier than what we originally planned.

He used to be a bit like this in school before myself and a few others told him off for it. My boyfriend and I continued to be friends with him (but we kept an eye on him), and I honestly thought he'd changed because he never did anything like that again, but he has. He's honestly destroyed my trust.

I feel like I should tell my boyfriend that our friend crossed a boundary, but I'm scared he'll think the worst. I definitely didn't give him any indication that I was okay with it (I clearly looked uncomfortable and I told him to stop) but I still feel fucking guilty for inviting him over in the first place, even though it had just been to catch up after not seeing each other for a while. I also plan to steer clear of him for a while because the whole thing just left me feeling horrible and uncomfortable.

104,"First off let me explain, this is very unlike me. I’ve always had a very high sex drive, cheeky morning sex? Start your day off right. Afternoon delight? Absolutely fantastic tell me more.. 
But these past two weeks works been kicking my arse and I’ve come home very fatigued and just want to sit down in front of a good movie and unwind.
 
Problem is with my job it’s not unheard of for me to pull 60 hour weeks, whereas my brilliantly sexy girlfriend is a photography student in university. Not to put her down but she doesn’t do a lot, her work load isn’t challenging therefore she had a lot of free time on her hands. 
When we first got together we were sex sex sex, and she confided in me it would upset her in her past relationship that her ex wasn’t bothered about sex, we always agreed we wouldn’t be like that but.. 
When she initiates sex 9/10 I’ll apologetically decline and she takes this as a personal insult. I’ve tried to reassure her this isn’t past events cropping up in a new relationship but just me being shattered, she doesn’t get that she gets to do what she wants 7 days a week whereas I leave the house at 7 and sometimes don’t get back till 11 that night.

105,"So, a lot of people may find it weird that I dislike what has happened so I want to lay down some ground work: I've had a difficult life, I'm pretty sure most people have but it's just been one of those scenarios where I can't catch a break. Despite that I really really hate being pitied or seen as weak so much so that i will go out of my way to not seem as such. I don't talk about my problems with most people because I don't want to be pitied or ever want anyone using the phrase or thinking  the phrase""poor her"" towards me. I don't like free things, I don't like being favored, I will go out of my way to make sure I am not favored - it's a whole ordeal.

Having said that, recently my friends and I were having conversations regarding money management and how some people have difficulties which can stem from their upbringing, constantly battles in life etc etc. 
We were all sharing examples in  our own lives I brought out the example that I love electronics but I refuse to buy expensive  things as they are out of my budget. While it's easy for me to do that b/c I have a good grasp of what I want from my future it's not as easy for other people. I also mentioned that sometimes people get tired of fighting to survive in life and that can lead to making rash decisions and ending up in debt. Currently I am going through some not fun so as I was saying those things I teared up.

Fast forward to the next day my friend comes over and gifts her google pixel 2XL, which she has been trying to sell for over a year and also discussed with me the morning of the our talk on how to best sell it and asked me to sell it for her.

If this was any other time like my birthday or during a holiday or for any other reason I really would have appreciated it and yes I would have been resistant b/c the gift is expensive but I would have accepted. But she gave this to me right after our conversation and I just look at it every day and feel ashamed that i shared a part of myself like that and it culminated with this.
She is a great person and I know she has good intentions but I am just so hurt that this has happened and I am finding it really hard to explain why it hurts.

TL;DR: friend got me an expensive phone after I spilled my love for electronics and financial issues. She has good intentions but I feel pitied. I can't accept the gift, she won't take no for an answer, and I'm having a hard time explaining my feelings.",08Feb2019,1
107,"Hey everyone how’s your day going? Me and my girlfriend have been together for 2 years now, things have always been great and like any other couples we have had our ups and downs. The issue I am concerned about started last year July -ish, she all of the sudden became cold, distant and would often tell me she wasn’t interested in sex anymore and that if I needed it so much I was allowed to sleep with any other girl I wanted, I never did! She was also calling me crazy, insecure and delusional whenever I asked if another guy was in the picture. Fast forward to September, and I found out she was hanging out with one of her exes and getting drinks... I broke up with her on the spot, after a week I unblocked her and allowed her to tell me her side of the story, and things kind of made sense and because i didn’t have proof of infidelity I took her back (kind of regret it) from then on things were good until December when I found she hung out with him again! But this time all of her friends (who also went to HS with this guy) were there celebrating another friend’s birthday, I didn’t make a big deal out it. But here’s where things got crazy, lately she’s been picking random fights and I didn’t know why until I got the scoop that her first love, the love of her life has came back into her life and have been texting her. This was the final straw and I politely broke up with her and blocked her from everything! She say nothing went on with her and him but this guy is LITERALLY her first ever “true love” before me and her were together this guy was always in the picture no matter what, I mean the first ex is some nice guy dude that i wasn’t really worried about, but THIS guy is a huge no no! 

So with all of the lying and secrecy I just didn’t think she respected my feelings enough to stop doing what she promised she would stop doing. Also with the recent random mood swings and her saying “I need time to think” and ignoring me for a whole day and me finding out these weird antics started right when her OTHER ex whose the love of her life came back I simply put two and two together and left in peace. Am i in the wrong? Was I justified?

112,"This’ll be long, thanks for taking the time to read because I really need an opinion from a neutral perspective. I’ll change a few things as well because I want it to be anonymous but nothing that’ll affect the overall story.

I and my husband got married last year. He just got a job before the wedding, and we’re relatively a young couple, I just graduated before we got married and am currently not able to work because of an unfortunate situation. Getting into the wedding we knew we will be well off for ourselves, but not have a ton of money as we’re just starting off and he’s the only one working currently. We wanted to avoid having a big wedding and just sign papers and have a small dinner to save money that we’d need for eventually getting a home. His mother wanted a big wedding and kept suggesting things in a way which made us think she’d pay for a few things she wants herself, so we paid for whatever we were asked for according to the plan. Come the wedding ceremony, a week ahead we’re told we have to pay a lot more for all the things she wanted. Rude shocker but we shelled it out. Even at the wedding most of the things were done the way they wanted. They kept making a big deal out of how its my special day and it’s all going to be what I wanted, but no one actually cared for or agreed to any ideas I had. We didn’t think much of it but did have a good time at the wedding and enjoyed ourselves. We were living with his parents and planning to move out on our own soon after the wedding. All while the stay, his dad would make passive aggressive comments every now and then about how much he hates us staying with them, and how happy he’ll be when we’re gone, and how he needs to wipe our bum for us and how we eat too much of their food and all that. Mind you, I’d cook for myself, clean after myself, keep to myself and never got in their way and I and my SO did our very best to help around the house as much as we could, and we paid them whatever rent they’d ask for. My SO is a very kind, generous and polite guy and the best son they could’ve asked for. His sister is an absolute brat, irresponsible, dumb college dropout who never cleans after herself and is always whining about others. But for some reason, the parents absolutely love her. She got married last year and moved out as well,and every other day they’d call her to ask how she is, pay for her bills, take her to dinners and concerts with her husband and pamper her in every way they could. But when we moved out we received none of that treatment. We didn’t feel entitled to it, so we didn’t care and were happy to talk to them whenever my SO would miss them and call them, which’d be once a month or so. We moved to a different city, and his parents gave us some of their old furniture for free and did help us move which we were really grateful for.

Come Christmas his mother keeps asking us to come over and spend time with them. We decided we’ll go for two weeks to stay with them as he was off work for two weeks. His sister and her husband were there too. All this time, she’d never pick up after herself, never do her own laundry, never cook her own food, but they doted over her. I and my SO would take care of our business and make sure we’re being as nice as we can as house guests. We were met with the same passive aggressive comments from his dad. We wouldn’t mind and keep moving along as mostly we were having a fun time. I could see my husband getting upset over the obvious and blatant favoritism going on between the kids, but he’d set it aside and we did our best to have a good time.

Shortly after my husband got a different job offer which is closer to where his parents live, and we were broke as his older job hadn’t paid him for 4 months and were on the verge of getting bankrupt, so he decided to take up the offer. The apartment in the other city still had our lease, so even though we don’t stay there anymore, we still have to pay the rent there until the lease ends. Given the situation and how things were, when we spoke to his family about the decision to shift jobs and cities they offered us to stay at their place. We were beyond grateful. But as soon as we get here, we’re hit in the face with how incompetent my SO is because we couldn’t contest him not getting paid in the previous job properly. We were very grateful to just have a nice job that’d allow us to stand on our feet soon, and having a place to stay, so we didn’t mind the comments. His sister’s room and his old rooms were currently empty but we were given a room to stay in a small attic. We didn’t mind that at all, were grateful that we just had a place to stay, though it did seem weird. The passive aggressive hurtful comments continued, all the while while we’d see them call his sister and gushing over her and buying her presents for no reason and worrying about her all the time. It stung both me and my SO but we decided to not care about it because we’re adults after all, and didn’t need their attention or praises. We’ve been very careful about being respectful around the house, trying to help out and taking care of all household chores in every way we could.

My SO started feeling very claustrophobic in the attic and was waking up at night several nights in a row, and was very cold and sweaty all the time, and over the next few days got very sick. So we decided to ask them if it’d be possible to use the attic as our room and we wouldn’t be invasive of the rest of the house, and just sleep somewhere else, as there were two empty rooms and he was getting sick and not able to work well at his job. His dad breaks off in a tirade insulting us about how we shouldn’t tell him what we want to do in his own house, and how it’s not his problem that my SO, his own son is feeling sick and that we should be grateful that we get to stay here under his roof in the first place. That was the last straw for my patience. I felt so insulted. I know he is doing us an immense favour by letting us stay, but if he didn’t want us to stay or sleep anywhere else, couldn’t he have said it nicely? Did he have to insult how broke we are and my SO? My SO was incredibly upset because all his life he’s been nothing but a good son but they’ve always been passive aggressive towards him, while showering his total brat of a sister with presents. We just don’t get the double standards. I don’t want to live with his family anymore, neither do I want to ever see these horrible people again who constantly berate and have no respect for my SO despite him being nothing but nice and gentle and caring. Especially after they said they don’t give a damn if he gets sick. What kind of parent doesn’t care about their son’s health?

I know they did us a favour by letting us stay here, but just because they did, does it mean we should be bearing insults constantly about how useless we are? Am I the asshole for wanting to never see them again? Moving out will be very hard for us right now as we have not much and were really relying on staying here for a few weeks to get our feet wet again, but I can’t really sacrifice my self respect for staying under a safe roof with an egotistical man who has no respect for his son and obviously for some weird reason favors other siblings more. We’d be living by the last dime if we moved out now, but I really don’t want to see them again. And my SO has always said how they’ve always been this way his whole life. Ever since he was a kid they always had something to complain about him despite being the nicest he could while his sister got all the love. I just can’t stand to see the man I love so much hurt. I just don’t know if I don’t have the right to be angry in this situation given they did give us a place to stay at is all. But they’ve been passive aggressive and mean for a while now and I don’t know how much longer I want to tolerate the behaviour just because they’re family and gave us a place to stay now.",08Feb2019,1
113,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

So i'm a computer science major at my university. I have always struggled a lot with math which probably means I shouldn't be in my major but oh well.  I barely passed precalc last semester with a 74%. So I went to my professor earlier this week and I told him after going to tutoring to get help with each homework assignment, I just wasn't able to grasp the concepts well enough to solve them on my own.  My professor said that he rarely heard students not get help from the tutoring center, and had proceeded to ask me what was the highest math I took in high school. I said college algebra. He also asked what grade I got in precalc and I said a C. He said that I am going to have a difficult time in calc 1 as a result of the information I had given me as well as he isn't going to give me some sort of special treatment because i'm struggling. Tomorrow I have my first exam in the class, and as a result i'm feeling very deterred. I LOVE programming as well as my programming courses that i'm taking but math is kicking my ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do in my situation? Change my major? If not change my major what else can I do to get help in addition to going to the tutoring centers?

114,"Hello! So for about a month, I have worked as an associate for a large mortgage lender. Since my job will soon involve discussing mortgage rates and terms with clients and writing loans, I need to obtain a license through the NMLS and pass a 125 question exam.  I provided all the necessary documents, excelled in my training, and passed the exam with flying colors- but I'm still unable to obtain my license because of a mistake my employer made.

When our employer entered in all of our information, they gave me the wrong SSN, and gave someone else my social security number.  The wrong person was then verified under my social security number, which has since made it impossible to verify my identity through TransUnion.  I've submitted countless documents, called both the NMLS and TransUnion, and my company's licensing department, no less than 13 times.  They all say there is nothing they can do for me at this time.  Additionally, I had to cancel a credit card because TransUnion now considers my identity ""compromised"".  

I'm furious that this even happened in the first place, and that the task of cleaning up a mess I did not create has fallen on me.  I spend 12 hours a day making over 1000 outbound phone calls for them, in addition to completing additional education requirements for the states.  Frankly, I do not have time to get caught in the constant cycle of calls between the NMLS and TransUnion.  All the while, the Licensing Team takes days to get back to me and refuses to answer questions about how my personal information was mishandled in the first place. I have spoken with my boss about this, and he has confirmed that the licensing team's mistake could mean that I am stuck on the associate level longer- even though I am excelling at my educational requirements and on the phone.  This means that I could potentially miss out on thousands of dollars.

All the while, no one is coming forward to explain the mistake, or to offer an apology, or providing any actual solutions to this conundrum I've been caught in for weeks.  Frankly, I'm at the end of my rope.  I've lost a lot of faith in this organization's ability to handle non-public information appropriately, and all my friends and family who have heard about this say they wouldn't get a loan through that company if they are that careless with personal info. Everyone always says you can't succeed in sales unless you believe in what you're selling, and I've already lost a lot of faith in this company (for additional reasons as well that I'll elaborate on if asked).

Every time I express my concerns to higher ups, they tell me to stop being ""negative"" and to ""trust the process"" and say that I'm only hurting myself.  I feel like I'm over-reacting and going crazy, and I don't really know what to do.  I want to find another job and get away from this, but I'm concerned I'll never get an opportunity like this again, and everyone is telling me that by leaving I'm missing my chance at success.  Also, leaving a job after 1 month looks bad on a resume.  Is this as bad as it seems to me? Is there any additional action I should take? Or should I run out of there and not look back? ",08Feb2019,1

I was trying to get it done tonight so I could draw while I’m on a trip for a few hours tomorrow but that’s not really happening. Oh well for that, But I’m still very much so up for any advice on what I could do! Or if anyone knows any apps that work really good from their experience with the price and all. I’m going to get a job sometime this year and or in the summer when there’s more time for me to work and et cetera.",08Feb2019,1
117,"Need some advice on what on earth to do with my career! I'm 24 and I have a degree and a masters in History from a very good university in London. However, when I was doing my masters I was working part-time in a pub and I contunied doing that after I graduated because my girlfriend and I wanted to save money for travelling. Last year we went travelling, came back and I got offered my position back, with the addition of being trained up as a supervisor. 

&amp;#x200B;

During that time I have looked (probably not as frequently as I should have done) for other jobs in careers more related to my degree subject, in museums, writing jobs etc. However I just have no idea what I want to do. I've taken what feels like a million career tests and they all say I would be good in a editorial role or a writing role and that would be fantastic but to get into a publishing career like that requires a lot of time, and most probably an unpaid internship (which I can't afford). I also have no idea what career or industry I want to work in. I've looked at a few different ones, and some i find appealing, but I have failed many times in applications for them. It makes me think I am not suited to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now back at the pub the Assistant Manager is leaving, and I've been offered to train up as the next one, which if I said yes would mean I would get the position hopefully by the end of the year. This is appealing as I do like the job, I understand the business, and I've made a lot of friends there and in the area. I have a lot of good contacts fpr a career there and I am seen as an up-and-coming person to watch. This is exciting but I can't help feel that I am not using the skills I learned in my degree for which I put myself in a lot of debt for. It feels like a waste.

&amp;#x200B;

If I agree to be trained up my manager has asked I remain committed to it and not look for other career options until the training is complete which is fair, but it feels like a bit commitment and one which will decide my career path. I know I will be judged by my family and some friends for wasting away my degree and going into the pub business, even though there is lucrative money and success involved there. It isn't seen as a ""real"" job.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Do I stay at in the pub business and create a career there which I know I would be good at but risk wasting some valuable skills I learned in my seemingly unrelated degree, or turn a managerial position down, but still have no idea what I want to do as a career?

121,"So I am a freshman elementary education major at a big ten university and I am taking a class for my major that has mandatory volunteer hours at a partner location for the duration of the semester. We had the chance to chose four locations from a list and were assigned to one by our professor, and I was assigned to an adult education center where students are able to get a high school diploma instead of a GED. I am scheduled to go once a week for four hours and have gone once already, and I loved it! It feels like I’m learning a lot and it’s an awesome opportunity. But I want to make sure that I am doing a good job for my students.

I have no problems of any kind getting along with them and they are all very nice, but I feel like my teaching strategies aren’t working very well since they are designed for younger kids (not to mention that all my students are older than me). I feel like I’m not getting through to them and I feel like they aren’t grasping the concepts which make me feel awful because they all care so much about doing well but get frustrated. 

I would ask my professors or classmates for advice, but my university doesn’t offer any classes for adult education (those are offered at a neighboring community college) and I am the only person in my class who was placed there.

I feel stuck, these people are trying their best to further their education and and I am responsible for helping them, but I feel like I can do a better job, and I feel I need to do better because nobody else signed up to help, even thought there are +120 students in my lecture.

I teach English and math at an accelerated level for them, mostly one-on-one work, but I am also looking for general advice for teaching adults. What teaching strategies work best for adults? What can I do to make sure they understand the content I am teaching them? 

Summary:

I have been assigned to an adult education center and have no background knowledge on how to teach adults and don’t have access to any resources, I am looking for general teaching advice for teaching adults.

125,"There is this girl that lives very close to me that I've known for years and both us, our siblings,  and our parents are friends with each other. We were pretty close and hung out every night during the summer of 2017 but somehow we lost touch when school started again. I tried contacting her on 2 separate occasions: one around Christmas of that year, and during this summer, the first time she kind of just gave short answers to my questions about how she was doing as if she wasn't interested, and the 2nd she just flat out left me on read. 

Every day since that summer I have felt like a complete pile of shit by the way I basically just ignored her when she poured her heart out to me saying she had a huge crush. I felt so stupid for doing that EVEN THOUGH I had a huge crush on her as well but was just an anxious middle schooler. I wished for any opportunity to talk to her and reconnect. Well that day arrived, it was a few hours ago at my sister's cheer banquet, and instead of talking to her and reconnecting I just sat on my phone while she talked to my parents.


The entire time I was so anxious and couldn't even bring myself to look in her direction. I felt so terrible because she seemed pretty talkative and I would spot her looking over at me in my peripheral vision as if she wanted to get my attention. I am at a total loss as to what I should do. I feel as though I need to say something but idk where to start. Please, this is eating me up.",08Feb2019,1

I didn't commit an actual error, and I actually have absolutely no recollection of the situation described to me, but I was in the chain of staff involved, and it could be seen as a situation where I could have called attention to a potential issue and failed to do so.

I was assured that the lawsuit does not name me, only the hospital and doctor, but I am practically frozen in terror thinking about all the possible serious outcomes.  And certainly not least of all, thinking about what this person has experienced and the guilt of not knowing if I contributed to that.  

Due to some major financial issues that inevitably caused me to divorce my spend-a-holic ex-husband, I am currently not in a great place financially. I'm on a two year debt snowball plan, but loss of my professional license and my income would obviously be financially devastating.  I'm so worried for my children, for whom I'm provide 100% of financial support.

I'm imagining myself bankrupt, losing my home and career, my self-respect, not able to provide for my kids...  my thoughts are just spinning out of control.

Every interaction I've had with her has been quite pleasant, even though we cant really speak the same language. and I'd really like to make friends with her. She doesn't seem to have too many friends.

There is a boy in my class who also speaks arabic and I asked him to translate something from her really quick because she's in the class with us.

131,"Here's some background. I’ve been working with her for a year and a half. I got really close to her. She knows a lot about my life as do I about hers. We smoke together and hang out outside of work. We click really well. Make each other laugh, have a lot of things in common, and never have a dull moment in our conversations. 

However, she lives an hour away and only comes into the office once or twice a week so our time together is very limited. Up until about 3 months ago, I was married. So I suppressed all romantic feelings towards her because I don't cheat on my wife, unlike my wife who left me for someone else. While my wife and I were together, this coworker started dating a guy. When I became single, I was bummed because she was still with someone else. Well this week the coworker informed me that her bf of 6 months broke up with her. I felt bad for her because I know what she’s going through. I’m going through the same shit. But I got a little excited because I thought an opportunity was presenting itself. 

A few days pass and the coworker has decided that she is going to put in her 2 weeks notice and go to Peru for a research program (she’s fluent in Spanish and spent 6 months in Spain studying abroad so this wasn’t too drastic or out of character). She said she just needs to get away from her hometown and escape from it all. 

Now I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don’t want to tell her how I feel and her not reciprocate, thus jeopardizing our friendship. At the same time, she’s going to Peru so who knows if I’ll ever see her again and I don’t want to regret it later in life not telling her how I feel. Also, I don’t want to try to convince her to stay here for me because I feel that’s selfish. She should do what she wants to do and what’s going to make her happy. 

She said she’s not 100% sure if this is the right move but she has already applied to it. If I tell her how I feel and she doesn’t reciprocate and also doesn’t go to Peru then I may have just fucked up the entire friendship. Plus both of us are in vulnerable places right now so neither one of us is looking to date. We both need time to heal. But I wouldn’t mind getting closer to her and just taking things slow. 

Either way, if I do or don’t tell her and she still goes to Peru, I’d be losing a dear friend of mine and I know I would miss her terribly. I’ve already cried over the thought of her leaving. She has supported me so much through my wife leaving me so she really means a lot to me.

A little background, he is 31 years old and lives in Illinois with his mother. Abusive father led to a pretty nasty eating disorder that left him physically and mentally unstable, and he relies on his mother to provide everything for him. He is currently seeing a therapist and participating in outpatient groups for eating disorders, but he is also heavily medicated at almost all times, I think klonopin and a few other mood stabilizers. In the past ten years I have been with his sister, he has only slowly deteriorated and not improved at all. He isn't able to hold down a job for long, and has no aspirations to get better and live his own life, and this is slowly crushing him and his mother.

141,"I could right a million things about how my life lead up to this point.
But basically I feel like I had an early mid life crisis.

I say this because I went through a lot of changes most people don't go through until real life.
At 16-17 I lost 2 uncles and my only grandparent I've known (my gran) to cancer.
At 18 I got sucker punched down an alleyway, my girlfriend of 4 years was fucking me about and then dumped me, and I failed to get into uni.
At 19 my (late 70s) dad had some health troubles - blood in his urine, prostitus etc. 
At 20 my mum had health problems / hiatus hernia, goul bladder etc. - she was taken off by ambulance in the middle of the night at one point.
Meanwhile I'm workin shit job - studying at college - in a band and running my own streetwear company. 
Before I know it the guy that got me the job died and I took over his shifts too - he was a neighbour and family friend a real fucking character and old man. 
After 3 years I was done with this job. I remember venting about it - and my situation to my dad who is now in 80s. He then says I'm going to have to ask you to take it easy, we've just found out your uncles got cancer. Within 4 months he too was dead. 
My 4 year of graphic design studies lead me no where. Things like being in a band and streetwear company and a lot of things I was passionate about suddenly seemed meaningless. My friendships were falling apart as they were so childish to me. - stuck somewhere between the devil and the deep blue sea. My life wasn't really going forward. Or backward. I was just sinking into a depression. - which has only seemed to get worse as I lost my integrity on a downward spiral. 
I went from feeling like a leader to a lost cause who nobody needs. 
I feel like I've been on the edge of a knife for a while in terms of what way to take my life - do I move out? What relationship is right for me?
Is she the one or will she ruin my life? Do I give up on things like guitar that used to define me?
Do I have to settle for a shit job? Do I try working for myself again? Do I take the opportunity to go to America to be with a girl of my dreams or do I stay with my parents who I love dearly? 
I have multipotentiality and it has fucked me up.
I can do graphic design, photography, guitar, All kinds of things and yet every dream I ever had and every way of life that made me fulfilled has come apart or been smashed into my face. 
I question myself everyday as to where my life went wrong? Or did it even?
I have my brothers wife sending me video links on Facebook saying 'you are what you've been searching for' and 'it's ok to be vulnerable with depression' and it makes me feel even more fucking lost. It feels like every person I know has a different idea of what I should do.  Some say I need to travel. Others say I should set up my own graphics company. Others think go back to learn a trade. And quite honestly I just want to blow my brains out. It feels like just as I had it so figured out it all fell apart. 
Who leads the leader when he's lost his way? God? Mentors who have had less life experience?
Did I burn out? Or give up?
Did I expect too much from life?
I try and see the light. Try and find some clarity but I feel myself getting lost in this small town. 
My integrity has slowly lost its way. 
It feels like all anybody in this town does is gets fucked up and work. 

I've been talking to a girl this last month we met on tinder. She has 1200 matches but says I'm her favourite - we have been best friends on snapchat a month now. We talk and video chat every day. She lives about 20 mins away. 
She looks like a model. But she used to be an escort and she has 2 kids from her asshole exes that left her. 
Today she was opening up to me about how her eldest seems to be having some behavioural problems being manipulative and controlling and is having to see a mental health person soon. She said she was only 16 when she had her and fell into a post natal depression and the kid had to live with her ex for 2 years. 
I don't know if I should run a million miles from this girl or what. She has been nothing but supportive of my depression. 
Today for example she said when she was depressed she let herself go like I have done etc. But she started buying nice clothes and getting her hair done again etc and started feeling good about herself again. - she sees I have been wearing this same jumper day in day out. 
She works 4 days a week and her exes are not helping with her kids, she even took one to court apparently. 
She seems to have gone through quite a lot in life, and opens up slowly. But looking at her you would think she would be on the front cover of vogue magazine. 
She reminds me a lot of my ex. Extremely attractive but probably riddled with issues behind the surface.
But from my experience it seems like all the best ones are.
I don't know if she could be exactly was I need. She is loving, kind caring, demands respect off of others in the best kind of way. Protective of her kids. She could get any man she wants which makes me question what would she want to do with me? Does she see something in me that I don't? The forgotten parts I have lost in my depression? Or is she just taking me for a mug? She seems to want to best for me regardless. And I'm not looking at her with rose coloured glasses, we have pissed each other off a couple of times. 
So many people my age seem so grounded in themselves and there life.
Where I feel like I've lost myself. And I'm sinking.

It's not that I don't know where else to turn, I just need perspective that I currently do not have. My brother has autism and can be very difficult to be around and to talk to, but he's highly intelligent and high functioning. Unfortunately, my parents didn't really do the best job of teaching us how to manage our finances as kids. It was the kind of situation where our parents said, ""you either go to college or you're kicked out of the house,"" and neither my brother nor I really knew what to do in that situation besides go to college. Somehow, my brother got into a really expensive college and he took out a loan that my mother cosigned. My brother did pretty well and graduated... with a theater degree. I did what I could to steer him away, but like me, he is really stubborn.

Now, of course, he has a ton of debt. But what's worse is, he cannot get a decent job to save his life because he is so different. Think about it. Everybody who interviews him either thinks he is incapable of the work or that something is just wrong with him. My parents kicked him out of the house because they're clueless. He's 25 after all, he should be able to support himself. He has a job 2 nights a week at a restaurant and 5 days at a regular job that pays about 10-11 per hr. He is now subject to a debt he never could have possibly understood, and my parents aren't in a good enough financial position to do anything about it. I also am not sure they would do anything about it if they could. He can't refinance due to obvious credit issues, and he only makes about enough to break even and, at this pace, will have to until he dies.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit I could really use your help and advice. I know this is really long but I have tried to include the whole story. Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

&amp;#x200B;

My entire life I have always been very focused on academic and career achievement. I graduated from a competitive high school with a perfect GPA, went to an Ivy League college to study something I was passionate about, and worked multiple jobs after college to gain experience and save some money up to eventually get into the grad school program of my dreams (I'm being intentionally vague about the kind of program as if I'm specific there is a nonzero chance it could identify me).

&amp;#x200B;

My first semester of school, things all started to fall apart. My dad became very acutely and seriously ill. Being the overachiever that I'd always been, I somehow (and naively) convinced myself that I could do it all - be there for him, every weekend for as long as it would take, driving several hours home and back and being in the hospital, while also studying in a very intense program and that somehow it would all work out. The stress of it all - being in a new place where I didn't yet really know anyone, in a really stressful program, with a very sick parent (my relationship with my other parent has always been complicated and we are now estranged, more on that in a moment) led to the resurfacing of my own struggles with depression and anxiety. I told myself I just had to keep it together until I ""aged out"" of my dad's insurance (because in my mind the absolute last thing he needed while going through things was to worry about me) and I almost made it...at the end of the semester and just days before my 26th birthday, I had a complete breakdown (hello, understatement) and become suicidal. I was hospitalized for six days in an in-patient psych unit until I stabilized enough to be released.

​

The following semester in the spring I returned full-time to the program and passed all of my classes and in the summer completed a re-exam for a first semester class I had failed. I thought I was back on track. Unfortunately, I had gotten an additional diagnosis of ADHD while going through all of this and while I had been working with professionals to develop new/better study strategies, the process of adapting how I learned and studied was not an overnight one for me and I continued to have academic struggles and failed another course.

​

My program allowed me to repeat that course - which I did, successfully - and continue forward. Things were going much better and I was in a better place. I was managing my mental health conditions with the help of doctors and new coping strategies. My dad was doing better and the whole experience had strengthened our relationship. My grades were not nearly at the top-of-my-class level that I had been used to - which had been a major blow to my sense of self-worth - but I was keeping my nose to the grindstone and I was determined to graduate.

​

Then it all fell apart...again. I got a phone call that my dad was back in the hospital and I just saw what had happened my first year about to happen all over again. In one of my classes, we had an upcoming exam - which I did very poorly on, since as soon as I had gotten the news about my dad I was on my way down to be there. Over the course of the next few months, he had numerous procedures/surgeries. I agonized constantly over what to do and no matter what I chose it always felt wrong and that my priorities were never in the right place. The final surgery that he had I wasn't even there for because I had an exam scheduled for the following day which I somehow managed to pass. As soon as he got sick again, I met with my psychologist and came up with a plan to try to not have this go the way it did the first time and with the exception of one of my classes, I did overall pretty well that semester and was still able to be there as much as I could be for my dad. Despite all my efforts, though, and a very high final exam score in that one class, I was still 2 points shy of a passing grade.

​

At this point, for anyone keeping score, I had now failed a total of 3 classes. My academic situation was not good and while the powers that be in my program had been very sympathetic towards me the first two times (something that I am eternally grateful for) - the third time was where they said no. I went through the appeal process (which consisted of appealing to a committee of people and then the dean of the program) and was ultimately told that they understood everything I had been through but I was no longer allowed to continue and they would process my ""withdrawal"" immediately. A week later I was out.

​

I was devastated. On the one hand, I completely understood their decision. I had had ongoing academic issues and ultimately had nobody to blame but myself. On the other hand, I knew of other people with similar academic records that had been given additional chances to be successful (and who are now close to graduating) and so it felt like not only was I a failure - I was a failure that had worked hard for a dream that I didn't deserve and wasn't capable of achieving.

​

I'll be honest. I didn't get out of bed for a month after all of this. I very seriously considered suicide again. I truly felt like if I was a failure in this then I didn't deserve the privilege of life and my family would be better off if that was the end of my story.

​

Over the past few years, I have slowly but steadily built a new life for myself. I work in a related field doing research that I love and is meaningful to me. I found a partner that is wonderfully loving and supportive and we have been in a relationship together for about a year. I have been in therapy and worked on my various issues and have stabilized to the point where (under doctor supervision) I have been able to successfully come off antidepressants. I have come to terms with the fact that my mother is severely mentally ill and I have cut ties with her completely. Last fall, I finally got a diagnosis for a chronic condition that I have had since college (and probably also contributed to my struggles in my program) and have a good doctor that is helping me manage that.

​

I'm in a better place in my life now in my early 30s than I was in my mid-late 20s. I think that the decision that was made a few years ago was probably the right one - I had some things that I needed to work on (another understatement). But I think that now, if I could be given another chance, that I could be successful. I have had multiple people encourage me to appeal and try again. A new dean started with the program last year and while it is a longshot chance, other people have encouraged me to reach out and write a letter and ask that my standing with the school be reconsidered.

​

Here's where I turn to you, Reddit. What do you all think? Do you think I would be out of my mind to ask for another chance? Or should I roll the dice and ask? If anyone thinks I should ask - are there official and proper ways to do this, or is writing a letter to the dean the best way to go about this?

​

Thank you in advance for any and all advice you can give me.

I honestly have everything I could ever want in life and I appreciate these gifts everyday! However, I just don’t feel happy? Recently, I just don’t feel joyful about life. I don’t want people thinking I am not happy with what I have in life.. its just sometimes I feel like I am not in control. I have a lot of anxiety and stress and I’ve been really busy with school these past months.

151," **Info:** We are both studying abroad but were grown up in the same country.

So, I need some advice. Like some months ago I have met a girl (just started Uni, I am already here for two years) which I really liked (in a romantic way) and we literally spend every day together and I loved it! However, at one point I made a move but she rejected me thus she just saw me as a friend from the beginning (also had a boyfriend back home at this time.). I was crushed. She asked if we could stay friends because we had such a good time. I told her that it is better for me for not having contact anymore for some time and she was really but understandable.. Luckily it was right before our Christmas Break, so we could not meet up anyway for four weeks. Well we both flew home and did not contact each other. First I was really really bad but I got through that with the awesome support I had home. Was so awesome to see all of my friends again after such a long time. Started also starting to go to the gym again, was reading more and much more which is really good for me.

Well, now I am back since four weeks and she has contacted me two weeks before, if everything is fine and I want to meet up. So we did. Several times. However I have noticed something weird. My perspective kind of changed. Well, I still like hanging around with her, we have such a good time, but sometimes I think: Why being so close to a former crush again, after you felt so bad after the rejection and barely got happy again? Am I playing with fire? Before the break I wanted to meet her every day and now I am more trying to see her not that often, although she is a great person, because I think it is better for me. However, she and me are literally doing the same thing what we also did before when we meet up, but the dynamic kind of changed. Many attempts to meet up comes from her (of course I also think about her, but I do not reach out as often as I did before) and want to hang around as often as before. To be honest, I think that she does not have too many friends yet and she feels really comfortable with me thus we are from the same country and also can speak in our native language, which I also enjoy kind of to be honest. I think she is really happy that I am back in her life. Also she knows, that I kind of know everyone from the Uni and she may can meet interesting people through me.

Well, now, she also knows that tomorrow I am throwing a party and has asked me if she can come, but I'm really not interested for her being included in my circle of friends and at the end I might see her on every occasion. It's enough for me to meet every few weeks or just we two like before every other day. It is good as it is as the moment, I feel so much better and not thinking about her anymore every day and feeling sad. My circle of friends is a save heaven for me and I have a lot of fun with them, but I think if she would be around, it would always remind me of the time I have ""suffered"" and that could really knock me back in the back, which I do not want. Maybe also afraid starting to catch feelings again and then it would be the worst having her in my friendship circle (or maybe she even dates someone in my friendship circle?). It may happen or not, it may effect me or not, but do I want to take the risk? I am not really worried right now, but who knows?

**Current Situation/Summary:** I still enjoy spending time with her but not too keen about letting her get as close to me as before? Anyway, how do I get out of this situation? When I say that I am fine to see her only once a week or not inviting her to gatherings, she thinks I still have feelings + I do not want to make it weird somehow because I have nothing against meeting up several times in a month. I just feel great again after this bad time and do not want to risk it. Furthermore, If we see each other at the university (you often see her by chance, since I live in a small town) I want to be able to talk to her because I do like her.

I just feel that there is now a hole that I cannot fill. I have known him my whole life and he never deserved an end like this. He was finally happy in his life and I just need some guidance, some *advice*, as to what I can do to lessen the pain. I soon will be in possession of a lot of his things, things that will always remind me of him but that I feel I should keep either for the memories or the monetary value. One of these things is his German Shepherd which I hope I can raise as he would want but I know that at least for a while whenever I hug this dog I will cry, remembering all of the love and times I spent with my brother. I do not want to forget him ever and treat his memory the way I feel he would want me to. If anyone has gone through something like this please help me, I have never, and believed I would never, experienced something so painful as this.

So my friend (“S”) is very depressed and really needs help, but her parents refuse to do anything about it. Any advice would be really great. *Note: She isn’t in danger of self harm or suicide but still needs help, just not the 911 kind*

I’ve known S since 8th and we are both freshmen now and we regularly talk and text. Since about halfway through 8th grade I noticed that she was (to some degree) depressed. For about a year or so, S has been confiding in/talking to me about how she feels, and both of us are 90% it’s depression. (She hasn’t been formally diagnosed but she defiantly some kind of help). like I said i’ve been through a lot with depression and even self-harm: About 2 years ago I started on medication and therapy, and thanks to that i’ve never been better. So think I know enough to recognize when someone needs help. That being said, I’m not any kind of professional, and S really needs some who knows to help her. I’ve been tried to get try her to go into therapy or something like that, because I know how much it can help, and I know how much she needs it. S can go from perfectly fine one minute to breaking down. She talks a lot about how empty, sad, tired, overwhelmed and useless she feels. She’s said many things along the lines of, ”I hate everything about myself,” “Everything I do is pointless,” “I’m a burden,” “I’m not worth your time,” things like that She’s frequently has “Episodes” where she cries and doesn’t want move, or texts and/or talks to me about things like the ones I mentioned. They eventually pass and I’m usually able to talk her out of it. But that can take a long time, and I’m not always able to be to talk or be there, not to mention that i’m not at all qualified or equipped to handle situations like this. To sum it up, S is clearly struggling badly and really needs help. Not only am I not able to give her that help, her parents are actively stopping her from getting it.

Even though her parents are fully aware that S is very depressive, they refuse to do anything about it. And S has always had a somewhat shaky relationship with her parents. Once in early September 2018, S had a full on breakdown right before 9th period. It was by a staff bathroom in one of the far halls, and S was curled up and quietly sobbing. It was almost 2 or 3 minutes before I could talk to her again. I eventually convinced her to go to the social workers office (which is a great thing for a school to have) to meet with and talk to one of them. We walked together to the class she would’ve gone to, because passing period had ended a while ago. Her teacher gave us both passes so she could go to the social worker and I could get to my class without being absent. S stayed there for the rest of the period, and when I texted her she said that they called her dad in and he was talking to the school. The next day when I asked her how it went, she said that the school strongly recommended therapy, (they can’t force you to) but her dad wouldn’t even consider it. When she go home, S and both her parents got into a huge argument. She never told me what they exactly said, but they thought it was somehow her fault or didn’t believe her and that there was some yelling. She said that whenever she brought it, both refused to talk about it and the she had given up trying to get help from them. I’ve been trying to convince S to get counseling with a social worker, but she say that she doesn’t have the time and doesn’t want another fight with her parents. Basically, S needs help, but her won’t get it and she can’t get it herself without her parents knowing and getting mad.

Overall, my problem is that my friend is depressed and needs help, but her parents wont let her. Her parents refuse to get her any kind therapy, counseling, medication etc. She can’t get any from the school because she’s worried about them finding out. I can’t call 911 because she isn’t in any physical danger (From herself or anybody else.) I’ve thought about CPS, but I think a big change like that would be bad since she’s already very fragile. Besides, I don’t think her parents are doing anything legally wrong. But neither are completely off the table and I’m ready to do either. She’s already doing badly, and i’m worried it will get worse. I have no idea what to do and could really use some help. Even if you don’t think it will help, any advice or opinions would be great. Thanks for reading, hope you’re doin’ ok.

Sorry for bad formatting, on mobile. Also sorry if I ramble, I don’t tell stories well or ask for advice often. 

Over a year ago I moved in with an acquaintance (R), and we became pretty good friends. About a month in, he started seeing a woman (S), and we also became good friends. It’s obvious where this is going already, huh? 

S and I connected very well, would sometimes go out for drinks, went to a concert together out of town once, and this was all fine with R. But it was apparent that we had feelings for each other, unbeknownst to R. S and I had even talked about our feelings multiple times over recent months. But our platonic friendship was strong as well, and we crossed no other lines until recently. 

Their relationship went very south about six months after they began dating. I had already moved out by that time. R became strongly verbally abusive, trashed their house in fits of anger, and S suspects R cheated on her multiple times.

Myself and all of our friends have been advising S to leave him for this half of their relationship. She’s explained her reasons for staying, but they read as “I would rather stay than go through the breakup”. Our friend group has lost respect for R after hearing about the abuse, and some have stopped talking to him entirely. I currently work closely with R, so this is more difficult for me at the moment.

A week ago, before going out to a friend’s birthday party that N was not attending, S and I made out in my car. Two days later, we slept together. He does not know any of this.

Yesterday she packed her things and left him. I hear he’s taking it very hard, especially because he’s lost so many friends. I admit I find it hard to have sympathy for him, and that I am biased as hell. 

Today S told me she’s been in love with me for months, but also understands the precariousness of the situation and does not expect a relationship from me. I told her I feel the same way about her, and that I’m not sure what I should do.

It was immoral and wrong to sleep with my friend’s girlfriend, even if their relationship was toxic, abusive and imminently doomed. I know this and feel guilty. But if I can reconcile that, should I still not enter a relationship with her? 
Should I wait to tell R, or tell him immediately? I honestly will not miss having him as a friend, and has never been a very good one to me.

I have strong and genuine feelings for S. I clearly feel guilt already, and that I’d be doing something wrong. But I feel as though it wouldn’t bother me for long, considering the nature of their relationship and the loss of respect I have for R after his abuse of S. Again, I admit I do not feel very sympathetic towards him. And I know I could be using that as a justification for sleeping with S and wanting to explore a relationship.

168,"I’m sorry, this is long! 

I (26f) got married to a man (39m) I barely knew and met on a dating site. He’s a foreigner and won’t speak English with me (although he knows it, not fluently but knows). I went to live with him in his country, learned the local language(not fluently), got a job, tried to make some friends, but still feel isolated and lonely.

My main motivation for marriage was fear of being alone and not being able to handle life on my own. I wanted to be “somebody’s” I guess. 
Also I just got out of a very long and unhealthy relationship just before meeting him and was afraid that I’m getting old and don’t have much time for dating.  
My previous relationship was very mentally abusive and left me with panic attacks and huge anxiety and not much will to live. 

Now looking back I see how much I effed up, and how wrong this all is. I should have stayed single for a while. And should have gone to therapy.

But here we are, married for 5 years. 
He is a great man, protective and caring, he bought us a nice house and a fancy car just to please me (because I said it would be nice), he takes me on dates and buys me gifts.
His family is very nice and my family loves him. 

However, I don’t think there ever was any true love from me towards him. I was grateful, admire him, but was never in love.
I thought I’d start to love him as time went on and as we knew each other better, but it’s not happening. It’s difficult for me to have sex with him, because I’m just not attracted. 
I do it sometimes, more out of guilt, (which is even more effed up), but only once in several months. He stopped asking because he expects me to refuse anyways.
I don’t think he has anyone else. He just goes to work and back home. 

We don’t have much chemistry and never really did but we have our good times.

We fought a lot in the past, mostly because of my anxiety, which makes me do and say stupid things (and scream and cry). 
Sometimes when we fight especially badly he won’t let me leave the room and will grab me and prevent me from leaving. It’s scary and once he grabbed my neck and I got startled and hit him and broke my palm bone. It was years ago. 

All this makes me really sad and makes him sad too. 

So now I moved back to my country to “have some fresh air and think”, and he came to visit me last month, but I didn’t feel that I missed him much. Rather I was relieved to be back home. 

Lately I think I finally got recovered from my anxiety that made me go crazy, so I don’t fight anymore. I don’t know if it’s because we’re apart or because I’m truly getting better. 

I know that I made awful mistakes but question is how do I deal with this situation?

Would it be worse to stay and hope love will grow or divorce and hurt the man who loves me? Which is more selfish? 

I’m now 31, afraid it’s getting late for me to find somebody. He says he’ll never marry if we divorce (even before he said he believed he’ll never marry until I showed up). He’s now 44 and tired. 

We both hopefully want kids but never had. 
We also both feel like there’s not much time for us to wait on it. 

He says he loves me but will accept divorce if I decide on it. 
He says I’ll regret if I divorce him, my mom also says so. 

I am confused beyond sanity.

171,"Ok, so I like to think of myself as a pretty good friend. I am fairly nice, I make jokes, and I like to hang out with them before and after school (We are both in HS). We both like the same things, and freshman year we were really close. We still are, I guess.., But,

In school we both participate in this event called World Scholars Cup, which is a very important thing to the people in the program we are in. It includes a free trip to Europe, and the ability to compete with other scholars in a competitive manner, you can look it up. The point is, there are 3 people to a team.

As the only 2 freshmen taking the class last year, we made a team with this girl neither of us knew too well. We both did really good, I got 11 medals, he got 9, and I assumed if we had a competent partner this year we could go far.

However, and upper-classman asked to talk to him as me and a few of our friends were talking. He asked my friend if he wanted to join their team, Which was pretty good already. He came back and we talked about it a bit, saying the dream team would be me, him, and another one of our friends (Who will now be referred to as the Brit) and we could win with that team.

I finally convince the Brit to join our team, but my first friend already agreed to join the first team. I completely agree with him, and tbh is a bit jealous that I wasn't asked, but I am still a bit angry. Is this normal? Should I be happy for him, or angry that he abandoned me and the Brit? (I also don't know who will be our third now)

TL:DR- My friend got a better offer then I could give him, and he chose that over me. Am I allowed to be mad?",08Feb2019,1

Ok, have a crush on this girl that wasn't a small crush. I was in love with her. Let's call her Yana. Yana was beautiful and a genuine person who was actually considerate of others. She was also hilarious and lives across the street from me. We were friends as kids and often went to each other's houses. It was fun. But we just stopped slowly I don't know why I don't think she does either. I only spoke to her when forced guessing her but not like I was avoiding her or anything. We just never crossed paths. I still remember in kindergarten I was excited when I saw her in the halls waving like a maniac. Yana was one of my closest friends. Fast forward to about a year ago. Yana ended up going from one division of my school (CP) to the other (Discovery) So she was around me always. I still didn't talk to her that much or ever except when needed. One day in late October Yana acknowledged something I did. Then my brains was like you like this girl? I refuted the claim by my thoughts and continued on with my day. Until that night I had a dream where she was my ""partner"" AKA date for a field trip to a fancy restaurant. The next day I kinda realized all the qualities about her. Ever since I have liked her. Sometimes I would awkwardly look at her. I think Yana noticed once or twice but not that much. I really liked her. But I never really did anything creepy except for the looking at her awkwardly thing. It took me months to even talk to Yana. But I was forced into as my best friend at the time was showing me a meme and he was in this group project with Yana so I laughed and made a joke about it. Yana laughed and joined in. I kinda kept talking becoming friends. Creating inside jokes and kind of a book. We started being back in each other's lives. It was the best time I ever had in that grade. This continued for about 1 month until I had to ruin it. I finally got the courage in may of that year to write a note to her anonymously with one clue to who I am proclaiming my love. My friend Bre helped me write it and put it into her locker. Yana didn't even notice Bre had to point it out. She saw it. I'm not sure if she figured out it was me or Bre told her but Bre moved to Texas. Bre told me Yana needed a break to decide what to say for like 1-2 weeks. Which hit me hard but in the end, I knew we were gonna be friends again. Flash forward 8 months to the present not a single word from her. I feel like an asshole. But I'm not sure what I did still she won't tell me. I ride the bus and share a bus stop with her everyday not a single word still. I have 2 classes with her every day still no words. And on purpose too. She made me unfollow her on Instagram. She posted a story saying it was crush night and whoever messaged a heart to them meant they liked them. I made a horrible decision to do so talking about how I was sorry and we can just be friends after waiting 8 months to hear a response! But nope she read them and never responded. When I talk to Meg one of her and my friends when she's around she leaves. When I am by her she scoots to the farthest spot possible. I don't think it has to do with the note or the dm. Shes too smart for that. It has to do with me. What did I do? I have no clue. I am acting stalkerish? I don't think so because I'm not engaging in conversations with her though I would like to as our friendship was fun. I just want to be her friend. Is that too much to ask? I was thinking about dm-ing her asking what I did. But that would be weird. Any advice?",08Feb2019,1

I’ve been diagnosed with Chron’s disease for close to a year now. The doctors have given me a super strict diet that I absolutely need to work with. Here’s the issue.
I’ve been a picky eater my entire life. I’m only comfortable with either junk food or very little fruit (like strawberries, bananas, oranges etc) so my diet is very unhealthy, I admit it. I’ve also had stomach issues for as long as I can remember, which is my fault for eating so horribly. 

I know I’m not supposed to drink milk, or eat gluten etc but I honestly could care less. I know it’s destroying my insides, I feel as if maybe I don’t believe it. Like, I get the idea that it tears apart my intestines but I’m more of a “see it to believe it” person. Which isn’t good. I drove my car recklessly until I finally got in a wreck and now I drive more carefully. You know?

I eat cereal almost every day! And yes, I’ve tried almond milk, coconut milk, any kind of milk you could think of. None of it is the same to me. I also can’t stand to nit pick my favorite foods just to avoid gluten! Is gluten even real?! My parents lecture me every single time I eat/drink things I’m not supposed to, but I refuse to listen. I’m an asshole, I know. I just refuse to believe that I actually have Chron’s. 

I really don’t know why. It’s just a mental thing I guess. I NEED to start eating healthier or I will more than likely die before I turn 30. I don’t know what to do, my brain is set to just stay in my comfort zone. I literally refuse to even take a tiny bite of anything healthy or different. 

My issues are growing worse by the day, I can hardly eat anything anymore without becoming incredibly sick. Please, I need advice or support or just anything because I truly don’t know how to win this battle in my brain. Part of me knows the seriousness of this disease but part of me refuses to believe it. I’m out of ideas. 

Thanks for your time.",08Feb2019,1
176,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

For a little context, my best friend and her boyfriend broke up because she cheated on him with me (this was the fifth incident, and he knew about the others, by the way). I have had feelings for her for a long time and don't know what to do. They were dating for a year, making it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been helplessly in love with her and I feel like she is, too (a rude assumption, I know), but she won't admit to it. When she cheated on her boyfriend, she would say things like she wanted to be with me one day, that she wanted me to hold her, that she wanted to kiss me, etc. Her boyfriend wasn't too keen of this and I've always assumed that it was because he was insecure and didn't want to give me the victory (until now).

&amp;#x200B;

For context as to why they exactly broke up, I will break down the situation more, defining each incident. 

&amp;#x200B;

Incident One:

Over Thanksgiving break, she admitted to being in love with me and at around midnight, if my memory doesn't fool me, she said that she loved me, missed me and wanted to be in my arms. I, being the idiot that I am, replied back to her and said all of it back to her. This incident only lasted two days, but she would constantly message me. While I was Black Friday shopping, I was constantly distracted because she was always messaging me. Even though I loved the attention from her, I did have the feeling in the back of my mind because I felt bad for her boyfriend. It hurt a lot when she ended it, but it was whatever. I would later discover that she would say that I was flirting with her and she wasn't flirting back.

&amp;#x200B;

Incident Two:

Not too long after the first incident (a week, maybe) she starts by saying that she regrets what she did, saying that she regretted ending our flirting. Me, taking on the role of the idiot once again, start flirting with her again. I write her two paragraphs (she doesn't write one back, eek). This incident lasts from Saturday until Wednesday, not even a week, the second longest incident of us flirting with each other. This one ends with a bang. I tell her best friend, we tell her boyfriend, her best friend and her have beef for a day or two, it's over. This incident left a good strain on their relationship, but isn't that big of a deal to her boyfriend. (A bit of postscript, we started calling each other babe in this incident.)

&amp;#x200B;

Incidents Three and Four:

These incidents are short, so I will keep them sweet. All the same for awhile, but we do something unprecedented in our flirting. We do this over the phone on a call. Only one of these two incidents and I tell a close friend of hers about it. These incidents are largely uneventful and don't include much, other than a large strain on their relationship that would never go away.

&amp;#x200B;

Incident Five:

This incident has all of the meat to it. This incident lasted two weeks, which was the longest incident. We would say that we loved each other and the usual stuff we would talk about, of course, but this incident was the breaking point in her relationship. When we were hanging out with each other on a Friday night, we decided that we were going to sneak off. We hold hands to a dumpster, we hold each other, talk, all that. Long story short, we were caught by someone, still unsure who it was, though. This would be the final straw and, maybe two weeks later, they would break up after lots of pressure from others.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do and need help with this, If I should try dating her, how long should I wait? What should I do in the meantime, if I should wait? I am really confused on what to do and need help with this.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR. My best friend and her boyfriend break up because she was cheating on him with me on five incidents, I don't know what to do. Along with that, I am helplessly in love with her. ",08Feb2019,1

179,"I’m 21 years old and my memory seems to be slipping. I  have smoked copious amounts of marijuana through the years. I’m constantly losing my keys, wallet, and (mostly) placement recollection. I remember the things I say pretty adequately, events, and overall long term memories. Of course, I could be talking and totally forget what I’m about to say— I will admit this has receded since I’ve quit smoking heavily. Here recently, however, I threw my Television remote in the garbage and I have absolutely no recall of doing such. Should I be worried or seek medical assistance?

180,"I've been smoking way too much for the past few years but I don't know how to stop. Because ever since I started, it has made everything else really boring or uninteresting, and made me not able to care about much of anything. I've used it as a crutch and now I have really messed up, because I'm really mentally addicted to the stuff. It's not as bad as other drugs, I know, which is why I don't do them because if I can't deal with a weed addiction I definitely can't deal with a crack or pill addiction or something. 

So I just need help to know how to enjoy things again. I'm in therapy but that doesn't help much. He doesn't suggest what to do, infact he basically tells me to keep smoking, just not much. 

I actually want to keep doing it, right now it's hard to imagine my life without it at this point. It's the only thing I have to look forward too day to day, so I enjoy it a lot. 

But I don't want to only enjoy that for the rest of my life, I want to do and enjoy other things also, but it's like the joy has been sucked out of my life and I can't rekindle the flame for anything at all. I barely even like video games or music anymore, and I used to like them both a lot, especially music. Usually if I'm not out with family I'm sitting at home smoking and messing around on YouTube/Netflix or on this app, or beating off. I have attempted to work out, read, find some interesting skill to learn, but I get done with all of it and it feels more like a chore than anything else. 

Any advice would be good. Thanks. ",08Feb2019,1

182,"So my older brother and I moved 1 1/2 years ago from another country, we're renting a room in a small apartment. My brother moved here to go to university (he got a scholarship in one of the best universities around here) and I moved because I had just graduated high school in my country and was planning on attending university here. I signed up for school but dropped within the first month of attending due to money issues and stuff and got a job, I was barely 19 at the time and where I used to work my first job there was only older people I'm talking like 35+ so I had a good relationship with them but no friendship at all, my second job I worked at a clothing labeling company it was even worse; only 40+ older ladies and besides the usual older ladies trying to flirt with me I didn't make a single friend. I go to the gym pretty constantly and from time to time I get to chit chat with some interesting people there but the gym is so big and my schedule so unpredictable that  I usually never see the same people like never. I went to my hometown for the holidays and stayed there for 2 months I loved being home man and I kind of wanted to stay but my brother still has 1 1/2 years of school and since we share rent he wouldn't be able to pay it himself. So I decided to go back with him.

My brother is always at school and when home is always studying and I just got used to the routine, we never go out on top of that he's pretty introverted more so than me I'd say (I'm kind of 60% introvert 40% extrovert) so when he is here we barely talk since he doesn't like talking when studying. I'm returning to school next semester and I hope I make some friends but in the meantime here I am 20 years old no friends. I got back from my hometown 10 days ago and I'm currently unemployed so there's days I don't even say more than a couple dozen words and after all this time I feel like I'm going nuts, seriously I sometimes write for myself just so that I have someone to talk to. I haven't talked to my old friends lately since I'm increasingly depressed and I know it might sound like I'm over exaggerating but even texting them just feels like it takes so much mental energy for me so I end up not replying back to their messages. I really want to stop feeling like this but feels like a really hard hole to get out of. How can I meet new people, feel less lonely and overall put myself in situations where I can at least talk to people? I'm currently looking for work right now what kind of job should I get? I'd really appreciate any advice thanks.

184,"for context, i’m AFAB, and i’ve known i was trans (agender) for a few years now. while i do feel neutrality fits me best, i’d prefer being seen/ treated as male if i _had_ to pick from the binary. that said, i present feminine, and haven’t done any visible medical transition (also no T). 

i bring all that up because i’ve been struggling a lot lately with social dysphoria. on top of just trying to gather the courage to get friends to use the right pronouns, i’m on my high school’s track team, which is lately causing me issues..

first off, changing. i do not use the women’s locker rooms, instead i go change in the bathroom. but even that is uncomfortable- normally when i go to the bathroom throughout the school day, i go when i know it’ll be empty. i really don’t have that opportunity in the 15 minutes i have between school’s end and track practice’s start. 

also, getting grouped in as a “woman” for racing. i’d rather come far in last and get to run in the men’s race than get grouped somewhere i’ve been wrongfully grouped for so long and have a better shot at winning. but i don’t think that’s a choice. and even if it were, people would just see me being allowed to run as pity for my _confused soul_

i’m also just so weak, the worst of almost all distance runners on my team. and i actually try.. it hurts a little to be honest. i almost want to start T to be strong and low voiced and all, but i’m short so transition to male would make me look shitty, and hell even if i did start T, i think i wouldn’t be allowed to be in sports at all probably. 

atop it all, only a few friends on my team know i’m trans. and i’m scared to tell my coach or anyone else- they’re all really nice and chill; honestly they’re like family and are the main reason i’m staying in the sport, but i don’t want to make a big deal out of anything.

at the same time, forcing myself to be “normal” to fit in is really taking a toll on my mental health (hence me trying to gain the courage to at least be more insistent with friends about pronouns)

does anyone have any advice on what i could do to improve my situation? i’m honestly at a bit of a loss right now :/ ",08Feb2019,1

I've been creating content on YouTube for a few years now. Mostly just for fun and to test out video edits. My content is usually about conspiracy theories and unsolved mysteries.

However, lately I've become more politically enlightened. I've come to recognize certain deep-rooted prejudices within myself. I find myself surrounded by people who don't trust vaccines, who support MLMs, who don't believe in global warming, are racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally bigoted. 

In college I've learned a lot about research, critical thinking, and reasoning. I've done a lot of research to find the true answers to these things, and really want to make videos about some of them. But I don't want everyone to hate me or to lose friends. The reason I started doing conspiracies was to encourage rational thought, and that's the core of the content I love to create.

So my question is, how can I make these videos, talking about things like ""What the Bible really says about homosexuality and how this applies to us"" and ""Why global warming isn't a matter of opinion"" without losing these people and getting the cold shoulder?

They said I was a filthy user and that I was horrible for trying to use someone for fame and things clicked. When someone finally mentioned Nico.

My other friends told me about this so the details are fuzzy. Nico thought I was using him to try and become these big account’s friends. He had told them about how I suddenly was texting and they called me into question.

I expected it to be kinda awkward, but it wasn't like that at all. I later thanked her for being upfront about the other guy and told her I had fun meeting up and she said she had fun too. So yeah. Didn't turn out exactly so planned, but what can ya do 

 've never done the tinder thing, so I'd say my expectations were about where they should be. But it went in the opposite direction I thought it would. I expected awkwardness and some discomfort, but it seemed like we immediately started clicking. She's so much more gorgeous than tinder makes her out to be, and it seemed like we had endless stuff to talk about. And I know I sound like I'm absolutely swooning for someone I've only met up with once, but it seems like that's somewhat expected when you've never been on a date. If this doesn't work out, it just seems like nothing else will come along, you know?

I'm in my junior year of college, so I feel like finding people to date will never be this easy again. I have no idea where my life is going because I'm starting to come to the realization that my major is above my mental capabilities, and I feel like my dating chances after college will be based on nothing more than my income. So I guess during this period could be my last opportunity for ""the one."" :/

**Tl;dr: Girl I orginally matched with on tinder and scheduled s date with starting talking to another guy somewhere in between. She said she wanted to see where it goes. We still got coffee and I thanked her for being upfront abou the other guy, and she said she had a good time and I'm not sure what I should do, if anything.**",08Feb2019,1

First time was a few weeks ago and she was giving me oral when I came so that wasn’t a big deal. This time though, Im not sure if I even came at all during sex. We were having sex in my car and after awhile I just started to. get less hard and eventually we stopped. I didnt feel like I came, but I’m so worried that I somehow came inside of her without feeling it, and it’s just a few days after her period and to my knowledge that’s the time when it’s most likely for a girl to get pregnant. We kept going for awhile after I wasn’t really hard anymore with oral so any leakage that might normally have been there for us to be able to check i feel like would be all gone from that. So i have no idea if i came in her or not but she’s not worried at all because she didn’t see anything when she checked herself and won’t go buy plan B even though i offered to pay for it.

200,"So I'm a 17-year-old guy (Considered an Adult at 16 in my country) and I'm turning 18 soon and I'm likely headed away from my country to attend college in the USA. I've been playing hockey for 6 years and I'm not amazing but it became a way for me to build some major confidence that I needed and my first hockey coach really helped me to do that. She coached my team when I was around 13 years old and we never won a game but the field became a place where I built confidence and really found my character.

&amp;#x200B;

So after 4 or 5 years since then, I found out that she's still teaching at my old school and is now happily married and still coaching the team. I'm trying to catch up with all my older teachers to say thank you and wanted to ask her out for coffee or lunch to thank her for helping me realize that hockey was the sport I would want to play in my life.  BUT it seems a bit strange cos there's only about an 8 year age difference between us and I don't want it to seem like I'm asking her out on a date or anything because she's married and I have no interest in pursuing a relationship with her or anything like that. I've been talking to my teachers on Facebook and found her profile but I'm hesitant to send a message and ask because this is the first teacher I'm meeting up with that happens to be a young female adult and it might seem a little ""I want to date you"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it wrong for me to ask her out for coffee or lunch to catch up or ok? Do I need to make it clear that I respect her marriage and don't want to pursue anything? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 17 year old Male, want to ask former hockey coach (Around 25 year old married female) from 4 years ago to coffee or lunch to thank her for making me realize hockey was the sport I was loved and where I found confidence and character. But Im worried it seems like I want to date her or anything which I really have no interest in because of her marriage.  (Questions right above TLDR)

209,"(Names in this are fake for my own privacy)

Please read this and give me advice, I don't know what to do.

I have a mom, dad, three older brothers, and one younger sister. As for myself, I'm a female, so I'm completely average, not doing especially good in anything really, other than sleeping. 

My brothers don't play a big part in this so I'll just tell you their names so it's easier, Gordon's the oldest and he's moved out, we have Tyler for second, and Evan as the third, Then there's me (Liaza), and my little sister Millie. 

Keep in mind that theres two parts to this.

&amp;#x200B;

So awhile back, I decided that I was going to stay up late on a school night, so as you'd expect, I had trouble waking up. On that day my dad had to go to work at 3 am, and my mom was the only one who could get me to school, so my mothers an assistant teacher, so she had to be at work at the same time I had to be at school. I hear my mom tell at my sister that they were leaving and then my sister asked; ""What about Liaza"". At this point, I had drowsily gotten up and was about to get ready when I hear my mom say something that made me freeze. 

""Who cares about her?"". So you might be thinking that she said it in the context of school or whatever, but the tone of her voice made me freeze, she said it, in the most nonchalant and disgusted tone I've ever heard. When I heard her say that, I was on the verge of tears, so I just did the only action that crossed my mind. I crawled back in bed. When my mom came home later I played it off as though nothing had happened, and kept a fake smile all day. Keep in mind that I'm a very soft-spoken person.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I managed to put what my mom said in the back of my mind and I carried on. So this next thing happened about a month after the incident with my mom. My sister speaks her mind and has a lot of guts, because of that, she never had many friends, so she and I were pretty close when we were little. This was in October and she went to a new school because she made so many enemies that she got bullied. When she went to her new school she quickly made friends, while I had started to lose friends. Millie began to bring her friends over every day, and it began to agitate my family rather quickly, Millie fed our food to her friends, let her friends puppy come over to poop and pee all over the house, she annoyed all of us pretty often. Me and my brothers got so annoyed that we spoke and each of us agreed to lock her out the next time she brought friends over, throughout the day we agreed on this, my brothers each warned her once, and I warned her twice. We gave her *four* warnings. The next day she brought a friend over. We all ignored her. Millie kept knocking (She doesn't have a key) and my brothers convinced me to open the window and tell her what's happening. I let her know and she got mad, so I ignored her (and yes I understand that we were being assholes). So after the whole ordeal, I got in trouble. I love my sister, don't get me wrong, when she was bullied I scared her bullies away. We were extremely close. But that night she said to me; ""I hate you! Fucking bitch!"". I walked into my room and started bawling my eyes out. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the whole reason I'm here is to ask for advice. I've become convinced that my mom and sister hate me, my dad is always busy with work and my brothers don't interact with me much at all. It was only ever my mom and sister. So I wanted to ask the internet if I could have some advice on what to do. ",08Feb2019,1

214,"So this story will definitely be long and convoluted. I'm gonna try and keep it vague. My life over the past few years has been very crazy. It mostly started when my parents found out I was smoking weed in high school. My mom said things to me then that were extremely insensitive over something so benign. It caused a rift between us, and broke my trust in them, even tho at the time I don't think they realized. After high school I got into a relationship with a girl from my area. My parents were initially cool with her, for the most part. However, as things progressed they became increasingly more and more dissatisfied with our relationship.

After a year of being together my partner and I had a son. We were both barely in our 20's at the time and so it wasn't ideal clearly, but my parents continued trying to get me to separate and just pay child support and such. I didn't listen because I don't think it'd be right. Also, my partner and I are of different races, so that is in my mind very pertinent here.

Anyway, my partner and I have been living together with our son for about 6 months now. I finally left my parents' house because of disagreements with them that became too much to bear with regards to my partner and our relationship. My relationship with my parents is damaged, to say the least. We've been back on speaking terms and have seen each other since the new year when we had dinner with my son, but that's the only time I've really seen them. Outside of that, it's been very infrequent conversations, and occasional text messages back and forth.

So today I get a call from my grandma while at work. I couldn't talk, so I didn't answer and I forgot to call back when I got home. Around 9 or 10 I got a text from my aunt saying we had to speak asap, and my partner got a call from her asking about me because someone had called my grandma impersonating me. Then my dad texted me saying if I didn't answer the phone he was going to send the police to my apartment. So I called him back. He told me that someone impersonating me called her and said I was in a different state and was in trouble and needed money. I explained that I was fine and hoped that my grandma didn't do anything to compromise her information, which she didn't.

That's when they kinda dropped a bomb on me and started asking questions about where I was and if I had any idea how it could've happened or who could've did it. Both my parents were on the phone, but my dad made it especially clear he thought me and my partner were in on it. He said it was a ""pretty big coincidence"" that the race of the fraud caller would match my partner and that they'd know my name. I said that's a ridiculous accusation to make and they said there was nothing ridiculous about it. My mom then said that I ""spend all my time with hoodlums"" which is false. In the past months I have only spent any time with my partner and our eighteen month old son. I have spent a little time with some old friends of mine who would never do such a thing to me or my family and that's it. 

I certainly would never just hand over my phone to someone who I thought would do something like this to my family. I explained myself to them, and they still sounded unhappy with me. They definitely believe my partner or my partner's family had something to do with this and the only reason they'd believe something like that is because of my partner's race. My partner holds no animosity towards them in spite of it all, and has even hoped that our son could one day have a healthy relationship with them, in spite of the differences which they so obviously cannot overcome.

I really just want to know of any ways that someone could've gotten ahold of my information or my grandma's information. They called her from a blocked number and said they were me, that they were in a different state, that they were in trouble and needed help and that I'd been physically injured. Then grandma asked what my father's name was and the caller hung up the phone. I know the basics of the internet. I don't go giving out information to websites and I steer clear of sketchy websites. I do however sometimes livestream sports and other such events. I figured maybe this is where it came from but I still don't understand how they'd have found my grandma's info. Please any help or advice is appreciated, I'm trying to not be wrongly accused and I'm trying to maybe someday give my son a real family nucleus with a normal relationship with his grandparents.",08Feb2019,1

217,"I’m in my 2nd semester of my 3rd year of university, and it is really wearing me down mentally. I feel depressed, anxious and unmotivated all the time. I cry pretty much every time I’m alone for more than a few hours, or just when I think about my situation for any meaningful amount of time. My grades have been gradually declining to the point where I hardly bother going to classes anymore, which adds more stress and anxiety but for some reason I can’t push past the draw to just stay in bed or in front of the tv, because I’m failing anyway so what’s the point? I want to get away from all of this, maybe not permanently but for longer than just a summer. I want to just focus on working and spending time with my family and friends. 

I don’t know how to talk to my mom about this. She’s worked so hard to get to the place of success she’s at now, and to allow her children to live well without struggling. She pays for everything; my tuition, rent for my near-campus apartment, all of my bills, etc. for which I feel extremely grateful, and guilty. I’m home with her and the rest of my family most weekends, and she fully expects me to stay at home for at least a year after I graduate to get my footing. I have a brother close to my age who also lives at home and struggles with his own mental health issues, which my mom is often worrying about. This whole time I’ve been telling her everything is fine, maybe letting her in on minor issues but not telling her just how deeply I’m being affected and how much I’m struggling. She always says she expects/hopes that I’ll be graduating on time, within 4 years, but I know that’s not happening now. She still thinks I just need to talk to the counselor and take a couple extra classes and it’ll all be fine. It won’t. 

I think the cracks are starting to show and she suspects something’s wrong, because she panics when she gets the slightest idea that I’m not happy there, like when I said “I’d rather be here (at home) than there (school)” when classes were canceled for a week due to extreme weather so I get to stay home. She knows I have some issues with anxiety and motivation, but I always deny having more serious problems because I don’t want her to worry. 

I have an extremely hard time with confrontation and opening up emotionally. I usually just start crying and can’t even get through what I want to say. It’s pathetic. The only person who really knows the extent of what’s going on is my cousin, who has encouraged me to talk to my mom about this and let her know that I need a break. 

I just feel so lost and hopeless. I don’t want to put more on my mom’s plate when she’s done so much for me and sank so much money into my education, and when she’s already trying to help my brother with his problems. It almost feels like it’s not my choice to make, to leave school, because I’m not the one sacrificing my money for it, but I am sacrificing my mental wellbeing. I don’t know if I can do this anymore, but I also don’t know if I can face my mom with this. I need help.

My wife was on birth control pills, and we had sex at least once every other day. There was a gap however while we were on vacation where she was not able to get a refill for a while. We continued having sex as normal though, as we thought the chances were just too low. Sound like a story a lot of you parents out there have too huh? Well my wife has a rare genetic condition that makes her to continue to bleed even while pregnant. We found this out because she had very very heavy bleeding after being back on pills for a bit. We took her to the doctor who informed us not only of the condition, but of the fact she had just recently had a miscarriage as well. Due to the birth control. She had been 3 months in. 

That was a month ago. We want kids. We have made an agreement to not go out of our way to try until a few more years, but if it happens it happens. I blame myself for not noticing. For thinking the bloating was some stomach or digestive issue, and convincing her it *for sure* was because she still had her period so that's what I believed. She blames herself for not noticing what was inside her own body. I think she might blame me for convincing her it wasn't anything serious. We both took it hard but..

Really at a loss here because we also dont want to buy a car from craigslist that will break down on us in the near future and put us back in this position (he's had both terrible and amazing luck buying cars from craigslist, and has never bought a car from a dealership). The easy ""solution"" would be to buy a beater from craigslist and save for a more reliable car, but it would be unwise to spend thousands of dollars on a car that might require expensive and unpredictable repairs in the future. If we go that route and the car breaks, we will be out $3000+ with very limited options, and would be back at square one, and realistically it would take years to save up for a car from the ground up. His job is in a very wealthy suburb with extremely limited to no public transportation. Taking ubers every day would hinder his ability to save for a car, and if he cant get to work he can't pay for stuff obviously. We have considered ""hiring"" an anonymous cosigner through services like Hire A Cosigner, because we definitely have a few thousand dollars to pay for it, but we are unsure about the legitimacy of these services. We have heard that smaller credit unions might be able to give him a loan but it's also a hassle to travel fron bank to bank with no transportation and limited free time.

my mum and dad do not know this happend and I kept it up the lie for years. 

Just a few days ago I had quite a bad PTSD attack and it got me thinking that if I was to have one around my parents they would be questioning why I'm having it, so I thought it might be time to tell them. 

my issue is I dont know how. 

I've decided to tell Mum that I need her to make sure dad is ok, as I feel he might get the most angry at himself as he hired him to work with him and brought him over to our home.

234,"So that everyone understands I’m 18 and still attempting to finish high school but my life over the past few years has been very hectic and complicated and I recently found out it completely my moms fault because she is extremely irresponsible with her money and every time something happens she lies to me about it. 

It started in my freshman year of high school when she left her now ex husband which I do admit I don’t regret because he treated me terribly, but because of this we moved in with my grandpa for almost a year, which was complicated because he lived far from my school and friends. 

Halfway through my sophomore year we moved into our own house and everything seemed great for a few months. At the very end of the summer before my junior year we got evicted from that house because she wasn’t making payments( which she tried to lie to me about and say she did make the payments) and I had to go live with her ex husband for a few months while she stayed with a friend .
 
While living with her ex husband, he got drunk and beat his dog with a shovel so I left his house the next morning with my dog and spent a few weeks at my aunts while my mom got us into another house. During this time I hurt my back and because everything was going on I didn’t get it checked out for awhile and began to get worse and worse.

After we moved into our new house, which she made me and friends move everything into despite my injured back. I found out a had a bulging disk and sciatica and asked my mom to call and make me appointments so i can get it fixed, I thought that she was trying to make me the appointments but turns out she just wasn’t doing it for some reason. I found this out over the next few years as she almost never made me appointments to help me fix my back despite her always asking me to do things. 

After about 4 months in that house we got evicted again because she didn’t make payments and she lied to me about that one as well even though some one came to our door and literally handed me an eviction notice. We put our stuff in storage and moved in with a friend of hers and we’re sill living there almost a year later. I honestly don’t know where her money is going ( drugs?) but I’m tired of her irresponsibility and lying affecting me and my little sister, but the ting doesn’t even end there.

Sometime while living in the second she took a loan out on her car, which I drove most of the time, and while at my girlfriends house some one took the car, at first I thought it was stolen( that’s what she told me and what made sense at the time as I didn’t know about the loan)but turns out it was repossed and she let me believe I basically lost the car. Oh and remember how all our stuff was in storage? She told me that there was a fire at the storage facility and that we lost all our stuff, turns out she didn’t make payments and everything was auctioned off. 

And another thing to add on is that throughout all this my grandpa had been helping us whenever he could whether it was letting us use his truck to move or lending us money, and when he went to confront my mom about the lies she told him to never contact her again. 

I’m sorry that this post was super long i just didn’t want to leave any thing out, but I need honest answers on what to do because I have no idea what to do. I want to confront her but I don’t know how she will react. I hate to say it but I honestly don’t respect her anymore and I definitely can’t trust her. Any suggestions on what to do or what not to do is greatly appreciated.

I'm not quite sure where to post this and I'm not quite sure if I'm stupid for thinking that my case would be sexual abuse. Throwaway cause I don't wanna seem like a retard and don't wanna be insensitive to what I would consider actual abuse victims.

So let me start off with this: When I was like 11-12 I would use the internet and back then a chat software named ICQ was hugely popular with everyone at my school so of course I used it daily. And I also used to go to their websites chatrooms where you can talk to strangers. So after a while I would become friends with this ""girl"" and after a while you know we started talking about more sexual stuff. And after a while it was like we were a couple and 11 year old me didn't think of the possibility that it wouldn't be an actual girl.

So the person asked me for nudes and would sent me some of ""her"" (which I a few years later found out where just pictures of some girl ripped from the internet). And after a while I would keep sending her nudes and videos and I was so stupid for not realizing it was just some pedophile tricking me into sending him pictures and videos. And it just makes me sick knowing that these probably still exist somewhere.

Now over the years I had issues with coming to terms with this and I never really considered it being sexual abuse until recently, but I'm still not sure if it really is. I have never ever talked to anyone about this.",08Feb2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

A little more background. I've always been kind of an existentialist and wondered the meaning of life many times over. Always thought of the possibility of an afterlife (heaven-ish type) and of the possibility of nothingness. However, it was not until a while ago that the possibility of nothingness became one of my true core beliefs. This happened a while after my best friend died in a car accident. It was absurd and meaningless. This accident rippled into my life, and  I entered a period in which nothing made sense, life literary lost meaning, and I had recurring and long panic and anxiety attacks on the idea of nothingness and the meaninglessness of life. I even started to question if the world itself and everything around me was real. I thought I was becoming insane. So after thinking and questioning myself I made up a meaning for my worldly experience, which it to make the most out of it, be present, love life (as cliche as it sounds) and to try and be my best self. However, if we die and then there is nothingness, where is the transcendence in life? I know I can't prove or disprove theories on what happens after death but I just wanted to know how do fellow redditors with similar beliefs cope with the idea of transcendence if there is absolutely nothing after life.

First of all, english is not my first language so excuse me for some imperfections. This is the first time in many years I write something longer than few lines of text. Enough of excuses.   
Let me start of by saying that I have met a beautiful woman over the internet sometime around 2 years ago. Everything was going great, For the next 18 months I spent every penny from my wages to travel to Germany just to spend a weekend with her. Around 6 months ago she moved to my country to live with me. She came from a difficult family where  abuse, screaming was on a daily basis. Ever since she moved in she was screaming every day for towards me about stupid things. For example. One day, leaving work she was trying to put on her jacket, I asked her to hand me her backpack so I can hold it for her, so I can help her. I got screamed at that she can do it herself, she doesnt neeed help. The next day, same situation I dont even ask her, not wanting repeat from yesterday, I got screamed at because I would not help her. I know its stupid... but I wanted to tell you about one of many situations like this. Back to story, ever since she moved in I understood screaming for her was natural because of family. I tried talking to her for first 2/3 months every time she screamed. Unfortunately it did not stop. That is the time I started runing away with my problems into gambling. I used to leave my house, sit in the park and play online blackjack / slots, spending most of my wages to the point that I was spending around 300 euro weekly. Might not be much but I only earn 1700 euro per month. With that I must pay rent and eat for whole month.   
20 minutes before the creation of this post I had a talk with my girlfriend, that she is unhappy with me, (we might break up soon) we went into seperate rooms. What did I do?? I played slots and lost nearly my entire months salary...

To be honest I dont know if any of this makes sense, I just feel terrible, I feel like giving up on everything around me, just wanted to scribble some nonsese to someone. Any tips regarding gambling problems?

She once said that her little brother gets his blond hair from ""his father"" then her brother responded with ""he's yours too"")

- Jaz told me that her old sister (let's call her Dani) is transgender (from male to female). Then six months later, her sister gave birth to a child. YES, you read that correctly, this girl claims that she has a transgender sister who naturally conceived a child and pushed him out of her vagina. I decided to humour her and ask how this is possible. Her response was ""she had surgery, she now has a full female reproductive system"". Oh, wait there's more. I stalked her sister's facebook page only to find that her sister Dani has Endometriosis (a condition where tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside the uterus) and has had many surgeries to repair the damage. 

- Jaz says that her sister Dani has two other children (twins in fact). So I asked, ""how is this possible If she only had the 'surgery' recently?"". Her response was ""surrogacy"". (Debunked, because Dani's entire Instagram is filled with her baby boy and ZERO of these 'twins'. I also asked, ""who do these twins live with?"" And apparently, they're in England with their father)

- another, she used to claim to have a personality disorder (the same one that the guy from split had) and she even had names for these people!) She soon gave up on that lie (never actually admitting to it, just letting it go). 

Again, these lies have been told over the course of the 5 years that I've known here --- along with many many others. 

Here are some honourable mentions: 

- Jaz claiming that her sister Dani is divorced (debunked: when I told her that I need to interview someone single whose parents are divorced then she responds with ""interview my sister"" and I was like ""isn't she divorced"" then she shrugged and said ""we were technically never married"")

- claiming that her older brother plans to purpose to his girlfriend then the next day saying that they're on their honeymoon (Debunked: when I asked: ""didn't they just get engaged?"" She was like ""...oh, I lied last time, I couldn't tell you that they got married"") 

- claiming that she has been diagnosed with mild depression and takes meds for it, but goes days without taking it (debunked: I've been around SOOO MANY people who are on antidepressants and if they miss a day they're sooo unwell). 

Anyway, does anyone have any advice on what I should do about this so-called 'friend'? I'm genuinely concerned for her mental health like I literally know no one who acts this way at the age of 17. ",08Feb2019,1
264,"Long story short—

*i just got married

*i could no longer live with my mom because she was charging me and my husband WAY too much for rent and I had just started a new job so our budget was already way too tight when we agreed that she’d allow us to save money but ended up charging rent then raising it more. It was getting ridiculous sooo...

*we moved into my husbands parents house (yes we talked to them before moving in lol)

*first night there and I already felt uncomfortable. I’m the type of person to get mini panic attacks when I’m out of my comfort zone. Same thing happened to me when I went to my first sleepover. 

*also first night there I showered. My husband had texted me (before I got in) that he was going to the store. I said okay. So when I got in the shower, my husband was not home. The parents were still at work along with his sister. The 2 young brothers (seniors in high school) were the only ones there.

Now that you’re caught up, here’s what happened...

*One of the Brother knocks on door*
Me: yeah?
Him: *mumble*
Me: Im sorry i cant hear you!
Him: are you in the shower?
Me: *nervously* uhmmm............yeaahhh?? As I think to myself “I know he hears this water running 😒”
Him: can I come in?
Me:......
Him:......
Me:.....uhm....
Me:.....sh-...suree??

Okay pause! Some of you may think “why didn’t you just say no?!”
Because I wasn’t sure how his house worked. I wasn’t sure if this was the only bathroom he could use and I assumed maybe he just really had to go?
I have a habit of giving people the benefit of the doubt. So I assumed maybe he just really had to go and if there was other bathrooms he could use, then he probably would have avoided the one I was in the the first place? 

Okay back on topic!

*heard him come in and closes door*
*then I heard pee in toilet sound*
My head: *panic attack because I started to feel very uncomfortable*
Him: it might get hot when I flush
Me:.....O- okay...
*flushes then leaves*

That’s all that happened.

This happened 5 days ago. I just told my husband today. He thought it was weird that I kept it secret but I told him because I knew that he’d confront him and I didn’t want to make it awkward. He said no, that was very inappropriate and he knows better.
Me and my husband are both 23 by the way. 

Also: I was inappropriately touched by my male cousin when I was 15. He was in his late 20’s at the time. So that incident has made it very hard for me to get comfortable in places that are not my own and my husband knows this. So he promised he’d leave it alone but if he does it again, he will take action. 


My question is...
1) was it wrong for me to tell my husband not to confront his brother? 

2) do you think the brother had other intentions or thoughts? I don’t know what goes on in A mans head like how I know what goes on in a girls head. ",08Feb2019,1
265,"Hi there, everyone.

So, as it says in the title, I am messy. My room is usually covered in clothes and papers and stuff (though no food, as I hate rodents). Whenever I try to clean, I struggle and end up stopping, even when I try to force myself through.

I've been going through a depression for a while. I'm on medication, but I need to up the dose and I haven't yet. I'm sick a lot and I usually just lay in bed and draw, which is the only thing that brings me pleasure besides ice skating.

My father and I are dysfunctional and my mom and I are close, but she works a lot. My family and friend lives are very poor and dull. 

I would like to know if me hating to clean is just me being lazy, or if it's a depressive state or something. Also note that I am autistic, usually appearing in my vocalization, pronunciations, and movement (I'm very twitchy and shrink myself as much as I can). I'm also very physically weak, because I can't handle the texture of a lot of proteins (mostly meats, last time I had chicken I threw up from the texture) and I feel tired a large majority of the time.

Is there a way to fix this? Thanks for any help you can offer.",08Feb2019,1
266,"I have a friend, or I guess I HAD a friend, who I was close friends with for just about 3 years now. Me and him have been really close since then. However, just last Sunday, he decided to, I guess ""dump me"" as a friend out of nowhere for a bit of an odd reason. So, last Wednesday, I texted him, ""Hey, do you wanna hang out on Saturday?"" It was a routine session of me asking him to hang out, nothing we hadn't done before, and he said Yeah. I told him to meet me at 1. So, it was Saturday, it was 1 PM, he was not there. I texted him, ""You coming?"" No response. I texted him 30 minutes later asking him again, and he replied saying, ""You need to chill out for a minute."" I assume he didn't want me to repeatedly text him, I can understand. Then, my mom comes in asking me to go to the store with her. I told her my friend was coming, but I didn't know when. She wanted me to text him to ask him. I was a bit nervous given he told me to ""chill out"", but I did anyway. I texted him a little bit more, he never responded or showed up, so I gave up. I gave him one more text that night saying, ""Not sure why you were so unresponsive. But if you felt I was texting you too much, I'm sorry."" Cue one day later, Sunday night. Another friend of mine said they wanted to hang out on Monday, and I said, ""Ok, I'll text (insert friend's name here) and ask."" This was probably a bad idea all things considered, but I didn't think of that at the time. Especially with what happened next...he blocked me. Not just on Snapchat which is what I used to text him before, on all social media. He then texted my other friend saying he didn't want be my friend anymore. 

Ok, I get it, maybe I texted him a bit too much...but cutting me off completely after being bascially best friends for 3 years? Seriously? And here's the thing...I texted him a lot on Saturday because he was supposed to be at my house, and I needed to know if he was still coming, especially since my mom wanted me to go to the store with her. Trust me, I mostly only text him once or twice a week, I'm not a usual ""overtexter"" or whatever. I think he severely overreacted to the situation. 

So now here's the big question I'm facing...do I want to keep being friends with this person? My friend...I love him. Just as a friend of course, but I really loved him like a brother, like family. We've been close friends for 3 years, so I hate the idea of losing him. The last few days since this last Sunday have been hard knowing he seemingly hates me now or something. I hate knowing that. So of course I want him back as my friend. There's nobody else out there like him, he's one of the most unique people I know, I loved having him as my friend. But...he did decide to drop me off as friend after 3 years for a pretty stupid reason. Should I really want to keep being friends with him after that? And me and him faced a similar situation less than a year ago. In June 2018, we got into a bit of an argument over something, he blocked me, and our friendship was over and done with until October 2018, where I asked one of my friends if they would text him and say that I'm sorry about what happened before and if we could be friends again. Sure enough he responded well, and me and him went on being friends again like nothing happened. Jump ahead 4 months later, and now we have this situation. Some people are telling me to not be friends with him anymore. As a matter of fact, I asked the friend who helped try and get him back before, to try to talk to him about me, and they refused because ""I'm not doing this again, you need to stop being friends with him."" And maybe they're right, they probably are right.

It's just that...he was my best friend, and for 3 years too. And like I said, he's a really awesome, unique person, and I felt really lucky to be his friend. The idea of not having him as a friend anymore is really painful to think of. But, again, this is the 2nd time he's decided to drop me as a friend in less than a year, and this time was for a pretty dumb reason. I don't want to let go of him as my friend, but I think he may've made the decision for me. 

One of my friends said they would try to talk to him about me if I so chose. Should I go ahead with I guess the ""operation"" to get him back? And if so...when should I do it? I have three people who have three different opinions. One person thinks I should not be friends with them at all, one person thinks I should try again but give him time, maybe even an entire month or two, to cool down, and another person thinks I should try again with him but do it now, because waiting too long would be too ""weird"". So, my three options are this:

Option 1: Don't try to be friends with him ever again.

Option 2: Try to get him back as my friend, but wait a little bit, a couple weeks to a couple months, to give him time to cool off.

Option 3: Try to get him back as my friend now, waiting too long wouldn't work.

What do you guys think? ",08Feb2019,1
267,"Greetings reddit!

I have an odd situation at work, and I can't decide how I should take it. Here's the back story;

I'm in my early 30's, I work in IT, I'm great at it (a little self horn tooting but I feel it's worth it occasionally :P ), I started about two years ago, in early 2018 I had a Hemorrhagic Stroke whilst on site. Was taken to hospital and informed of what had occured. A bombshell to say the least. I returned to work six weeks afterwards. 

Granted... I know now it was stupid and way too soon to return, given average recovery is 8-12 weeks, but I was determined... and I felt pressured by my manager to work remotely and hurry back... I thought as I'm also one of the lucky few who have almost no long term side effects. Which is great... this shows I should be able to head back promptly...

Ever since, my manager has questioned my competency in almost everything, questioning my memory (which isn't affected, barring a day or so either side of incident - medically normal), making regular quips to ""are you sure? before you wouldn't have suggested that"", challenging my decisions, changing them to department and company detriment then blaming me, or ""come on, you were the password master, you knew every password we use off the top of your head, did it all fall out?"" ""what else have you forgotten since eh?"" the best one was in front of almost 150 other employees during a company wide meeting the projector encountered some technical issues and got ""Don't ask him for support, he's probably forgotten it all"" (cue laughter from a number of people) and another bash on my ever dwindling confidence... 

Now humorously, I get some of it... (I'm all for the occasional stroke joke - contextually appropriate of course) but remember, if your told something again and again, with regularity... you start to believe it... this is daily, multiple times... and I've begun to question my own memory, my skills even my personality... looking for anything that has changed... pushing myself to remember everything possible... My wife says nothing has changed, I was weird for a few months afterwards but seem back to normal. Now I trust her, but I don't want her to know I'm doubting myself... 

Should I continue to try ignoring it, mention it (informally / formally) and ask it to stop, leave the company, develop telekinesis and screw with him (would be nice but unlikely :(  )?

Any suggestions, comments or thoughts? 

Thanks in advance :)",08Feb2019,1
268,"I apologize in advance for how long this is; but there’s a lot to it. I’m just hoping if I can get some perspective from someone in the medical/psych field to see if I have any grounds to stand on in terms of helping my sister more formally..

 I’m worried my mother (43) has Münchausen syndrome and is using it to emotionally abuse my younger sister (16). I’m in my mid twenties and out of the house, but I hear from the both of them quite often while they’re fighting with one another. Additionally I see them separately on occasion so I can kind of hear either of their stories pretty regularly. 

To begin, my mother had breast cancer when I was my sisters age and it was a long, grueling process of pain and recovery. She had a double mastectomy, radiation, chemotherapy and then on top of that- full reconstruction. Now she has to have hormone replacement and other anti-cancer fighting injections every couple months or so to combat the chance of it coming back. It’s a lot to deal with for any person but she’s a very strong woman. Since she’s been proclaimed cancer free, she’s been hyper involved with cancer support groups and those peoples lives. She frequently says things like “I’m living with cancer” even though she’s been out of it for years and there’s a small chance of it coming back. 

One day, for her work, she had to get vaccinated against measles and shingles. And people who have had (i’m getting this from what she told me her doctors told her) chemo and radiation are not supposed to be getting live virus vaccines because their body cannot fight it off. She ended up having the shingles virus enter her brain? (this is what I was told)  and cause nerve damage. I do know for a fact she went to the doctors a lot complaining of nerve damage and facial numbness. She also did have a mouth rash. (lots of different ailments were going on at this time- she told me she got a mouth herpes outbreak because of irritation caused by some extensive dental work she was having done) This was an ongoing issue for a while, and an issue that she says still gives her trouble. 

Now, a couple months ago my mom got in a car accident where another driver hit her from the side and totaled her car. She ended up in the hospital with a concussion, a cracked sternum and bruises and what not. She was put on bedrest and told not to drive or look at screens while she recovered. However, she did look at screens and drive to some extent (I was told this by my new step-dad) About  a month went by then bought a new car and  been easing her way into driving for work again. Now the other day, she called my work in the middle of my busy shift and was crying- telling me she passed out while driving, and that the cars looked like they were going the wrong way on the highway, that she was having migraines and that I needed to lyft to her to come pick her up. When I got there she seemed alright, although distressed and apologetic and asked if I’d drive her to the doctors appointment she already had scheduled. I did. I stayed and then i drove her home. 

Now, these are just the few big examples I have or her ongoing medical issues. Please note that every time I talk to my mom she brings up her health, my health, anxiety, my sister and her relationship with my sister.  

Since my mom has moved from the suburbs and into the city to be closer to work, my sister needs to be driven to school (that’s still in the suburbs) by my mother. Most days my sister is either bought a Lyft for school or will stay near her school with friends. However, any time she doesn’t- my mom gets very angry with her and blames her for making her drive her to school. She tells my sister things such as “You are the reason I got cancer”, “every time you argue with me I get a headache”, “driving you every day is what caused me to get into a car accident” etc. And then she punishes her by threatening to ground her for weeks, ripping her out of student body or her academic extra curriculars, or even school altogether (I mean like, she’s not allowed to go to school because she’s in trouble). 

My sister got her license a couple months ago in hopes she would be able to drive herself to school, but unfortunately or coincidentally the car my mom gave her broke down within a month and my mom says she cannot fix it at this time. Resulting in her having to be driven... 
I really want to stress, there has not been any gap whatsoever since my mom was diagnosed with cancer that she hasn’t had some “life threatening” illness or issue. 

This is just the mere surface of a lot of an issue, but you get a general idea. Please if you have any advice or I can add anything to supplement the information given please ask. Thank you in advance. ",08Feb2019,1

Anyways, about a week ago my friend and i got into a series of fights and she ended up blocking me on all platforms. She meant everything to me and i would always message her and ask her for advice/memes/homework help 24/7. However, the source of our fighting was another girl who was so socially awkward that my friend had devoted too much time and effort to her and ended up making me feel like she didn’t care for me at all. Fast foward a week, I have been suffering severe anxiety, depression, and constant suicidal thoughts because she genuinely meant the world to me and i couldn’t believe she chose to block me in a matter of 2 days. Hesterday, she unblocked me for the first time and told me that, although she doesn’t hate me, she thinks i’m too dramatic and that, by being my friend, she would automatically be dragged into the drama that i was apart of. In my personal opinion, I genuinely do not think I’m as dramatic as she says I am, but even if i do overreact sometimes, it’s because i was in 2 abusive friendships over a year ago that i still hadn’t recovered from. 

So the main problem is that she thinks i’m a liability and therefore wants to refrain from talking to me, despite not hating me or anything. Reddit, what the fuck do i do? I want to convince her that i’m not overdramatic at all and that my abuse is the core foundation of all this drama i’m supposedly in, but idk how to.

283,"**TLDR: any quick tips on being tougher and allowing yourself to react quicker and in a heroic way?**

I’m 30M and live in tough NY. We all love watching people get what they deserve in videos online, like tough guys defending a stranger in public (verbally too), or generally doing something “strong and heroic”.

I’ve been practicing to be stronger emotionally and a quicker thinker for the past year (making small progress too). My main downfall is I overthink, to the point where I may not react to something when maybe I should. This is taking me time to improve, mostly because these things don’t happen every day.

I don’t think my downfall is not wanting to do the right thing or anything like that. It’s not that I’m physically weak either, it’s all mental. I have grown up minding my own business, convincing myself that I shouldn’t intervene since “I don’t know the whole picture”, but I want that to change. I want to do good, for myself and for others. I bring positivity to the people around me verbally, and now I want to do it through my actions too. I learned about “bystander apathy”, and I want to be the one to break that loop.

(It’s where people are more likely to do nothing when there are more people around, and everyone sees everyone else not doing anything. Same concept as: if you speak up, you make it easier for the next person to speak up. Not sure if the phrase is common knowledge, but I know we’ve all been there.)

One thing for which I’m proud of myself: a few months ago I saw a parked car get hit-and-run by a tractor trailer. Fender benders happen here a lot, but this was extreme, so I took a ton of photos including ones of the drivers/plates/company name, and went to a store to ask for some paper and a pen to leave a note for them, saying that they can contact me for the evidence. I want to keep improving my willingness to go out there for people like that, and continuously set new bars for myself until it’s second nature.

Living in NY can be shitty sometimes, and ultimately if I am or if someone is wronged, I want to be able to count on myself to do something about it *every* time, not just once in a while (which is where I’m at now thankfully so far).

I know I can change, I just need direction—things to keep in mind in the moment and to be prepared with every day. Does anyone else have similar thoughts, or tips for someone like me? Thanks very much for reading this unexpectedly long post.",08Feb2019,1

FOMO. fear of missing out. my colleague is now in Mexico working from there for two months (we have a remote job). i have a friend now in Thailand for two months with his wife and kids. also working from there. have another friend who just left for holiday for a month to Sri Lanka and New Zealand. how to overcome this? feel all these people around are having all this fun and i’m missing out. i get to travel myself here and there but when i’m not i get this feeling. i suppose i could travel and do the same since i can work remotely but don’t really wanna leave my wife and cat so long. just seems these people off traveling all the time are only having good times. exploring new things. everything new. maybe it’s all a delusion. hmm. ,08Feb2019,1
288,"first off, this may be quite long. I apologize. The TLDR is at the bottom. 


I’ve truly gotten myself into some SHIT. Ok,...to start off, my bf and I have been together for 5 years. We recently had a baby, and I moved into his home. It was everything I dreamed of. Everything. The man I love, and our precious baby boy. A perfect house for us to raise him in. I wasn’t working (stay at home mom) so I spent my days playing/caring for our son, doing laundry, cooking, the usual. 


The thing is, things weren’t always this great...I’ve struggled with extreme anxiety for YEARS. Literally ever since I can remember. I quit cross country in middle school because I didn’t want to be looked at. Noticed. I passed up a modeling opportunity because I was too nervous to go, I’ve even missed court because I couldn’t leave the house. I hate being seen. I feel like I carry myself awkwardly, and I feel like I wear failure like one may wear a trench coat. 

People can smell my insecurity.

And yes, fear is a bird that believes itself into extinction, because I am dying. 


Slightly dramatic, but it’s how I feel. If you haven’t noticed by now. 


This led to depression, clearly. So now I’ve acquired both anxiety as well as depression. Quite the lovely cocktail if you ask me. /s


 Anyways, I turned to drinking as my outlet. More so, comfort blanket. I couldn’t find doctors who would prescribe me what truly helped-Xanax-(I’ve been on it before) many psychiatrists tried anti depressants as well as non-narcotic anxiety meds, to no avail. So, FINALLY, I found a doctor who actually would hear me out. 


She prescribed me Klonizapam. Which actually helped. I could
go on runs during the day, take my son outside, go places, run errands. You know, normal shit people who don’t have the spirit animal of a chihuahua. Anyways, let me get to the point. The drinking. 


Well, my doc eventually took me off of the anxiety medication. I couldn’t fucking believe it. So, all of the anxieties started flooding back, and I had no way to quell it. 




I couldn’t drink considering I had my son, but his grandmother was planning on taking him with her on a trip, so maybe I could relax a little. This was a mistake. It was my bfs friends birthday the day they were supposed to come home. People were drinking the night before so there were still quite a few beers left over. Well, my depressed, anxious Eeyore ass decided it wouldn’t hurt if I had a couple beers before they got back later that day, calm my nerves and whatnot. People drink wine with their children around all the time, I’m not going to get wasted.” Is what I told myself to not feel guilty. Truly, I just wanted these feelings to go away. 


WORST IDEA OF MY LIFE. 


So, yea. Basically, I drank myself stupid and his mom found me asleep, on my bfs bed when they got back. She even dug through the trash and found the beer cans. They kicked me out. The only reason I even have 2 more days before I’m homeless is because she’s gone so I can stay here until she gets back Sunday. I’M FREAKING OUT. 


I don’t have any lifelines. I can’t beg for forgiveness to stay here. My parents aren’t going to help me. About 6 months ago, I attempted suicide and alcohol was involved. Depression is one hell of a bitch. So, you can see why I’m not supposed to drink. And everyone is adamant about that which I totally disregarded thinking it wouldn’t be a big deal. No one would know if I had what, 3 beers. I thought. But we all know how that turned out...Also, she called my case worker and told him the situation, so they said I can’t reside there anymore. 


Of course, the most devastating part of all of this is my poor son. This is where I’m most conflicted. Should I just leave? He won’t remember me, and his father will find a better woman to be his mother figure. God, it sounds so fucked up, but he really deserves better than me. I’m thinking I could stay, go to a shelter or halfway house, get a job, get my shit straight and at least have a chance at getting my family back. I’m just so damn discouraged. I don’t even have a car. Or any money. I’m literally starting from scratch. Can I even succeed? Am I capable of this at all? Will I be in and out of his life? How can I even work with this anxiety? 


Or do I run? 


Find a new city, stay at a shelter there, save up for an apartment, and let everyone live their lives in peace without having the burden of me.

TLDR: Basically ruined my life, lost my family by drinking and now facing homelessness in the next 2 days. I’m not certain if I should try to get better where I’m at, or if I need to just pack a bag and go to a new city, ultimately, leaving everyone behind until/IF I get my shit straight. ",08Feb2019,1
289,"Hello, This is a kinda weird first Reddit post for me but, I need some clarification. 

I am a male, I'm 14, but people say that I look very feminine, and when I grew out my hair, a lot of people thought I was a girl, I even had another boy tell me that they had a crush on me because they thought I was a girl. I know I'm a boy but, I really liked the Idea that people thought I looked like a girl, Is this how being trans works? Or am I just overthinking it?",08Feb2019,1
290,I've been lying to friends and family about my enrollment in software engineering. Truth is I dropped out after the first year because I attended close to no classes. I'm meant to graduate in one year and my parents have been pressuring me to get an internship. Everyone i know thinks I'm in engineering. I'm living with my parents because it's cheaper and I will pretend to go to univeristy for classes but I would just chill in the library or elsewhere. How do i even begin to get over this?,08Feb2019,1
291,So In 2016 I got married to someone I’ve known since middle school. Well I was in the military and found out I was deploying during the time we initially planned to get married so we moved it up and just got married in a courthouse in March of 2016. Well while I was deployed she found a dog she wanted to get in a different state which was actually near her hometown. Well she has always had family problems but her ex’s mom and her had a good relationship so she just decided to stay with her during her visit to get the dog and visit friends. Well her ex stayed there a night while she stayed there. (He was living with his dad) well one night she was taking a shower and he went in and he wanted to have sex with her. Well she ended up letting him do it. She tells me it’s because she was scared he would get mad. And at this time I was deployed on the other side of the world. She waited a week to tell me. And since then even after I’ve tried talking to her about it. I just can’t seem to get over it. I told her to tell the cops or something but she refused. They are still friends but don’t ever hang out. I just can’t seem to feel like it’s entirely accurate that she didn’t want him to but I wasn’t there so I can’t be 100% sure... and it still ticks me off and makes me depressed sometimes. I just can’t seem to get over it and I don’t want to bring it up to tell her it hurts cuz she will get mad. I just don’t know how to go about trying to forget about it entirely,08Feb2019,1

293,"A note before my story:

* Sorry that this is quite long. I will include some short ""tl;dr"" at the very end, but I believe the longer version is more coherent.
* This is actually my first post on Reddit ever (technically second, since it's not possible to crosspost from the place where I posted this first). So please forgive me, if I messed up anything.
* I marked this as NSFW, since some details of this story are only suitable for adult readers.
* Keep in mind that this is not all of the shit that happened to me, as I ommited stuff which could give out anybody's personal information.
* Please forgive me for language fuckups (constructive criticism is very welcome tho). I'm not a native english speaker and while english is the language I think in and use like 95% of time, I still learned it mostly because I'm a gamer, programmer and an avid wikipedia reader - so while my scientific/gaming vocabulary is probably okayish, I may lack a lot of writing skills and day-to-day vocabulary. You know, things like the name of that plastic thingies wrapped around the kitchen countertops' edges, the ""pockets"" in cars where one can put maps and similar words which are not used that much on the internet. So, sorry if my meh writing skills or vocabulary make it hard to read, it wasn't my intention (◞ ‸ ◟ㆀ)
* I want to apologize in advance, if my estimates regarding economy of transitioning in different countries and attitudes towards LGBT community are off. I'm not an expert on such calculations nor on sociology and I didn't even leave my country in over 10 years (it costs money and I had more important needs, so), which means that my knowledge of such stuff is mostly based on various government statistics and such. I know that it's not like life elsewhere is magically better or anything (especially since cost of living is higher). But I guess statistics about LGBT tolerance, purchasing power, etc. indicate that while things aren't revolutionary better, there are definitely visibly better elsewhere. I am also super sorry if I inadvertently offended anybody, my social skills are not really great and I may say dumb things from time to time. Sorry if this is the case here and there.
* Also, sorry for bothering anybody with this. I just felt I have to ask for some advice/support or just rant, because my situation feels so hopeless I sometimes can't cope with it anymore. I am aware that other people have much bigger problems and mine aren't that terrible, but for me they are way over my strength limit. I don't think I will suicide, since I almost tried doing it so many times (and always chickened out in the end) that I don't believe I have the guts to do it - but still, even if I don't think my life is in danger, every second of it still fucking hurts. So I thought venting or asking for some advice/comfort/support may be a good idea.

Ok, so I happened to be born in Poland - which is one of the states of the former Soviet Bloc and also a pretty damn religious country. Both are not really good for LGBT community:

* Being former Soviet Bloc country means that a lot of former worker class was marginalized after the state transitioned to capitalism (since they weren't needed as much as during the communism era). This resulted in a lot of young males becoming aggresive hooligans, most of them also very opposed to the LGBT community. Some of them even joined various far-right organisations, one of which actually even managed to legally register [this (text: ""faggoting ban"")](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plik:Anti_Gay_Sticker-Narodowe_Odrodzenie_Polski.jpg) as an one of their symbols. AFAIK, court of higher instance overruled this - but still, it's horrifying that it has happened in the first place  (ʘ言ʘ╬)
* Being a pretty damn religious country (mostly Catholic to be more precise) means that well, not only the aggresive young males and ordinary LGBT-phobes are a problem, but a lot of seemingly normal people is fueled with hate towards everything that seems alien as well. Media talks where people casually use hate speech are pretty common and there is very little that can be done about it. Even as an atheist I don't feel welcome here, the currently ruling party pretty much produces propaganda about male-female family being the pinnacle of human existence and even something as stupid as me wearing anime merch causes A LOT of stares on the streets. I don't even want to imagine people reactions to a trans person.

I guess you can see where this is going. I wouldn't feel safe even wearing a rainbow pin or bracelet on the street, out of the fear that somebody will be violent towards me as a result, let alone transitioning here.

There are some trans people in Poland and I deeply admire their bravery, but I am not brave. I'm terribly worn out by life, scared and weak. I just wish to transition and be a girl one day, find myself a boyfriend or girlfriend (or both  (●♡∀♡)), dress colorful, smile and make others smile, do a lot of blowjobs and hopefully drink gallons of cum. Or maybe end up in some heart-warming lesbian relationship, like the ones from yuri anime, if any girl will ever want me lol. I just want to move somewhere where I won't be batshit scared to even ask somebody about their sexual orientation (in fear of them attacking me) or to ask somebody out on some dating site (in fear of meeting somebody being dangerous, if they are a trolling transphobe/homophobe). I don't want to be forced to look at my awful male body, dress like male and sound like male. I don't want people assuming that I'm male and expecting me to be male in bed. Of course this last one is maybe not that big of a problem, since I'm just avoiding dating for that very reason, but then avoiding dating becomes a problem... I just want to live a happy calm life, not a rich or famous one, I couldn't care less about this crap. I just want to live somewhere where I can start working towards transition and where I will be able to safely find a person who will accept me (FFS, I'm a cat, cats need milk (๑•﹏•)⋆ and yet here I can't ask anybody to feed me).

&amp;#x200B;

My life generally was pretty shitty in many ways, I almost died quite a few times (because of other people aggression, medical issues, me almost killing myself) and of course I was abused quite a few times by people who found it funny to toy with a weak, shy and insecure person like me. There were a few things though which were burned into my memory and still hurt, even after so many years. Of course I don't hold a grudge, I don't feel any need for revenge or seeking justice - I believe revenge is pointless, stupid and only feeds the hate fuel back to the society. And I think bringing people to justice after so many years, even if it was possible, doesn't make any sense - people change really fast and I don't believe in hunting them for sins of the past. But that doesn't mean those things didn't scar me and make my current life much more difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To start off, my family situation was far from perfect. One of my parents happened to be seriously mentally ill, which resulted in me and other family members being in constant fear of our lives. I had my property damaged, witnessed arguments, psychotic states, violence, throwing insults and verbal violence, generally not really fun stuff. After moving away, I had to spend a significant part of my adolescence crammed with 3 adult family members in a 30-something m^(2) (somewhere above 300 ft^(2)) flat. Sure, it could be worse, but considering that I was already really traumatized by the fear and being bullied in elementary school, it didn't really help me recover. So many people on so little space resulted in a lot of verbal quarrels and I almost didn't have privacy at all. In retrospective, its surprising that I somehow managed to orgasm few times a day while nobody was looking (am I a ninja or what?). I felt a lot of loneliness and craved emotional warmth during that period, so I often came back from school, hopped into my bed, turned my face to wall and just quietly cried for hours. I guess it's understandable considering that I was a lonely girl who didn't even know she's a girl and I really wanted to be hugged and wanted. But well, back then I didn't know that and the whole ordeal, which I didn't even understand, left psychological scars.

And speaking of being bullied, I was literally psychologically tortured by some guy, from my class in elementary school, who somehow managed to sense my OCD and abused this weakness. He got teachers to punish me for things I never done (which made me really anxious). He encouraged me to do some handicraft selling business with him - only to use this later to scare me to death, by revealing that to sell things you actually need to own business and do paperwork. Over 15 years later I am still insanely anxious of any paperwork/formalities because of that and it's one of my biggest OCD-related issues. I even recall destroying some of the things I made, literally crying at the same time because I put a lot of love into them and dying from debilitating anxiety of being punished by law for trying to sell something without owning a formal business (which led me to think I have to get rid of them). Of course looking now, it's absurd (especially since I never even tried to sell anything), but at that moment it was enormous trauma given the limited understanding of the law I had at the time and the fact that this guy literally made up that he called police on this only to make me completely break down emotionally. I don't even get how it's possible that somebody so young was so precise at sensing somebody's mental issues and abusing them to deliver such a precise and unbearable pain. Of course nothing could be done to punish him and I was left with severe emotional trauma which I still have to this day, considering that my OCD got from mild form of washing hands 4-5 times to me almost suiciding due to anxiety levels higher than any human could withstand. I would probably be dead by now, if not for my friend intervening, telling me to see a doctor, and my belief in science forcing me to start taking the medicines, despite my fear of side effects, just because I managed to prove myself that not doing so is scientifically a mistake. It's kinda scary, if not for somebody's help and my firm belief in science I could have already kicked a bucket (・へ・)

Of course this is not the only bullying I received. I'm currently an atheist, but my family was really religious and back then I was often mocked for it by other people in school. Because I tended to actually try being a good person (this is still the case, I always try to be kind and fair to other people), I often ended up pissing awful people off, which resulted in them taking their frustration out on me. But well, not much to speak about here, just the usual stuff of lauging at me, beating me up or threatening to do so, destroying my property, traumatizing me by having some people hold me while others punch me, you get the idea. I was lucky enough that none of this was serious beating and most were just intended to give me pain rather than harm me (I guess most didn't even leave bruises), but still, the idea of people using you as a punching bag while you can't do anything to stop it is really something that can't be shaken off the memory.

Middle school (upper elementary? naming things is hard, what I mean is 7-9 grade equivalent) went pretty normal, but well, in high school I was again laughed at because I trusted some girl with the fact that I had sex with other guy (I considered myself male at the time, due to complete lack of education on gender issues in my country) and of course she spilled the beans. Hence me being harrased, laughed at, having my property destroyed, threatened (I think violent threats were unreleated to my sexual orientation tho). All of that just because I was too weak to defend myself (both emotionally and physically) and because of my sexuality and fetishes (I told some people what I liked... it wasn't a smart move, since soon everybody was laughing).

Then came studies which were a horror experience. Universities here have this dumb habit of purposefully making insanely hard exams, which made many students not pass them.  Such students have to repeat the classes in the next year and pay for it, which is how the institution generates additional income for itself. It wouldn't be so bad, if the difficulty level was raised on things which are actually important, but unfortunately it often has nothing to do with value of particular topic for the future employee/scientist and instead just dwells in some obscure and useless bullshit. Which means that it not only doesn't improve academic level, but supplies loads of fresh, enormous stress packages to students (and it also costs money which sucks btw). So I guess you can imagine that being a hobbyist programmer and having to learn some stuff which isn't even important for computer science, but has exams that are very hard to pass, didn't really leave me in a good mental state. After finishing the bachelor's degree I pretty much collapsed into OCD and got crushed by anxiety and depression. I improved a bit since I started medications, but I couldn't even get psychotherapy, since our wonderful healthcare system has waiting queues over a year long щ(ﾟДﾟщ)

Of course as you probably already noticed, I do really love sex. So, throughout my life, apart from all that bullying I spoke of earlier, I also received quite a lot of insults and was laughed at a lot because of being so open and proudly promiscuous (not that anything came out of it, nobody wanted me lol). It didn't really help my already rock bottom self-esteem. Not that important to the story, but I figured I'll mention it cause it's a great example of how harmful slut-shaming is, even to people seen as males (at the time I didn't know that I'm trans). It's scary to think how much it harms females, considering their already disadvantaged position, uh (・へ・) I always try to be kind and respectful to promiscuous woman and I consider them to be really brave. I don't understand why there's so much hate of promiscuity and why people are not only cruel in the first place, but also sexist since they criticize woman more.

Some time after starting my master's degree (which I still didn't finish yet and I'm not sure if/when I will manage to do that) I figured out that I'm bisexual and trans. It took over quarter of a century, because there is no education on sexual orientations nor on gender identities in Poland, so I had to notice everything by self-assessment and learning those things myself before I understood who I am. Of course considering that I'm stuck in Poland, I can't do anything to transition and I can't find romantic/sexual partner and it's absolutely awful. I'm forced to use male forms when speaking in public, as verbs in Polish language have different endings depending on the speaker's gender. I only speak in female forms when talking with the few people who know my situation. I can't even contact any support group, since the only ones are the street thugs bands which can help me end my suffering quickly, but I guess I'm not that interested lol.

I pretty much decided I need some support or at least venting when I noticed that sometimes I almost break down in tears while fapping - just because I'm heartbroken that I want to suck and lick a cock so much and I can't because I'm too scared to ask out any guy in my country (that would be dangerous considering the widespread homophobia). And here in porn people do this all the time, swallow all that yummy cum, feel its warm on their cheeks and just take this for granted. All that while I sit here alone, anxious and crying, dreaming I could one day be somebody's cat and hug a huge, warm cock. It really fucking hurts that just because of being assigned male at birth and being born in this conservative country I have no hope of ever being happy. Sooooo, that was my garbage life up until now and here we are.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course I would love to move out, but if moving out of this place was so easy, I would be gone a long time ago. But there are a few major problems with this:

* I may be a programmer, which in theory puts me in a better financial position than an average polish citizen. But keep in mind, that even as a programmer my highest (and way higher than my other ones) annual wage never exceeded 15k$ (around 10k$ after paying taxes), with my 1.5 year of work experience. Even if we assume that I could save 25% of it, it will probably take around three months of saving just to fly to some place like America (and probably around one month to fly to Western Europe). And it will probably take somewhere from few months to a year just to gather enough money to survive for a short time in a foreign country - which would be pointless anyway, if I wouldn't find the job before running out of cash. Considering how shy and insecure I am after all the scars people left on me, it seems like an impossible chalenge. Especially since finding any work even here took me a long time every time I was searching for a job and I never ended up staying in any job for long (for various reasons, mostly studies which were unspeakably stressful, dealing with other people shitty work and being blamed for it, etc).
* Of course anxiety from my OCD (which in my case is mostly worrying about taking risks, about fucking up some paperwork and about things like ""did I turn off the kitchen stove?"") makes literally every aspect of my life a nightmare, which doesn't help. Sure, I'm taking antidepressants for it since I broke down emotionally and almost killed myself, but while I am able to stay alive and function on a very basic level, it's not like OCD will magically go away. Fuck, I don't even remember the last time I cooked anything warm, cause I'm so scared I'll forgot to turn off the stove (even tho I never forget about anything)... Being a transgender person with no hope in sight and no possibility of finding a romantic/sexual partner is debilitating and makes me even more anxious and depressed than I already am because of my OCD. I'm no way perfect, I don't think of myself as especially smart or intelligent, but I think I can offer some warmth, smiles and fun (since I have many interests to talk about and share) in a relationship. And in return I just want somebody to hug me and support with those small things which are trivial to average person, but are nightmare to somebody with OCD. I can calculate (or at least could, not sure how much I remember lol) volume of random 3D shapes using integrals, but I can't dump premade food into stove to eat something warm, eh (I guess this is the best description of how it is to have OCD btw).
* Gathering funds to transition here and then moving away is also pretty much impossible. The wages are horrendously low here (as you saw above). I'm also really emotionally fragile because of my gender issues and OCD, which doesn't help me to function properly and focus on pursuing career. I tend to be scared of other people, like, I sometimes get stuck in streetcars when there are people standing by doors and I can't squeeze through - it's too difficult for me to just ask them to move. Same thing happens while I'm shopping, I often search the whole shop for some item instead of mustering up the courage to ask an employee where I can find it. Finding work isn't really easy when one is so scared and shy. Also, having little work experience and being in a few different jobs doesn't really help finding anything well paid... And besides, I'm already 26 and I really want to transition as soon as possible, because not only I can't stand living in a male body, but I also want to live at least few years of life as a female while I'm still relatively young (╥﹏╥) Oh, and even if I managed to find a well paying job by polish standards, it will still be pretty much nothing compared to money earned elsewhere. My previous job, which I considered pretty well paid, would be around the minimal wage in the US. So, even if we assume that I could save 25% of money towards transitioning, it would still take decades to gather enough to transition. Sure, it may be a bit cheaper in some places and I could maybe take an advantage of that, but the difference is not really that significant - unlike food prices, things like electronics/medical services/games/etc can't vary that much in price from country to country, as otherwise people would just import them or travel to get them cheaper. Transitioning requires more money than my family ever owned and this thought is really horrifying. Btw. this is why food in Poland is so cheap, since it's made here, and electronic devices are so expensive in relation to wages. For example, if one saved up 5% of US average wage, they could buy a kitchen stove after one month, while saving 5% of polish average wage would require 6 months of saving (please forgive me for sketchy calculations, I'm not an economist). And of course the same applies when trying to gather funds towards transitioning. There is also the problem of me being so stressed living in an LGBT-phobic country and being completely alone, which results in being unable to really save up money. I pretty much tend to become broke quick, especially because of my dumb habit of eating tons of sweets to relieve stress and buying various things to distract myself from the day to day sorrow. This of course also made me quite fat, as if I didn't have enough problems already. I guess if I moved somewhere more LGBT-friendly, my stress levels would fall significantly, but well, I am stuck here...
* I could in theory try to find work in a foreign country and ask for help with relocating and I did try doing this in a few english speaking countries, but it didn't work. I tried applying to some LGBT-friendly companies as well, but to no avail. Honestly, I guess it's kinda understandable - my work experience isn't that great. I still haven't finished my master's degree. Bachelor's degree from polish universities aren't respected in the world that much (or at least that's what I heard). I don't even really feel like finishing the master's degree studies, considering how much in pain I am, but I guess I'm going to at least try. I'm also not really talented or anything, I just went for computer science, because programming was a hobby of mine and my other interests (biology, chemistry) at the time aren't something one can earn their living from in Poland. But I'm just an average programmer, one with little job experience to make things worse. I guess discrimination may also be a bit of an issue, considering how much shit I've experienced in multiplayer games and on the internet just because I'm slavic (nowadays I don't even admit that unless I have to), but it's hard to verify for me whether employers are more keen to offer a job to somebody from western world, maybe I'm just imagining things. But anyway, it's very hard to find a job, and I don't think any company will help me relocate Ó╭╮Ò

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, here I am. A weak, fragile, hopeless, sad catgirl who can't afford transitioning or moving away from this place where I'm hated just for who I am and who I'm attracted to. And the OCD makes me even more anxious and depressed, feeling like there is really no escape from this sorrow. I don't really know what can I do to improve my situation (hence this message). Maybe I should ask somewhere if anybody needs a programmer or something? But I guess nobody wants to import a junior dev from a foreign country, when there are so many of them already there. This is the most painful thing in all of this - the feeling of hopelessnes and lack of means to improve my situation. If I could make it better and failed, I would at least have some ways to do it better next time, but this... this is just excruciating.

&amp;#x200B;

Aaaaaanyway. Sorry that it turned out to be less of a story and more of me just venting my powerlessness out. If you happened to read all this (or even just the tl;dr), thank you. If you have any advice of what I could do or where I could seek help, I would be really grateful for it. And thank you, people of this sub, even just reading your posts is empowering and inspiring, as it shows how resilient humans can be.

294,"Hey guys, Australian here,

I’m at a bit of a cross roads personally, and just unsure of what I want to do. 

I graduated school two years ago, and have just been accepted into my bachelor of education (K-12) and am unsure on whether or not this is the right path for me, so I deferred it for a year to decide what to do with myself. 


However, I don’t know what to do this year. I work full time managing at a supermarket, but just feel empty when I think of working there, just, don’t enjoy it. I know I’m young and all, but I wanna spend my life doing shit I enjoy, and even though I’ve only worked here for four years I just don’t see much more of it in my future. 

Essentially, I was just asking if anyone knows any careers, any ideas, what did you do when coming at crossroads like this? Just wanna work shit out. 

Thankyou everyone! I look forward to reading your responses xx",08Feb2019,1

He smokes weed daily for the past dozen years - often inviting his druggy friends over and he even deals it himself recently for money. He has gone to Jail once for racial assault and was clean for a month but came straight back.

He has a short fuse and wants his own way without caring about others, he will smash everything in the house when he is angry, mostly punching holes in walls and doors. Two houses ago, he knocked several doors off and multiple broken rooms, one house ago he smashed my Dads brand new TV.

He will get mad over losing £5 or when my Dad isn't awake or ready to drive him somewhere, he has everyone under his thumb but no one is brave enough to call the police. My dad makes an excuse like ""he's family and the police wont do anything unless he punches you or something"", or ""he has weed in the house, we will all be kicked out if we do that"". 

I got up this morning to go to the toilet like I do often as I have IBS, he got so mad because I woke him up that he smashed the hallway up and threw things in my room. Threatening to smash my computer setup, I went downstairs to my Dad and had a panic attack (I am having the after effects right now as I type).

For a bit of background his dad died of cardiac arrest at the dinner table while this person was there and it fucked him up, this is excluding the fact that he was beaten as a kid from said dad. I never knew any of this infact i didnt know much about his family at all. So it was less than a week ago and i promised on his dads grave that i wouldnt do something from a mutual friend and stupidly i did do that something and now im in a real fucked situation. So he started sending me threats that hes going to beat the fuck out of me at school so it wasnt too much of a surprise to find that hes been looking for me for 3 periods. I wasnt trying to avoid him at all so he found me quite quickly, upon finding me he pushed me against a wall and asked if ""we are going to do this"". Our principal walked past and told this person to follow him which gave me some time to walk away.

313,"Basically, this girl comes back to our place with another roommate, completely fucked out of her mind on pills. Now i mean, I've seen lots of people take too much, nothing like this girl. Eyes rolling in the back of her head. Literally, could not even look at anything due to her whole body convulsing. Like, by far the most fucked I've ever seen anyone on pills, and I've been around that culture for a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

So my other roommate takes viagra, then half an hour later sets up an orgy with this girl included. It's me and another 2 girls. Things are weird at first, but the girls are into it so I kind of go along with the foreplay. But the fucked chick is still there, and I get a super weird vibe and leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

The creepy roommate I later found out (through him bragging to another roommate, and from others involved in the orgy) that they tried to keep her away from the orgy, but she wouldn't leave. So the girls leave, and this guy takes the girl fucked on pills and fucks her. She's 18, he's 25. She is literally out of her mind, it was consensual in the sense that she was willing, but she was so far gone I doubt she could even distinguish people, and to me it was similar to if she was so drunk she could barely open her eyes to pass a slurry ""yes"". The only difference is, she was on pills, so was probably squirming and convulsing in pleasure or some shit I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

This is rape, yeah?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, so I kicked the guy out for dodging out on rent, and kept his bond money for when the power bill came. The power bill has come, and I owe this guy $100. I don't know if I can bring myself to giving him this money, and really want to donate his money to a sexual assault charity and send him the receipt with a thankyou.

&amp;#x200B;

He's going around spreading rumours that I'm stating all this happened as fact, from me talking to the others involved and his friends, who have labelled him a creep and confirmed what I had learned from the other roommate who told me of his bragging about fucking her.

&amp;#x200B;

When I questioned him directly, he first denied she was even there the whole time, and was trying to play off that it didn't happen. He then tells me later on, that I'm spreading rumours, and while he admits they had sex, argues it ""should have been avoided but there was consent"". Definite inconsistencies in what he is saying, but he tells me the others confirm that I am exaggerating. However, they were under the impression I said that him raping her meant ""forcing her down"". Which I never claimed, only that she was out of her mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I still think the term rape applies. I was abused as a child so am worried that I may be skewed in my thinking. But I just can't bring myself to letting him get away with it. To giving him that money. I'm worried also that, as he knows where I live, he may try to damage my car or property. But I also just hate the thought.

314,"Hi Guys,

So about two years ago I moved out of my family home and into my new place. The first few months was bliss, but I then started noticing piles of stuff that i had just accumulated start to grow. Now I don’t mean things like bikes or traffic cones (a normal student grab) but bottles for perfumes I couldn’t part with, even though I had finished them, cups that were clearly cracked and unusable, even a pair of headphones that was snapped in half. 
But for the life of me I cant bear to throw these away, I feel like I’ve developed an emotional attachment to these things, the perfume bottle reminding me of that date I went on, the headphones were a gift given to me by my mother. It’s even bottom to the point that I keep all my empty foundation bottles.
I mean it’s not at the point where it’s a massive hinderance on my life but I guess it could get to that point.
I’ve talked to a few friends at work and they just say ‘Just throw it out’ but in a say and age where I feel like everything can be replaced by a click of a button I want things to mean more to me.
Does this make me a hoarder, and if so what can i do to get out of it?

TLDR; I never throw away empty bottles of things, or broken things, because I get emotionally attached. Am I a Hoarder?

318,"Ok, so background info:

I live in a shared flat with 3 other random uni students, we are pretty cool with each other but not ride-or-die besties.

One of my flatmates went through a recent bad break-up, and we generally supported her in getting back on the horse and to start dating/hooking-up again. About a week ago, we went out to a club and she got the hot bouncer's number, which we were all excited about and supported.

A few days later, she tells us how they've been progressively heating things up (hand holding-&gt;kissing-&gt;make out sessions/heavy petting), but she was nervous to tell him that she contracted genital herpes earlier this year after being raped; she was afraid about how he would take the information, as a potential lover, and that he would possibly reject her.

This was the first time she told us about having genital herpes and being raped, and after we offered any needed support in regards to both of those incredibly tough to talk about issues. Later in that conversation, she mentioned that she wasn't sure if/when she would tell him that she was raped and that she had genital herpes because of it, and I gave the advice that she should disclose it with him a day before their next date, since she had a feeling they would hook up, so that he would have some time to sit with the info and decide for himself. She seemed to agree at that time.

So the said hook up took place, and the next morning she gushes about how wonderful the sex was, which we were all happy for because A: she really needed to get laid post break up (according to her own statements) and B: she was anxious about having sex bc of the emotional trauma from being raped. So after the celebrating subsided a bit, I asked her how the conversation about her having genital herpes went with him. She said that she chose not to tell him, since she wasn't currently having an outbreak and she didn't want him to possibly lose interest in her. 

In my head I was shocked, since she is a generally responsible person, and maybe I'm in the wrong here for thinking so, but isn't it kind of a moral obligation to disclose with a sexual partner if you have genital herpes, even if you're not currently having an outbreak? I did a little (tiny) bit of research and found that ""Herpes (both oral &amp; genital) can be spread even when there are no symptoms or sores. This is called asymptomatic shedding."" So even though the chances are lower when there are no visible outbreaks and even more so when using condoms, there is still a possibility of it being transmitted. 

I don't think any less of her, or anyone, for having genital herpes, and I believe that everyone deserves to have sex if they want to; however I do believe people should be honest with potential sexual partners about any possible issues and I have a problem with people knowingly withholding the fact that they have an STD/STI with a sexual partner, because it eliminates a person's choice to personally decide whether or not they want to have sex, all factors considered.

I also understand that this is her business and that it in no way directly effects me whether or not she tells him, but I can't help but feel disturbed that she withheld that info. Am I shitty for thinking so? If it is brought up in conversation again, should I tell her that she should have told him?

Sorry for the long post, just kind of sorting out what or if I should say anything.

TL;DR My flatmate has genital herpes and didn't tell her random hook-up that she has it, and I think she should have, but idk if I should express that opinion with her. Help me decide!",08Feb2019,1

There is a biology teacher in my school who we will call Mr.O. It’s hard to tell his exact age because he is bald and looks rather old but he is also incredibly physically imposing as he is very muscular.

A few years ago Mr.O kissed a 16 year old girl at a school dance. The school has tried to sweep it under the rug but people still mention it. Of course this could be disregarded as a onetime thing but he also has often told young female students “if only you were a few years older” and will often stroke their hair and just general inappropriate behaviour. He will also try and intimidate the males around the female students age almost as if he’s telling them to back off the girls.

**Second path - Driver** \- I've always loved cars and waited for the moment I'll get my driving license. I got my driver's license 2 years ago and since then I had a lot of fun driving my Kia Picanto, I haven't got the chance yet to drive a more powerful car.

I'm not sure about what job I could get, I heard about some options like: Stunt driver, being a coach, testing cars, hot laps and etc. I'd guess my income will not be as stable but I would enjoy my work and get to experience different things.

My intention is to move to the US after I finish my time in the army regardless of which path I'll choose.

My experience in programming and driving is pretty low but I'm confident in my ability to improve significantly in either of them. In the last few months I'm getting more and more interested in the second path but I'm having a hard time making a choice between them.

I'd love to get some advice that will help me to make my choice.",08Feb2019,1
338,My boyfriend got into a disagreement last night regarding alone time. He is an introvert and I am sort of in the middle. My friends have grown up and moved out of town ( I do live in a bigger city). He loves to play video games and watch YouTube and does this almost every night in some capacity. Sometimes I feel really sad about not having anyone to hangout with so I try and hangout with him. He says that I get upset whenever he wants to play games. In truth I don't.  I don't mind and the only reason I end up bothering him is I feel I don't have anyone else. He tells me to get a hobby. Any advice is appreciated. Currently I am into art but without inspiration it seems pointless. ,08Feb2019,1

340,"I guess the title doesn’t sound that bad but here’s the situation. 
I began working at an “upscale” restaurant about 6 months ago where most of the staff is over 25. Maybe a handful of people who work there are under 21. I’m generally outgoing and got to talking to a lot of coworkers with no ease. Only recently I began hanging out with them more and I found myself becoming close to one girl (25F) and boy (27F). I don’t feel weird or distant from them because of our age and I love hanging out with them. However I know it can look weird if me and boy hangout because he’s almost a decade older than me. I don’t sense any sort of romantic implications from him though and he’s even helped me avoid a harassment situation before. Another example of this is sometimes after work me and boy go outside and smoke a joint or just chat for a bit. People know we do this but I’m always concerned they think it’s romantic or weird because I’m so young.

343,"Hiya to whoever takes the time to read this, I realise it's not as serious as most of the other posts on here, and I appreciate your time in doing so. 

I'm a university student, and in my first year of a three year course I made the best and closest friends I've ever had; as a result we chose to live with each other for the further two years. 
I've always found it quite hard to make friends, as I was home educated and am a little shy, and when I went to college I got bullied quite a bit. So, making this group of friends who I could talk to about anything meant so much to me. I love them so much, and would have done anything for them.
Now I'm in my third year of uni, and for the last few months something has changed in the group. They started to do things without me, going out to places we always used to go together for fun, only now I wasn't invited. I felt quite hurt, as I didn't know why. I kept trying really hard to keep them happy, so maybe things would go back to normal; I'd keep our house clean and tidy, and make them dinner and bake cake, if I thought they'd had a long day etc. But things just got worse. 
They started really isolating me, even in our own home. For example, on New Years Eve, they all went out partying together without me, didn't invite me or ask what I was doing, and left me alone in the house all night.
They don't talk to me at all anymore, it's like they try to ignore the fact I live with them too.
Yesterday, they took my house keys and hid them in their room so I couldn't get out of the house for my lecture, which I inevitably missed after tearing my room apart searching, and all the communal areas. 

It's gone on for months now, and it's wearing me down, bit by bit. 

A few weeks ago, I confronted one of them about it- the girl I'm closest with. I asked if I'd done something wrong, because everyone was treating me differently and I feel isolated. She told me I was being silly and nothing was wrong. Her and the others carried on isolating me.

I don't know what I've done to them, they won't tell me, and act like nothing is wrong when I ask.

It hurts so much, I loved them like family, and our home used to be my safe space (my family home isn't a home anymore; long story short, my mum is homeless and jobless right now, and has been since I started uni. My dad is a jobless alcoholic, so I don't feel comfortable staying with him as he's not very nice when drunk.) My uni house has been my home for three years, but now I feel anxious 24/7 here. I get panic attacks a lot, which has escalated while this has been happening. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated; also I apologise if this came out as rambling nonsense, I'm fairly upset at the moment haha.
Thank you!",08Feb2019,1
344,"I have just become aware of how much I have changed as a person in recent years. 

Life has hardened me. I used to worry about everyone else all of the time. I was giving to a fault. I was a very sweet and vulnerable person.

Then life happened. Now I realize that in many ways I am hardened and uncaring. I don't really care all that much about other people's problems. I tend to feel internally harsh, dismissive, and angry to many things and many people.

In some ways I might be ""healthier,"" because I have more boundaries and more fortitude. But I also feel that my best qualities are gone.  I may have more self respect, but honestly I'm not sure I like myself anymore.",08Feb2019,1

Neither of those options will work as I'm in debt and have bills to pay. I also am not really sure what I would even WANT to be doing... I also feel that the only way I'd be truly happy with work, is to not have to ever work which is something else that will never happen

348,"Hi

I have a masters degree in history. I have a very boring, but not very demanding or stressful job in a totally unrelated field, cause there are few related jobs to be found. 
I am working full time and it's just so hard, I'm tired all the time, and simply organising my household is so difficult for me, I just can't do it after a long work day. I do most of my shopping, cleaning, cooking and administration in the weekend. Maybe I have a mental disorder or whatever, but I just hate spending 8 hours a day at a desk and it prevents me to properly take care of myself. Last thing I'll do when coming home from work is peeling potatoes or folding laundry.

My main interest is Islamic history. Most things I do in my free time are in one way or another related to Islam(ic history), although I'm atheist. I'm even studying Arabic in my free time.

So the dilemma I am now facing is either trying to find a job related to my degree and hobbies, which won't be easy to find as I suck at networking. Such a job will probably be full time, assuming I must take every opportunity I can get. But at least it would be a job I'd like and give me a sense of doing something useful for a change.
Or I can work part time, so I have enough energy left to live a somewhat descent adult life, and can combine hobbies with household.

351,"I’m in my 2nd semester of my 3rd year of university, and it is really wearing me down mentally. I feel depressed, anxious and unmotivated all the time. I cry pretty much every time I’m alone for more than a few hours, or just when I think about my situation for any meaningful amount of time. My grades have been gradually declining to the point where I hardly bother going to classes anymore, which adds more stress and anxiety but for some reason I can’t push past the draw to just stay in bed or in front of the tv, because I’m failing anyway so what’s the point? I want to get away from all of this, maybe not permanently but for longer than just a summer. I want to just focus on working and spending time with my family and friends. 

I don’t know how to talk to my mom about this. She’s worked so hard to get to the place of success she’s at now, and to allow her children to live well without struggling. She pays for everything; my tuition, rent for my near-campus apartment, all of my bills, etc. for which I feel extremely grateful, and guilty. I’m home with her and the rest of my family most weekends, and she fully expects me to stay at home for at least a year after I graduate to get my footing. I have a brother close to my age who also lives at home and struggles with his own mental health issues, which my mom is often worrying about. This whole time I’ve been telling her everything is fine, maybe letting her in on minor issues but not telling her just how deeply I’m being affected and how much I’m struggling. She always says she expects/hopes that I’ll be graduating on time, within 4 years, but I know that’s not happening now. She still thinks I just need to talk to the counselor and take a couple extra classes and it’ll all be fine. It won’t. 

I think the cracks are starting to show and she suspects something’s wrong, because she panics when she gets the slightest idea that I’m not happy there, like when I said “I’d rather be here (at home) than there (school)” when classes were canceled for a week due to extreme weather so I get to stay home. She knows I have some issues with anxiety and motivation, but I always deny having more serious problems because I don’t want her to worry. 

I have an extremely hard time with confrontation and opening up emotionally. I usually just start crying and can’t even get through what I want to say. It’s pathetic. The only person who really knows the extent of what’s going on is my cousin, who has encouraged me to talk to my mom about this and let her know that I need a break. 

I just feel so lost and hopeless. I don’t want to put more on my mom’s plate when she’s done so much for me and sank so much money into my education, and when she’s already trying to help my brother with his problems. It almost feels like it’s not my choice to make, to leave school, because I’m not the one sacrificing my money for it, but I am sacrificing my mental wellbeing. I don’t know if I can do this anymore, but I also don’t know if I can face my mom with this. I need help. 

TL,DR: college is fucking me up mentally, I can’t take it anymore and I need to step away, at least for a while. I don’t know how to approach my mom with all of this due to guilt for how much she does for me and is already dealing with, and the fact that I’ve been acting like everything is fine up until now because confrontation and emotions are hard. 

How do I bring this up? What do I say to explain it all and for her to understand? ",08Feb2019,1

355,"I am aware of most of the facts which are relevant to what happened/is happening to my friend, however some questions may require me to double check with him.

Some background; when my friend was in his mid teens (I believe 15), he was forced to hand over his bank card and account details to an older boy who had been a student at our school a few years back. This boy, with the help of people unknown to my friend or I, deposited a fake cheque into his account and managed to somehow get the funds out of the account in cash. My friends bank realised a few days after and contacted him. He explained the situation, filed a police report and with the crime reference number, was able to avoid any criminal charges. However, the bank closed his account and since then, he has been un able to open a bank account in his name.

Fast forward almost 10 years to present day and he was able to open an account with a fintech company. A few weeks after opening the account he was unfortunately held at knife point after a night out and forced to give over his phone and card along with pin number. He had £400 taken out of his account and a further 21 failed transactions at 21 different ATMs. After filing a police report, the fintech company agreed to return the funds however they are now closing his account. He cannot find a bank that will take him. He also has no data available through any credit rating agency (He has tried clearscore so far). 

What are the reasons behind banks declining him? Could he be on some sort of black list? 
How can he get an account in his name? He works full time and needs a personal current account (He has had to resort to using his mum's).

My friend has been with his gf for just over 2 years, i kind of stopped hanging out with him as much because i don't like her and she doesn't like me. Cut to yesterday and i notice some changes on his social media and ask how they're doing, I'm the only one person who has messaged him so he was eager to talk to me about it.

To summarise she ""lost interest"" in him about a month ago and last week they broke up quite calmly and intended to stay friends, he says she wanted to be free to enjoy being young and kissing strangers and stuff. In the week since they've broken up she has slept with at least 1 other guy and been staying at another's apartment. This past couple days she's been calling him and has said she regrets breaking up, he is being very smart and telling her she needs to think for a couple weeks about her feelings because she  might just be missing him and change her mind again in a couple days.

From what he has said he doesn't want to rush and get back together and look like a fool, but he also said in a few weeks if she still wants to get back together they can move towards that. I understand this is very sane of him and better than a lot of people would handle the situation (myself included), but i can't help but think they need to go ""no contact"" for those couple weeks while they each sort out their emotions and figure out what's best for them. However he is afraid to leave her to herself because she recently moved away for education and he doesn't want her depression to come back full swing, but i think her calling him or texting him every day isn't going to give him the freedom he needs to make his own decision.

368,"My mother's always been a hoarder and both physically/emotionally abusive to me. She raised me and my three brothers with the help of her equally abusive boyfriend after cheating on my father. We lived in public housing, and so it was tough growing up not always having hot water or new clothes or fresh food. I moved out when I was 18, and I'm 21 now.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few years, I've just been working a crappy retail job, but I was initially doing 43 hours a week to make ends meet while living with roommates. Last year I started going back to school and cut my work hours to accommodate that. I moved out of a pretty decent apartment and have been bouncing around to some friends' houses that happened to have an extra room where I got really cheap and generous rents. I really can't thank them enough. But my current friend/roommate is moving and they're giving up the house (the church they work at owns it -- long unrelated story), so that means I have to move too. I've looked at all my options and it seems to be that my only one is to move back in with my mother. Rent is really expensive here as I live near Boston. My classes this semester especially require a lot of studying so I really can't afford to be doing 40 hours/wk again at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone back to my mom's apartment which is still owned by public housing, the same one we grew up in. The hoarding has gotten worse. I've had arguments with her about her unwillingness to clean and toss out things that are caked in \*literal\* inches of dust. She had piles of mail sitting on the dining room table dating back well over a year. It's just so exasperating. I feel like I worked so hard to get out of that crappy place and try to make something of myself as a person and become an adult, and now I'm falling right back. My depression was at its worst when I lived there before, and I've just been having these awful thoughts again knowing that I'll be back there very soon.

I love going out and drinking with my buddies, but after a night out drinking I feel really bad in my body and head. And it feels like it takes about 5-6 days before I get back in the flow of creativity, explosivity in boxing and my clear mind etc. 

Almost every weekend my friends call me and wanna go out and drink. But I don't wanna ruin my flow, so I don't actually feel like going out. But don't get me wrong, I fucking love going out with my buds, I have an amazing time every time. 


So there's the problem. Me and my friends only hangout when we drink. We have a good connection and have been friends since we were like 13. When I keep putting off the nights out drinking it feels like I'm losing my connection to my friends more and more. 

So it's so hard to choose... Either do what I really want. Feel good and go do some boxing.  Or go out and get wasted and bond with your close brothers? There's no inbetween for me. I can't jsut have 1 beer and chill. If I start drinking, I drink til I pass out because it's so much fun. 

And if I join them sober, it will be so damn hard to resist not drinking. And I will feel like a boring asshole.

 Info on the guy: has a house in Maryland (we live in PA) with a boat. Has three DUIs and lives with his mom in PA during the winter I guess. He smokes and drinks way too fucking much. He was a marine, but got kicked out or whatever for getting shot or something. We can call him Jim. 

So my mom meets this guy on plenty of fish. She ends up going down to this random fucking strangers house 2 hours away, for the weekend. I did not agree with this at all, but she didn't seem to give a fuck. The name she has this dudes name in her phone as ""jim boat"", and does not shut up about how he has a boat.

A couple weeks my mom invites this dude to our house one weekend, and they proceed to have loud fucking sex like I'm not even in the fucking house. After the dude leaves, my mom says hes not coming back, but she was full of shit because he came back new years eve. Meanwhile I went out with my friends. When I came back at one am, my mom was drunk off her ass bitching and whining about how the dude needed to leave and how I needed to call the cops because he wouldnt. Long story short, the dude leaves and my mom goes to bed. One other time, jim comes over at like 2am on a fucking weeknight and starts having loud sex with my mom. Keeping me up till 4am when I have work in the morning.
And to top it all off, I got back from babysitting last night at 12:30, and Jim is sleeping on the couch, bare fucking nude. 

I brought up my concerns with my mom but she doesnt listen, and says that her 18 year old son shouldn't be telling her how to live. 

What the hell am I supposed to do? More importantly, why am I so angry about this subject? I'm struggling to understand myself at this point.",08Feb2019,1

376,"I'll add some context (and disclaimers). 
1. I love my husband very much. 
2. I've tried doing everything I can think of but it doesn't help. 


My husband has extremely dry skin that seems to never stop flaking. I've never really been too bothered by this until our recent move into a hardwood floor house. It. Is. EVERYWHERE. 
It's on my feet, my socks, my clothes, my hair. It no longer has any carpet to cling to and it's become a bit out of control. 

Husband's family all have dry skin but he's always lived in a carpeted house so he's never really thought about it much but I believe something has to change as I've literally just swept up an entire dustpan full of flaky skin. I love him but I'm also slightly disgusted about how much there is and how little he seems to notice. I've tried buying him more nourishing soaps and encouraging him to use more moisturising products. Nothing seems to help.

Advice from people with similarly dry skin (or have a partner who has): how do you manage it? 
Is there any particular products that help?

377,"At 16 I was in my first sexual relationship with my then boyfriend who was extremely abusive. Mentally, sexually and eventually physically. After less than a year I got away from him but it was not easy. 

I look back and wonder why I stayed with him and why I put up with his shit but I put It down to the fact that I had an extremely abusive childhood also, so probably didn't know what a healthy relationship was supposed to be. 

I'm now 25 and with my current partner nearly 8 years. It's only in the last couple of weeks that I realised that my first boyfriend raped me multiple times throughout that relationship and I'm trying to deal with the crazy shit that's going on in my head because of it. 

I never let myself think back to that time with him before I came to the realisation. All my memories of him were locked away but now I feel like I've opened Pandoras box and I can't control my anger. 

 I had been having a lot of problems surrounding sex and was trying to work through these things (reading Come As You Are) when all those memories came back to me. Forcing me to have sex when i didn't want to and coercing me, telling me I'm a terrible girlfriend for not giving him sex, so it really fucked up my view on sex in general. I though I was just there for his urges and had no sexuality of my own. 

When I told my partner what was going on, he comforted me. I told him I don't think I need councilling as it was so long ago I can get through it myself. I just couldn't believe I never saw what was happening before. He said he agreed I could do it myself, and he would help me through it. 

Fast forward a few weeks later and I'm all over the place. I'm so angry and bitter and I don't know why. I can feel myself over analysing every aspect of my current relationship and looking for any signs of abuse. And I can see them everywhere. A lot of mentally abusive shit. Underhanded and sly. But I don't know if it's really there or if my brain is making something out of nothing, trying to protect me.

I feel like I'm going crazy. I have since thought every day about breaking up with my current partner because I feel so depressed in this relationship. I don't feel like I have time to work this shit out in my head. We both work full time and I feel like he's more interested in his job than he is with my mental wellbeing. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling about it or how I'm coping since I told him about it. He comes home from work and just talks at me for an hour straight about his day without asking how I'm doing. I just come come from work, clean the house, make dinner and wait for him to come home so I can be an ear for him to talk to. 

I just feel so alone. I want to die. I'm so angry. I can't control it. I'm generally a very laid back person but I feel so on edge. Like my whole life has been a lie. Like how can I trust this relationship if it took me so long to understand what was happening in the first one. 

I'm sorry for this wall of text. I don't even know what I'm asking. I'm just so angry and I'm afraid that I'm going to direct it at my partner so I need to vent. I need to get it out. I'm sorry if I sound like an ungrateful bitch.  I know he loves me. I just need to let these feelings out somewhere. ",08Feb2019,1
378,"I’ve been living with this elderly lady (90 this year) as a lodger. She is very well off and not wanting financially. She has carers come in the morning and afternoon to make her food but not the evenings.

The old lady can also be quite abusive: belittling, condescending, shouting etc.

379,"Previous Facts : Friend A's IphoneX is cracked but just okay to use it normally. No major cracks and screen is responsive and he's been using it this way for many months. 

Situation : 
Me and two of my friends ( A and B ) were out late a night together a few days ago. 
We were standing by a ledge that was about 150cm high. 
Friend A had left his phone on the ledge, a few feet away from my phone which had my wallet on top of it and finally my pack of cigarettes.
We were all just talking casually and decided to make a move and leave the place. 
A few minutes before we leave, Friend B moves A's phone under my phone+ wallet + pack of cigarettes.
Not knowing of this, I nonchalantly make a move to get my things with the IphoneX underneath. 
His phone drops to the ground and there's a major crack on it and he gets a little annoyed for a while but we proceed with our night. 


Current Situation : Two days later Friend A says that his parts of his phone are completely unresponsive and wants Me and Friend B to pay $400 to replace his phone screen. 

Please let me know what you guys think and who is the one at fault and who should be paying how much to help him repair his phone.

381,"I know I need to make a change. I am going to try to provide as much relevant detail as needed.

I'm 27. Spouse is 33. We bought at house Jan 2017. My spouse started his Phd May 2017. My husband kept applying for jobs even though he told me we wouldn't consider moving until graduation in 2020, and when we did move it would be a location we both liked. He said he was just applying out of habit. A university in a really rural area reached out to him Dec 2017. I told him I absolutely did not want to move to that area because it was extremely small, no diversity, very rural, and I wouldn't find a job easily. On top of that we just bought a house. Spouse said he would just interview for practice. Interview and offer happened in Jan 2018. Offer was 50k more than his current salary and a job he was aiming for after graduation. He put me in the position to have to say no or yes after I had already said no to the move before he even interviewed. I felt like if I said no, he would resent me for blocking a career move. If I said yes, I could possibly resent him. I was a dumb ass and agreed to move. (After we moved, he actually received an offer from his mentor for a position with more pay/ free house in a major city.)

Fast forward to now. We have dealt with horrible tenants, spent a ton of money on them and repairs. Now under contract to sell this home, which also is costly with light repairs buyers want. My husband never has time for me between work, traveling for work, his phd program, and flying back home once a month for class (hybrid program.) I am 14 hours away from family and friends. There's nothing to do in this area and I feel isolated. Believe me, I have really tried to make friends. Joined fitness classes, tried to use friend apps, etc. I have a job now, but I am completely unfulfilled doing it. I'm in bed in tears more days of of the week than not. The only thing I can say that we have going for ourselves is more money. We were happier as a couple before this job even came into the picture. Right now my husband is out of town for work. I dont even have the energy to tell him how poorly I feel anymore. So I would rather not even speak to him. 

The options now are for him to heavily apply for jobs now, and take a job that would be a lateral move for the same pay or less, in a possibly higher cost of living area. Or wait a year until he graduates next summer to start applying. This would leave me feeling the way I do currently and just toughing it out. This is not a good option, but I have thought about taking 10k In savings, searching for a job in a nearby major city, and relocating first. I know realistically this doesn't make sense. I could make things work financially in a new place, but there's no guarantee he would find work in the new area I would move to. Also, it is not a good idea for our relationship for me to leave. We had discussed me staying behind back home and him commuting, when the offer first came. I wish we had stuck with that option. The nature of his job is another issue. We have no idea where we will move next, which also causes me anxiety.

I just don't know what to do. I am tired of being in a bad mood and feeling sad/upset. I am basically dragging myself out of bed into work and faking through all day. Just don't know what to do at all.",08Feb2019,1
382,"For reference, I am in high school right now. I have been friends with a girl for a while, I'll call her Sophie. 

Sophie and I have a study hall together where we like to talk about stuff in our life. Recently, however, she has started going out with a guy who is a junior (we are sophomores). While skeptical, I tried to help her, even though she wouldn't tell me who it was. After about a week, I found out, through coincidence (long story but point is I found out who it was). 

This guy is terrible, he is the stereotypical ""player"" of high school. She told me stories about him telling her his ""body count"" (amount of girls he's had sex with), and she literally openly told me he has more nudes of girls than he can count. She says she likes him because they both have ""commitment issues,"" but I highly disapprove. Many girls I know say he uses them for sex/nudes and leaves, and he's notorious across school for this. There's even a rumor he once tried to rape a girl. 

Anyway, I made clear to Sophie that I very much disapprove, and that she should get out asap. She is still a virgin and has expressed many times that she wants to lose her virginity to him. I told her that she should find someone else, not this guy who will take advantage of her, and I also mentioned the risk of STDs/pregnancy. She says she's okay with being taken advantage of and that she ""knows she'll be taken advantage of eventually, so why does it matter who it is?""

Do I help her? Do I back off? At this point, I figure you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. I'm not sure what else I should do, if anything.

386,"Last summer I took an admission exam for the university of medicine in my city. Although I failed the exam I was and still am very sure that this is the career I want to pursue, so I decided to wait and study more, then take the exam again this year. The last student accepted took 85 points and I had 82, so I think at a second try I have all the chances to succeed.

My mother did not agree with that, and forced me to get the exam for pharmacy which I took and now I'm a 1st year student here. I am still very determined to go to med school, but my mom doesn't agree. From her point of view, the fact that I failed the exam is a sign that I shouldn't go to med school.

I decided to skip pharmacy exams so I can focus on studying for the admission exam which is 5 months from now. The problem is, mom doesn't know about this and she'll probably freak out when she finds out. She is a very strict parent, never allowed me to have friends or get out of the house for any purpose besides going to school.  Even now, although I am almost 20 years old, from her perspective I am not allowed to have friends other than family, go to a party or anything like that.

387,"Hey everyone! I wanted to post on here to get some feedback and see what your opinion is on the subject I’m dealing with. So me and my gf have been together for almost 2 years now. In the beginning of our relationship she had told about a guy she had slept with along time ago. That guy was one of her Dad’s friends who comes over to her family get togethers all the time. Once she had told me I was always uncomfortable being around that guy everytime he came over to her parents house. Every weekend her parents have get together with their friends and drink/play music in their game room at their house and my gf and I would hangout with them. So everytime that guy came over I would feel uncomfortable and me and her would leave. Well yesterday I found out that she had slept with her Dad’s friend in the very beginning of our relationship when I was out of town one weekend. We hadn’t become official yet but we were getting serious. The day I got back in town we made our relationship official, without me know what she did when I was gone. Now that she told the truth about when it actually happened I have been really upset. Since it happened when we weren’t officially together I still feel like I was cheated on or played or lead on. We’ve been together for 2 years almost now and I still think about that and it upsets. She’s apologized and hasn’t done anything suspicious since that event happened however I still can’t seem to get over it. I’m upset with her and I’m upset with her Dad’s friend cause he knew about me when me and my gf were starting to get serious. It’s hard for me to just forget about it because he still comes over to her parents house when they have get togethers. Keep in mind her parents have no clue what they did.

A little background: 
I work for an insurance company, in the office we have 8 women including myself. I have only been here about 7 months, the next newest person is at 3 years. 

One of our agents, who I do not work with nor have I yet met in person, wife passed away and the funeral is today. 

Everyone else in the office has worked with him 3 or more years and is going. I'm uncomfortable with attending because I have my own beliefs on paying respects to the dead and I've never met this man let alone his wife and I find that its intrusive to ""pay my respects"" to a person, a family, that I dont know and that doesnt know me. 

They're trying to make me go because they're all going as a group and continuously disregard my beliefs and feelings on the matter. It's gotten to the point where the office bitch, who already has it out for me since day one, is being really shitty to me and I feel like it's now even worse to go cause at that point I'm just going to appease a woman who hates me and that i have equal negative feeling about. 

So what do I do here? Do I just go and ignore my own feelings about it or do I stay firm and not go and deal with the wrath of she who is never happy?

396,"first off, this may be quite long. I apologize. The TLDR is at the bottom. 


I’ve truly gotten myself into some SHIT. Ok,...to start off, my bf and I have been together for 5 years. We recently had a baby, and I moved into his home. It was everything I dreamed of. Everything. The man I love, and our precious baby boy. A perfect house for us to raise him in. I wasn’t working (stay at home mom) so I spent my days playing/caring for our son, doing laundry, cooking, the usual. 


The thing is, things weren’t always this great...I’ve struggled with extreme anxiety for YEARS. Literally ever since I can remember. I quit cross country in middle school because I didn’t want to be looked at. Noticed. I passed up a modeling opportunity because I was too nervous to go, I’ve even missed court because I couldn’t leave the house. I hate being seen. I feel like I carry myself awkwardly, and I feel like I wear failure like one may wear a trench coat. 

People can smell my insecurity.

And yes, fear is a bird that believes itself into extinction, because I am dying. 


Slightly dramatic, but it’s how I feel. If you haven’t noticed by now. 


This led to depression, clearly. So now I’ve acquired both anxiety as well as depression. Quite the lovely cocktail if you ask me. /s


 Anyways, I turned to drinking as my outlet. More so, comfort blanket. I couldn’t find doctors who would prescribe me what truly helped-Xanax-(I’ve been on it before) many psychiatrists tried anti depressants as well as non-narcotic anxiety meds, to no avail. So, FINALLY, I found a doctor who actually would hear me out. 


She prescribed me Klonizapam. Which actually helped. I could
go on runs during the day, take my son outside, go places, run errands. You know, normal shit people who don’t have the spirit animal of a chihuahua on the verge of a panic attack, which is always. Anyways, let me get to the point. The drinking. 


Well, my doc eventually took me off of the anxiety medication. I couldn’t fucking believe it. So, all of the anxieties started flooding back, and I had no way to quell it. 




I couldn’t drink considering I had my son, but his grandmother was planning on taking him with her on a trip, so maybe I could relax a little. This was a mistake. It was my bfs friends birthday the day they were supposed to come home. People were drinking the night before so there were still quite a few beers left over. Well, my depressed, anxious Eeyore ass decided it wouldn’t hurt if I had a couple beers before they got back later that day, calm my nerves and whatnot. People drink wine with their children around all the time, I’m not going to get wasted.” Is what I told myself to not feel guilty. Truly, I just wanted these feelings to go away. 


WORST IDEA OF MY LIFE. 


So, yea. Basically, I drank myself stupid and his mom found me asleep, on my bfs bed when they got back. She even dug through the trash and found the beer cans. They kicked me out. The only reason I even have 2 more days before I’m homeless is because she’s gone so I can stay here until she gets back Sunday. I’M FREAKING OUT. 


I don’t have any lifelines. I can’t beg for forgiveness to stay here. My parents aren’t going to help me. About 6 months ago, I attempted suicide and alcohol was involved. Depression is one hell of a bitch. So, you can see why I’m not supposed to drink. And everyone is adamant about that which I totally disregarded thinking it wouldn’t be a big deal. No one would know if I had what, 3 beers. I thought. But we all know how that turned out...Also, she called my case worker and told him the situation, so they said I can’t reside there anymore. 


Of course, the most devastating part of all of this is my poor son. This is where I’m most conflicted. Should I just leave? He won’t remember me, and his father will find a better woman to be his mother figure. God, it sounds so fucked up, but he really deserves better than me. I’m thinking I could stay, go to a shelter or halfway house, get a job, get my shit straight and at least have a chance at getting my family back. I’m just so damn discouraged. I don’t even have a car. Or any money. I’m literally starting from scratch. Can I even succeed? Am I capable of this at all? Will I be in and out of his life? How can I even work with this anxiety? 


Or do I run? 


Find a new city, stay at a shelter there, save up for an apartment, and let everyone live their lives in peace without having the burden of me.

TLDR: Basically ruined my life, lost my family by drinking and now facing homelessness in the next 2 days.

I’m not going to describe what he says but I’ll just say he asks obscene and personal questions and the girls I work with naively answer or get uncomfortable. 

I only started working late into last year and it’s been happening for a while. I’m just now starting to get seriously annoyed by it. I don’t know how to confront him partly because I’m not confrontational and he’s older than me so I’m a bit intimidated. I considered going to my manager about it but we’re so understaffed that she most likely won’t get rid of him and will just tell him I complained. What are some ways I can approach him about this?

Also, I hope I don’t seem too nit picky about this. I know it’s just a part time job and I won’t be working here forever since I’m only in it for pocket money, but I can’t just witness these things and not think there’s something wrong with it, right?

TLDR: my male coworker shouts expletives near customers and engaged in inappropriate conversations with female coworkers and I want to know how I can confront him as someone who is afraid of confrontation.",08Feb2019,1

403,"Hi hello this is my first time on reddit ever (really ever; I've never independently gone to this website before). I'm desperate! Pls excuse if this is not the right place/format for this.   


This is a LOOONG story but here's the summary: 

In October 2018, a 22-pound, very large package of mine (containing all my winter clothes and several items of great sentimental value) got lost in the bowels of USPS through a forklift mishap that resulted in a ripped label and an address-less box. My pursuit of the package has included: 

* digging up NPR articles about USPS from 2010
* contacting the facility manager &amp; several facility employees on LinkedIn and Facebook
* countless hours reading USPS blog posts
* 19 hand-written letters sent to the facility - with photos of me wearing said lost items included - every week over a 2 month period
* endless emails to various podcasts 
* detailed documentation of my efforts on instagram (@pollyatomic story highlight: #findmypackage)
* most recently, a woman with lobbyist connections messaging me on Instagram saying she'd seen my posts and wanted to put me in touch with someone from the Governor's office and potentially the Post Master General (though now she's stopped responding).

As a teen with no real physical connections outside of school, I really valued the social aspect of it. I'm in 9th grade now, and things have only gotten worse. As far as substance abuse, I've been sober for awhile due to not having access to drugs/money. But everything else has gotten worse. I was hospitalized for the 3rd time last September after I tried to kill myself. I can not stay this way. Not being able to communicate with people, not being able to meet new friends, not being able to have a relationship, and not being able to stay caught up in school are driving me fucking insane (all of my main goals right now). I don't know where to go or what to do. I have the opportunity to go back to any school in my area including the one I got suspended from.

412,"I [21 F] live with two roommates, one who I will call Anne [31F] and another I will call John [22 F]. All of our rooms are leased individually. 

John and I are in our last semester of college. While I work full time and go to school, he doesn’t. John can be very rambunctious (your typical 22 year old male college kid). He has a lot of friends over, but our apartment is so large that the noise doesn’t really bother me. If it does, I simply text him and ask him for his friends to be quiet, and they always correct themselves. John can be pretty messy, while Anne and I are clean. But he always cleans up if confronted.

We have had two instances with John where he has left the gas running on a burner, and has left the house with it on going out of town. Both times the gas was so bad I walked in the door and almost passed out. We both have dogs so this is a big concern. When we confronted John, he brushed it off. Not apologizing, and doing it again. 

This set Anne off, who really has her shit together compared to John. Anne works a 9-5 making around $80,000 a year. She has a 17 year old dog that she will leave at the house in a cage for over 24 hours. That is the only real complaint about Anne. I end up having to take care of the dog and pick up the slack for the dirty house but it doesn’t bother me, and if it does I just let Anne know that she needs to get the dog. 

After the burner situation, Anne was pissed. The day after this, she had come out of the bathroom in a towel (normal things) and one of John’s roommate came out of his room and hit on her. This completely set her off. Her boyfriend threatened to break John’s teeth in, and Anne started doing everything in her power legally to get John out of the house.

Anne told our landlord that John was smoking cigs in his room (he wasn’t) just weed but we are all 420 friendly. Anne doesn’t come to the house anymore, but when she does she locks John out of our part of the house where our bathroom is for hours on end. Anne called the cops on John for banging on the door so he could go to the bathroom. They came to our house which set me into a panic because I don’t do well with cops. Anne threw away all of our toothbrushes, she poured a shit ton water in an expensive container of John’s protein powder, she threw away all of his food, she blocked Johns number, she saw what she thought was John’s key sitting on the counter and took it, but it was mine, etc. 

None of this really bothered me until she called the cops to our house, took my key, and threw away our toothbrushes. Is there anything I can do about the situation? I have tried to talk to them both about talking it out, but Anne refuses to talk to John. I have bad anxiety, so this is really starting to effect me. Help?",08Feb2019,1
414,"Hey guys, just for a bit of context, I am currently 24 and live with 3 of my friends from high school after college. All of us are/were in relationships at the beginning of the lease. One roommate just broke up with his girlfriend (took him down a very dark path, but he's better now) and my other roommate is the topic at hand. 

During the week leading up to the SuperBowl, my roommate and I had been planning a party with our friends at our apartment. Everyone had been talking about if for a couple weeks before and we were all really excited about it. The day of the super bowl and his girlfriend is a no show for a few hours, he gets a bit ticked but it's okay. Game is started and they are talking, and through their discussion, she has decided to ditch the plans to hang out with the people she was hanging out with there, keeping in mind she also had her friends there too waiting for her. He and her friends are very mad, understandably so, and try to explain that she should be coming. Her solution to this was to text my roommate that they're on a break. The day goes by, and the next day they're talking about grabbing her stuff out of his room. They get food together, and are now back together again. 

Now, normally I wouldn't care about this sort of thing, but the signs of this relationship from what I've seen and heard (our walls are very thin, I can hear a lot of their arguments) are just not good at all. She had previously done this exact same thing with their New Years Eve plans, constantly picks at what he says to start fights (they had a full yelling match about his tone of voice one time), has thrown things at him while she was drunk (threw an iHome at his head one time), and claims she's trapping him and has threatened to call the cops multiple times. During the SuperBowl debacle his cousin was there and found a Pros and Cons list that he had been making. The only thing he had written down for Pros was ""we have a lot in common."" He has even had one of his other friends come out and say that she treats him like shit and he doesn't deserve it, and he won't be helping/talking to him until it's over. Roommate said he has every right to be mad, but he's still going to make his own stubborn decisions. 

My question is, how do we get him to realize the exact same thing is going to keep happening? Whenever they have fights there's a lot of empty promises, pushing blame and dismissal from her side. I also think she's just making a play to get something for valentine's day and then escalate another fight, but I could be very wrong. Just looking for some help because he's been through enough with her and I and others believe it should end sooner than later. ",08Feb2019,1

418,"A close friend of mine I’ve known since start of school is unfortunately very sick. Needless to say we both have had rough teenage years when it came to health, but she’s been fighting this brain tumor for 3 years now. She doesn’t feel sick, but her visions getting worse and then she gets these “attacks” that can last hours and slowly make her body go numb.
She’s reached almost like a breaking point, she’s very anxious and paranoid about getting attacks and the doctors appointments that require her to drive hours from 1 to 3 times a week are getting to her. 
She’s been offered an experimental treatment, but one that takes place in America (we live in denmark) and she’s obviously stressed. Not only because she’s scared of traveling and staying in a foreign country for over a year. But she’d be alone and she’d have to give up her college study.

Worst of all. I’m also stuck here, on the other side of the country. We text and talk almost daily but I can’t even be there for her physically (even though I sadly doubt I’d be of much more use then)
Of course I do my best, let her talk to me, listen, let her vent, try to understand her day to day life, talk about other things to distract her when it’s particularly bad and try to give support and advice mostly based on my experience with mental disorders.
I’ve suggested her going to a therapist, because I know therapy could help ease her everyday paranoia and give her some mental tools to work with her daily struggles.
But at the same time then I’m not sure pressuring her to do that, when she already goes to the hospital 3 times a week is the right thing to do. Especially when she already has doctors breathing down her neck, making her feel gulity and even more stressed for hesitating the offer of experimental treatment.

I know this might sound pitiful going online to ask for help. But I’ve honestly seen so much good and honest discussion and talk happen in these kinds of communities and I hope I could ask for some advice from you people who may even have experience with these kinds of situations

421,"So about a week ago I met a girl online, and we hit it off. We live about 1200 miles apart, but I was already planning on moving to a new city 1000 miles closer before I even met her. Still going through with that, I’m moving to be closer to my daughter. We talked every day, and once in a while a few hours would pass between messages. Which isn’t a big deal, we both have social lives and jobs and no obligation to talk.

Thing is, two days ago she just stopped. I haven’t heard anything. We’re still friends on the website where we met, she hasn’t blocked me or anything, she hasn’t been active at all on the site (not stalking, just shows up in my news feed there). I’d rather not get into which site it is. Don’t worry, it’s safe and legal.

So emotionally I’m a bit torn. I’ve always been bad at assuming the worst, and it’s ruined potential relationships for me in the past. I instinctively think she’s intentionally ignoring me or she’s found someone else, but it’s just as likely she’s super busy at work or some life event. I sent one text yesterday asking if she was okay, I’m not planning on sending anything else. I really like her and want to talk to her more and it is pretty taxing, but I don’t want to smother a girl I just met with a bunch of messages. I’d hate it if someone did that to me.

422,"Hey people!

I'll cut straight to it and try and explain as best as I can (hopefully clearly).

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I applied for a course and have accepted the offer and have commenced the enrolment, however, I haven't FULLY confirmed the enrolment for this course. The reason being is that the government doesn't cover the total fee of the course and requires a ""gap"" pay of like $2000 if I want to continue the second semester. The problem with this is I don't think i would be able to pay it and I'm thinking of abandoning the enrolment all together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a history of not being able to hold down a job, being let go after 2 weeks or 3 weeks of work, and in all honesty when I work I feel dreadful and I constantly feel like I don't want to be there, to the point where I would actually snap and just leave the workplace. I'm not one that gets angry, in fact, I rarely get angry however mentally it feels too overwhelming and I feel very, very depressed and shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I could work and study at the same time however I can't rely on myself to do this, I feel like I'm going to collapse because I'll be honest, I used to be a very pessimistic, negative and toxic person. I would always expect the worst and I realized that hey, life isn't going to work that way and I realized that I've never really done anything to improve as a person, I haven't got any interesting hobbies or do anything productive, all I do is just sit in front of my computer staying up late nights and waking up in the middle of the day and I want this to change, but I feel like if I study and work at the same time, I'm not going to be able to handle it properly especially with the way that I am with no financial stability or any personal development.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do the thing that will benefit me the most, to be honest if this ""gap"" pay situation didn't exist I would've been all for it but now I just feel so stuck and so foreign to even my own self, like I'm second guessing myself constantly.

424,"Hi all, 

So my wife and I recently moved across country for her dream job about a year ago now. She is a hard worker, and loves her job. 

Most days she doesn't get home until late, and will be checking and answering work e-mails until 10pm at night. She was like this at her old job, but had to work weekends also so this isn't neccessarily new. 

However, her boss will message her and her team up until 10pm at night. I get being committed to your job, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of boundaries. My wife and her boss (also female) will message each other about random family stuff, work stuff, and just stuff in general. Sometimes during breakfast, dinner, first thing in the morning etc. 

I mentioned to my wife about putting some boundaries between home &amp; work and she seemed... upset about it? not angry, just like she was sorry for doing extra work at home. I'm just getting frustrated that even when my wife is at home, even after working late, her boss is constantly messaging her or vice versa. 

I understand being committed to a job, but it's... just... frustrating. My wife shows me the messages, without prompting, and asks for my advice with stuff but I'm so frustrated. 

Am I right to be frustrated? I just want my wife to have a work-life balance, not be answering work-related texts every night up until 10pm. If I was doing that I know she'd be pissed if the roles were reversed. ",08Feb2019,1

It was almost impossible to get my first real (payed) job. I had to work for free for years to gain direct experience. Now this is frowned upon as if it says something negative about my worth as a person and work ethic as an employee. They tell me to stop feeling inferior but yet they treat me as if I'm not nearly as luxurious as someone who hasn't struggled one bit to find a job. It's a cognitive dissonance.

I have a child (that I would die for) and share custody with my ex who doesn't agree with moving out of the City. The unemployment office tells me that I should take a job outside the City since those jobs are easier to get (in their opinion). However, I (for real) can't afford the transportation and I wouldn't be able to pick up my child in school in time if I worked a job outside the City. It's like a circle that just goes round and round and round and round and...

&amp;#x200B;

My family is nowhere nearby, neither spiritually or physically. I get no support from them. Only negative energy so I don't really hold contact with them any longer. I'm seriously doing all of this by myself and it looks like this is going to continue for a long time still. I just can't seem to get out of this loop. 

&amp;#x200B;

My body aches (severely) in the hips and the shoulders because of the weight of my bad economy and my living situation as well as life-situation overall. I feel stuck and like I'm caught in a nightmare which I can't escape. I can't seem to get my life back on track and it seems to just fall apart and there is this constant battle, trying to find a home and a job simultaneously and still paying my bills, without ever quite getting to that point where I can just relax and breath. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I gain a dollar a letter lands in front of me from someone saying that I owe them 2 dollars. This is how it feels. Like I'm cursed almost. It's been going on for years. I own nothing. Sometimes I remember back on the days when someone in my extended family would just do something kind for me and I felt loved and blessed and protected. Now I feel like I've accepted the fact that there's no place for me in this life. I feel like I'm going to die from this soon and nobody is going to thank me for struggling to death, in the effort of trying to exist in a world that doesn't accept me any longer. I'm at my ends with. I feel completely rejected and used and tossed away but still controlled and expected to deliver things which I can't deliver unless I find a hidden treasure in the ground or something""

440,"I'm in a bad situation but I'm thankful for all the good in my life. I graduated college and moved with my girlfriend to a small town for work. We thought it would be a quaint oasis but it turned out to be somewhat awful. The problem is things are pretty good. I like my job, we're closer to family, we have each other. 

However, we had an abusive landlord that drove us out of our place. I'm looking at the bright side because we did move and we like where we moved to a lot better and there is nobody that will pick on us or harass us, however the sting of our previously landlords actions has me down in the dumps. 

We have moved out, but still have some stuff in our old place. The rent is paid until March 1st so we have the whole month to clean and move the rest of our stuff out. The other day I found out someone had entered our apartment without telling us. I called the cops, the cops called the landlord. The landlord said they entered because of all the snow we've been getting there might have been the leak. The landlord told the cop we smoked weed. I told the cop that wasn't true. The cop said she didn't believe me, and I ""wouldn't admit that to an officer anyways."" She basically said there is nothing I can do. She was so unsympathetic. The landlord has been calling my girlfriend and I multiple times a day from a blocked number and when we answer she hangs up. The cop said, ""if its a blocked number, how do you know it is even her?"" I told the cop about the time the landlord blocked my car in with a snowplow and the cop said I ""should have planned ahead.""

I just don't understand why the police who are supposed to protect the community are basically making me feel like the bad person in this. 

I don't understand why the world just beats people down. I'm a simple person. I go to work and I'm very well liked there. I go home to my girlfriend and our cats. I'm a very happy and grateful person, but being on the receiving end of this abuse and thinking of the abuse others endure and may not have the means to get away from just makes me feel so worn down.

He does fake crying, screaming, and shaking arms or legs to show anger when someone does what he doesn't want.

He is antisocial as fuck! Instead of other kids in the class saying ""Hey, want to play with us?"", he says ""Can I play with you guys?""

He doesn't tell the things that happened to him in school. We always get the news from his friends instead from him.

He cries over very small things (for example losing his pencil)

He is very addicted to computer games, I am too but at least I have learned from my mistake with the lowest grade possible.(%27 success rate on an exam)

I rarely see him do homework. Even if he does he can't do it on his own. He is in second grade.

He plays for 4 hours each day but the doctor said 1 hour a day.

445,"Reddit, I don't know how to navigate this issue involving my future in-laws.  Long story short, they are approaching retirement, I'm pretty sure they owe approximately the value of their home on the mortgage, and I have reason to believe they have close to $100K in credit card debt.  

I don't know what, if anything, my Future Spouse knows about the credit card debt.  I haven't raised it because my source of knowledge is an old spreadsheet I found on a shared computer.  It's a delicate subject - FS claims not to know anything about their financial situation and is (understandably) uncomfortable talking to them about it.

FS and I have discussed the importance of making sure both of our parents are taken care of when they need it in old age.  I agree with that philosophy, but to a point.  The problem is that I do not know whether anyone has a plan to deal with or even takes seriously the level of debt they are in.  They don't live an extravagant lifestyle or anything, but they certainly live comfortably.  I suspect they are still spending more than they bring in, or are breaking even (meaning no headway is being made on the debt).  I'm worried that FS and my future is going to be jeopardized - we're working to pay back significant student loan debt ourselves, and I don't know between FS's attitude on caring for parents and them living outside their means, how this is going to impact us.

I'm seeking advice about how to plan for the future and how to navigate discussing the issue with FS.  Do I bring up what I know about the credit card debt with FS?  Do I try to convince FS to give them unsolicited advice on debt repayment and budgeting? And how big of an issue could this turn into for me down the line?",08Feb2019,1
446,"Hello,

I am currently in high school, and my history teacher keeps assigning me SJW, and other generic “liberal” packets. Our most recent one was about defending those who kneel during the NA. Prior to that it was about some Native American camp thing, but halfway through the article it takes a turn and compares the people building through it to white supremacists during the Civil Rights movement. These worksheets are a pain to get through because I need to pay attention because at the end I have to answer questions. One of the hardest requirements for credit is having to agree with multiple parts of the article (it is actually a requirement to agree). I refuse to do that part. As I’m sure you can guess these packets always find a way to include President Trump just to shit on him, and treat President Obama like a god. In one packet that was written after the inauguration they called President Trump “Trump” and President Obama “President Obama”

447,"I'm not sure if this is even the correct place for this but here goes. 

I started smoking weed for fun after I graduated high school and then it eventually turned into a pain and anxiety management tool for me. 4 years later and I want to be able to quit long enough to get a decent job but I'm not sure if that's even possible anymore. I honestly don't want to quit because of how bad my anxiety is without it but I know I'm missing so many decent job opportunities just because I can't pass a drug test. In my state weed is legal but a lot of employers still expect a drug free workplace. I can go all day without it but my anxiety gets the best of me and then I can't sleep and then the anxiety rolls over into the next day. When I say anxiety, I mean my heart is beating rapidly, I have a hard time breathing without hyperventilating, I already sweat like crazy but it gets a lot worse, I can't focus on anything, I have no appetite and feel really sick and do throw up sometimes, and I get super impatient and angry at everything and everyone.

450,"Note: this might be a bit long, but if read and answered , im very grateful 

Hi I’m currently a senior in college and should be graduating this May. Now I’m writing this because I’m not prepared to graduate college and am completely full of anxiety. I went through my entire life in college doing what my parents wanted me to do, and they would constantly tell me that I must graduate on time, and that i have to get a job as soon as possible, not realizing how much pressure this is actually putting on me.

I’ve went through more than one episodes of depression while in college, as I’ve failed 4 classes( i did study and put in work for all those classes) , and pretty much had no friends for my first 3 years of college. That dark, empty, loneliness, hidden behind that fake smile, and a never-ending wish of being buried alive until I suffocate from lack of oxygen is something that I’ve never told anyone about. The constant thoughts of suicide have stayed by my side for the past 3 years. Not having someone to talk to, or a companion or friend, as well as lacking in confidence because of previous experiences, takes a very heavy toll on your mental wellbeing. If you’ve ever failed a class, you know how terrible it is and how it feels like you’re being held against your will by a 1000 ton chain, having to sit in that class for another 3-4 months having to take the class again. Back to friends, I had the “Hey, hows it going...Alright man I’ll see you later” type of people but no actual friends, and I believe that I am no where near a socially awkward person. The school I went to had a very little amount of clubs and none interested me. I wanted to study abroad but my parents were against it until they said “ok” out of the blue, but by that time I had no way to pay for the semester abroad as it was around 17k+.

Now back to my parents again, my father didn’t like the thought of me getting a job on the side as a college student , which I really wanted to so that I can at least self- provide a little for myself, even if it was simply lunch, it would provide a sense of responsibility in my life. He would tell me “I work, so there’s no need for you to work, are you saying I’m not enough?!”. I feel like he took it as a strike to his male pride ( I’m a male ) and masculinity. My mother did all she can to help me honestly, but she was always pressuring me so much in college. I wanted to transfer schools to get into a better program for my degree, she would always put these thoughts in my head about me having to graduate late or financial aid not covering, when she honestly knew nothing about it. Even when I told her how the system goes she still said no,  a bit arrogant but I let it go. I went along with the program, even though honestly it wasn’t that great, but then I decided I wanted to take at most a semester off just so that I can get my head straight. I felt completely discombobulated and had no idea what I was doing anymore, everything was a wreck, I was getting D’s in my major classes and passing with C’s, just taking classes because I need to take classes, not having a set goal in mind. Ive taken a class in the summer to make up for a class I failed and paid for it out of pocket with whatever I had just to graduate on time. They wouldn’t allow me to get a  semester off either, my mom again, saying “if you go, you will most likely just not come back to school, you should just finish as soon as you can”. She wasn’t completely wrong as some people do actually not come back to college, not that it’s the end of the world, and for some people doing all you can to graduate in 4 years is what works for them. But she didn’t understand that doesn’t apply to everyone, and that we all have our own capabilities.

So I stuck with the degree, continued getting C’s despite all my efforts and just went along with it. I continued on having little to no friends, not being a part of any club, not going abroad, not having a side job, sticking with my terrible GPA, and not transferring to a different university, but thankfully not throwing in the towel on life and just fighting my way through(it makes me wonder if those people who committed suicide even wanted to do it, or was it out of their control as by that time the resting demon inside just took over) 

My parents stuck with their one dimensional mindset of life, get born, go to school, SAT’s decide your entire future, go to a college as near as possible to home, graduate college ASAP, get a job, pay the bills, get married, work, die.

Now that I’m in my senior year, I don’t know what happened but a lot in my life turned around, I began working out more, met a lot of genuine people whom I’m very compatible with, got all A’s in my major classes in the Fall, and have taken a more serious outlook at my major and I haven’t had any breakdowns. I feel like I’m now beginning at my step 1, and before I had to just battle it out of all the negative steps. I don’t believe I’m prepared to graduate college, and now I’m stuck. Despite having such a terrible experience in college, I’m now FINALLY getting a good taste of it and not a bitter, lonely, and dark one, I kind of don’t want to let go( if that makes any sense ).

Where should I go from here, I’m about finish both my major and minor requirements to graduate but I don’t have any internships or any jobs planned. A lot of what happened during college really held be back. Should I get another minor and pursue that, just to get another semester or two? I honestly don’t know. I finally met some great people after not having any for years, and then I suddenly just have to let them go after all that struggle trying to have one companion.

Thank You

Hello again,

After my husbands and mine recent blow up about his health, which caused a huge fight, we have done a lot of talking and communicating about issues that has been building up for the last 25 years we have been together. He has really come around and is willing to work on himself and his health and family participation which is a HUGE step from where he has been for the past month or so. I can say I am proud of him for this.

One thing that has always baffled me about him, his is never proud of his accomplishments. I was talking to him about how great it was that he was willing to work on changing, and change his rather childish view on seeking help from Dr.s and therapy. I AM really proud of him, and expressed that and he just got embarrassed and well, the way he gets when he has done something good and is being praised by anyone.

Now this is a man who HATES his birthday (really he usually stays home on it and hides from everyone and has according to him mom since she can remember), He did not walk the line at his high school or college graduation. Has never opened his diploma, or license. did not tell me he had finished his internship and passed all his exams for licensure. He has done so many great things in his life, and I have never seen him once celebrate, he will congratulate us like when I graduated both high school and trade school, but when it comes to him he kind of hides from it.

I really don't even know how to frame this to a therapist when he goes to see one soon, or if I should even bring it up at this point.

So my dad has worked for this factory that manufactures and processes meat. He works in the day as a delivery guy (he goes to different states surrounding New York.) And at nighttime as a security guard. In the past few years the company has been doing bad and I think it was going bankrupt. It was sold off a few days ago and the new owners don't wanna manufacture meat. As it stands my dad will most likely lose his job as with everyone else there.

My dad has been in this job for more than a decade. And he's worked day and night in order to provide for me, my mom and my little brother.
My mom can't work because she has cancer and very fragile (shes only in her 40s) so my dad (who is 51) 

Anyway my little brother and I don't know what to do and we are worried because my dad is having a hard time admitting that he is on the brick of losing his job. We are trying to see for any jobs for him. And I wanted some advice.

 I have taken control away from myself. 

Some people say that going with the flow reduces stress; But for me, the phrase serves as another form of escapism from a world of observation.

Backstory:

I'm currently a college student and have been part of a special committee for the past one year. I'm pretty sure I got selected for it by mistake but either way I worked well in the committee and did what was asked of me. 

After 6 months, the current head (Let's call them X) asked me if I would like to be the next head of the committee. Thinking it was a great opportunity I agreed. 

However recently I realised that it involves alot more work and is way more time consuming than I previously anticipated. So I asked for my name to be withdrawn from consideration. 

As it turns out, I ended up being the most qualified and well suited person for the post so X was reluctant to withdraw my name. But I did get my name removed while still remaining part of the committee.

The problem:

Although I would really love the chance to be incharge, I highly doubt I'll be able to cope with my studies and the extracurricular work. Although X strongly believes I'll be able to manage both, I know myself and I am pretty sure I'll screw up something.

Another problem that arises is that the amount of politics and drama involved is something I loathe and want to avoid at all costs.

And the last reason to deny this post is that I don't feel I'm prepared enough to handle something this big and trust me when I say this is a big deal.

Now the other side of the argument I'm having is that I think X pretty much depended on me to take over. I hate disappointing people in general.
And by refusing, I'll be dispapointing someone I respect and admire.
The worst way to disappoint someone is when you know how much they depended on you. This guilt of disappointment is tearing into me in ways I cannot possibly describe. 

All my life when someone needed me to do something, I've always had their back and this is the first time I'm doing something which I feel is selfish but necessary. 

I hate being the person you can't rely on.

I was looking to buy a used car and found an out of state dealer who had a good price. At the time of the dealer posting the deals Carfax/Cars.com/Autotrader etc listed his cars for sale without a lot of reviews. Long story short a lot went wrong in the process of buying and luckily for me (other that the time and money spent) I walked away without making the deal. I can list the communication facts below.

I then posted Facts about the dealer as far as how things ended and noticed a few others reviews that had just popped up within the same week. Some were legitimate and had the same type of Shady and crocked issues. Others, you can clearly see were padded and promotional reviews.

The Dealer then also responded to my review with a outright racist response and for whatever reason Google.com decided to remove my review. Again, I have been on SD/FW for years and getting a good deal is in my nature but I am now determined to hit a shady dealer where it hurts and am looking for ideas and advice.

Owner is Racist and a bigot (read his racist responses on Google before proceeding). I have stated facts about my transaction with the owner and his response is clearly a personal and racists responses.

File Complaints again this guy:http://www.mvdb.virginia.gov/cons...tance.aspx


Facts:-Spoke to the owner that I am out of state and had another family member go see the car 1 hour away.-Called to put the deposit down but he wouldn't pickup calls for 3 straight days.-Finally did get a hold of him 5th day was the owner told me that he had the car and that we had a verbal agreement that i'll come pickup the car 2 days later. I mentioned about putting down a deposit he said ""its okay"".-I rented a car to drive down 240 miles with my young children and stayed at my family's place.-Again the next day after I get to VA i cannot get a hold of the owner as I called him several times through the day.-Finally the day of the agreed upon sale I call him again before driving an hour to meet him and he texts back saying ""car sold"".-Owner calls me later in the day to tell me the car was sold and then proceeds to tell me ""ohh there was no deposit"" WHAT !! Then proceeds to tell me oh I'll have more Camry's 3-4 days later , OK.


I was willing to buy the car ""as is"" on trust and had a verbal agreement from the owner and did not haggle on anything yet he responds back with the below response:


Response from the owner: a day agoare you mad at me because i didnt sell the toyota camery MR xxxx... I DONT DO BUSINESS WITH CHEAP ASS xxxx (Race)


Original Review 2/2/2019:

Shady and Dishonest Location. Good luck trying to get this guy on the phone and honoring anything he says on the phone.


A lot of red flags for this location that I went against my instinct: Brand new dealer who has closed 3 other locations in the last 3 years (opened and closed each year). All of a sudden positive reviews within a week. When asked questions about Car titles he says it would be mailed; which might or might not be an issue.


Agreed up deals suddenly become ""SOLD"" causing a lot of hassle and what not. Deal at your own risk as noted the person is not reliable and dishonest at best.",08Feb2019,1

So to lighten the mood in the chat i naturally started shitposting memes, then another ""friend"" (we'll call him chode's personal masseuse) screenshotted the first meme i sent and send it to chode and chode decided to remove me from our other main ""boys"" chat (that i originally founded may i add!) because he took it was some kind of deep insult to his name.


[I messaged him and this conversation ensued.](https://m.imgur.com/HSDC6di)


I also found out from some friends still in the boys chat that chode had been talking about how he is going to ""F*ck me up"". Chode is well known for getting in unnecessary fights on nights out with everyone from bouncers to the police, he is not overly tough or big he just enjoys it because he's a c*nt.


Now i am not afraid of a fight with him, i go to the gym regularly and know i could handle him. However he is the volatile stroppy emotional unstable sort and i would not put it past him to bring a weapon, or if i did best him in fisticuffs he would definitely want revenge and would not let this grudge go until he had hurt me or my belongings/property or those that belong to my fmaily.


Hopefully you now understand my predicament, my pride doesn't want to let this stroppy crybaby continue to think that he is some kind of local gang leader who is not to be messed however i dont want to risk damage to myself or mine or my familys belongings/property. I should also mention that if i called the police on him following any violent actions this would only fuel his need for revenge further

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a senior in an Education program to become a teacher at a state college in NY. Each education student has a concentration, and mine is Geography. Last semester I had my schedule set with the approval from my advisers that I was set for graduation. I would take my last classes this semester and walk at graduation in May. I would student teach abroad in the summer and finish my second placement in the fall. 

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of last semester, a professor cancels a geography course due to them receiving a grant. I've been emailing advisers throughout the winter break about how to solve the issue to no avail. They suggested classes which literally overlapped with other classes I was taking and even recommend I beg to get into others. I did try but was declined.

&amp;#x200B;

I've brought the issue higher up but nothing seems to be coming of it. They're now claiming that I dragged my feet on resolving the issue and rejected my advisers suggestions without reason. Is there anyone else that I can appeal to? Are there policies in place for this sort of thing? Is the school accountable for a professor cancelling a course and another course can't be substituted?

Thank you for reading.",08Feb2019,1
482,"TL,DR towards the bottom. 

I’m in my 2nd semester of my 3rd year of university, and it is really wearing me down mentally. I feel depressed, anxious and unmotivated all the time. My grades have been gradually declining to the point where I hardly bother going to classes anymore, which adds more stress and anxiety but for some reason I can’t push past the draw to just stay in bed or in front of the tv, because I’m failing anyway so what’s the point? I want to get away from all of this, maybe not permanently but for longer than just a summer. I want to just focus on working and spending time with my family and friends. 

I don’t know how to talk to my mom about this. She’s worked so hard to get to the place of success she’s at now, and to allow her children to live well without struggling. She pays for everything; my tuition, rent for my near-campus apartment, all of my bills, etc. for which I feel extremely grateful, and guilty. She fully expects me to stay at home for at least a year after I graduate to get my footing. I have a brother close to my age who also lives at home and struggles with his own mental health issues, which my mom is often worrying about. This whole time I’ve been telling her everything is fine, maybe letting her in on minor issues but not telling her just how much I’m struggling. She always says she expects/hopes that I’ll be graduating on time, within 4 years, but I know that’s not happening. She thinks I just need to talk to the counselor and take a couple extra classes and it’ll all be fine. It won’t. 

I think the cracks are starting to show, because she panics when she gets the slightest idea that I’m not happy there, like when I said “I’d rather be here (at home) than there (school)” when classes were canceled for a week due to extreme weather so I got to stay home. She knows I have some issues with anxiety and motivation, but I always deny having more serious problems because I don’t want her to worry. 

I have an extremely hard time with confrontation and opening up emotionally. I usually just start crying and can’t even get through what I want to say. It’s pathetic. The only person who really knows the extent of what’s going on is my cousin, who has encouraged me to talk to my mom about this and let her know that I need a break. 

I just feel so lost and hopeless. I don’t want to put more on my mom’s plate when she’s done so much for me and sank so much money into my education, and when she’s already trying to help my brother with his problems. It almost feels like it’s not my choice to make, to leave school, because I’m not the one sacrificing my money for it, but I am sacrificing my mental wellbeing. I don’t know if I can do this anymore, but I also don’t know if I can face my mom with this. I need help. 

TL,DR: college is fucking me up mentally, I can’t take it anymore and I need to step away, at least for a little while. I don’t know how to approach my mom with all of this due to guilt for how much she does for me and is already dealing with, and the fact that I’ve been acting like everything is fine up until now because confrontation and emotions are hard. 

How do I bring this up? What do I say to explain it all and for her to understand? ",08Feb2019,1

The other day I met up with a girl who I matched with on tinder. We had orginally planned to meet up the other week, but our schedules filled up so we settled for yesterday. When I asked her on Monday if we were still on for coffee that we rescheduled, she told me that she was talking to another guy and wanted to see where it goes. I told her that I understand and thanked her for letting me know, but she still wanted to meet up. We got coffee yesterday, and I thought it went really well. I expected it to be kinda awkward, but it wasn't like that at all. I later thanked her for being upfront about the other guy and told her I had fun meeting up and she said she had fun too. So yeah. Didn't turn out exactly so planned, but what can ya do 

I''ve never done the tinder thing, so I'd say my expectations were about where they should be. But it went in the opposite direction I thought it would. I expected awkwardness and some discomfort, but it seemed like we immediately started clicking. She's so much more gorgeous than tinder makes her out to be, and it seemed like we had endless stuff to talk about. And I know I sound like I'm absolutely swooning for someone I've only met up with once, but it seems like that's somewhat expected when you've never been on a date. If this doesn't work out, it just seems like nothing else will come along, you know?

I'm in my junior year of college, so I feel like finding people to date will never be this easy again. I have no idea where my life is going because I'm starting to come to the realization that my major is above my mental capabilities, and I feel like my dating chances after college will be based on nothing more than my income. So I guess during this period could be my last opportunity for ""the one."" :/

489,"Ok hi all, need some advice on how to plan for my future. 

I’m currently located in Boston, living rent free at home. I am having a very hard time finding a job in my field here (or anything even remotely close that I can market myself to), so I’m left with 2 part time jobs. One, related to my interests so that’s good and the other is my job from college. I am bringing in about $909 (after taxes) biweekly. So $1800 a month. I cannot move out anywhere close to my job because a studio apartment in Boston is like $1600 minimum lol. My student loan payments are $650/mo. MINIMUM - I always try to pay over that amount though. 

My boyfriend is an angel, and he helps me out a lot. He makes ~$1000 biweekly with no debt (he only did a 2 year degree, works in culinary). We want to move out at this point, but not in Boston. When we move, we are doing it with our friends who are a couple. 

We were thinking of Colorado (Denver/Aurora) because the rent is so cheap. But the job market for me is similar to Boston, there’s nothing that good for me and the salary is pretty similar. So I could go there, get whatever job, pay down my loans but also have my own place. I wouldn’t really be working on my goals/passions though. My boyfriend Restaurant has 4 other in the US, one being in Denver, so he’d be all set there. 

I know this part might sound insane, but in NYC there are an abundance of jobs for me!! (International Relations/Nonprofit/Russian) From what I’m reading, the pay is pretty good too! I’m seeing ~50k salary for some of these jobs. I know the rent there is ridiculous, for such a small place, but I can’t get over the jobs that are there. I know that I would be paying more in rent but wouldn’t this give me a better quality of life and overall better pay? As for my boyfriend, we have a friend who works out there in culinary who could set my boyfriend up with a job, same pay rate as in Boston. Plus we both want to move to NYC so badly. 

Which one would make more sense? Cheaper rent but also lower salary, not relevant jobs or higher rent, higher salary, relevant jobs. Am I being ridiculous thinking about moving to NYC with 600/mo loan payments? I get no help from family, as they obviously couldn’t even help pay for school lol. ",08Feb2019,1
490,"I am in highschool and currently in the process of getting put on medication for my ADD. Part of this process is basically getting teacher recommendation that I have ADD that warrants medication (the nichq vanderbilt assessment)

She gives me the form back and she didn't just exaggerate... she blatantly lied? She put down that i frequently initiate physical fights with other students and i actively defy rules. This is incredibly untrue, I've never fought anyone before, or would I say I try to cause trouble.

492,"This is probably a stretch. I thought I might as well ask anyway.

I live on the street level in my apartment complex. My back door leads directly to the roofed parking lot, right next to the handicapped spots. That means I see stupid people parked there all the time without a permit. There's this guy in particular, who parks there often. He does have a permit, but he always parks super sloppily, sometimes even using more than one spot. I even saw him parking without a permit for a while, though he was probably just renewing it.

One day that I was in a bad mood, I left the guy a mean-spirited letter in his windshield. You don't have to tell me that was a mistake, I know now.

Anyway, cue to today, and I notice this car is parked pretty badly again, and next to it there's another car that's parked even worse, almost blocking the way into my apartment. This pissed me off, so I decided to report them to the building administration. I started taking some pictures for proof.What I failed to notice is that both drivers were in the first car, because it has tinted windows. And they saw me.

They immediately got off the car and started berating me for it. They correctly guessed I was the one who left the note. While this was happening, I started to get bad vibes from all this. The cars they were driving are pretty expensive. The way they moved seemed threatening. I decided to back off and defuse the situation, so I apologized. They demanded I erase the pictures, so I did it in front of them. As I was leaving, some of the stuff they said made me think they might be pretty wealthy (if the cars were not a sign by themselves).

Now, I'm hoping this will not escalate any further. Even if my gut feeling is right and they are dangerous people, there's little to gain by messing with me. But they know where I live. They know the car I drive.

496,"9 months ago our cat was lost overnight. We tried looking for him in the neighbourhood, but without luck. He was an outside cat and some neighbours had complained about him. Before he was lost, he looked a bit sick, so we were worried he was poisoned. Yesterday my mother saw a post on facebook about a straycat in the industrial area near our town (a few km from where we live). The cat looked just like ours, and upon further inspection, it was our cat but significantly more fat. We took it home today and he's acting really scared. He must've been 1.5 years old when he was lost. He was always a cuddly, happy cat and now all he's done is hide beneath our table, our sofa. What can we do to relieve the trauma he experienced (being outside for 9 months) and get him to accept us again, or is it a lost case. We have no idea what to do.

btw, we expect that a neighbour took our cat in the car, drove to the industrial area and just released it there, that's what the woman that has been feeding our cat thought as well.",08Feb2019,1

498,"TL;DR For months now, my husband's been distancing himself from me. How can we communicate again? 

I have bipolar 2 and am sometimes unstable, but I never asked for his help or his worries. All I asked for was for him to be by my side. He says he can't not worry about me. He has intrusive thoughts of coming home to find me having killed myself. 

I have been hospitalized once and he says this took a toll on him. He felt helpless. 

As we were moving my parents offered to come and help (we live in another country). And we said we didn't need any help, but they came anyway. This had also affected him immensely and the fact that these two things happened so close to each other (timewise) before he had had a chance to digest my hospitalization hasn't been easy for him. He says he doesn't have any energy anymore and finds that I am too clingy. He wants to approach me himself, not me approaching him. 

Since then he just pushes me away emotionally (for months now) and a couple days ago, he physically pushed me as I tried to snuggle with him. 

Then I snapped and told him it's either divorce or couples' therapy. That he can't touch me anymore or call me love, that he can be with others if he'd like, and so can I, etc. 

The next day he went to talk to his parents and came home to tell me that he wants a divorce and that he'll cancel our vacation (which is in a couple of weeks). 

That night I could not sleep at all and had physical heart pain. It was the hardest night of my life. I begged him to reconsider in the morning, I told him I was sorry, and that we can try to see how it goes during the vacation, etc. 

He accepted that but he is still distant. He called me just once today. He doesn't call me love (rarely, if ever). I let him be for now, but I really don't know how to proceed from there. It hurts so bad. We still love each other. What can I do?

Note: He doesn't want couples' therapy. I believe it could be useful. ",08Feb2019,1

506,"I don't really want to state my age but I'm around 14-17. Even at a younger age my parents have completely disclosed the Idea of allowing me to leave the house to simply stay at a friend's house or go around a town. At first I just accepted the fact that I was really young back then and perhaps I would've done something silly. I appreciate that they're protective of me but they have never trusted me and I've never done anything to break their trust in the beginning. I haven't taken illegal substances, involved with dangerous people, have a clear mindset to not fall into peer pressure, rarely leave my comfort zone, severe trust issues and extremely paranoid around people. I've even refused to take drinks/food from acquaintances in fear that perhaps it may be drugged or riddled with bacteria. In the beginning my friends have continuously tried to invite me to social events and I've had to guiltily decline them all. In fact they were starting to feel as though I was purposefully trying to avoid their invites which is completely the opposite. Now whenever we discuss anything there's always an inside joke or something that particularly clinged into their minds during a night out together and I've just sat uncomfortably. Obviously they don't bring up the subjects on purpose just to make me feel guilty but I feel as though most of their bonding time is outside of school instead of in so there's a great deal I'm missing out on. It's quite upsetting and I feel very isolated that my parents trust me so little. 

I've discussed my unhappiness with their choices and they won't budge. I feel as though I'm losing a large chunk of my young years sitting in my room all day when I could be socialising instead.

510,"I'm currently in my first semester of college taking care of prerequisites. When I first entered college, I intended on eventually going to nursing school (and had a whole career sketched out), but a few months ago, I started entertaining the notion of majoring in psychology. I have a knack for psychology and love learning about people's minds.

The thing is that I don't really want to be a counselor or social worker—I'd rather do research, but that's a small field, and you need to have a doctorate degree to make any money in it. And even if I did decide I'd be a counselor, that's an extra two years of school. I'm already 21, so I feel like the clock's ticking.

What appeals to me about nursing is the stability, mobility (I'll have a job no matter where I go), and versatility. I'm not an ambitious person and don't wanna make lots of money, but I do want to be comfortable. Travel is a priority for me, and nursing could even allow me to travel as part of my job.

However, I'm just not a super nurturing person. I care about people, but I'm not doting and sickly sweet like some of the nurses I've met are. Nurses face lots of abuse in the workplace, as well, and I don't have the thickest hide in the world, so this worries me. (I'm a good match for nursing otherwise: detail-oriented, good at multitasking, enjoy science, have lots of stamina, etc.)

My question boils down to this: should I study something more intellectually invigorating and that suits my personality better, and deal with more limited career/life growth, or study something practical that I'd be good at but doesn't suit my personality the best, yet will allow me to do basically anything I want with my life? (Keeping in mind that nursing is a really, really stressful job.)",08Feb2019,1
511,"I feel this subject is often left in the dark and I feel the need to cast a light on it. I love the quote “be who you wish you had when you were younger.” Well, here’s an inconvenient truth: I can’t be a sober mother (for myself), but I hope I can somehow bring strength to others and be a strong role model for my own children one day. 

Last Christmas I had agreed to coffee with my mom. As soon as I saw her, I knew she was drunk, again. 14:15, wasted. I have 25 years of experience, figuring out whether or not mom has been drinking in fractions of a second. I could see it immediately and I knew id have to cut this meeting short. What did I grow up doing? I tried to fix her. Watch her back. Pour out alcohol. I tried to delay or avoid any chance she could take to buy more wine. I put her to bed. I laid next to her, looking at her ribcage, making sure she’s still breathing. I often looked at the clock thinking, the longer she sleeps, the sooner she’ll be back to being my mom again. I laid next to her, to make sure she keeps breathing and was thankful for mornings, feeling maybe today, things would be different.

When she was awake, I listened to her as she poured her broken heart out to me. I may have known it’s not the job of a child, but I felt I was responsible. Maybe me listening to her would help her? But as much as I tried to piece her together, I always failed. I could spend hours trying to inspire her to a sober life or to get any sort of help, or just to see the beauty in life, feeling each time that this time, I’d get her to stop. I’d feel I’d get somewhere, until she’d blame everything on something or someone else or even worse, say nasty things to me and make sarcastic comments about my life, and that I couldn’t understand, because my life is perfect and because I’m so young. 

School became everything to me. School was my safe place, where I wouldn’t show any of this and where I earned good grades. I was believed to be a really happy child. A diplomatic / expat environment isn’t generally one where you see these kinds of deep family problems, but I feel it’s a mistake to believe they don’t exist and even worse, to pretend they don’t exist. I was on the honor roll and principals list, largely without a big effort, but that’s not to say that it didn’t mean anything to me. When it was time for my graduation, and when from the stage I could see my dad standing alone with my sister, without my mother next to him, what could’ve been the happiest day of my life turned into such a disappointment. My mother hadn’t showed up, because she had decided to get drunk instead. 

Over coffee last Christmas, I repeated myself. Mom, when you want therapy, I’ll organise everything and I’ll come with you. I’ll do whatever it takes. But no, she said she doesn’t need help. Our meeting took 5 minutes, we drank our coffee and I drove her home. It is the worlds most heartbreaking thing, to see someone otherwise so warm and kind, suffer so deeply and decide to continue their self destruction, but I can’t be a part of it anymore and I don’t feel anyone should have to be.

What have I learned from this? I can tell a drunk person by one glance and I have earned a wide set of other depressing skills I feel I could honestly live without. But I’ve chosen to look at the good, and I’m thankful that I have learned to appreciate the smallest things in life. Those are what keep me happy. I obsessively tell everyone I love, that I love them, because I’ve become terrifyingly afraid of the minute where I hear of the moment where this all ends badly. I am painfully aware that it could be any second of any day. But I do what I can to keep moving and keep building my own happiness. I carry with myself a sense of responsibility now to instead of saving my mother, potentially helping someone who is, or has been, in my shoes. I make sure to listen to and to feel other peoples pain. I share my story more and more as I get older, because I know how it feels to be ashamed of all of this and I know how it feels to be alone. I am deeply thankful for the people who are brave enough to talk about this, because I know it’s more common than one would think. I now in turn, decided to “tell the world” despite how unsuitable this story may be for social media. I’ve learned that there’s no use pretending this doesn’t exist, because it is the realest thing in the world. With the risk of someone else reading this, and feeling this pain, I want to say, that if you’re waiting for the universe to give you permission to live your life and choose to be happy, I am giving it to you, for whatever it may be worth. I am also writing this for me, because I feel I need to remind myself from time to time that I am allowed to be happy and I am allowed to live my own life. I am only responsible for me. 

I’m not keeping myself from crying in order to avoid fights at home anymore. I’m not pouring any more bottles down the sink. I’m trying to not feel guilty for being a generally, happy person and I’m trying to accept that this situation is beyond my reach. I’m convinced this isn’t something anyone ever gets used to but I’m trying to accept it and trying to learn to let go. This is for the adult children / victims of honest to god, fucked up situations. You are only responsible for your own happiness and you are allowed to live your life, and above all, you are allowed to do what it takes for you to be happy. And maybe this is a little bit, for those too, who think that diplomat families live a perfect expat life, or for those who feel they need to hold up the facade that belongs to that life. Nothing is as it seems and everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about. ",08Feb2019,1

519,"When I was young, my mom or older sister always told me that I had attitude. Recently, a situation came up and I was told that I had attitude. It immediately brought me back to my childhood and made me reflect on a lot of things about myself. Being told I have an attitude bothers me a lot today but more so as a kid, being told that I had an attitude bothered me the most. It actually completely changed the way I was/acted/my personality. I am 22 now. I guess I will share an example before I ask for advice.

When I was 7, my younger sister was around 4?? She somehow locked herself in the car during the summer and luckily, I was playing outside and realized it when I heard her pounding on the window hysterically crying. I freaked out, went to her and told her to unlock the door from the inside. When she did, I pulled the door open really fast to get her out and she fell head first onto the cement driveway. She had a huge bump on her head. I was worried that my mom would yell at me but I thought that since I helped my sister she would understand. So we went inside, I explained to my mom what happened and my mom immediately said to me, “why are you lying to me??? Why would you hurt your sister like that???” My sister wouldn’t stop crying so that didn’t help me either. I got really frustrated and angry because my mom was yelling at me for something I didn’t do on purpose. She was accusing me of lying when all I did was help my sister out of a hot car. I didn’t purposely try to hurt my sister. I didn’t know she would fall out of the car and bump her head when I opened the door. I was doing what I thought was right. I told my mom the truth about what happened. With all of this running through my 7 year old head, I asked/told my mom, “why do you never believe anything I say??? I didn’t do anything to her! I only helped her! She is only crying because she was scared and it hurts!” To this, my mom responded, “you need to stop talking back to me and having an attitude before I twist your ears off.” I didn’t want to get my ears twisted for helping out my sister (it was a form of punishment) so I finally gave up telling the truth and just shut up. I went upstairs to my room and I cried until I fell asleep. Exact situations like these would happen from when I was 7 - 12. Sometimes my mom would come to my room only to say to me, “why do you do cry when you’re the one who does this to yourself?? You have no reason to cry so stop crying if you don’t want to get your ears twisted off.” 

That obviously really impacted me growing up as a teen and into a young adult. I never understood what “talking back” was or what that meant because to me, was I supposed to stand there and get accused of lying when I truly wasn’t lying??? Or was I never allowed to share my feelings to my mom and have her understand me and help me process these feelings??? Was I not allowed to be understood? ?? Was I not allowed to have feelings??? To me, I never “talked back”. To me, I was always defending myself. I always felt like I had no choice but to do that. I always felt misunderstood because my mom never listened to what I had to say or believed anything I had to say. I became very frustrated and angry and eventually didn’t know how to deal with my emotions so I became a very quiet person in my teens/now. 

For some time, when my mom yelled at me for something, I would say something smart back just to piss her off because deep inside I was angry at her. I knew that no matter what I said, even if I “talked back” and told the truth, I would have still gotten yelled at so I decided to go ahead and give her what she told her I was giving her. Finally, one time I was just sick of my mom yelling at me for the same thing so I yelled right back at her, “I told you the truth when I was younger only to help defend myself but now, I am doing exactly what you say. I am giving you attitude and talking back for no reason to show you that this is what real attitude is and real talking back is.” To that, she chased me around the house and ended up twisting my ears and telling me that I am the worse child she ever had. Ever since that day, I said what I wanted to to my mom and never said a word to her again when she yelled at me. I just walked away or went to my room and cried. I gave up. I was only 12.

Now being 22, I just don’t know how to deal with my emotions anymore. I don’t understand everything clearly or why I am even writing this. I just feel frustrated and misunderstood again. I guess I don’t need advice. Was I wrong? Do I need to change something? Is there something wrong with me? I don’t know. I just don’t understand anything or myself anymore.

520,"I have a 14 year old daughter who is in middle school. 
She has gone from being an exemplary student to merely scraping by. The symptoms of her issues largely correlated with “being a teen” so we didn’t think much of it, and supported her while trying to get her back on track. 

Last month she started exhibiting physical symptoms, things you might not notice if you didn’t know her really well, which made me concerned. We have thankfully gotten the results from various tests, and she has 2 autoimmune diseases. 

I’m not sure if I should disclose any of this to her teachers/school. She will be receiving treatment but some of the damage isn’t reversible. It also may take some time and dosage tweaking to get to a better place, physically and mentally. She’s not going to improve overnight.

It’s not so severe that she needs an IEP, but I do feel like she might need to be afforded extra patience, and less bad cop from the teachers that have watched her grades slip and are clearly disappointed. ",08Feb2019,1

when i was 12 i was in a pretty abusive relationship with a girl who was 14/15. me being the very vulnerable CHILD i was, i let this girl be open about the relationship, which obviously led to it being very common knowledge between years and even teachers at school. i would never have let this go on now, but i didnt know how to say no to anyone. 

at the time i was someone who didnt have a lot of friends and the friends i did have were the social recluse type, but when i went into year 10/10th grade i fell in with a crowd that were polar opposites. i mean like the popular kids who smoked and drank. to this day those people occasionally take the piss out of the relationship i was in which has forced me way back into the closet and tell everyone im no longer interested in girls.

526,"I'm seeking advice or knowledge for a friend and her son, a young kid around 20...

In a nutshell, my friend's son and his wife and their 2 yr old child were living with his parents(my friends) And this is what happened:

Mother of the 2yr old suddenly decides she's ""homesick"" and was thinking of moving back in with her parents(which is a very unhealthy and unstable situation, but that's for another time) . She relays these homesick feelings to her husband and his parents(my friends), and says her husband can move in with her and child. A couple weeks later, the mother takes the child to visit her parents, then sends text saying, ""I think me and child are going to just stay here"" She wants her stuff and moves out. Husband pleads, texts, ""please don't do this to me and my family."" 

Fast forward about a week and the mother offers a ""visitation/custody"" plan. Says the husband can see his child 8 hrs two times a week, and no sleepovers. Husband then files for divorce and temporary custody. Wife gets papers in the mail, says her lawyer(I don't believe she had one) also proposed the 16 hrs/week visitation. Husband turns it down and says we'll let the judge decide.

So now, a month has gone by with zero communication from the wife. Husband has texted nearly daily asking to see his son, she has not replied. Her and her entire family has blocked him and his entire family on social media. They are no where to be found or heard from. So, it seems as if they have moved, they wouldn't moved far, probably just to wife's grandparents house a couple counties over. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, the worry and questions now are: Will they receive the court papers, if it is mailed as a certified letter to her previous address she has on file, if she has moved? What if a court date is set and she was to never receive the papers and doesn't show up? Is there anything he can do legally right now while awaiting court, to see his child?  

Any advice or suggestions will be greatly appreciated, Thanks in advance

528,"After work, I am very defensive, impatient and tired. The work that I do, requires this kind of mentality to get through the 8-13 hour shift.

When I get home, at least the night of and morning after, I can’t seem to shut it off. My poor boyfriend has to deal with my irritability.

Last night we met at Denny’s, and the worst and most horrible episode of my behavior happened.

When ordering I asked the waiter if they had mac n cheese. He was sure and so I tried explaining what it was and sort of asked again. In now way was I trying to give him a hard time, I was smiling and just trying to figure it out. 

Then right after I told my boyfriend what a pos my car is. Before I can elaborate why, he starts telling me how Boujee I’m acting. How I was treating the waitstaff poorly and that I shouldn’t be saying that about my nice car. 

I try to explain myself that I wasn’t trying to give the waiter a hard time. I’ve been a waiter and know what it’s like and always try really hard to be a courteous customer. I was trying to explain the now 5 things wrong with my car, when he kept telling me I’m acting all boujee and cutting me off. 

I got really pissed and threw all the money I made that night all over and said “fine take my money”, and stormed off home.

I came back, we finally talked things out. I apologized to the waiter that I was genuinely not trying to be rude and tipped him 300%.

I just feel so fucking shitty about what happened. How I handled things and made the waiter feel extremely uncomfortable. 

I dont know what to do. I feel like my bf should break up with me because I’m a huge pos and he doesn’t deserve that. I feel like maybe I should go to counseling. I tried that a few months ago and was really discouraged, because she was judging my occupation and would only nod her head the whole time.

529,"Right, so I have this person I care about rather deeply. Turns out, their parents are quite possibly abusive. It might be me overthinking things a lot, but problem is now that I think about it it makes far too much sense to not be true. They have rather deep mental health issues, especially anxiety and diagnosed depression, which I never really gave much thought to. However, they've accidentally told me a couple of things:

1. Their parents regularly abuse them (Not sexually, I hope to dear god) (To the point where they later faint and call me crying for help, or that one time where apparently they slapped them for telling them that they want to be an interior designer)
2. They're never happy for them, but they're happy for their siblings,
3. They have expectations that keep on rising to impossible heights, and I mean ""Your child is obviously studying day and night, still gets what is equivalent to a B and then you blame them for not being smart enough and demanding higher grades"".

Additionally, I would like to mention their seemingly non-existent self esteem.

So I'm just worried about them, a lot. Their parents appear to not exactly care for them in a way that benefits them. We're both couple years' worth under 18; What do I do?

536,"So, slight background. I have been in yhe restaurant industry for about 15 years, lived in the same city for about 23 years (30f). I have a nice resume with a emphasis on production and catering, but have also ran a few lines at nice restaurants. I now own my own food truck/catering company.

The business was not exactly my idea (my moms), but I ran with it anyways. It is a successful popular business and I'm getting calls and emails on a daily basis for future events.

537,"So a few weeks ago I guess I had accidently added my phone number on Instagram. Which led to someone from school finding me and adding me on there. I don't use my full name on social media because of my profession. I do run a public account however and therefore have no right to complain about privacy. Everything I post is open to the public to view. However I have always disliked people from school/family adding me on Instagram. The reason being is that I like having my own personal space on social media without feeling judged. I find people from my family/school have always let me down by talking about me or finding new ways to judge me. That being said my fear also arises from being bullied back in high school. My current friends on social media are my internet friends, and people I've become friends with solely over the internet and running a blog. They understand and appreciate me. We listen to the same music and stuff. And that is the kind of culture and positivity I want to foster. I like to keep a fine line between my professional and personal life to avoid unnecessary conflict. I'm just scared of blocking this person because I'm finally getting comfortable being who I am. I also don't know this person that well. Like they're in my classes, but we barely talk. It might be that they want to be friends with me or think I'm cool. It might also be they want to make fun of me, judge me. Hard to tell. I graduate in less than a year anyways so chances are I'll never see them again.

At the beginning of my senior year I blacked out in class and had a seizure.

555,"Hello all,
I'm an American student studying in Europe for my junior year. I'm living in a flat with 4 other people (two doubles and a single). We are part of a group (of which I won't disclose for anonymity) of ten people living in two floors of this flat. I'll cut right to the chase. I've been hooking up with a girl that lives right next to me. It's happened a couple of times (and has been great) but I don't really know what to do at this point. I like the girl but don't have much experience in the college/study abroad hookup realm to be honest so I don't know how to proceed. We've both talked to separate people in the flat about it. Her roommate is cool and was kind enough to give us their room once but the guy in the single that I talked to was very weird about it. He was kind of rude and told me to ""cut it off"" ASAP. 

Tldr: 
I'm going up with a girl that lives next to me in a foreign country for the next couple of months. I like her. One of our flatmates is being a dick about it. What do I do?
Up until this point I've been basically looking to New Girl for advice so I'll take anything. 
Thanks y'all

557,"Okay a little backstory first... my brother used to live alone before I asked him to move in with me and my S.O because he was losing a lot of weight from choosing his PC instead of eating, so I asked him to move in so he could always have a hot meal made for him since it was no big deal because he'd just eat with us, I could also watch his progress and help him put some weight on (he was 7 and a half stone at 20) looked really bad won't lie, since he's moved in he's been getting better and his self-esteem was improving maybe because me and my S.O were supporting him the best we could.

Well onto the problem we went out for a family dinner (Wednesday) and I specifically told all of the family NOT to talk about his weight and just talk about other things.... but then my Nan decided to in her infinite fucking wisdom talk about it even going as for to say he looked like a crack head because of his weight, he was obviously heartbroken and now he's just sitting in his room doing nothing looking upset. 

I told (I was seething)  my nan she went too far and I've cut her off ignoring her birthday which was today. I thought he'd get better but he's just getting worse I think, he's still eating but it kills me to see him like this. 

If anyone has any advice on how I can dig him out of this I would be more grateful than you can imagine.

561,"Hey reddit, 

I’m in a situation that I don’t know how to handle.

My younger sister (11) has been lying about doing her homework and apparently hasn’t done the entire week’s worth of it. Everyday when she comes home I ask her if she has homework and she says no.

Her teacher messaged my mom saying that my sister has a homework log. My mom’s response to it all is that “if the teachers think it’s the parents’ responsibility to get their homework done, then there’s something wrong.”

The problem I’m facing is how to help my sister stop lying. She’s lied before and gotten into a lot more trouble like when she stole something along with another student. 

She has a constant problem of lying. 
 
We’ve tried many methods, like reward system when she does good. Punishments when she does something really bad (not minor things like not putting her dishes away). 

My parents are from a third world country so their method of parenting is just yelling and taking things away. It obviously hasn’t worked.

My mom has basically put the issue on me to resolve and fix but I have no idea what to do.

When he went there and saw the cat, it was apparent to him that it was in a bad condition, it had been stepped on by a car and completely mutated its lower limb, it looked extremely sick and the people around there said that it hadn't eaten in 4 days. So he did what any sane person (in my opinion) would do, and took it to the vet. Upon examination the vet told him that the cat was in tremendous pain and there was no chance of survival as it has a sever infection even before the injury and his only option was euthanasia. My friend called the person that manages the rescue but did not receive any answer for 4 hours (which he spent in the vet waiting for the call from them) but time was going fast and he had to make a choice so he did what the vet had recommended. After 6 hours he received a call from the person who manages the group, so he told her what happened and she EXPLODED on him calling him a murderer and other disgusting things, she then proceeded to post on her social media stating that ""a person decided to end a precious life because it was the easy way out"" she made a whole video and even added pictures of animals that he rescued before just to taunt him. Following the post he received massive backlash and is being cursed left and right being called a murderer. She manipulated the publics view of the situation and lied about many things but we can't do anything because she keeps deleting our posts. She refuses to take down the video and continues to taunt my friend till this day. She calls us bullies for trying to defend him even though she is the one bullying, we asked her multiple times to take down the post as it has really hurt him and he's even contemplating suicide because of all the hate he is receiving. She says that she wont take it down but she might fix the post if he admits to being a murderer and writing a public apology letter.

572,"I’m a young teen and want more independence. I’m not trying to full on rebel I just want to feel like I have some control over own life. 

My mother is very protective to the point she won’t let me walk my dog in the front yard or let me check the mail alone.  It’s very irritating because I feel like she doesn’t trust me enough to be alone for a few moments almost like I’m a small child. 

I have not been able to go to social events because I don’t know all the exact details of my friends’ parents’ lives. For example, when I was finally able to sleepover at someone’s house she asked me about the parent’s dating life and other invasive questions. This somewhat hurts my chance of ever being able to have fun in a group or do anything without being watched by her. 

Whenever I ask to even go out and sit on the porch alone she tells me that I’ll get kidnapped or raped. I know these are real dangers for young teenage girls like me. But I live in a fenced in house in a very safe area and would be near help if I need it and I have a cellphone as well. 

When I try bringing things up like letting me sit outside alone or even just her letting me walk around the mall with friends while she is in a store close by she gets angry and yells. It’s very frustrating. When I’m frustrated I cry, she says that I’m having a tantrum and I need to calm down and won’t listen. I hate feeling like a small child by crying but it’s how I express I’m upset. 

My grandmother even keeps tabs on me a lot if my mother isn’t home. She stays downstairs at all times because of mobility issues. She tells my mom when I get home from school, what I eat when she isn’t home, and what I draw/paint when I work down there. My mother will search through my sketchbooks and when she found a picture she didn’t like she made me scribble it out with ink. 

She randomly decides to go through my phone contacts, emails, Internet history, and everything else. She yelled at me because I had a mutual male friend in my contacts and threatened to take away my cell service. As well she sometimes does this late at night, one instance was when she kept me up over an hour going through my emails and ultimately took my phone and yelled me for being awake. 

My brothers are both nagged by her constantly and she controls very tightly where my 19 year old brother goes w/ his car. 

My mother also cancels plans without asking me. She will sometimes decide to be “a better parent” by spending a day with me but refuses to do any activities I enjoy. When I told her about my problems at school she told me to read the Bible an get over it. 

Right now the only person I feel like I can trust is my 24 year old brother but he is busy most of the time so I hardly see him.

575,"Of course because it is 2019 most people at the ages of 16,17 and onward have mobile phones and social media such as snap chat meaning our small class of 20 people has a group chat. We use it to talk about non-college related activities such as sport or meeting with others and we also use it for college activities such as asking for help with studies. 

However recently in class a girl complained to the teacher about it saying how it was distracting and nobody even uses it for college related work. Their friend who isn't even in the group chat also agreed with them that it is harmful and got very angry storming to our class teacher to complain. We found out about this a few days ago when we were all called together and spoke to as a class and told that it is inappropriate as some people in the class are not finding it helpful and that we need to get rid of it. He also asked if people could leave the chat once they were in and we all explained that it was optional and nobody was being forced to stay in and they can feel free to leave at any time. He still proceeded it was harmful. I was sat there confused as to why we cant talk about whatever we want outside of our studies. Upon leaving the class many students left the group chat and now it is basically dead. These same students have caused drama in the class before complaining about the tiniest things to the same the teacher who takes what they say very serious and have even taken things into their own hands with asking students to stand outside the classroom and then proceeding to go outside and lecture them on what they have done wrong. I really wish i was joking.

We could just make another chat but we clearly are not going to add the people who complained as they don't like the chat and if we don't add them they will just ""snitch""on us anyway.

When I was 16 I got molested by my best friends fiancé.
They had a child together. I was so upset that someone dared to that to me. I took things to court because who the hell wouldn’t?! She begged me not to say anything because she didn’t want her daughter to grow up without a dad. Pathetic. I was/am livid that she would even consider that. We were best friends for 12 years. I knew her since pre-K and we even lived together for a little time . Her family were drug addicts and alcoholics. They didn’t give a damn about what happen to her. She lived with me for about a year and a half. My family treated her as her own. She was like a sister to me. 

After I file my report of what happened to me, I blocked her out of my life completely. I also block everyone she knew, even including all our mutual friends. She told everyone that it was a lie and that I ruined her family. 


But more women started to come forward and say that the same thing happened to them. After months of court, last year he finally went to prison for 10 years. 


After court I was broken and lost. Last year was so rough I never got a therapist because I was in between jobs and had such a hard time fitting in with any of them. The people were usually rude and it wasn’t something I enjoyed doing. 

I recently got a job but it brings me so much anxiety and hardship. 
It’s so out of my comfort zone and it something that doesn’t interest me at all. 
I’m a sales person at a technology store. I am supposed to go in tomorrow but I really don’t want to. But I feel like I always do that to myself. I just don’t like it. My co workers are always talk about weed and don’t teach me anything and they want me to be out on my own but I don’t even know what to say to someone. I have told management but they said they understand yet just want me out by myself on the sales floor. I also have a really rough time typing fast,spelling and saying weird words. So this job doesn’t seem like a good fit for me. But I don’t want to seem like a quitter because maybe I’m overreacting? :/ 
I used to be a dog groomer and love animals with a passion. But I haven’t found any job that are hiring that are dog/animal friendly. 

I’m very sad and wish death almost everyday. I feel like I have nothing to give this world or have the ability to do better. I hate how I have no friends and don’t do anything. But I hate when I got out and actually do something because my anxiety is so high. 
I do have a goals and things I would like to become. I just don’t have motivation or anything to make them happen. 

My mom said she would help me get a therapist. But I know she doesn’t have a lot of money and my other siblings always ask her for money. So I don’t want to do that to her.

I salute those people who can work full time and go to school because I could not. I started taking less classes a semester to eventually dropping out. I’ve gone from working in laundry to becoming a manager here but I often find myself wanting to leave. I half heartily fill out applications for other jobs  and get called or emailed but I chickened out due to the fear.
I would like some advise on how to proceed or taking the next step. I’d love to hear any stories of similar experiences. Thank you for reading.",08Feb2019,1
591,"Let me start with this; I have no eating disorders. Or at least nothing I'm conscious of. But I generally eat very little and barely feel any hunger. 

The problem is I'd like to start working out to gain some muscle but I know with my current diet I won't be able to. I'm also a vegan - I eat healthy food with good variety and try to avoid sugar as much as possible due to a medical condition that gave me a lot of headache a few years ago.

But how do I force myself to eat more or grow my appetite if most of the time I don't feel like eating? I'm in good health and I feel good in my skin but I'm afraid in the long run this could lead to problems other than not being able to put on a little muscle.",08Feb2019,1
592,"When I was a child in elementary school I was very vocal, extroverted and expressive. I could talk like a waterfall and always found the right words effortlessly. In school I would fluently speak to the entire class and the words just came naturally to me. Then in prep school when I was 10 the vicious bullying started, which I was not equipped to handle as I was a very sensitive child that wanted to be liked by everyone. It continued for years and took a huge toll on my mental health and personality, deteriorating over the years into a depression and social anxiety.

Instead of comfortably speaking I now could only utter short, simple sentences, stuttering while trying to remember the words I had laid out in my head. My body tensed up and my mind was in panic mode whenever I was around people.

Many years later at 18 and in university I started depression and anxiety medication causing me huge relief, plus I was forced to constantly challenge myself in my personal life so I could keep up with my social circle. I'm now much better at 23 but I'm nowhere near as outspoken as I was as a child, because I'm restricted to non-complicated sentences and I still struggle to hold a conversation fluently and naturally. Often times I simply don't know what to say in social situations because I never learned that going through puberty. How tf do you make small talk with strangers or acquaintances?? My mind just goes blank and I stand there like an idiot.

Am I ever going to regain the effortless, communicative skills I had before the traumatic experiences? How do I get them back?",08Feb2019,1

Very simple.
I can retract my foreskin except for a portion of it. This is because white stuff has built up behind that bit of the skin- probably smegma.

600,"Hey throwaway account!

So I’m (23F) just wanting to know if I’ve come across as a creep to a guy

I’ll start at the beginning - when my sister was younger in pre-school I used to be able to pick her up (before I started a full time job and just FYI I’m the sole carer for her) and there was a dad there that I ended up getting a crush on I was maybe 17/18 at the time, he didn’t look much older than me and he was never with his child’s mom - ok fair enough I had a crush. 
I then realised he worked in my local supermarket that I go in once or twice a week and I saw his name badge, I then asked my sister what his kid was called, (you know did a bit of social media stalking) 🙄 turns out he’s not with his child’s mom and we had some mutual friends on Facebook - I left it at that end of story and admired from afar because I’d never have the confidence to talk to him but what’s the harm in looking right? 

So fast forward a couple of years when I was about 21ish me and my friend were at her house -drunk- talking about boys and shit, for some reason I decided to show her his profile on Facebook and told her that I found him attractive. Then it was the next morning I woke up to a notification from Facebook saying he’d accepted my friend request 😱 my heart sank and I phoned my friend turns out when I went to the toilet after the conversation she’d friended him! I thought that it would have been weirder to delete him after he’d already accepted the request and have just kept him on there, a part of me actually wanted him to message me to at least have an (awkward) conversation. 

Currently he still works at the supermarket and I sometimes have to walk past him as he’s working, sometimes I catch him staring at me and other times he just keeps his head in his boxes. 

My question is does he just think that I’m some weirdo that friend requested him on Facebook having never had a conversation or is there a reason as to why would’ve accepted in the first place (his friends list is pretty short and he hardly ever posts on fb) and would it be weird to try and strike up a conversation after this long or to just delete him now?

I know I’m 23 but I’ve literally never dealt with dealing with crushes etc I’ve always just admired from afar because of confidence issues and social anxiety - if I’ve come off as creepy I would like to know ",08Feb2019,1

602,"To start this off, I need to give some background to the story. I am +18 and live with my mother/stepdad. For the most part I get along with them just fine(yes they have their habits but I can manage my annoyance with it), however there has been one exception that drives me up the wall. 

When my mom is out of the house, my stepdad will masturbate in the living room(Its right near the kitchen so if I need to get something, he's right there). I have caught him numerous times, however a few months ago I finally got the courage to tell my mother that it makes me uncomfortable(I have a lot of anxiety and its hard for me to speak up often). So I'm assuming that she informed him that I saw and didn't need to see that because there was an apology card left for me on my desk when I got home. 

Skip to a couple of months later, I come home from running an errand or two and hes doing it AGAIN. I do not understand why he has to do it out of his bedroom. I told my mom once again, but since then it has not been mentioned. When I brought it up to her, she responded ""well did he know you were home?"" and my thoughts on that are this: 

""Whenever I enter the space out of my bedroom do I have call out 'hey make sure you don't have your dick out because I'm around.' "" That just seems really odd and inappropriate to me. It's not like I was sneaking around the house, I made a stop to my bed room before trying to head to the kitchen and seeing him in the act. Also, how is he so brave to masturbate where anyone can catch him? It's **uber** fucking weird. He has some bizarre habits, but by far this is one of the worst of them or the worst of them.

603,"First, I know I made a naive mistake in not reporting this accident asap. I happened on October 4th 2018. I am wondering what I should do now...

I am licensed in WA state and was driving my WA plated car in Surrey BC Canada when a man hit and cracked my front fiberglass quarter panel in a grocery store parking lot. He had pulled in to his spot slowly and I was going in the opposite direction. I had to wait because he was in a Suburban and needed a wide turning range. There were 2 cars directly behind me, so I wouldn't be able to back up. After he pulled in, I began to move forward along with the cars behind me. That's when the guy started to back out again presumably to pull back into the spot and straighten out his angle. He had his window down and I laid on my horn because I couldn't back up nor race forward to get out of his way in time. He stopped, looked at me confused out of his open window, then started to back up again. I continued honking and the lady standing next to his car was shouting into his open window to stop! I think he must have thought I was honking to make him hurry? Otherwise I don't understand why he stopped, looked back at me, then just rammed into my car. He appeared to be over 80 years old, so although this might be presumptuous, maybe his depth of vision is going? I cannot hear out of my left ear at all since birth, so I know that the lady was yelling stop loud enough for him to hear, and my horn was blaringly loud.

We got out and exchanged all information including DL numbers, phone and addresses. I took a pic of his bumper where he hit me, the damage that it did to my car and of his car's license plate. I encouraged him to do the same thing, but he declined, saying that he didn't have a camera nor a smartphone. I eventually convinced him take a pic with his old phone because it was for his own protection. He was too busy complimenting me and agreed only if I stood in the photo. I think ladies will understand that accepting inappropriate flirting is something we do without really being conscious of it as a way to keep the situation safe and moving forward socially. We spoke about the damage and he said that he would pay me cash because BC insurance is crazy high (please no lectures on how naive I am, I know now how stupid this was to agree to in retrospect). I am 47 and have only been in one other accident, it was down in San Diego, where a teen boy hit me from behind while I was stopped at a red light. I was told that California is a no-fault state and that is why my rates went up! Because the damage was a simple clean crack and I wasn't excited about my rates going up for something that wasn't my fault again, I agreed to go get a few estimates and let him pay out-of-pocket.

The guy and I went to a few auto wrecking yards one afternoon but we couldn't find a match. He was returning my calls and honestly getting more flirty (kept inviting me to dinner to talk about the car and salsa dancing... he's from Brazil) but when I continued to decline he eventually stopped contact. I finally hand-delivered an auto body estimate to him at his door after weeks of him avoiding my calls. I've heard nothing back.

Today I called ICBC, BC's insurance car system, and was told to start with reporting the incident to my US policy. I was also told that I didn't need to call to make a police report, they don't takes reports for fender benders off of public roads. Finally the auto body mechanic told me that all parking lot accidents are deemed 50/50 fault by ICBC automatically.

Of course now I'm pissed that I was innocent enough to believe this guy would do what he said. I'm also pissed at the injustice that I now have a lower value car due to no fault of my own, and that I could pay higher rates. I'm having an all around immature hissy fit that things aren't fair! So honestly I'd like this guy to have some consequence, but that means reporting to my insurance company 4+ months late and risking a rate increase.

If I call my insurance company will I suffer a consequence for late reporting as well as my rates possibly going up? I'm not sure what to do...",08Feb2019,1

607,"I have feelings for a guy who hurt me a lot. I told him I needed space only for him to tell me a week later he'd started self-harming because of me. He made me promise not to leave and told me he loved me. He was being neglected by a bunch of his friends as well, and so I tried to help him in part because I really cared and in part because I wanted to atone. Unfortunately, turned out he was just using his relationship with me as a stepping stone to get back in with the ones who neglected him in the first place -- they're also a subject of profuse anger on my behalf because they just go around hurting loads of people and don't give a shit about it. We argued a lot, he unfairly took issue with me having feelings for him (I mean, I tried to resolve it in the first place), and then he nearly hit me at a party. I'm not blameless, but this has all left me feeling incredibly guilty, worthless, and all in all generally quite depressed.

I've recently started talking to him again after four months and these feelings are resurging. On top of the abundant stress I'm having to manage already with family, work, and university applications, this is crippling me. Due to certain social circumstances, there is no way to avoid him without completely isolating myself. He's thus far been uncooperative when I've tried to discuss it with him. Regrettably, what I chose to do in order to feel a little bit better -- it's tided me over for a little while -- was to tell him exactly what he did to me and to hold him accountable for it. This isn't healthy, that's not fair on him, and I just want to be done with all of this. Does anyone have any advice on dealing with it? Thanks.",08Feb2019,1
608,My girlfriend and I got into an argument about her not admitting when she’s wrong. From her POV she says that she can admit when she’s wrong without actually saying it then she starts to blame things on me and try to make me think that I’m wrong in a situation where I couldn’t possibly be and I try to see from her perspective and think about if something that I did or said could actually hurt her and when there is something I apologize and make it clear that I was wrong and that I’m sorry. From my point of view she’s just warping reality in her favor so she doesn’t have to crush her fragile ego. Should I let it go when I know that she’s wrong and she doesn’t see it? Is it too much to ask of her to admit when she is wrong? I told her I want to talk through this but she said she doesn’t want to talk which is understandable I’m giving her space but I made it clear to her that this isn’t going anywhere until we get to the bottom of it and I don’t want this to get between us. I’m aware making me think that I did something wrong when she did is emotional abuse but I don’t think she realizes that it is and before I leave I just want to know if I can get her to see that and get her to start admitting when she’s wrong so we can conclude arguments so they don’t keep coming up.

610,"So I caught my son searching for pornographic videos today. He was in his room watching youtube on my nintendo switch when I called him and he didn’t answer so I went to go in but the door was locked. This isn’t normal and he was already in trouble for fighting with his brother so I had a feeling he was hiding something. I used my fingernail to turn the lock and caught him trying to clear the search history. We were able to talk and I explained why he should not be looking up that stuff and that he should not have betrayed our trust by looking at inappropriate things behind our backs. I told him he can come to us and ask anything he wants. I also made sure to talk to him again and remind him about inappropriate touching and asked if anyone has made him uncomfortable or try to touch him in any sexual or even non-sexual but abnormal way and he said no.

The situation of catching him is not really what I am currently upset about. I am upset because when I asked him how he heard of sex he told me it was on my dads computer. I am going to give some background before going on: my son, husband, and I moved a state away from my parents when my son was 3-4. He would go and visit with them every other weekend from Friday night to Sunday night and I trusted them to take care of him and obviously monitor him when he would play on the computer and/or PS4. Well my son is stating that he found out about porn and sex because of thumbnails my dad had on his desktop. My son learned to read right around 5 so he of course was able to read the thumbnail titles by that age. He said that he didn’t know what the words meant so he searched them on youtube and was able to find videos. He also stated that at one point my sister caught him and my parents had a talk with him. I was told about this incident but not in detail, they basically just made it seem like he was on youtube and he accidentally clicked or got to an inappropriate video, also stating that it was really quick and that “he didn’t see anything”. 

Now that I know what really happened and know that they withheld information from me about my own son  I am pissed and not sure how to go about talking to them or confronting them. I don’t even know if I should say anything as they now rent my finished basement/apartment from me and my son will visit with them but isn’t allowed on the computer down there. I am mad that by not telling me the full truth I wasn’t able to talk to my son and explain anything and that I wasn’t able to make sure they were ACTUALLY monitoring him like they should have been. I am mad my dad even thought it was okay to have those thumbnails on his desktop knowing my son would see them and eventually figure out what they were. I am mad they didn’t take this more seriously and monitor him correctly as he confirmes he was able to watch videos sometimes still at their house even after getting in trouble. I know my husband and I are to blame for trusting him with things like the switch and the playstation and we were ignorant to think he would choose to do the right thing. We are also to blame for not making sure out son could come talk to us about these things and though we did not expect to have this conversation with him at 8 we should have done more to be aware of what he can be exposed to on a daily basis.

Just today I'm trying to help mitigate damage from a mess created by him while I was at work. A little backstory, my spouse is an up and coming musician, unfortunately this seems to make him a target for all sorts of scams not sure why. He unfortunately lost access to his FB page because some one in a middle eastern country was able to access the email associated with his account and his music page, they changed all his passwords and enabled 2 factor authentication on both the email and fb for their phone number.  So this is an issue we've been trying to resolve. Today I thought ""hey we should try to see if we can get in touch with yahoo support and get access to it."" Ususlly I'm the one who takes care of all this stuff because he's pretty computer illiterate. But today he without my help googled yahoo support and literally called the first number that showed up in the google search results. I'm decently computer savvy so if I'd been there I would have told him why that was a completely dumb idea to just google a tech support number. Long story short he gives them access to his personal computer where they install a bunch of bullshit and then on top of that he gave them access to our debit card info for our joint account. While I was at work he texted me and told me he was on a call with support. I asked him to give me some information about who he was talking to, how he got the number and I asked him to given me the phone number. I immediately knew it was a scam, I literally argued with him over text messages while he was still on the phone with them that it was a scam. He wouldn't believe me outright but I sent him a bunch of screen shots of the reverse number search I'd done to prove it to him. But by that time they'd already hit our account and were attempting to draw additional funds. Now we're in a state where I'm not sure what we're at risk of. I had him call the bank deactivate his debit card and change passwords/usernames for all if his accounts but at this point I'm not sure what's all on the computer. I've told him as of right now not to do any thing on there that involves putting in personal information and had him remove the ethernet cable.



So that's what happened TODAY; meaning this isn't the only incident of this nature (if I were to go over every incident we'd both be here for hours, me typing and you reading). We've probably lost thousands of dollars and electronic devices because he just refuses to apply common sense and thought to his actions. At this point I'm incredibly frustrated and I don't know what to do about it because I feel like these things continue to happen and the only person I can really depend on is myself. I hate feeling like the only real adult in this relationship. I have to pay all the bills, and pretty much handle anything that is really important to our financial success. On top of that I work full time and am running my own business on the side. At first I was sure that I wanted to have kids with him but now I have thoughts along the lines of what happens with x y and z occurs. I feel like that will put too much mental labor on me to be the sole person responsible in the household especially if we add kids to the mix...

On top of this he's hard headed and won't listen to me when I advise against him doing something.  Its only in the aftermath that he looks at the situation and says ""baby I know you told me not to do this thing but I'm sorry I'll listen next time""


I have talked with him about this several times in fact and there's been no change, instead I get continual promises to do better...to be better. Yet I've seen no improvement. I'm not really sure what I can do, if there's some sort of class I can put him in or... I could really use some advice I'm desperate.",08Feb2019,1

May told me what happened a day later, and since I’m usually the person who tries to stick up for my friends, I confronted Clarie. I asked Claire why she cursed out my friend, and she simply said “cuz I felt like it” when I tried to tell her that was an immature, and honestly pointless reason, she told me to “shoo”.

I insisted that Clarie apologize, but all she ever did was curse me out as well. 
I now have been ignoring her for a couple months, and I feel like I should talk to her but not sure how. She’s unapproachable, has an outrageous attitude, and isn’t at all kind. But I feel like it’s time for me to confront the problem instead of letting it fester, since ignoring it won’t help (and I feel in this case that ignoring is a bit childish)

My mother recently passed away and my whole living situation is f**ked in the worst way. My uncle who is a massive control freak made my 21 year old sister take me in and she didn't want to and i don't blame her.  Me and my uncle are never on the same page, he wants me to join the military and went through great lengths to call me a failure and such when i told him i wanted to do music even comparing me to my other cousin who is now in jail on assult with a firearm charges(i swear im being sincere and i know this story sounds crazy but please i just really need some outside advice from people) i tried repairing but he took things i said out of contexext and doesn't like me anymore. I no longer want a relationship with him but it isn't because i don't love him, i just don't like him and every single thing i do is seen as evil and me  just trying to manipulate people in order to get something from then. My mother's passing made me change my attitude and i tried showing him and i mean really i did try. But nothing works. Along with that my aunt is like threatening me and then saying she said nothing of the sort, then calling me a coward when i don't want to talk to them because they rhink they're right and stuff.

622,"Hello all, I know this is going to sound stupid, but... I have continuously struggled with whether or not I should put down on documents that I am Hispanic or not. I know there is a difference between Hispanic and Latino. From what I understand, and correct me if I am wrong, this is just what I have been told by people who claim to be Hispanic - Hispanic means you're from Latin America and can speak Spanish, and Latino means you have the ancestry from Latin America but you don't necessarily have to speak Spanish.

&amp;#x200B;

My father is from Mexico and very obviously Mexican and my mother is white and from the USA. When I took an Ancestry DNA test, it says I am ""34% Native American"" and it's talking about North America in general? To understand what I mean, [here is my ethnicity estimate.](https://imgur.com/DjcqoA5) [Here is where it includes Mexico.](https://imgur.com/a/c2vkHlc) I did not grow up with my biological parents and I cannot speak Spanish, only a few words.

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is, do or should I put that I am Hispanic? Am I Hispanic?

Sometimes I put it down and sometimes I don't, which probably isn't a good thing. But I have always been confused about it. This is so stupid but, please, Educate me, Reddit!",08Feb2019,1

625,"Hi guys. I currently switch between 2 pairs of Nike air max tavas. They are around 7 years old. Let me explain a little bit on why I am asking for recommendations.

I work 2 jobs. One that's 10 am to 7 PM and another that's 11.15 PM to 3.15 am. They are both 5 days a week. The office job I wear dress shoes so dont need a recommendation on that. However, my night/morning job is at the largest fulfillment center for the worlds largest fulfillment company. I'm sure you can guess but it starts with Amazon. The job is 4 hours of no sitting, walking around carrying and moving packages of all size. The floor is some of the most dense concrete I've ever had the opportunity to stand on. I'm just looking for some new shoes recommendation from the reddit community that will not only help my sore feet but also help me with having less smelly feet. I also have a dog I try to walk 3 to 4 times a day at 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I am a very clean person and I scrubbed all parts of my body every day and also get in between my toes as good as possible.

I trust your answers more than seo triggered google search results and my friends seem to only recommend these designer collector $300 shoes that dont seem worth it. I hope to hear some good advice from you guys.

628,"So I honestly don't know where to go, so I'm coming here. My girlfriend's mother is being really really controlling over her, and it is becoming unhealthy for her to live in her own household. Any advice for me? Some backstory for you all now. Last year, we both went to summer camp together, but the reason (for her) was that her mother was kicking her out of the house for the summer. She ended up loving it, and I didn't think much of it then, but since the new school year started, it has been getting worse and worse. Her mother refuses to allow her to have any sort of opinions in the house, if she voices her disagreements, she punishes her. She recently got a job at a place so she could get some cash toward a car, but when she found another job that paid better, but her mother refused to allow her to quit the first job, and is now working two jobs on top of balancing schoolwork where she is trying her best to bring up her struggling GPA. Recently, her mother signed her up for a ""self improvement and positive appreciation"" class, because she took it, and said that if she did not take the class (she did not want to), she would refuse to take her to the DMV for her license. The thing that broke it for me was that today during school, she passed out from dehydration and slight malnutrition (Not an eating disorder or issue with her mother, she had recently been very sick and couldn't stomach much). However, her mother is still making her go to these classes against her wishes, after she literally had to be brought home from the school in an ambulance. (the class is today). I have asked her about living with her father, or a friend, or even calling social services, but she cannot. In order to get a car, she needs to work, and living with her dad or a friend means she will not be able to to get to work. Please, if anyone has any ideas, or wants any more stories about her living conditions, my comment section is open and waiting.

I spent the last couple of years thinking that I was good with my finances but recently have come to the realization that I'm not. It's not super expensive stuff that I buy it's little ticky tacky things usually for hobbies that I get that I think will make me happier. Because of this I'm not able to save that much money.

I feel like it's a mindset thing that if I can get this thing it'll make my life better but I realize in the end it doesn't. I'm also slightly OCD so organizational items are a huge draw to me.

630,"Recently I adopted a pet from craigslist where the poster states the puppies are 8 weeks old. I took the puppy to the vet today and learned the puppy is actually 3-4weeks old. I have been reading a lot about puppies and read that in most states it is illegal to remove and sell a puppy before 8 weeks of age because their critical developmental stage is 4-8 weeks. Puppies learn essential skills from their mother starting at 4 weeks. Otherwise, ""a puppy that is separated from his mother before 7 weeks is often nervous, prone to excessive barking and more likely to bite. He is also likely to be difficult to train and won't socialize well with other dogs or people"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel absolutely terrible that the puppy was taken from his mom before he was ready. I want to take him back to the original owner to request that the puppy remain with the mother for another month and a half. We've only had the puppy for 5 days.

He messages me...we talk everyday...we make plans about traveling together. I'm really excited at this point because i've had pretty bad luck with stuff like this.

634,"Just for some context, I’m a female, currently on a mental health leave from freshman year of college, and I have PTSD, as well as social anxiety and depression

My PTSD is from abuse I suffered mainly from ages 3-12 through at the hands of one of my parents (physical and mental) and my teachers (verbal/mental), and expereienced a lot of bullying from my peers (since my teachers had no problem abusing me in front of them, they thought it was okay to do the same, or at least that’s my explanation)

I started experiencing depression for the first time in 3rd grade, and even though I had a couple “friends” I always was too “sensitive” or “weird” for them and they took it upon themselves to “correct” things I did and liked.... I guess they just wanted to be “popular” or whatever, but come 8th grade I just went full on selective mutism come the middle of the school year, wouldn’t talk in class, hated group work, and despised all my classmates, again I had a small group of friends, but every time I got depressed they always “had it worse” or took it upon themselves to just tell me it was my fault, it ended in a huge argument at the end of the year and I was offically alone.

I went to a vocational high school, and it took me until sophomore year to find a small group of people I got along with, and who took the time to understand my mental struggles, and who didn’t blame it on me, the only problem was, I ended up in the hospital for mental problems junior year, and then come senior year, they all finished their schooling up at local colleges that worked with my school, hence they got the college mentality before they even graduated, and I was yet again abandoned, this time though I developed a thick, calloused, “ I don’t give a fuck” mentality, and couldn’t stand the remaining senior class and their antics, so it was a me against them mentality I started. It was my fault, and I knew everyone hated me near the end, but all I cared about was getting the hell out of there

I graduated and went to college, alone, with no one, I was close with two peers during the fall semester but that ended once the semester came to an end.

My experience with friendship hasn’t been a good one, The only person I’ve had consitiantly in my life is my now Boyfriend, he’s been trying to help by introducing his friends (he’s very extroverted) to me, but that really doesn’t last even though he says they like me. I don’t have friends of my own, I’m too scarred to make friends in my opinion because no one wants to put up with my bullshit, and it’s not like I was exactly socialized correctly or like I have skills to make friends, teachers were too busy making sure I stayed their punching bag to realize what they were doing, and I don’t exactly have the highest self esteem or worth, in fact I’d say I have more skills to hide away from people to prevent myself from getting hurt yet again than anything

I’m going to my doctor to get a referral to a trauma informed therapist and to possibly go on medication for the time being..... but I wonder if I’m fixable when it comes to this “making and keeping friends” problem I have, or if I’m just screwed to be practically alone all my life",08Feb2019,1
635,"My manager is nice but I hate getting pushed to do something like taking on a shift I don't want, which is something these managers do... So stupid me agreed to do it because she basically asked nicely. This is equivalent to getting pushed around, not something I'd like being a habit.

I don't want to work mornings for several reasons:

Both staff members and customers in the morning shift (7 to 15, but wakeup at 5 to get there) are obnoxious and bitter. Not a good environment.

I just managed to fix my sleep schedule  and this will fuck it up again and I will be groggy yet again and have to work at my schedule until manager decides to put me on morning again...

The idea of a morning shift is to get in early and go out early but my experience is that the whole day is essentially wasted as you wake up early, get home tired and unmotivated and go to sleep early. Bullshit. 

I am simply unwilling to work a morning shift, I agree even though I care little about money or the place.

638,"I [18/f] have been with my boyfriend [17/m] for a year as of tomorrow. Tonight is his best friend Tristan’s birthday party. The people invited weren’t people I typically talk to but we all know each other. My boyfriend asked Tristan if I could come considering multiple guys were bringing their girlfriends, and he said it was cool. I was slightly nervous at first because I’m not the most social person, but I worked myself up to believe that I’d have a good time. 

Today, his other friend, Jerrad, called him and said that I couldn’t come (which was odd because it’s not HIS birthday nor HIS party). My boyfriend asked why not and he said that both him and Tristan don’t like me and think I’ll be too antisocial and cause problems. You would think that they’d have past experiences to back this statement up, but they don’t. I’ve never caused problems with them nor have I proven to be antisocial or given them any reason to dislike me. Jerrad has never liked me because my ex told him lies and he believed every bit of it. Either way, it was never any of his business and I shut the rumors down.

At that point, my feelings were very hurt. My options were to either go and feel uncomfortable because they made it sound like nobody wanted me there, or just stay home and let my boyfriend handle it. I decided to stay home because I felt that it was the best option considering how hurt my feelings were. 

What makes me really upset is how I was going to buy Tristan a gift because I thought “he didn’t HAVE to invite me so I should show my appreciation”. I never had the opportunity to do this because he followed (and has always followed) Jerrad’s word. I’ve been crying for quite some time because I feel so unwanted for something I never did to deserve this. Any thoughts? Thank you very much in advance. ",08Feb2019,1
640,"I've always been a bit reserved and having a few friends, but those people are the real ones. Since im going to a school w/12 kids next fall, I want to get out of my shell. I know, VERY small, its so small since its so new, as of September 2018. Now you might be saying ""how can a high school function like that"" well they have schools across the world, which is awesome. So, since I've been accepted to the school, I feel like a lot people will like me as a person. Not many people, I would say 70-80% of people in my grade HATE me. I honest dgaf, cause they won't ever see me again after may 29th, cause thats when we leave for summer. I talk with like 4 kids from the school already, and they're so nice to me. The reason I wanted to go there, was it was so different from the local high schools. The school teaches in a socratic method, which is no testing, discussion, and thinking about what they learn, and tie all the subjects together. Another reason is, is the kids dude. OH MY GOD, are they nice. No one argues, no one complains, no one distracts, no one bullies, no one does anything to hurt you, they are just nice genuine people. I went to a dance last month for the school at my church, and two girls offered to dance with me, girls dont even talk to me at school. From what I've been told from the kids that go there, that they are really excited for me to come there next year. Ya know, people dont come up to me at my school, everyone hates me, well im sorry I can't be everyone's friend ffs. But at this new school, I dont even go there and I already feel like I go there. At an open house, I was just noodling on a piano after the presentation was over, and a girl that went there came and sat down next to me on the piano, and we talked for a while, and she was so nice. No one at my school will even acknowledge me ffs.

I feel I might snap and have a mental breakdown I just cried my eyes out because I don’t know what to do. I have never had major help in my life my first car was bought by me. I grew up on bare to no food my siblings and I took care of each other while my mom was partying and being a stripper she was never home. Middle school my “Dad” took me in I put the parenthesis because my mom doesn’t know my dad who is my brothers dad might be mine and he is currently living in Mexico. However my dad just gave me the bare essentials and  a stable environment to do good in school. Never really went out of his way to help only for his kids. which is another story I’m grateful he helped me escape from my bipolar mother who would be nice to me one second and yell at me the next hour everyday. So I moved to my dads which I’m pretty sure was so he didn’t have to pay child support. I wrestled majority of my life and wasn’t too bad I’ve won many tournaments. However in high school my only escape was stripped from me after wrestling practice at a neighboring college that recruits people from my school. My shoulder was torn rolling around in pain screaming after a while the pain stopped hurting  but not gone. It took a while I wanted
to get checked out but my dad didn’t want to take me  and I couldn’t go I live 10 miles from any hospital near me and I have no car. He didn’t think I was that hurt but I was walking around school holding my shoulder any movement sent a shock of pain up and down from my shoulder. And before that I fractured my leg and walked on it for a week then my dad took me to the hospital to show me I was overreacting. Nope fractured during football could’ve been worse if continued to walk on it. So now my only chance to get a scholarship is out the door. Then I graduated with a 3.5 Gpa. So my senior year I made my dad take me to the dmv so I can’t get my license and buy a car with my money by working framing during the summer. Then I graduated with a 3.5 Gpa. I moved out after the summer after I graduated and moved with classmates to an apartment. We all signed a lease for a year now they’re moving out shortly after signing now I have to pay 800$ a month and I can barely afford that I worked two jobs I am a Electrical Apprentice +farmhand and fast food. I saved up for a second car and way better which I thought and quit fast food. My dad told me to get it from his friend so I did. It broke down just recently and now my other car just broke down and I personally can’t afford to fix it because all my money is going to rent now.

To make a long story short after helping my grandfather with some jobs over the summer  (He was a freelance surveyor at the time) I asked if I could stay with he said yes and I now live with my grandpa and his wife (I'm not blood related to her) it's a pretty good situation and I get along and love bothers of them.

She keeps saying things like she Hope's he doesn't come back and there is nothing here for him. She is also pretty loopy at times and can just be straight up dumb but I still love her. She also keeps wanting to sell the house and keeps saying that its hers. While she does pay the mortgage my grandpa pays all the bills (electricity,water,etc) and she couldn't live on her own since the only form of income she has is social security.

I started to see more and more signs about me not liking the company of people I didnt know. So I thought I just was an introvert. After the first semester of middleschool I actualy had to preper to give out presentations which I never had to. But still didn't think much of it. At the time all of this was happening I was playing on the saxophone. I was playing concerts and all of that if I had the chance. But I started to cancel all the concerts that I was offerd. Still didn't think it was anything bad. Since i watch alot of Jaidenanimations I knew what it was. I was really relating to her so I thought that I mabey have it. I take some random test online on some psychological site. Turns out I got aperantly did have social anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

FFW to second year of middle school. At around December I started to feel kind of empty inside. I didn't feel happy. I find some random dating/friendship server thinking i might find someone just like me. I found a girl that lives in US. She was a year older then me. She did have social axiety and she said that I was probably just an introvert. I agreed and went on with my day. After a month of talking to her she quits discord and social for a while. My days were very lonly so she was really the only one I could and wanted to talk to. When I was talking to her I didn't feel sad anymore. But since she left the sadness came back. I was more and more anxious about going to school everyday. I was trying to avoid people, and if I didn't have my firends around me at all times at school I would try and find a nice and peacefull corner to avoid people. I wasn't sick for the whole first semester. The first month of the second semester I felt more and more sad and empty inside. I was trying to talk to my friends but for them it just seemed as another ""meme"". I said that it's actually serious and all their advices just seemed to me like 'just dont be sad LOL' thing. I finally got sick in the second semester. I was gone from school for a week. After I was good enough to go to school I was REALLY anxious. I was waitng for class to start and my heart was racing. I was stressed as hell and I just wanted to get out of the class. I asked my teacher if we could talk. She said yes. We go outside the classroom to talk. I say that I get very anxious and stressed around a large groups of people. I also asked her if i could sit in the back of the classroom since i sat in the middle of it which made it even worse. She says yes. The rest of the day I spent inside the classroom whenever there was a break. This just made me more and more sad.

I started to sleep at day which i could never do. All i want to do is just sit inside and not have any contact with the outer world but the internet.",08Feb2019,1
649,"I am still processing this interview. The hiring managers body language was 100% uninterested. First thing he says when he sees me is “a lot of people applied for this role” but then also says someone else may be out the door. I let it sink in. 

Prior to the interviewing even starting he has this alarmed look on his face when he sees me. I try my best to ignore but it’s obvious I’m not what he was expecting. I get feedback 20 mins into the interview. I mean I don’t think I’ll take this job even if it was offered to me! I am just in shock.

650,"I'm 25. Recent single. I want to make friends so bad, feel alive. My old school friends don't even have enough moola for a pint. Currently, 3 pints and 2 G&amp;Ts down and feel like a loser. Just want to go out and dance and have no one to do that with. Help! Spend every weekend feeling like a hermit when I should be feeling like Beyoncé. 

Ps hope Brit people get this reference ",08Feb2019,1
651,"My friend is from Poland and she has suicidal thoughts, she says she's helpless, I tried to help her and tell her to try and get help, I gave her ways to contact a suicide hotline in her area but she didn't listen, she told me to leave it and I really don't know what to do.

I'm really concerned, should you guys respond and then I'll show her this post? I even told her to seek advice on this sub but I don't think she will.",08Feb2019,1
652,"throwaway account here.

My life is in shambles. I've truly hit rock bottom. I am $22k in student loan debt, and another $2,500 in credit cards and old apartment fees. I have been sent to two collection agencies based on my credit card and apartment. I was supposed to be in medical school, but I squandered my undergrad and am stuck at a 2.4GPA. I scored a 522 on the MCAT (which is a very high score), but know no medical school will accept me. I moved back home with my parents, but I have yet to be able to find a job and have been completely lost on what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a grad program option available for me to enroll in, which is more or less a 'gateway' to medical school, but I need a 3.0gpa to get in. That would be 58 more credit hours worth of classes, which I know I can do. My dream is to become a doctor, but I didnt get my head out of my ass until this past year. Now, my parents have told me I have until April to pack my things and go, which I dont blame them for. I had a plan to have a fulltime night-shift job by now, and work full time while paying a friend $300/mo while taking out loans to pay for my classes. At this point, I dont think I can even get federal loans for more classes. I just got a rejection email from the company I applied to. And my friend told me he has plans to move. I'm trying hard not to think about ending it all, and just need some guidance toward the light at the end of the tunnel. Please.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr -- I fucked around in my undergrad and am now paying the price with a useless biology degree. I wanted to be in medical school by now, but my shit gpa is holding me back. I had plans to bring it up to a competitive level and try to slip my way in, but everything fell apart and now I just want out. I'm also $25k in debt and collections are chasing me every chance they get.",08Feb2019,1
