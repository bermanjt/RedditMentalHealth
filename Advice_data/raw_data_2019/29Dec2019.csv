3,"This question is quite unorthodox but it's been bugging me. 3 of my closest friends, all 16 years old have been watching some really disturbing things recently, including videos of people getting ran over, people drowning and other various gory and horrific videos. I've been sent links to r/eyeblech , which were just horrific gory content and disgusting things. What worries me even more is that one of them was watching a video, which he told me was a video of a baby being run over by a train. I asked him why he was watching it and he said ""entertainment. These things don't faze me"". I'm not sure if this is normal between people of my age or if this is genuinely sadistic. Any words of advice/ opinions?",29Dec2019,1
5,"I’ll try to keep this story as concise as possible.

A month ago, a friend of mine got hired at the same place that I work at, and is being kept past the seasonal period (Christmas basically). Prior to this, I’ve had run in with a particularly bad co-worker and have made it very clear that I’m there to work and get the job done right, not to make pals with him. He has a tendency to steal, and is generally lazy. 

Today I found out that my friend (the newest hire) was threatened by him. Allegedly he kept pushing her to tell him things I’ve said about him. For 20 minutes straight she was pushed. Eventually he blocked her, preventing her from doing her job, in order to get information from her. Eventually she gave in and said something I had said, that was reasonable, and not actually bad. He then told her that if she told ANYONE about him asking, or didn’t tell him if I said anything, that he’d either report her to my boss, or tell me that she was talking bad about me behind my back. 

I want my friend to feel safe in the workplace, and right now she doesn’t. Is this worth taking to HR? I talked to my parents about it in confidence and they told me it wasn’t worth stirring up more drama with the shift leaders at my workplace.",29Dec2019,1
7,"These exams basically are the final exams I take before I finish school and either get a job or go to college. 

But for the absolute life of me I can't get myself to study. I'm somewhat on top of all my school work, I do all my work set for me, my homework is finished on time. But when I finish my homework given I procrastinate so much to the point where it's absolutely ruined my sleep schedule. 

I actually wanted to learn how to weld, do mechanical stuff on cars, anything before I actually wanted to study for my exams. 

It's absolutely ruined my brain, I try to sleep at night but can't at the thought that I've fucked myself. I have mock examinations at the start of February, hopefully they'll be a wake up call but by then I presume it'll be too late. (Actual exams are like end of June start of July.) 

I panic at the thought that I'm going to fuck up, it rattles my head constantly at night.

I have An Irish oral exam soon, I can't speak a word of Irish other than the basics I learned when I was like 6-7. I actually try to study but when I still fails tests in class it's bad.

Now I can barely function. I’m 21 (F). I’ll forget what I’m googling in the middle of typing it out. I can barely contribute to conversations cause everything is ‘on the tip of my tongue’ but I can’t remember what I was going to say. I’ll get ideas that I can’t wait to research, then forget what it was even about within less than a minute. I don’t even have time to write it down, usually. 

At one point, I took to carrying a pen and paper around just to so I could write things down so I wouldn’t forget, but my boss got irritated. 

I had to drop out of college cause I was failing everything that in the past, would have been a breeze. Now, I struggle with basic calculus (I try to follow along with YouTube videos to keep my mind sharp, but it’s not working)

I drove for work, the same roads, every single day (pizza delivery to get me through college), but started getting so lost cause I couldn’t remember very well where the right streets were.

13,"Hello everyone.

I currently work at a software/SEO company and about 2 months ago we hired a guy to write down English articles and such. As the friendly guy I am, I befriended this new guy instantly and a byproduct of that he and I would talk about personal stuff. At first it was alright but as time went on, I realized later on that this guy doesn't like atheists (I am an atheist) but he tries not to say anything negative to me because he is kind of a pussy. 

On top of this, he hates the U.S. (I love the U.S.) So there is always a little bit of tension between us because of this as well. I can control my anger but sometimes what this guy says is so absurd to me that I just want to smack him in the face. We work about 10 feet from each other at different desks and it's just me and him. Our boss stays in the office for about two to three hours a day. Unfortunately, we both smoke and often smoke together and get into conversations inevitably. 

The real tension started when I heard him say “I want Sharia law in my country”. My response was “So you want people to like me to be killed?”. He was like nah that's not what I mean blah blah, and tried to soften the conversation, you get the picture. I am a very talkative and friendly person but I just don't want anything to do with this guy. 

My thinking now is if I tell him that I don't want to talk about anything besides work will make the tension higher. What can I do to keep things calm between me and him without getting into politics (we're very, very opposite) and this kind of stuff? I really don't want to play with anyone's bread so I'm up for some advice.",29Dec2019,1
15,"so some time ago I met a girl online and we got along really well. We always texted each other very long messages (taking a day or two to write and answer them) over maybe 2 months - she even told me she never texted that much with anyone before and it was the same for me.

at one point her what's app had some issue on her phone and the messages she send didn't reach me. A few days later she asked me if I received her last messages and told me about her problem.  I left her last message unanswered and we haven't talked since.

that was almost 6 months ago. 

I don't know why but recently I had to think about her again and wanted to ask how she's doing etc. maybe reactivate our old relationship or end it if she doesn't want to reconnect. (in my mind it's just a thing that never really got any closure)

If I still had her phone number I'd just send her a normal text asking but I got a new phone and all my old contacts are lost.

so I just thought I could google her name + city and might find a facebook or twitter profile (I didn't have her last name but her first name is kinda uncommon where she lives, so I thought I might be lucky)  
the first result that came up was her profile on some linkedIN-like website. very official/business heavy thing. 

now I really don't know if I should text her over said website (I'd have to create an account just for that).  
 we never met irl and while I'm sure she remembers me I really don't want to be invasive, make her uncomfortable or look like a stalker.

should I try to text her or just live with the unrest in my mind until it dies down?

18,"Guys,

I think I am on my way to become an alcoholic and I am unsure if I want to fix it. 
Where should I begin. Maybe some financial background. I am married with about 300k saved up in cash. My wife has another 200k saved up in cash. But we are not happy, or should I say I am not happy?
I make about 400k a year before stocks but work is stressful. I used to love every single part of my job/past jobs but ever since the acquisition, I hated every part of my job - to me this is a huge issue. I heavily rely on my career satisfaction to make myself content. So yeah...

Onto my marriage - my wife(30F) is a loving woman that is extremely easy going. She loves life and loves her family. But to me, this is all too boring and undisciplined.  To me , in order to achieve happiness, one must be disciplined. As you can guess, my wife is not like that. Our sex life is almost non-existent. We fuck like once... 4 months. I resort to jacking off which I think is extremely sad. (She has no issue with sex, I am the one that do not want to engage).

Now onto my parents. Fuck my mom for cheating on my dad. But fuck my dad for being so demanding. They hate each other. My dad rammed his car into my mom's boyfriend at the time and went to jail. I can never express how much I hate the past. Obviously neither of them knows how I feel, because to me, the best punishment is to be completely silent. They are divorced obviously - and viciously hate each other.

Before this year, I was able to cope and pretend like I am fine because of money. But now due to my job, I am realizing what a mess I am - and I am using alcohol to assist me. I am also reading some books in order to communicate better - as you might have guessed - I need to manage better.

Anyways, this is just a bunch of complaining. Any advice is better than none. 

Sometimes, I wish I was still in college and single - even if it meant that I didn't have much saved up - money does not equal to happiness.

25,"I love my parents and family and would do anything for them in a pinch or emergency. Sure, I've never had that type of relationship with my parents where we open up about feelings or joke around. They're the kind of parents that work hard for me and my siblings but are also very traditional and borderline strict (although they've spoiled me and my little brother a lot more). Because of this I have had to bottle up a lot of my feelings on relationships or who I'm attracted to or how I was bullied in school a lot. And I think that's one thing that has me feeling where though I love my parents and family unconditionally, I cannot get myself to clean up after myself when I visit (I'm 19 and I'm in university right now) or help them out in the kitchen or even just ask how they're doing. Even when I think of doing it, I feel my body just resist and I give into continuing watching YouTube or scrolling on Reddit and letting my mom clean up the house after a long day from work everyday. 

Just recently my sister called me and gave me a long screeching rant on how I should be more considerate and not rude when I talk to my parents (which I don't mean to sound rude, they don't have the best hearing so I often have to speak up louder for them to hear which thus comes off as rude), or how I need to clean up after myself and think of how my parents feel. Worst part is this is the 1000th same speech she's given me in the entirety of my existence, yet I still can't commit to keeping on helping my parents out little by little around the house and just succumb to staying cooped up in my room. And it got to a point where it got heated in our argument and I hung up on her and am now scared to call her back. 

Although it's only when my parents really get stern on telling me to do stuff around the house that I can actually contribute to the responsibilities that need to be done. And they're not often stern these days as much since they're extremely busy working. So they often call my sister to discipline me if there's something up with me. 

I know I'm not the best child, but I don't resent or hate my parents despite all the conflicts I've had with them growing up. I realize now that I seriously need to get my act together and do stuff more for my parents. All over done that's even close to that is get them appreciative Christmas presents and have random topic discussions in the car for fun with them.

She then wrote me in neat handwriting her name and number. I called it with her request and turns out she gave me a bad number.

34,"I can already tell that this will be quite a long post so please bear with me. I want to include as many relevant details as I can.

I turned 26 years old just two days ago (as I'm writing this). To say that I am dissatisfied with the way my life has turned out would be an understatement. Here is some basic info to illustrate what my life is like at the moment. I've never held a job despite applying to a couple and being interviewed at one of them. I've also never had any post high school education apart from a year at a broadcasting school (thus the username, more on that later). I'm still living at home with my parents, but I'm I've tried (and failed) to take steps to move out. I got my driver's license last year but that changed absolutely nothing (also more on that later). I'm autistic, but it's mild enough to not be obvious to the casual observer, so I consider it a non-issue, despite it having an impact on my life. I've never had a girlfriend (probably not important but I though I'd include it anyway). Lastly, I don't have any friends nor have I ever considered myself a friends person, me being socially awkward enough as it is.

Obviously this is not how I imagined my life would be like at age 26. If you had told 16 year old me that this is what my life would be like in 10 years, I wouldn't have believed you. I can think of three (or two) major mistakes in my life that I think led to my life being this way.

**MISTAKE #1 - Not getting my driver's license when I should have**

Let's start back in high school. I didn't get my driver's license at 16 like most people do because at the time I saw no need to. It was only after I saw many of the people I went to school with driving that I began to think about getting my license. My parents enrolled me in a driver's education class. Because I was 18 when I started the class, I could do the classroom portion as usual but I couldn't do supervised group drives like the younger people, I had to do one-on-one drives with the teacher. I hope that made sense. Anyway, I only ever went on one drive with the teacher and then things fell apart and I never got my license. I didn't think this was a big deal at the time because my parents drove me everywhere I needed to go anyway. Fast forward to January 2018 when I realize that not having a driver's license is becoming a huge issue, and that maybe it would be my golden ticket to independence. To make a long story short, I contacted a driving school and I finally got my license in July 2018. However, nothing in my life changed at all. The only difference is that I can drive by myself, and even I don't get to do that very much. Makes me wonder why a driver's license is so hyped up as a ticket to independence if it doesn't change anything. But I can only imagine what would have been if I had gotten my license when most people normally do.

**MISTAKE #2 (?) - Not going to college out of high school**

I put a question mark there because I don't know whether to count it as a mistake or not. Anyways, I have three reasons why i didn't go to college out of high school. First, I was scared away by the sheer amount of nonrefundable money I would need to spend (I'm in the US) and the more than questionable payoff. Second, my parents would have wanted to visit me every day in college to check on me. Lastly, I didn't want to spend four more years with my head buried in books and being cooped up in lecture halls. I realize now that things definitely would've been a lot different if I had put up with those things and gone to college. But again, I don't know whether it was a mistake or not.

**MISTAKE #3 - Trying to get into broadcasting**

During high school, I became interested in broadcasting, especially radio. I went to a one-year broadcasting school after graduating high school in hopes of jumping straight into a career and avoiding a minimum wage job, which in my opinion at the time were for losers. After completing the program in February 2015, I naturally started looking for an entry level position in the field. However, try as I might, I couldn't find one position that didn't require some kind of experience that I obviously didn't have. I gave up on broadcasting entirely sometime last year.

So it seems as though three (or two) mistakes is one mistake too many, and because of that I feel I no longer have a shot at the life I want. In short, I want to be independent, have an awesome career (not just a job), and have a family. That's seems almost impossible right now. And this is as I see the people I went to high school with absolutely killing it at life. A few of them are married or have a significant other, at least a couple already have at least one kid, and many of them have (from what I can tell) great jobs. Why the hell can't I have any of that? What makes them different from me?

Before anyone says ""Get a job"", believe me, I've tried. During high school (graduated 2013 btw), I applied to a job the local grocery store. However, they did not contact me until I could no longer work there as I had moved with my parents elsewhere. For the next few years I didn't try for another job as I didn't have my license. In December of last year, I bit the bullet and applied to a minimum wage restaurant job, which I wanted to avoid by going into broadcasting as you may recall. This time I got interviewed, and it went very well despite a couple of mistakes on my part. I thought I was going to get hired on the strength of the interview alone and also because it was a minimum wage job that literally anyone can get, or so I thought. After a few months of not hearing back from them I concluded that they didn't hire me. This still baffles me to this day. How did I not get hired at a job anyone can get easily?

I feel like time has already run out on me. I feel like I've lived all the life I can possibly live. I see nothing in my future, other than continuing to stagnate with no way out. This is not the life I imagined I'd be living at age 26, and it kills me inside. Any attempts I've made at life progression have hit a concrete wall. I know for a fact that there is a successful, happy, independent man deep down inside me somewhere, but I don't know how to awaken him.

If you've made it this far you are amazing. So, given all that, how can I get my life back on a positive trajectory again? I really want this to be the last time I post about this on Reddit. Thanks everyone and I hope you have a better day than me.",29Dec2019,1

She’s worked there almost a year and has experience with all the tasks that she does in her job but still needs to consult me on everything. Sometimes is pertinent and she truly needs my guidance, but the majority of the time it’s a question she already knows the answer to or not even a question at all, she’s just telling me what part of her job she’s currently doing at the time. It’s almost like she has to be talking to me all the time. She’s noticed how annoyed or bothered I get by it and she’s pulled me aside a few times now to ask me about it and I’m always straightforward with her and tell her exactly why Im acting annoyed or bothered. I tell her that she knows the answer to her question and if she’d just think about it she will have the answer. I’ve told her she needs to have more confidence in herself and try to figure things out on her own before asking me. And she always agrees!!! But still continues to ask me questions!!!

40,"So I work as a cashier at a grocery store. My friends, a couple, came to get some food and something from the liquor cabinet. They came through my line when they saw me and we had a great little chat as I was ringing them up, and then I had to get their liquor so I left the stand for about 30 seconds. In that time, my coworker (40s, F) apparently saw and heard the woman in the couple, my friend, give me dirty looks and mutter something to her partner and then say ""I don't even like her"" more loudly talking about me apparently. When I came back I finished checking them out and they said they would have to come over sometime soon to hang out. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

After they left, my coworker told me what she had seen and I felt really hurt. It was busy so I didn't want to text the friend and start something in text when I couldn't devote my attention to it so I just texted my partner and told him what happened. He said that he didn't want to hang out with them anymore if that was the case and I agreed, and he texted them asking about it. After work, the friend texted me and said she was very hurt, that we are good friends and she would never say something like that or hang out with someone who she didn't even like. She said if I wanted to cut ties because of this it was ok and she just wished us the best. I realized that friends this good, who saw me and chose to come into my line and chat, probably didn't say that. I went over to talk with them and she said that when I was gone all she was doing was looking at the other cashiers and then her and her partner argued over who would pay, and that was it.

Today at work, I asked the coworker, ""are you positive about what you heard, could it have been a misunderstanding?"" and she said ""I know what I heard, I consider all of my coworkers friends and I'm not trying to start drama I just wanted to let you know"". Now I feel weird, like I don't know what actually happened. I'm definitely more inclined to believe my friend though. How can I get over feeling like something isn't right?",29Dec2019,1

42,"They’re only like a year old, and it’s not like I’m HUGE now or anything- so I was like 185 lbs and 5”9 at the time, and I’m now about 215lbs, last I checked (which I admittedly haven’t done in a while for fear of being bigger). I am a woman who primarily dates other women (but advice from anyone and everyone is welcome). 

My thing is, I know that most people assume that only face pics = fat, which I would be fine with, but I also used to be about 250lbs and know that I got a whole lot less interest when I had no body pics(not currently comfortable taking body pics). I also have a bit of a hang up of how much I love those photos- again, they were taken when I had gone from 250lbs to 185lbs, so I was SUPER confident for the first time in my whole life.

I’m back on track again to losing weight (my meds were switched around, so there wasn’t a huge amount I could do about gaining, but thankfully things seem to have levelled out now and I’m beginning to lose it again) and I’ve, frankly more importantly, kicked the type 2 diabetes diagnosis I got at 19 (now 21) in the ass and am now as close to not having it as I can be, but for the time being, I’m still fat again. Which fucking sucks and is a huge drag on my confidence.

What it comes down to I guess, is that I don’t want to take myself out of the dating game just because of some temporary body confidence issues that I’m working on, BUT I feel kinda deceitful having the photos up still (I don’t have anything against people who aren’t romantically/sexually into people who are overweight, as long as they aren’t assholes about it and it’s just a preference), BUT I feel shitty taking them down.

This is a very long winded way of saying: should I take them down? Or put in my profile somewhere that I’m bigger now but losing, or something like that?

It hasn’t been an issue that’s come up recently, but I also stopped physically meeting people about 20lbs ago because I was scared of the reaction.

45,"A little about my family: We are from Uganda and used to live there when I was little. We moved here(US) for unknown reasons when I was 4 or 5. My dad travels internationally A LOT (multiple times a month) for work. He even lived in Dubai for a few years to save on traveling. He travels to Uganda often. I don’t know who he works for or what exactly he does. His linkdln says he’s the director at a business but it must be virtual because he doesn’t go into any office daily. He works in telecommunications. He mentioned completing a contract with Huawei last summer. I have seen pictures of him shaking hands with the president of Uganda. We has never talked about what he was doing. He would meet with a sheikh in dubai often. My mom and brother didn’t get to meet him and ate in a separate room with his wife. My dad is mysterious as fuck. I don’t speak Luganda, the language spoken in uganda, so I don’t understand his conversations. Last summer a military general from the Ugandan military stayed in our home. I know very little about my parents; who their friends are, what their finances are, and what their lifelong plans are. My dad recently let us slip that he spent like $11,000 shipping his car and other items from Dubai to Uganda. I don’t know why. I know that both my parents have property they inherited from their parents in Uganda, but they have never mentioned moving back. Anyone know anything about Uganda’s Internal Security Organization?

48,"ps: this is a long story and deals with a tough topic ,I suppose. so this is a warning for that. I'm also not a native English speaker, so I hope I haven't made any confusing mistakes.

This year hasn't been great, but let's start with my older brother (he's 18). He has depression and he's always home. He doesn't go to school or work, but he did get a dog (who he takes great care of) (his psychologist/therapist? said it could be good to get a dog).

Then me (16), I'm not diagnosed with anything, lets make that clear. But I'm very anti-social, don't have any friends I meet outside school, and I tend to procrastinate everything so much to the point I screw everything up and all I'm left doing is worry, and I procrastinate even more.
Like my presentation, I couldn't even do that in front of half the class and after crying and talking to the teacher, she talked to another teacher and later told me I could do the presentation in front of even less people. and since this hasn't happened yet, it gives me constant stress and anxiety just thinking about having to do this presentation still. This is my last year at school and getting my grades up to something passable in certain subjects to determain my damn future! is also keeping me up at night.

But these last few weeks have been stressful for my whole family. we noticed my brother was behaving more angry, and he got quickly irritated by even the smallest things. 

the 2 weeks before Christmas-break, the dog hadn't listened a couple of times already and my brother was slowly becoming more and more irritated and angry. And then it happened, the first 'snap' sort of. On a saturday.
My parent were away to a birthday party.  My older brother, younger sister and me were home with the dog. And he and I had a disagreement and it ended in him slapping me across my face (I was in the right but if he doesn't get what he wants he gets very irritated, clearly). When my parents got home me and my sister told them about what happened and went to bed. We heard them arguing downstairs afterwards.

Then the real shocker happened the day after, on Sunday. my sister was upstairs and the rest of my family and me downstairs. My parents lecture my brother (again that day) about the thing that happened the day before. But my parents tend to sound a bit hostile during these things (my dad usually the calmer one, my mom the hot tempered one, kinda like good cop bad cop).
I could already see it coming, them yelling at each other. And then I hear my brothers voice go up a few times during the yelling (he has a sort of low voice usually). And I think he only does that when he is speaking his thoughts and not really thinking about what he says anymore.

(It reminded me of the time he spoke his mind the first time. when it became clear he had problems in his head, when he first expressed his true feelings. Then he got help of course.)

But this was bad. my mother especially has a bad temper and tends to come closer to you during arguments (unconsciously maybe?). And then my brothers threatened stuff. everyone flips, my brother gets up and my parents thought he was gonna hit my mom. My brother and father get into a fight. not just yelling this time my father trying to stop him and my brother just losing it and hitting him. I get up from my seat to keep the dog away from the fight. They knock over stuff and there's lots of yelling. after a short while it sort of dies down. they let go of each other and it stops.
but I see my brother walk towards the kitchen and my mind immediately thinks the worst, so I follow him. Then as soon as I saw him go to the knives, I start yelling and my parents notice. my dad is already there and my mom yells at me to get out of the kitchen. I again keep back the dog. at this point everyone is crying and yelling. my mom orders me to the hallway with the dog. All I can hear is them yelling and struggling. my sister comes downstairs in the hallway too and I tell her they are fighting. At this point all I could do I cry and hope my father is stronger than him and gets him to calm down before he hurts himself or others. My mom enters the hallways too and we go to the garage together. she calls the therapist people emergency line and then eventually tell her to call back in HALF AND HOUR!!!

but eventually my brother had been calmed down by my father. he goes to sleep upstairs, and thats what he really did. my sister goes upstairs after a short while too, she was kinda unaffected by it all. we talk downstairs and then me and dad go on a big walk with the dog (to clear our minds perhaps?).

There was already a sheduled appointment the next day with parents and brother. my dad also took the day of work to stay home to make sure everything was ok. and we went on like we always do. We know the problems, we talk sometimes, but we act like nothing has happened. We tend to just bottle everything up. 

That week was going to be a project-week at school so my mother allowed me to stay home (last-years project-week is just studying at school) and since my sister was not really effected by the fight (she didn't see anything and went back upstairs just normal after the whole hallway then garage thing) she did go to school that week.

The next day when I wake up I see a text from my dad (at his job): ""if you wanna go downstairs"" (my brother was downstairs with the dog of course) ""tell me, and your mother or me will come home"". I stayed upstairs until my mom came home from work (she works half days so she is home early).

The whole week I couldn't sleep. I stayed up almost all night just scared that my brother was either gonna hurt himself or all of us at night. eventually falling asleep still.

Then on Thursday my parents were going to our doctor. Just the normal family doctor. and asked me if I wanted to go with and I did. (I later realised this was also kinda a plot because they were worried about me, since I had seen everything.) and we talked to him and he also suggested reporting my brother but we aren't going to. and suggested that I come back and talk about this again, about how it's affecting me.

It's been a week. Even more than a week. Everything seems back to normal. I even watched a movie with my brother. but suddenly since yesterday, whenever I'm not distracting myself. my mind goes to everything I still have to do for school. but I can't get myself to actually start doing anything.

I don't know what it is. I just can't stop doing useless things that distract me. It's as if I can't accept reality. I'm turning 17 in two months and it's honestly so scary to me. I think I'm too lazy, anxious, useless to do anything I know I should be doing. I think I'm gonna fail school and I'm scared of the future. I don't where to go from here,what to do or who to talk to.",29Dec2019,1

52,"So basically this time next year I have to apply for grad school and i have no idea what to do. By that point I will have been with my boyfriend for 7 years and there is a possibility to make things work but I think my family will be very upset if I decide to leave my hometown (i am currently going to university in my hometown and i lived at home for my first two years of university before moving out with my boyfriend). My options would be:

Stay at my current university for graduate school (2 yr master + 4 year PhD)

Pros: probably easier to get into because of my connections, good school for my program, my family is here, great city to live

Cons: my boyfriend's career path isn't suited for this city so it's a slim chance he'll stay here, I don't know if I want to stay here forever and grad school is a long commitment

2. go to 1 of 3 schools all in the same city (1-2 hours from my hometown)

Pros: all 3 schools have a program both my boyfriend and I could take, all 3 are good schools for my program, staying with my boyfriend and having a future together (we have discussed having a family etc and it is something we both want very much)

Cons: having to move away from my parents (one of whom is unfortunately ill), the city is meh but not bad, parents might feel hurt and/or upset (I am their only child)

3. Take a year off to work as a lab coordinator in my field at my current uni and I would live at my family home and save money while my boyfriend is off on his year of internship

Pros: 30ish k working, save money, no rent, another year at home with my family, procrastinating my decision

Cons: sometimes stressful living at home, I already took a year off after highschool before I began university and I have a 7 year program to do

Either way my boyfriend will be gone 1 whole year (the year I would be in my first year of my masters) on an internship likely far away, and then he will be back for 4th year in our hometown so that is guaranteed 1 maybe 2 years apart - which we are both totally fine with and we will have been together 7 years by this point - but I dont think I could do a long distance relationship for more than 2 years. His program would be a 2 years masters after that. I truly do see us having a future and family is very important to me. We would both be making sacrifices to do this (he sort of wants to do his masters in the states and then move back to canada, but that would be 4 years a part). I just don't know how much I should consider my parents feeling upset, as I will be 22/23 by the time this happens and I also have to start thinking about my future.

53,"I know this topic has probably come up in the past and is probably one of the most common family issues ever but I would like to hear from people’s experience and any advice. 

I’m having the toughest time with my wife and mother. They obviously don’t get along with one another and it’s driving me insane! Almost to the point of wanting to initiate a divorce with my wife. 

A little background on the current situation. Ever since my college graduation ceremony my mom thought she saw me from the bleachers and my then gf said it wasn’t me but someone else. My mom insisted it was me and long story short my mom threw a tantrum and stopped talking to my then gf. 

The last issue was when my now wife dropped my mom off at the airport. While giving my mom a speech about how she should respect my wife, my mom got stressed during the conversation and told me that last time when she dropped my mom off at the airport my wife pulled away. When I brought this up to my wife I found out my mom twisted the story and she actually pulled away. She was not only shocked but hurt by this. I was shocked too. My mom never admitted she was wrong and never apologized to my wife even though I begged her to. I know my mom is wrong for this.

For me and because I know how my mother normally behaves I didn’t think these small conflicts are really a big deal. If one of her parents did that to me I would just probably brush it off. However, my wife has a completely opposite stance on it. In fact nothing I tell her about my moms behavior and how she can be extremely rude and unforgiving has changed her mind. Now every time I bring up something about my mom, it ends with a big argument and at time my wife has ended up in tears. She said she will never get along with my mom forever. 

My wife is pregnant now and my mom is visiting us for about a month, but not staying with us. I am not sure if it’s hormones from pregnancy or just her dislike of my mom but my wife is trying to avoid my mom at all costs. My mom acts like an angel and they both seem to respect each other during conversation but my wife refuses to spend any time with me when I’m around my mother and is constantly making excuses to avoid her. 

I really want our child to grow up with a wonderful wife and wonderful grandmother. My mother was very supportive growing up and I feel like she would be a big help in raising our child and an amazing grandmother. How do I get both of them to get along and spend more time together. Not just for me, but for our child sake in the future?",29Dec2019,1

This year has been a lot for me (F17) mentally and my friends do not help.

It got to the point where i kinda blew up on them and now we are not on talking terms. (last 2 days)

I am fine with being alone, but i’ve tried cutting them off before and contact with them is inevitable because they’re in most of my classes and so I fix things and deal with being unhappy at the sake of nothing being awkward.

I wish we could be acquaintances instead of super close friends, but it’s either 0 or 100. I would love insight on how to deal with these people I find very toxic to me.

I decided to take the picture with the back facing camera on the phone since a photo with the front facing camera would result in the username appearing backwards.

64," (Posting for a friend)

So, i need to do some explaining for this to make sense.

I am not from America, but my parents are working there and i live here under permanent residence. I am a minor but i will not disclose my age/grade. I am originally from the Philippines, and I've always wanted to live in the U.S. because of the better opportunity for what i wanna be (Musician) and because of the great people.

My mom has always been very strict about people that she can control falling in love with someone, with recent evidence with her scolding my 23-year-old cousin about getting a girlfriend. My mom has always stressed to me that getting a girlfriend before you ca support yourself is a bad idea and that i should stay away from those things.

A few months ago, i fell in love with a girl. She's the best. But neither of our parents agree to either of us dating, so both o us are under a radar that if either of us get caught, both of us will suffer. Although, me and her agreed that whatever happens, we will still be a couple, through all of the bullshit going on. My Mom recently scrolled through my Discord conversations with her, and found out that I've been in a relationship, forbidden by her rules.

She has told my dad (Who works in the U.S. but will go back to the Philippines by July) that she doesn't want me staying in the U.S. for long anymore. I want to stay in the U.S. to study to become a musician, as for I am a very good, aspiring tuba player, and i want to pursue that. My dad is all for me getting my grades high, and not missing the homework i need to do. But, he hasn't been and of dating, either. My older sister says the same thing, but she says that i have to break up with her and ignore her completely (I'm waiting for my dad's response).

So, what the hell should I do? Risk having my future being taken away or risk having to lose the closest person to me right now? I don't wanna let her go because that would be a dick move, even though i love her and she loves me back, but if i don't let her go, one of my few chances of having a good future will perish.

Just to clarify, my relationship with her is not affecting my grades, attendance, teacher notes, and trouble record (I've never really had one in the first place). My mom is going to tell my counselor, and that will probably result in my girlfriend's parents knowing about us two.

I hope that this was easy to understand and well put together, bc I'm hella tired and needed to get this out.

She calls me everyday, sometimes more than once, text me so much, asks about every place I go and want me to send her a message when I got back home because she 'worries' about it... it just don't make sense. She complains all time on how she miss me, and want me to go to visit her or want to come to visit, I visit my parents quite frequently, like once every two or three months as they live in another State, and she also visited me often and for long periods... but when we are together it's not good. She needs a lot of attention. If we are like in the living room watch TV, she will just randomly talk loudly about unrelated things and keep talking and talking even if it's not relevant, if there is another person talking, she always start talking loudly as to bring attention to her, if I'm working on the laptop she just start shouting from a different room that I need to go there to talk to her. She is also super touchy and I dislike it. 

 It's stressful, I don't think I can ever normally talk to her and I feel less and less interested in keeping contact. Whenever I try to talk to her, she gets super defensive. I feel sometimes she have very  childish behaviors. I don't know how to deal with it, I don't know if I could directly tell her about it, but I tried to talk it in a more subtle/indirect way but no success and I don't know if I should just start ignoring her and get some space, I feel lost with that, I'm getting resentful and starting dislike my mother right now because it's never pleasurable to have contact with her.",29Dec2019,1
69,"My younger sister is currently working onboard a cruise ship. This was her dream job with very wealthy clientele, and she has already been able to see so much of the world. She has definitely seen how the other half lives, and I am so incredibly proud of her for working hard enough to achieve her goal. She is only 18 and she comes back in September 2020. 

I am going to fly to visit her in April, (our birthdays are only 10 days apart so I will be going between then) and would love to bring a gift to show how far she’s come and how proud I am of her. I will only get to spend a few hours with her. I also want to get her the gift as she misses home and very rarely has time or WiFi/data to message us. 

We come from a working class family, and a very large one at that. I think she misses a lot of the comforts from home and her regular life. I know she misses our dog tremendously. I would love to get her something that sums up how proud everyone is for her, makes her feel less lonely, and is meaningful.

71,"My mother's brother (my uncle) committed suicide last night.  I didn't know him very well, except that he always struggled with drugs and alcohol.  He was 50 years old.  It was pills. 

He has always had a strained relationship with his daughter (\~28F).  He wasn't really in her life, and they were never really close. They talked occasionally, but from what he told me one time, he tried to make plans with her several times and she blew him off each time.  His daughter, (my cousin) I haven't seen since I was probably 10 years old.  I am 34 now. We are facebook friends and she lives two towns over.  She reached out to me asking if I heard what happened, and was angry that she wasn't getting a full story.  And then said she needs to know that its not her fault. 

I replied by saying he has spent a lifetime struggling with demons and drugs and alcohol, and its nobody's fault but his.  She didn't reply, so I asked her if she heard what happened (because I do know what happened, but I dont know what she knows) and she never replied to me.  Did I say the wrong thing?  If she reaches out again, what should I say?  I haven't had much experience with death in general, let alone suicide.  I have a tendency not to sugar coat things and I dont know if I offended her by listing off his lifelong problems...but I was trying to make it better to show her that it wasn't her fault.",29Dec2019,1

- 23 year old Canadian male living around the Great Lakes area

- Graduated two years ago with a Bachelor of Arts (Film Studies).

- Currently in a revised Bachelors of Education program that is not going well both due to how unorganized the program is, how awful co-ops have been in public schools, as well as my own failures to do better than average in my placements. I hate it now and want out.

- Had difficulty finding work around my area since I was 16 years old (the Great Lakes areas have youth unemployment rates of nearly 20%, and half of all youth don't have jobs). I can't even get call-backs from McDonald's, and the young people I know only got their jobs due to random connections.

- I have lots of volunteer experience at a local church as well as a local performing arts centre (youngest volunteer at the arts centre).

- I've had seasonal jobs at a church as well as a hotel and a bakery, but that's it for actual careers essentially...

**So, with all of this in mind, I need to ask this question;**

I'm happy for myself, but it sometimes feels so pointless when this is all just so I can afford to relax and do nothing when I'm older. I have nobody to share this with. I will never marry, have kids, or have a relationship. I don't even have friends and likely never will.

My best girl friend and my best friend we were at my ( best friends house ) we went to his room since his dad was downstairs and we decided to watch a movie. Suddenly they again cuddled togheter in his bed and i was sitting there in the chair watching the movie from the side. I felt like a third wheel. They felt i was down i didnt want to sound like a little kid and just said just some personal stuff. I went for a smoke woth him later and he asked me whats wrong i told him. He was like why didnt you say. We dont have anything more between us than friendship. I said i didnt care if they wanted sex or something more i just dont like being the third wheel. Doeant feel right. He said come lie down with us. Like come on im not gonna go like that. Its like i begged. Luckily a friend of mine gave me a call that there was snow and he wanted to take the car out for some mountain drifting. Good thing too imidietly said come get me. I left. later i told my girl best friend that i felt shit. She said we even invited you. Like come on i had to bring the topic. Always on the couch the two of you, now in the bed. I said i didnt care if you guys wanted more BUT if you want more dont freaking call me so that i dont feel left out. I actually would prefer if you just disnt tell me or told me dude i want to be with her or him. I would understand that. But i am not gonna beg, nor will i ruin a special moment of two people. Did i do the right thing ? I always put other people before me since im just maybe too nice but i didnt want to be the light in the room. I dont know what they did after i left, nor do i care but i feel super pathetic siting there in the chair. He said but i downloaded war thunder for you since you love the game.

86,"I'm embarking on a journey of finally being true to myself and pursuing the things I love doing, which are various forms of writing: short stories, screenplays, songwriting, composing, etc. 

The problem is, in the 30 years I've been alive, I haven't managed to build very thick skin. I'm not great at handling criticism; it tends to crush me. I can't imagine how much worse I'll feel when I put something out there that actually matters to me. It's one thing to be criticized for something you're not so emotionally attached to, like a report at a job. But to do something you love and have people tell you it sucks...I have a feeling I'm going to have a difficult time maintaining any semblance of self-worth after that, lol. 

I'm aware that the only way to get good at something like this is to expose your work and leave it open to feedback. Since I'm just beginning, it's likely that I'm quite horrible and will be told as much. Or, at the very least, receive walls of critique. 

One of the goals I've set for myself is to enter a highly regarded writing competition with a deadline in May. (Even if I'm not likely to win, you get notes on your submission from professionals in the industry, so that in and of itself is worth it.) The institution publishes the first pages of the winning entries on their social media channels. I was horrified to read the comments, basically telling people how much their work sucks and that they didn't deserve to win, picking apart every word. It's just baffling to me. Even the people who have shown to have immense talent and won prestigious awards have to deal with this shit. 

So there are two types of criticism: the valid type, which will help your work improve...and the second type, if you actually manage to succeed - the bitter assholes who think it should have been them, whose words you have to try not to take to heart. I feel like I can't handle either. 

Let me just clarify, I did not live a charmed life free of criticism. I'm not a princess who just doesn't like to be told she's imperfect. Hell, I feel like it's the opposite - I'm sensitive to it because my family's so critical that they've caused me a lot of shame. Now, anytime someone criticizes me even just a little bit, I fall apart. How can I build thicker skin so that I don't quit the first time someone tells me I suck?",29Dec2019,1

I’m at the end of my rope. I owe thousands that I can’t hope to pay. I’m on medication that gives me tremors and horrible full body acne.

This might sound like I’m a psycho or something, but I’ve always tried to have the best intentions. I help my parents take care of my brother who has ADHD,ODD and behavioural issues. I empty the dishwasher, vacuum some of the house, wipe the table, help make food, etc. I do whatever my mom tells me to do just so I can avoid her screaming and getting my privileges taken away (electronics, food that she makes, leaving the house, music, etc). I also have to deal with my OCD and severe anxiety ( yes it’s diagnosed by a psychiatrist) which my parents always try to downplay.

93,"Alright, so to start, I need to say that there are some touchy subjects I have to go though. Noting major, just something that doesn't happen to many people.

When I was 12, I had to go to the hospital several times for intense stomach pains. None of my doctors had any idea what was wrong with me, but it was eventually diagnosed as Chron's disease. Once I hit 14 I was also diagnosed with Interstitial Nephritis, which is just fancy talk for kidney failure. It got extremely bad to the point that my grades plummeted in high school for the first two years. I missed about 100 days of school across the last two years, but I was somehow able to pull my grades up.

Now that I'm 19, I'm realizing the situation all this has put me in. My family can't take loans out to send me to college because of my insane medical bills (I had a transplant this March), and because I was at Dialysis 3 days a week and school 5 days a week, I was too worn out to really work or drive, so I also have no work experience or a driver's license. We also just moved two or three days ago, so now I don't even know my way around the town we live in. I should mention that we *can*afford community college, but my transplanted kidney was acting up around halfway through the first semester, and since I was taking online courses, the due dates were too strict for me to handle while I was in the hospital, so I dropped. I'll likely go back in the Fall, but by then I'll be almost 20.

So now here I am. Never had a job, can't drive, and I don't go to school. I am 19 years old and I'll be 20 in November next year. I feel like such a let down but my parents are acting like I should just automatically know how to do everything since I'm an adult. They only want to help me on their terms. When I ask to drive a little, they only approve if they feel like it. Since we moved I asked ""when and where should I apply for a job"" and the answer so far has been ""I'll let you know"". I'm aware I'm an adult now and I can apply for a job whenever I damn well please, but I have no clue what I'm doing. I was never taught any of this stuff at school or home. I feel especially pathetic when I think about how I'll be turning 20 only 2 or 3 months after restarting my *first* year of *community* college. 

I'm honestly not sure what I should do, all I know is that I feel like an idiot for not pushing myself to learn all of this stuff, even though I was sick so often. I want to enjoy life, but every day I'm met with thoughts like ""You're gonna be 25 before you even move out, idiot"" and a lot of other self depreciating things. I'm not suicidal or depressed, but I can't help but feel like there's less and less hope for me every day. Any advice would be fantastic. My parents are no help currently.",29Dec2019,1

Option 1, Ride out my current daily driver and run the risk of breaking down. Not to mention buying expensive parts for it and dealing with the 13 mpg. 

Option 2, get a cheap fuel efficient car that probably won't do well in the winter since I will be moving up north.

Option 3, buy the more expensive truck that I really want that is better on gas mileage than my current by almost ×2.

111,"I think I have a problem with blaming myself for a lot of things. Even if I know that I have done nothin wrong, I just don’t want to blame others when i’ve done things wrong also. An example would be that me and my friend were arguing about how I think i’ve put a lot into the friendship and that i’m constantly trying and i’m not getting anything back. I mentioned that I cried over it and this is how she responded “like it’s not my fault you cried like I’m sorry you did but that’s just not me”  I then responded with “fuck you” and she said “saying fuck you did not accomplish anything good”. I’m the one that brought up the topic and I feel like if i just kept it to myself and didn’t respond in such a hostile way everything would be back to normal. I even feel the need to apologize to her for being so rude and being stubborn but my best friend stopped me.

She apparently has angry outbursts, is verbal but the sentences are sometimes very jumbled, and sits on the floor and screams/hits a lot.

113,"My husband and I have lived in this house for about 2 years. We don't know our neighbor, but have seen him around. The one time I did speak to him, he gave off weird vibes that made me uncomfortable, so I stayed away.

Husband and I have noticed that when it gets dark, he goes to the end of his driveway, stands close to the road, and stares at oncoming traffic with a spaced out look on his face. There is no pacing, checking the mail, or anything.

Tonight, we were driving home and he almost looked like a tree with how still he was standing. It was drizzling too. 

He's been doing this for a few weeks and I'm genuinely concerned that he's high, has some sort of mental issues, or something else.

I'm fully aware that he hasn't done anything illegal and it might be something innocent, but the behavior is just strange and kind of creepy. I'm wondering if we should ask the police to do a wellness check or maybe a group of us go together to see if he's okay.",29Dec2019,1

115,"We're both 18. 

Our relationship caused me to lose my friends due to prioritization. I'd try to hang out with others, but he'd follow me and tell me he didn't like the fact I was leaving him out. 

My ex doesn't like being left out, but our ""friendship"" is making me miserable. We don't have a single thing in common anymore. I'm his only friend, and as long as this friendship is a thing, he'll be my only friend.

Everyone stands near the doors before school starts. He always stands far away from everyone else. He'd walk up to me when I'd try to go to my former friends.

He'd say ""Hi,"" and wait for me to show him memes to talk about. I don't save memes for him anymore, so I'd ask what he wanted to talk about. He'd say ""I don't know,"" and go back to his phone. This would repeat every time I'd try to talk with anyone. 

He spends all of his time on his phone. It's caused him to lose friends and girlfriends, and he's failing all of his classes. He prefers being on his phone to talking, but he doesn't want to be completely alone. Someone once told me the only time he talks to anyone is when I'd talk to him. I think he has anxiety.

He used to take up all of my time. I'd spent hours searching for memes to show him, I'd text him, kiss him, get him gifts, hold his hand, start the conversations- things like that. Reality hit and I realized there wasn't anything of the sort in return, and I was tiring myself out.

I wanted to do things for myself and hang out with people that would make me happy.
At that point, I didn't have any hobbies, friends, and I gained weight. When I decided to get hobbies and lose weight, the relationship deteriorated.

That relationship was making me miserable and it was preventing me from bettering myself, so I told my parents how I felt. They forced me to end the relationship, and I'm glad they did.

When I broke up with him, I told him I wanted to be left alone the next school day. He said he understood, but when the time came he completely ignored that and walked up to me. Like I said before, he's content with just co-existing and not talking, and he'd only try to talk to me when I tried to talk to others. The rest of the day followed that format.

I thought that this chapter would close when I broke up with him, but it hasn't. It's exactly the same, except now we're just friends.

I'm fine with being friends, but not with him taking up all of my time. Every time I try to go to others, he'll follow me. One day, I told him I needed to be left alone, and he didn't have anyone to go to. 

It's rude to just leave him alone, but staying with him is making me unhappy. How do tell him that we probably shouldn't be friends?",29Dec2019,1

My ex was 6 years older than me, and I’m now on dating apps with my age preference set to 23-33. A few of my friends have told me nicely that they feel as though that’s not a great idea for a few reasons...
1) people that much older than me are in a much different place in their lives
2) any 30+ year old man who’s interested in a 23 year old is kinda weird
3) any 30+ year old man who want a relationship with a 23 year old is probably not very mature
Their reasons are less because of the actual age difference (ie if I were 43 and with a 53 year old that’s a different story) but has more to do with how different a 23 year old is to a 30 something year old.

125,"I wouldn’t normally ask internet folk for advice, but I don’t think my family or friends would be able to provide novel advice in my situation. Tomorrow, I am scheduled to work a shift with a coworker who I understand to dislike me. I’ll explain how this came to be, but it’s a little long winded.

I started working at this establishment two weeks ago. I met this particular coworker on the first day, and they seemed friendly. After a week of training with someone else, this coworker was scheduled to train me for a few days as well, so we began to work  closer together. 

I have some issues with social situations, especially with anxiety when starting a new job in a pseudo peer-subordinate type situation. I was definitely intimidated in this close-proximity training situation, and acted more tentative and timid with her rather than behaving more friendly and outgoing, or more like myself. What I mean by this is that I was mostly quiet aside from asking questions about the job. I have a feeling she found this a little off putting, because by the third day of training with her, she stopped initiating casual conversation during downtime, and didn’t say hello to me in the morning. I took this very personally. This happened with my last job as well, and no matter how hard I try, my problem with being social and personable with my coworkers in a new work environment stems from a lack of self confidence, and that hasn’t improved much. 

My anxieties culminated on the third day, when we happened to be very busy. Another worker was scheduled to help us, and when he came in, she and him had no problems chatting and being friendly, while I stood aside. This definitely made me feel more awful about myself than it should have. With the addition of him, there were too many hands on deck, and even though we were busy I ended up getting in the way and just making mistakes more than anything else. My heart cinched up, and in a moment of weakness I dipped early without telling anyone. 

My managers were compassionate and were okay with me returning to work the next day. Another coworker then informed me that while this other particular coworker “didn’t hate me”, they were “grumpy with me” for leaving early. So, if I thought she wasn’t too fond of me before, she definitely is now, with extra reason to be. I have to work a full shift with her tomorrow, this Sunday. There’s always a lot of downtime with this job, so that means a lot of standing close to her in potentially awkward and tense silence. That’s my absolute worst fear in the world. I’m so anxious about it that I’m considering flat out quitting.

Does anyone have any advice for what I can do or ways to handle this? Things I should be keeping in mind maybe when I go to work? Thank you tons.",29Dec2019,1

127,"Hello everybody,

My quality of life has been awful for the last 8-ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of what's been going on:

* Age 13-14, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxiety/depression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxiety/worry/stress feeling continued.
* Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good night's sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatigue/brain fog. It is 24/7. Not even a second of feeling better.
* Age 17-18, had medical testing done. Food allergy, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, working out more, etc. Tried 2 more SSRIs that didn't help and made me feel slightly more tired.
* Age 18-23, Continue to decline cognitively. Went from feeling more like a mental fatigue to now both a severe mental fatigue AND sleepiness. Had a head MRI done, EEG, tested for Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, sleep apnea, you name it, I had it done. Tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin. All they really did was make my body feel more anxious, but did next to nothing for the fatigue/fog in my head. Caffeine does the same thing.

I feel this intense dissociation feeling 24/7 that has gradually emerged/worsened over the past couple of years. Like I'm so tired, I don't even feel like I'm in real life ever. I feel drunk/drugged, especially as the days progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.). My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. It's almost impossible to startle me. It's like my body doesn't even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia). Vision has declined (eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity). Eyes are dry/watery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but can’t feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled. Hearing, taste, smell, touch, all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually non-existent. Libido low. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling drunk. Slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as I’ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across as an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every cold/flu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over it. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day and/or when I’m more tired. Feel like I need lots of sleep to “recover”, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit. All of these symptoms seem to flare up more when I’m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.

Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse and worse over time. For example, caffeine’s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It’s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie.

We barley talked about it and she said to me “are you sure you were really raped” that’s when I left my house and ran to my best friends house where I was with her for a little while. My mom ended up not telling my dad and doing nothing about it. When I started driver ed in December I told my youth pastor at my church who ended up texting my dad.

Addiction + being a teenager, I was neglected and was left in very poor shape as an infant. CPS was called, and I was adopted by my grandparents as last resort. 

They are not the greatest parents at all. One, my grandma, in her youth, sold her prescriptions to her kids. Their home life revolved around beer. I see just how messed up that is, today, and I love her, but knowing this I'm not quite sure how to feel. She displays some of the same behavior today, always asking to borrow money and whatnot. 

Like she somehow lost $300, and now I'm going to pay $600 of taxes for the house. This is irrelevant but I just want to give context into the situation I'm in. 

But as she gets older, she is not taking care of herself. She keeps trying to lose weight even though she is skin and bones. She thinks she is ""fat"" because her diabetes gave her a gut that won't go away. I forget why this is, I think it's because of swelling. 

But her sugar drops to dangerous levels constantly. Her diet is the cause. The doctor gets onto her for it, but she doesn't listen. Me and my grandpa have had to forcefully feed her sugary items to get her sugar to normal again. It's scary and has been happening for years.

I never tried to kill myself but the thoughts wouldn’t leave me alone. I never knew exactly what caused it. But eventually it stopped and I was happy again. 

I feel like that cycle is about to start over. I’m making decisions I’m not proud of. I never intended on smoking and now I do it whenever I have the chance. It’s making my brain foggy even when I’m sober. I have an ex boyfriend, we’ll call him Caleb, who I still hang out with nearly every day. We broke up because both of us are moving to different states soon. I still love him more than anyone I’ve ever met. I mean that with all my heart and for that reason I don’t know why I do the things that I do.  Almost immediately after we broke up, I invited a guy from tinder over to my apartment. We probably would’ve hooked up if I didn’t have a guilty conscious and slept in the floor. I couldn’t stop thinking about Caleb all night and how devastated he’d be if he knew. That was months ago and eventually I told him I “kissed another guy” after we broke up but that was it. I’ve never seen Caleb so angry. 

Flash forward a few months and I’m still making irrational decisions for no reason. Earlier today I told Caleb’s best friend I had a crush on him. Why? I have no earthly Idea. I don’t want to be with his best friend, I’m not even attracted to him. I did it impulsively. And now I’m paranoid Caleb will find out and be so angry with me that he’ll never speak to me again. 

My parents don’t like Caleb and want me to forget about him but I can’t no matter what I do. He’s the best person I’ve ever met and would never do anything to hurt me which is why I’m so angry at myself for the stupid shit I do. I understand if reading this makes you dislike me. I dislike me too. My mom makes me feel guilty for even hanging out with Caleb since she doesn’t like him. 

In 15 days I’m moving to Florida for a semester long internship. All I want to do is get away and start my life over and forget about here. Forget about the people, forget about the bad choices, forget about the weed, forget even about Caleb and start the fuck over. But eventually that semester will be over and I’ll have to come back. 

I’m terrified. I don’t like myself and I’m so scared of falling back into the hell I went through months ago. I can’t go to therapy because the internship is going to work me crazy hours. I don’t want to get on meds. I want change. I want to redo myself. I want to start over. What do i do?",29Dec2019,1
140,"Some sources are claiming it only takes a couple certifications similar to getting a driver’s license and you’re all set and others are saying I would need a bachelor’s degree in animal science or something else related. Some sources are also saying I would first need to become a regular police officer while others are saying I could just start out working at an animal shelter or animal hospital as a vet assistant (others are saying having a vet tech certification is required). In addition, some sources say get the certifications needed would be almost free while others are saying it can cost up to $1500 (some say these certifications are the only ones needed while other say these would be needed on top of having a degree).

So, could anyone give some details or insight about the process or maybe explain the process that you went to and what your experience was like?

The things I’d like to know most are how long it takes to get a job as an animal control officer from scratch and how long it takes once all the certification requirements are met. Along with this, I’d like to know what the general certifications are, what they cost, and how long it takes to get those certifications. I also would like to know what the entry level wages are. Lastly, I’m wondering what the overall costs tend to be when working towards becoming an animal control officer.

143,"Hello redditers. I am getting really lonely. I am able to maintain long-term platonic friendships and occasionally date, but I have never had a boyfriend. I enjoy dating, but most of my experience with it has been through online apps. I have alright experiences with guys but no one I see seems to take me seriously. I would like to try to meet more people in real life or through friends of friends but I am sensitive. I'm trying to work on this, but I have generalized anxiety that makes me physically uncomfortable in certain situations. This further complicates dating because it takes me some time to feel comfortable enough to have sex with people I'm seeing. Recently, I've tried to say this directly to men I'm seeing (asking to take things slow physically) once we seem to be getting more physical, but in my experience the guys I see do not really want to hear it, or it reduces their interest in me.

I think I am a decent person who could make a really good partner. I work hard, love learning and have hobbies and interests that I do on my own (dance classes, writing). I'm pretty attractive and take care of my health and fitness. I'm very caring and loyal, but I can also be independent and I understand the value of giving others enough space to be on their own. I am a good communicator and most of the time I can manage my anxiety really well. I'm a good conversationalist, especially one-on-one, and enjoy socializing.

I feel like the older I get, the more difficult it is becoming to enter into a relationship. I feel that I missed out on the chance to have a boyfriend while I was a student, when I could have developed the skills and experience needed for a healthy and sustainable relationship.

I don't think there is anything wrong with me. But I am really worried that the gap between my age and my experience is only accelerating. If I were maybe 16, I wouldn't worry. But I really want to be with someone, and it increasingly feels like I have really missed my opportunity.

Can anyone give me advice? I would love some tips on how to meet potential partners, how to manage my inexperience once I've begun dating someone, and how to sustain my self-esteem. I would especially appreciate hearing from anyone who has been in a similar situation in the past.

Thank you xx",29Dec2019,1

I was supposed to pay in September but my school was kind enough to give me some time but time ran out and nothing, i am in a foreign country, i tried everything except illegal stuff, i was talking to these guys that said they were agents and if i work for them, advertise their agency and get customers, i will get paid $1000 and what I needed was $4000, i did get people but a lot were skeptical  so thankfully they didn't sign up, these agents also offered loans. My school told me to pay for accommodation then the school fees, i could pay later, so i decided to get a loan of $1000, then while I was talking to the agent, i told him to get me $4000 instead, he told me every amount has a different application fee, i had paid $50 so he said he would only give me $1000, i said it was fine, $1000 is fine, i gave him my account number, passport number, school adress, email and phone number. Then he told me that he filed for $4000 so i had to pay $200, i didn't have that money and i told him i didn't have that and it wasn't my fault that he filed for $4000. He started threatening me saying I have 11hrs, then he said if i don't pay, the loan will be issued but then it will bounce back and it will show that it was paid to me so I'll have to pay back the full loan or cyber police will come for me. I realized he was a scammer and I blocked him. I know I was dumb but i was desperate, i didn't want to stop school. That's all i was thinking about, the guy knew what I was going through and still decided to do that to me, it made me realize how dark some people's hearts are.

Hi, 

Im a 19 year old guy and to be honest at this point I’m so confused and desperate that I don’t know what to do. Ever since I could remember all of my closest relationship have been destroyed by things and i don’t know what to do. 

I’ve always had trouble making friends, but as a mixed kid in a small town with adhd that just kind of came with the territory. The weird thing came from every single time I got really close to some one, once they became my best friend after about 6 months to a year they would move away. And this isn’t once or twice. This happened to me 8 times. After the first 4 in elementary school I retracted into my shell and didn’t get close to anyone anymore. Then I met my best friends in middle school in 8th grade. By the end of the year all five of them were redistricted to go to another school. Over the summer I met a guy who became my best friend on my swim team. By the end of it he had to move to florida. I went back into my shell for all of high school and then the summer before my freshman year of college i got another group of friends for the first time in years. But that lasted 3 months before they either went to different schools then me or weren’t leaving for college. 

And then once i did get into college (I’m in a very small exclusive acting program, promise I’m not bragging it pertains to the story) And i got very close to a guy in my class. We became great friends and I developed a crush on him (I’m gay and he was bi). By the end of my first semester, I had confessed to him and he told me that he wasn’t really attracted to men in that way anymore, ended up dropping our program, and picked up a year abroad in london.  And the last tragedy is still unfolding. He has yet to move away but my current best friend is also in my program. He and i got close at the end of my second semester(also bi), and over the summer i confessed to him. He said that to be honest he had thought about it to, but because of the program, him struggling with things, xyz it just wasn’t gonna work out. And while i was on a social media cleanse over the summer he came out as straight on instagram(which i didn’t find out till months later and ended up being very embarrassing for me).

All in all i have had 8 instances of my best friends being torn from me, and the only 2 guys I’ve ever really liked realize they’re straight while we are hanging out. And all the while i have never had a single romantic encounter with any one. Not a girl, not a guy, not a kiss, not a date, hell i haven’t even “talked” to anyone before that wasn’t apparently all in my head. And the thing is, I’m not bad looking, or mean, or horrible to be around. Every time I talk to people about it they get all surprised and confused and start asking questions about how and why and how it doesn’t make sense. My therapist GASPED when i told her.

I don’t know. Maybe I’m crazy. Maybe I’m just really unlucky since birth. But right now what I am is desperate. If anyone could give me ANY insight on this please please please help.

Thanks in advance,

Lonely and confused",29Dec2019,1
167,"Me(19) and my girlfriend (19) were friends for a year before we started dating back in 2018.
It was amazing as it was genuine.
Everything went awesome until I felt some of her decisions weird.
A) beginning of the relationship I had made it clear for her that we would discuss about crushes openly , as I thought it would help build a better relationship. She was okay with that and would talk about some guys in her college whom she felt were good-looking. She recently told me that this guy whom she found attractive, had texted her and she started texting back. She told me this and I was totally okay with that because she was a Shelled person - would never talk to people much.
A few days later I found out , or she told me that she would not mention her relationship status OR about me when talking to guys.
Now this would result in the guy assuming she's single and making moves. BUT the problem was she never avoided from making a move. Eventually I found out this and we had a fight.

B) this happened recently - October of this year.
She joined a gym where she met this guy, who was her trainer and she told me she's good friends with him (in like 2 days) and I was actually happy. A few days later she calls me up and tells me ""you're gonna hate me for this ..I think I have a crush on him"" ..I'm silent , I casually ask her ""and?""  ""And I might wanna confess to him""she says. I'm silent again ..I ask again ""and ?"" . ""And I know he likes me back so ...""  Now I've lost it I ask what the fuck is wrong with her. Then I basically told how I felt this was double dating (English isn't my first language sorry for any mistakes ) and we eventually fought over this for a day or two. (October 1-14)

Two days later we met up and she apologized saying she'd never do such things again , I kinda forgave her. We were walking when she told ""now this is gonna change everything isn't it?"" I asked what she meant. She said ""now if I text any guy .. you'd end things with me "" . I told it wasn't like that I just didn't want any guy to come between me and her. And I'm okay as long as she maintains a boundary with any other guy and I had no rights to ask her about it.(October -16) 

Few days pass and I went for a trip with my friends and came back. (October 22-26)

We were supposed to spend time together at a hotel on November 1st and 2nd. Now after the fight she had told me she would be basic friends with the trainer guy as she can't totally avoid talking to him. I was okay with that.
On October 30th she texted me saying she has to go to gym that day as the trainer dude ""wanted to talk"" , later that day she told me that he basically confessed but because she was dating me he would back off. 
Two days later , we are spending at a hotel , she's drunk and out. I go through her phone (dick move? Idk but read full ) she had been cheating on me since October 11th.
She had told him she's single ( and of course she never mentioned me , so that guy doesn't even know I exist) she kissed him , pretty much made out every single day when I was out for trip , she had openly flirted with him , discussed about sex stuff
And he had gone to extremes , proposed and stuff , but she told SHE CANT BE IN A RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR HER TO HANDLE , but SHE WOULD THINK ABOUT IT. I broke down then and there. 
We had a huge fight next morning where she would refuse to leave the hotel room as I suggested we check out immediately it all became a mess afterwards.

Since then she's been trying to talk to me about how she feels we have a shot and SHE DESERVES ANOTHER CHANCE. I avoided any form of optimism from my side as she overthinks a lot.
I couldn't block and get her out of my life as she was special to me - as a friend and more.
So I didn't block her.
She still texts me and its casual until she starts apologizing and talking about how she didn't MEAN what she did.
Should j block her and get done with it?
Or should I not block her and be friends with her?",29Dec2019,1

Back in highschool things got rocky very fast. It was on and off, on and off... I started talking to this chick in my automotive class who was really cool. We were shy with eachother at first. Both being Italian, we would joke around in the shop saying ""how you doiiinnnn"". My life had then gotten to a very dark place in that time. I had a timer set to take my own life when i got home from class. I decided to go for it and i left my number in her locker with a note that said ""hey how you doinnn"" and my number on it. 
She texted me when i was on the bus going back to the highschool where my truck was. 
We talked for HOURS. Through my alarm and everything. It was the craziest thing ever. I had never met somebody like her. I had never connected with somebody like that right off the bat. Every conversation we would have would make me smile. She had a boyfriend at the time that used drugs and wasnt very nice to her. I started hanging out with her and then she finally broke up with him, and we started to be a thing. She was all i needed. I went to her house and met her father. He liked me a lot better than her previous boyfriends. I would talk with him for hours about cars, about the military... and then after a while my current wife would somehow find her way back into my life and kindof screw stuff up in my head as far as emotions. 
It began to go back and forth between my current wife and this other chick from automotive class. I could never stop going back to her. Everything her and i did was exactly the same. We both put our right sock on first. Tied our right shoe first. Both had the same favorites. We would say the same COMPLETE sentences, at the same time, jinxing ourselves... with no idea how we were thinking the exact same words. Ive just never connected with a person like that before. I miss her so much and honestly i still love her to death and would do anything for her. 
She currently has a boyfriend, and thats pretty much all i know. She stopped talking to me a few months ago out of the blue after being perfectly fine with eachother.

Also, my stress is gone. After the nightmare trip, I have not been as stressed out at anything. I missed a final in one of my college classes, but I still didnt get phased and managed to find a solution. 

It could also be that the only thing I’m bad at is even starting or having a relatioship. I suck when it comes to that, but I will set my simp shit aside cuz that’s basic. I also got some family shit going on that just bothers me as well, but who doesnt

I have know clue where I’m going here, but I know there’s fuckers like me. I’m wondering where or people find/get that spark again cuz right now it feels like my positivity just cant stay running like it used too. 😪 ahaha",29Dec2019,1

Backstory 2:  I’m a terrible liar and have always been honest with my husband and hold trust in everything in the highest regard. Which is also why the affair is doubly more crushing.

I was not allowed a grant or loan for classes from which I withdrew. The agency that gives me grants required a transcript in order to give me a grant for the autumn semester. However, I had a hold on my account for outstanding debt from the summer classes, so I was unable to get a transcript to get my grant for the autumn. Meanwhile, the national government offered me a loan for the autumn semester, but I was unable to use it for the summer classes to release my transcript to get the grant for my autumn semester,  even after I explained all this to everyone.

175,"  I hope it's ok to post this here, I'm trying NOT to be this way.

I didn’t mean to write something so long but I really need to get this out. I just don’t really know how to fix this, I can’t really admit this to anyone I know, especially since many of friends are LGBT. This also something I’m too ashamed to bring up to my new therapist. I have terrible thoughts about queer people, mostly about gay and bisexual men. I’ve noticed my views about them have become more extreme, I don’t want it get worse. When I hear homophobes criticize gay people I can’t help to agree with them, even though I know their criticism are coming from a place of hate.  I don’t ever say these things out loud, I don’t want to hurt anyone or take their rights away. 

The disgust I feel is mostly towards feminine men. I try to make myself watch content that has femme men in it, I feel like if I can just get to place where I can understand them maybe these feelings will go away. I don’t always hate them, when I’m around them in person I don’t really care, but after when I’m alone I start having terrible thoughts about them. I don’t like the way they act and I hate many of the things they do. They make me uncomfortable and I have a hard time seeing them as men. It really shouldn’t bother me this much, they’re just being themselves, but it does. 

Most of my lgbt friends are lesbians, bisexual women and transgender people, I rarely have bad thoughts about them, and nothing they do really feels threatening to me.  I only had one close femme gay friend, and after he came out I started hating him. He changed so suddenly, his interests and personality changed overnight, we just had nothing in common anymore. He became very pushy and annoying. He would just constantly insult us and all he ever wanted to do was get really drunk and do ecstasy. The only reason I would ever spend time with him was because I was so afraid he would kill himself. We got into a fight and haven’t spoken in years. I understand not all gay men are like this but I feel like most of them are, I just can’t stand these types of guys. 

Worst of all is that I’m bisexual, I shouldn’t be like this. I feel like I’m far more concerned about masculinity than my straight male friends. It’s rare, but sometimes they might say something that’s kinda homophobic but they usually listen when someone else in the group calls them out about it. My views are far more extreme than theirs, for them it’s just minor slip ups, I actually feel hatred and disgust towards others. 

I feel like if I bring this up to my therapist he will think it’s just my OCD, but I think this is who I am. I can tell the difference between my hateful intrusive thoughts and my actual views about people, this feels genuine to me. If you’ve been able to get over being homophobic I would really appreciate some advice.",29Dec2019,1

In it she explained she was depressed and thought she was gay. She explained that she came out to her church and they “helped” her find her way back to God- aka be straight and only straight. Last night we had our family Christmas and she had a breakdown. She refused to be around us, she wouldn’t look at us, wouldn’t sit with us. Finally her brothers were able to talk to her and as it turns out, she was just overwhelmed and sad to see us with our families and claimed she’d never have that. And turns out this has happened in the past. I genuinely believe she is a lesbian and she refuses to believe it because of her church. She has dated men and always breaks it off no matter how well things are going. I have no idea how to help her or be there for her (we aren’t close) and I know there may be no way to help her, but if there’s anyone who’s been in this situation on either side, what did you do?

184,"Sum up: I'm interested in a guy with social phobia issues and looking for advice on how to help him be more comfortable around me. He doesn't seem to like texting and struggles to communicate.

&amp;#x200B;

He has expressed interest in me in the past but I (basically) told him to wait and see where things go. When I say he 'expressed interest in me', I mean he told me he loved me a month after meeting me. I felt like this came out of nowhere.. We had not spent that much time together and the time that was spent together was in groups. He wasn't able to tell me verbally, instead, he wrote how he felt down and gave me the note to read. He was extremely embarrassed and expressed some remorse afterwards. I think he may have been pressured by a friend to tell me about his feelings. He had seen me with another guy, as well, and I think this made him panic.

We have known each other for 4 1/2 months now. Things haven't changed a whole lot but I am interested in him now. I have grown to really care about him in the past few months. We go out together, around two or three times a week, both with and without groups. I try to be flirtatious with him but I don't have much experience. He looks *very* confused (also scared and nauseous) when I touch his arm or try to hold his hand. I haven't confronted him about this yet. I'm starting to feel ridiculous. I would just assume he wasn't interested in me anymore and let it go if our outings didn't feel so much like dates.

The only time he texts me is for very basic information about our plans. I want him to text me more often, like when we aren't going to see each other for a few days. I have already tried to ask him why he doesn't like texting but I didn't get much of an answer. I have tried to make conversation over text but all I really get are one-worded answers. Other than for making plans, if I do not text him, he will go weeks without making any contact. I do not want to pressure him into contacting me more because I don't want to force it, but at the same time I feel like he doesn't care about me when he does this.

He has done me many favors without my asking. He's gone out of his way to help me and spend time with me. He has also warmed up to me over these months time. He jokes with me and talks about his past and his family, where he didn't before.

Neither of us has dated / been in a relationship before. I know this isn't a very specific question.. I'm just wondering if anyone here has any advice..? Even just experiences you've had similar to his that might help me understand his point of view could help! I just want to understand and help him be more comfortable around me.

I have some social anxiety issues but they're not nearly as bad as his are (he can barely make eye contact for more than a few seconds at a time, tends to freeze up and not answer questions, usually red-faced, looks stoic to many but I can tell he's scared).  I was wondering if the texting issue is a social anxiety-related thing?

If you would like any more detail I'm open to questions. Thank you!",29Dec2019,1

187,"Me and my best friend have been friends for 4 years, we took her to see a concert for Panic At The Disco for her 16th birthday. She was my friend when I stopped seeing my father and has been there for me. Over the summer I took her to counseling (which my mom payed for) because she was self harming and super depressed. That was in June. 

She moved away to Baltimore and has been doing A LOT better, she’s not depressed, not self harming and recovering from an eating disorder. 

In August we got into a HEATED argument over what I’m going to tell you today. And we stopped talking for two months. 

Recently she hasn’t been texting me. She’s been ignoring me and leaving me on read, she doesn’t text me unless she has something to talk about. Any time I have something to talk about it’s always “that’s nice/cool/good” or if I’m sad “I’m sorry” and then change the subject. When SHE is having problems I try to come up with solutions to her problems and when she’s excited about something I try to act excited also. 

She’s stopped referring to me as her best friend and only her friend whereas I call her my best friend. 

Last night I texted her this: 
“i love you and I know you probably don’t but I do and I don’t want to ever lose you again so I’m gonna keep fighting to keep you in my life even if you don’t want to be in my life anymore I’ll still fight to keep you in it because I love you so much and you’re my best friend even if I’m not yours” (I copied and pasted it) and she left me on read and hasn’t answered me.

192,"I’m a 26 year old male who has dropped out of college a few years back and has been working odd jobs ever since. I have also been depressed for a while but recently, few months ago, I have been a lot better. I never had a girlfriend before but I am not a virgin. I’m not assertive but I’m trying to be.

A few months ago I applied to work for the electrical union and I also made an attempt to join the army. Both opportunities told me that it takes a while to join. The union will take 6-9 months before I’m even accepted and the army is taking longer than expected because I had a DUI 4 years ago and I needed a waiver they’re currently working on. 

Last night I woke up feeling extremely unmotivated. I didn’t want to play games, I usually play 2-4 hours daily. I didn’t feel going out to hang out. I didn’t want to eat. I didn’t know what I wanted. So I asked myself, what do I want? I looked at YouTube videos about backpacking the world and that didn’t inspire me. I don’t want to travel. I thought about going back to my country and I also didn’t want to do that because I would get bored. I was raised here. I thought about my passions and also didn’t find hope there.

I thought about the army opportunity and didn’t feel aroused by the idea of joining anymore. Same thing with the electrical opportunity. I don’t know if I want to do either anymore. I’m leaning towards a no but In my mind I know I have to because it’s a life changing opportunity. I also feel pressured because I don’t want to disappoint my mom. I don’t want to hurt her. Sometimes I think I’m doing this for her. Even a million dollars in the bank wouldn’t satisfy me. I would still feel the same way but In a nice apartment. 

Today I woke up the same way. With the same mentality so again I asked myself what do I want? I searched deep in my heart and I truly know now I want a partner. I feel like I need a partner to spend time with and grow old with. To share and to enjoy together. I want kids and someone to love. I think I’m scared to be 40-50 with no wife, money, or children. 

I feel like if I got a girlfriend tomorrow I would drop everything and be with her, except my casino job. I wouldn’t go to the army or join the union. I would just be with her and do what couples do.

The only think I know for sure is that I don’t want to kill myself. I may be depressed but I will never take my own life. 

I’m not sure the exact advice I’m seeking but if you have some insight I would appreciate it. I’m extremely indecisive atm and don’t know what I want. 

Thank you

  Ever since her parents divorced, my friend (who I’ll call F) has been telling me about how miserable she is in her mom’s house. She tells me about how her mom’s boyfriend has changed her life for the worse. F told me that her mom was so nice before she started dating her boyfriend. 

Some of the things F told me about her mom
•F’s mom threw her on the ground and kicked her until her grandma pulled her off

•Her mom constantly grounds her for simple things like “looking angry in her house”

•She took F’s phone away like 3 months ago for the above reason. She has not given it back since even though her mom was not paying for her phone bill anymore.

•She threatens to not let F see her sister if she doesn’t do what she wants

-I’m going to add more rn because I can’t remember some of them so brb-

  Basically, I feel sad for F. She tells me that she wants to die as she hates how her mom makes her feel. Thankfully, I am able to stop her from doing bad things to herself most of the time, but I am afraid that one day she’ll go too far. Her dad has decided that he’ll start taking her to therapy, so I hope that that’ll help her, but what can I do? My other friend (who I’ll call H) and I have decide we want to do something about this as we are tired of how F’s mother treats her. 

  H and I kinda want to report some of what F’s mom has done that is actual abuse, but we are scared of how F will react to this as she’s said she doesn’t want to be separated from her younger siblings. If we tell someone, will they actually do anything? Is this enough to report her mother? F has showed us bruises before that her mom gave her, so that’s physical proof. 

Basically,
•Do we have enough to report her mother?
•Will F hate us if we do this?
•Is there a chance F might get separated from her siblings?
•If there isn’t enough to report her mom, what else can we do?

If I do I will have to find an apartment because dorms are not for me between the fact that they are extremely expensive and I'll have to find new places during breaks and the lack of privacy overall, not something I wanna be apart of. (I'm aware some colleges make freshmen live on campus none of my college choices have that requirement. )Right now I have a job and I'm working a 12 hour day, 5 days a week between the job and school. Anyway, my home life is toxic so I won't have any financial support from them. They have offered to give me a car but I'm afraid it will only be used to manipulate me and once I announce my choice to go NC they will most likely try to get it back, and I don't want that legal drama. Perhaps I can get them to sign it over in my name. (PS. I'm thinking more towards out of state so that will be even more expensive. MY INTENDED MAJOR IS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION) Anyway, I'm just looking for some reassurance or advice if you have anyway about leaving this toxic home situation and how to afford it with little to no financial aid from my family.

I live in America if that will influence your advice. I posted this on college advice no answers so hoping to get some here. :)",29Dec2019,1
208,"Hi everyone.

Quick back story, I was verbally and physically abused by my dad until I was 13 when my mom left him and took us with (yes cliche abuse story etc etc). I am now 24 and I've moved on. I was on good terms with my dad and I thought he'd become a better person when he married my step mom (who is an amazing, strong, wonderful woman).

They had my brother who is now 5 and he is the best thing in my life.

Yesterday I was at their house, and he told me that he wishes that my dad were dead and told me that one time he pulled my step mom down the stairs and said she was going to call the police. And just knowing how he is, I know this isnt the first time it's happened. 

When he told me, my step mom shushed him and we didn't talk about it or address it, and I didnt know what to say, I was shocked and really sad to hear it. But I dont want my brother shushed when he talks about abuse. I've seen how my dad punishes him in ways that are way too much for what the situation calls. I don't want my step mom abused and hurt and put down. Her parents are dead and she has no family around. She has nowhere to go and I dont want my dad to ruin her life.

But I dont know what to do. Hes my dad. I know he loves them (not an excuse of COURSE). I love my dad. They love my dad. But hes awful and I have no idea what to do. I want them to know they are safe with me and that i love them and that i know my dad is awful and they need to do what they need to do to be safe but I dont know how to tell them and I dont want to go to the cops because it's my DAD but I dont want to be the bystander that does nothing.

Does anyone have any experience or suggestions? I've been sick to my stomach all day over it.",29Dec2019,1

On my days off its extremely tough to schedule times to hangout with my friends. They are usually always busy with their other friends or something similar.

Most of the time I'm left spending the weekend alone or I'll drive to my parents house and hangout with them or watch a movie. Lately I've been feeling lonely and depressed.

I'm not hard to make friends with either. I'm funny, easy going, great conversation, and overall a great friend to anybody who makes an effort to hangout with me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong if I'm here on reddit spending another Saturday alone. Cheers.",29Dec2019,1
210,"Ok so if it isnt obvious by the title, im an angsty teen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I just turned 15 and I NEED friends desperately. I always had 2-3 really close friends when I was younger but me and my neighbor (best friend at the time) just grew apart and had different interests through years. I went to a charter school and so always had the same class mates give or take, sure I had plenty of school friends but anytime I tried to spend time with anyone they were always busy or just didnt want to. another thing with that is since I knew how to talk to the people I knew I never really learned any social skills. Dont get me wrong I am an extrovert but I just cant seem to make friends.

Since Ive entered high school I have only made one meaningful relationship, ironically a girl. and even better we were basically neighbors. then she moved 30 mins away, maybe not a big deal for most but i dont have a car and the bus ride takes an hour and 30 mins, so that has pretty much eliminated us hanging out irl. 

I could pursue more friends in high school however ive been expelled for 3 months now. (drug abuse). 

anyway not having anything to do with anyone for 3 months has been pretty damn soulcrushing and now I have clinical depression. (ive always been sad but my mom got checked out when I didnt leave my room for 4 days.) my therapist believes the loneliness is the biggest reason why im depressed. (we have deducted that I only started getting sad and fat after I lost my neighbor.) 

so yeah just need to know how to make friends. again ive tried to hang with people in hs but no one is ever  down. my dad has recently been diagnosed with rectal and prostate cancer, and is expected to be dead by march so I really need someone to spend some time with and talk too.

This is a seemingly normal white family, and I’m guessing these were handed down to them from their family or something. My mom told me not to say anything.

No one has ever told me I'm unattractive before, and he used to compliment me all the time. Like all the time. I've been on the best dressed lists on websites before, and he sometimes still will tell me I'm pretty, but then out of nowhere he'll tell me I'm unattractive.

I'm a normal weight for my height, I have great teeth and hygiene, I've never thought I'm ugly - but now the person I love is telling me I'm unattractive. He also says things about my weight and that I'm more ""loose"" than he wants. In the past I've forgiven him for cheating on me - and I really have forgiven him, meaning it's behind us, but I'm just not sure what would cause someone to turn on me so much.

It makes it very hard for me to connect with people and contributed a lot to my difficulty with being affectionate or intimate. I also think I’m asexual which might add to it.

Basically, I like my boyfriend. I think we have a lot in common, and I don’t mind being in the relationship. The thing is, I’m finding it difficult to actually feel... romantically attracted to him. I don’t really... care either way. I just feel so neutral in the relationship. We kiss or cuddle but I just do it because I dunno... I feel like it’s the thing you should or have to do. But I do like spending time with him.

The worst part is that because of my social problems, I have to drug myself with 2 or sometimes 3 times the recommended dose of benzos whenever I go see him just so I can feel normal and be moderately ‘fun.’

225,"It started about 5 years ago, I noticed that I went to the bathroom more frequently than my friends. Started out just thinking that I drank too much liquids that day which resulted in the frequent urinations. But sometimes I won’t drink anything at all and still have to pee every hour, sometimes every half hour. And if I’m drinking beer...I’ve peed at 15 minute intervals before. More than once. On more occasions than I care to remember. 

I have anxiety, undiagnosed but I get panic attacks from time to time so it’s pretty obvious. I’ve heard they are related somehow, because a lot of people pee a lot when they are nervous. Sometimes I can’t pee in public bathrooms due to stress that others are watching me or it’s too loud in the bathroom. I’ve been to several doctors who all say that I have a clean bill of health (physically). A couple physicians and 2 urologists all say that my urine, blood work, and X-rays state there is nothing physically wrong with me. Also, I can’t gain weight, I’ve weighed 120 pounds for about as long as I can remember. Idk if it’s related at all but I’ve been told that I might just have a super efficient metabolism which causes my body to break down liquids and food very fast.

I hope someone can give me suggestions on how to possibly go about curing this. I’ve been told that drinking lots of water can help put my body back to normal. Also, doctors have prescribed pills that have given me horrible side effects and barely helped the problem. It’s not that I care whether people think I’m weird for peeing a lot, I just don’t want to miss out on opportunities in my life due to this problem.

227,"To start with, I have some major social and mental problems which make social environments... An issue. I'm okay online, but in person my behaviour and mental state is entirely unpredictable. One day I'll be in a common area chatting away and socialising just fine, the next I won't leave my room even to use the bathroom because I am so petrified of having to interact with someone. It also affects my reactions to other people's opinions and generally, everything. So people can be afraid of expressing how they feel to me in fear that I'll take it badly and to heart, or generally feel stuck when it comes to approaching me and getting close. Because of all of this combined with a dash of childhood trauma, I'm incredibly good at pushing people away and doing things alone, and incredibly bad at letting people in or anywhere close to me. 

Now, to the couch hopping issue. 

The day before Christmas, I left home. After years of clashing with my parents and generally debating whether it was even healthy for me to be living with them, they had a talk to me about the issues I've listed above and how they felt trapped and manipulated by them, and completely unsure as to how to deal with me, and I took that very personally. In the moment it felt invalidating, like I had to ""just change"" and somehow become someone I'm not, somehow instantly change the wiring in my head to feel and react different ways. So I left, right then and there. I have since spoken to them about this, and we're all back on speaking terms but agree that home is not the best place for me right now. The problem is, I'm still completing my uni degree, and can't handle having a job as well. People will generally hear that and say something along the lines of ""suck it up, there are people who can manage to do much more than that at once and you'd be surprised what you can do when you push yourself"". Sure, that's true. But I held a job, full time and eventually dropped to part time, for a year while I have been studying. The stress built up over time and ended with me being hospitalized, entirely because of my issues and the way they interact with that stress. I can't do more than a part time load without this repeating itself, I've tried. 

So currently, I'm staying with my partner and his housemate rent free. My partner has had a chat with his housemate about this, and... The social issues are a problem. So I'm likely on a timer as to how long I can stay. I have other friends, a few other places I can go when my time here runs out, but my issues will follow me. In the end, everyone will always need some aspect of me and these issues to change in order to be comfortable with my presence. That's what happened at home, it's what is happening here, and... I'm scared. My money will run out, so will couches I can crash on. I don't want to end up on the streets, but I might not have a choice. I'm on expensive medication, the ""severe"" issues watchlist at my uni, have multiple psych doctors and counsellors following my case. On the psych end of things, I'm using every resource available to me and sure, my issues will change and improve over time, but I need something to change right now, or I'm going to be on the streets. 

I don't know what to do. I'm going to prepare myself for the streets by mapping out any resources I can use for food and water and power, I'm going to take advantage of campus when its open again after the Christmas break, I'm going to crash on couches for as long as I can stretch this out. But if I end up on the streets, just trying to manage alone and being left with my own mind for so long, I can almost guarantee I will end up dead, whether that's at my own hand or by some accident involved with being a young female on the street. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks, Reddit.",29Dec2019,1

229,"I’m going to try and keep this short and explain as best as I can.
My mom and him met about 12 years ago. I knew him from before and let’s say he wasn’t boyfriend material. Unfortunately my mom tend to fall for the bad guys and lets people walk all over her. He is high strong, loud, self-absorbed, he is an alpha male, has no filter, rude and disrespectful even to his own mother at times and it’s his way or the highway. He has angers issues and he will never admit his wrongs. He doesn’t have kids either. 
Yes, he can be nice, he’s helpful, if I asked him for a favour he probably would do it. If I needed help he probably would be there.

It became clear from the beginning the boyfriend and I would not quite get along. I’m the opposite of my mom, I will call out someone’s bs and I will stand up for myself and my loved ones. I will not tolerate people being rude and disrespectful to me or my loved ones. So over the past 12 years we’ve had a few fights because I called him out for being stupid. He’s the only one who ever got right in my face and yelled and pointed his finger at me because he can’t admit his wrongs and I’m the only one who dares standing up to him. 
The first time he threw a huge temper tantrum is when I had given birth a week earlier and my mom stayed here for a week to help out. I had really bad post-partum depression and my baby would not sleep! I was a mess. It was time for him to come get my mom back and was supposed to stay for the night. He brought their dog with him and he was warned multiple times not to being the dog because the dog wrecked my floor and furniture because he pisses everywhere inside. When I saw the dog in his arms when he came inside, I remember having an anxiety attack and just saying “no no no no no no no”, I told my mom please do something, I don’t need to clean up after a dog on top of a newborn. He gets right in my face and starts yelling all kinds of rude mean things. He goes and grabs all of my mom’s bags tells her to f*cking leaving right now. So they left and I cried and was mad my mom let someone speak to me this way. He eventually kind of apologized a few months after.

With that being said, I will admit my wrongs. Since my child and losing my father tragically when my son was 7 months old, I haven’t been the same. I do my best to work on myself and I don’t take any drugs or drink away the pain. I have anxiety and I don’t always have the most patience. The only way I can function properly during the day is when my son sleeps good at night. My son’s sleep is so important to me and some people might find it crazy but this is what works for me considering my circumstances. My mom knows this and I thought her boyfriend did.

This past Christmas was the worst. I stupidly decided to take my 3 year old and my husband over to my mom’s to spend our Christmas vacation there.
The 23rd the boyfriend decides to invite 4 of his loud drunk friends to watch the hockey game. My mom’s place is small and only one level, you hear EVERYTHING. I was freaking out inside because my son was finally sleeping somewhere he was not used to. Also I wanted my son to have a full good night sleep so he could stay up late on the 24th because that’s when my family parties for Christmas. I asked nicely twice to his friends to please keep it down and they didn’t give a damn. The boyfriend’s best friend was there with his wife who have 2 young kids and they were the loudest and the ones who cared less about my son. They didn’t care because their kids were sleeping peacefully at their grandma’s. Thankfully they finally left at around 11 pm. But the boyfriend came back home extremely late, at around 3-4 am, waking me and my son up because he has no decency to be quiet. Slamming doors and whatnot. 

Comes the 24th. All my mom’s family came over for dinner and party. My son was having fun with his little cousins. The kids stayed up until midnight. That was really late but I compromised, he would not have been able to sleep anyways with everyone there. So my family all started to leave around midnight. There was my grand-mother left and my uncle. My mom and I were starting to clean up and put the food away. My grand-mother and uncle we’re getting ready to leave, and guess who comes in? The boyfriend’s husband and wife. They are drunk and don’t get the hint at all that the party is over. The boyfriend says come in!! We’re partying all night, until 4-5am! When he knew we planned to have a Christmas morning with my son. Oh and don’t forget he said some rude things to my mom that night and pretty much treated her like a piece of garbage. He belittles and is very condescending, making my mom feel like she’s stupid. Also to note, my mom was very sick the whole time, she had bronchitis or something and it was obvious she was sick.
So anyways, I look at my mom with terror in my eyes when the best friend came in and she was not impressed either with the friend being there. I said to my mom, this can’t be happening, my son will barely get any sleep or any of us and Christmas will be a disaster. My mom wanted the perfect Christmas for my grandson, she maybe sees him 2-3 times a year. 
For one of the first time she stood up for herself and told the boyfriend that she was sick and that she needed a good rest and that the party was obviously over. You should have seen the look in his eyes, scary. He says “PFFFFF REALLY?!”. I knew at that point he wasn’t going to respect her so I stepped in and said very nicely “I’d like for my son and I to have a good sleep because it’s Christmas morning tomorrow”. He looks at me like he wants to kill me. Tells his friend that they’re leaving. They left and I thought alright good, that’s it.
He comes back home once again at 4:40am, wakes me up, because he’s being loud. Has no care for my mom who is sick whatsoever.
Christmas morning he slept the whole time. I opened gifts with my mom, husband, son and brother. I was exhausted but still had a good time.
The boyfriend wakes up late, leaves, texted my brother to say he was having Christmas dinner with his little best friend. We were all invited for dinner at my cousin’s, it was sad and awkward for my mom, people wondered where he were. He didn’t come back that night, slept somewhere else. 

The 26th he finally comes back. Asks my husband for a ride but it was just an excuse to talk to him. He talked so much crap about me to my husband. Tried to turn my husband against me. He even said “I hate her (me) so much, if she died I wouldn’t go to her funeral”. 
He blamed everything on me. All this because my mom and I, not just me, asked if we could have a good night sleep. He said I was a b*tch and that he was going to “f*cking talk to me” and whatever else.
He goes back out all night on the 26th, it was great, I had a peaceful dinner and night with my mom. But once again he woke my son and I when he came back late. We were coming back home the next morning. It was early and my mom came in the bedroom to tell me her boyfriend is FREAKING OUT, and to not talk to him because it wasn’t worth it. I’m like ok? For one of the first times my mom put her foot down, defended me and told him he was in the wrong and to stop disrespecting her. I got my stuff ready, gave my mom a hug and left. He never said a thing to me.

Today, I found out the boyfriend and his best friend AND the wife are talking all kinds of crap behind my back. Keep in mind they’re much older than me. My brother told me everything and he couldn’t believe they were doing this to me. They said I knew nothing because I’m young (I’m 31) and that I do a bad job with my son because he doesn’t talk as much as the best friend’s kids and lot’s of other stuff. I had enough, told the friend to man up and stop talking crap about me and that he didn’t know much more about me (he’s not the smartest guy on the planet, we all know that). The friends freaks out, calls my mom boyfriend, they tried to claim I was harassing them. The boyfriend and the friend and wife told me I was crazy and that I had serious problems. They’re trying to ruin my reputation or whatever you want to call it and going around my whole hometown talking about me, it’s no joke.
I stand up for myself and my mom and now I’m the bad guy and I have “mental problems”. They’re so good at manipulating things and playing the victim. The wife is posting things on Facebook and accusing me of being a narcissist. 

At this point I’m not sure what to do or think. No one ever did this to me, not even my worst enemy, let alone gross ass men and women. It’s pure craziness and I fear they’re not going to stop any time soon. 
All of this mess just because he couldn’t “party” with his little friend, because he didn’t get his way. I said to my mom, if he wanted to act like a little teenager and not care there’s a child, he could just have said so, I would have stayed home.",29Dec2019,1

232,"I have a friend, who I will just call x, and she hasn't had the best life. I've known her my whole life. I don't want to name anything too specific so I'll just say her childhood consisted of divorce, death, moving, and bullying. Her guardian right now isn't a good model, and she has to deal with a lot.

The problems she has are
1. Constantly seeking attention
2. Feels like the world owes her something
3. Constantly wants/asks for material things (clothes, makeup)
4. Rarely says thank you unless reminded
5. Never takes advice

(I know it's bad to point out problems in people, but it's been years and I want to help her be a better person)

She is older than me by two years, and I understand she gets a little more leeway since she didn't have the best upbringing, but her actions are becoming so time consuming and frustrating on my part that it affects me. 

She has an obsession with getting a boyfriend, and constantly asked for advice on her boy problems, but when anyone gives advice she will not take it but complain about the problem anyway.

An example of this could be she was talking to a boy, c. C was a bad guy, and I knew he was. Everytime I told her to cut it off with him she wouldn't listen, but complain about things like ""he left me on read"" or ""he said he loves me"" (conversations about him would last for hours).
Only when she finally realized c was no good she found another guy, J. J seemed better than c, but it was the same thing... ""He left me on read... Etc."" 

I get that being a friend means listening to problems, but when you listen to them for so long, and it feels so one sided, it gets super frustrating. Even more so when said friend doesn't take your advice.

I understand I need to be patient with her, but it almost feels like she isn't learning, or is acting like she isn't for attention. I was wondering if anyone knows what I could say to her to
1. Help her realize that just because something bad happened doesn't mean to world owes her

2. Take advice or don't ask for it

3. Show more graditide

I understand if this post makes me feel shallow or inpatient maybe, but I felt like I should at least ask for advice because of how frustrating it can be sometimes",29Dec2019,1

235,"I am 23, good looking, I can be funny. I've had girls interested in me but I just can't touch or kiss them.

Most of them give up quickly. One noticed that I wasn't comfortable and took the lead. But even then it didn't work. She tried to kiss me and my reflex was to avoid her even though I was definitely interested. 

I have always been avoiding physical contact with people. When someone hugs or touches me, I don't know what to do so I just freeze and it feels awkward. My parents weren't tactile and emotions weren't expressed much. It might explain my behavior but it is annoying and stops me from having normal relationships with people.

237,"So this is about my mother. My father is a G. So as a young boy I’ve been a delinquent. When I started highschool I was tripping out on drugs and running around doing young reckless teenage things and now I’m halfway through my senior year of highschool. When I was younger and doing all these things my mother seemed to not give a shit about what I was doing and let me run off and do whatever, only wanting me to check in and such. Midway junior year I cleaned up my act. I was never good at school. But I stopped doing drugs and stopped hanging with bad people. I’ve stayed pretty clean since, and I could pass a drug test. I’ve also gotten my grades up. But now that I’m doing better my mother has gotten stricter on me. Slowly she has been putting these rules on me that were stricter than before. Like giving me a curfew, checking my grades nonstop, and asking me things and acting suspicious of my activities. I used to be a D average student. Now I’m a C-B average student and whenever I get a low B or high C she questions me and isn’t impressed even going as far as to try and ground me (This is all after I’ve gotten my act together for a while) obviously I feel more responsible and none of her past efforts or actions caused me to do better, I’ve made all of my own decisions. If she tries to do things that I don’t feel is necessary or overstepping I will tell her and battle her tooth and nail to help her understand she’s acting ridiculous. Sometimes she sees it.  Now I’m doing the responsible things on my own, and now that I’m feeling like a responsible person who’s about to face the world as an adult, I feel a little constricted and I feel my relationship with my mother is deteriorating as time passes. She’s only getting more strict as the months pass. Help? I don’t reallly know what to do I just need someone who can relate so I feel alright.",29Dec2019,1
238,"This is literally the dumbest problem ever. I'm afraid to bring it up irl because it's just so stupid. Here's the story:

Last year I (f14) went to a summer music camp for 2 weeks where you ""live"" on a college campus. Although it was an amazing experience, it was also extremely uncomfortable. Every bathroom was made for multiple people. I'm in the US, so typical. 1-2 foot gap above and below stalls, which made it worse. 

Dorm bathrooms always had someone else in them. During the day, there was a stupid rule that you had to bring someone with you everywhere, including the bathroom. Taking a poop was so awkward for me and it was physically hard to survive like this for two weeks. Nausea, diarrhea, and constipation (somehow at the same time) followed. It was pretty awful. 

I'm seriously considering not going again because of this. I always feel this awkward, in school bathrooms as well, but coming home and being able to take a poo privately makes it less of an issue. I feel so anxious and self conscious. Help.",29Dec2019,1
239,"I'm 17 (guy) and my cousin is 20.

My friend said I was fucking weird for thinking that the best feeling in the world is when I hug my cousin, and that I need to find some other girl instead. He also told me it's not normal to look forward to hugging your cousin. But I don't even have a crush on her. But she makes me so happy. I remember that one time when she was lying on her bed, and I went to her room to hug her goodbye, she sat up on her bed and when I hugged her and she laughed it was seriously the best feeling in the world. I don't know why but it felt really cuddly. I don't ever get any physical contact with other girls. I’m pretty ugly and not good at all at socialising so I guess that's why. I’m actually really grateful that I have my two cousins for that. They always smile when we hug, that also makes me happy.    I guess I just love the soft feeling from hugging them. It's nothing sexual, but I feel people will think that just because I mention it's my cousin.

Long story short the girl who said would take the shift did not. And the manager threatened to give my girlfriend a write and also said “since you are not showing up for your shift, we are not paying you for Christmas and the half you worked for” I was confused at first and it sounded a bit weird and illegal.

245,"I'm an 17 yo female. My parents are strict, I'm not allowed to go out when I want (I don't even have friends, but you get the gist). I'm not allowed to have boyfriend (yes, I'm still a virgin). Anyway, I graduate in June 2020. I met this girl this summer, who is 18. She birthed a daughter last year. Even though, she has a child, she only weighs about 85lbs. She is only like 5 feet tall, so I guess she is a healthy weight, I don't know. I have body issues unfortunately and I know it isn't her fault; but every time I see how skinny she is; I get triggered. I feel like she rubs it in my face about her sexual experience. No- she does. She always talks about how her ""man"" did this and that. I can't relate. The girl called me weird once, it kind of got under my skin. I don't like her, to be very clear; not completely sure why. I never told her I was still a virgin or not allowed to date. I feel like people know if you are a virgin. My parents want me to graduate from college before I decide to start having sex. They claim that, ""You won't finish school if you get caught up with boys."" And, ""If you start having sex, you wouldn't care about school anymore.""

I feel like I have no control over my body or my life and maybe I'm just overreacting. Maybe my parents just want to protect me. I feel pressured to lose it.

247,"I have no idea what to do. 

My son is 17, will be 18 in June, and is completely out of control. It’s been a constant struggle for nearly two years now to try absolutely anything to get him back on track but nothing works. 

It happened overnight, literally. He was a great kid, A+ student, football, powerlifting, track, a (sorta too serious for their age) long term gf. He was honest and kind and loved to spend time with us. We had nearly zero issues with him beyond a little back talk and totally typical teen moodiness before. Then, suddenly, he breaks up with his gf out of nowhere around November of last year and it’s been absolutely awful from there. 

In January he conned my sister into house sitting for her and he threw a huge party that ended with her brick mailbox being smashed and her screen porch ruined. He was caught tagging buildings and drinking in March. He was caught with a gun and drinking in May. He was caught shoplifting in August. He’s been caught several times smoking weed and drinking. He’s wrecked two cars. 

We’ve tried everything. Talking? You bet! He says he understands, he writes me notes that are sweet and make me cry and I think I can work back to trusting him again before he’s back to doing the same things. 

Screaming? You bet I’ve lost my temper and raised my voice a few times! (Yeah, I know but you try waking up in the middle of the night to a police call that your son was caught running from them with a GUN before you judge me too harshly here.) 

Therapy? Sure! He won’t go and when he does he won’t take it seriously or talk! 

Discipline? We’ve taken his iPhone, iWatch, TV and car. Grounded him. Told him to get a job. (He won’t. There is always an excuse.)

253,"Let's call my SO Steve and the colleague Jamie. 

Long story short, Steve mentioned he wanted to give Jamie money because they thought their Christmas bonus was ""only"" going to be $500.  (In my experience a $500 bonus is pretty damn good).

We argued about it and I said it was a bad idea and that Steve should not be giving them any money.  

Steve was included at work about discussing the bonus that Jamie would receive.  Steve effectively had the bonus increased from $500 to $700.  But Steve wanted more and told his boss he would give some of his bonus up to Jamie.  Steve's boss said no but suggested that he could give Jamie a small non-monetary gift. 

Steve did buy non monetary gifts for Jamie.  

But I found out a couple of days ago that Steve gave Jamie a check for $800 as a ""Christmas gift"" and she cashed it.  

I'm pissed off for so many reasons:

1) We needed this money for ourselves. New home owners.  We have no blinds on most of our windows etc.
2) We have not been on vacation for two years because we were saving for a house. 
3) Steve went against my wishes and went behind my back. 
4) Who the fuck takes a cash gift from their boss? (A personal check) I certainly would not.
5) it's completely out of character for Steve to spend money.  He is normally very frugal and trying to get him to spend money on us or our home can sometimes be difficult when it's over $300 and not absolutely nesseccary.  


The check is cashed.  It's the only reason I found out.  I'm so angry. Steve said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again but why do it the first place?! What do I do? How can I get over it since there's basically nothing I can do at this point?

257,"My best friend has been telling me he is going to kill himself soon and he doesn't know how much longer he has left. I need advice about what I should do to help him, I'll leave detailed information about the situation.

He has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD. His OCD is really bad and that is the main thing driving him towards this decision. In his mind he always has to do everything right and if he wasn't able to succeed in it at first, he goes back and redoes it until he succeeds in whatever he is trying to accomplish. We graduated high school in May and he had two dreams for high school: make it the best he possibly could and to have a girlfriend throughout it (he has never had a girlfriend before). He started a business in high school and started focusing on that, which took away time from him accomplishing his dreams. We ended up graduating and he was not able to accomplish these dreams and now he is obsessing over them, not being able to fix them. There was a time where a girl that he had liked also liked him and tried pursuing him, but he was obsessing over his business at the time and he didn't focus on her and now she is with someone else. He really likes this girl now and has for a very long time now and now when he sees her with her boyfriend, he wants to throw up and cry (her and the boyfriend have been together for over a year or so and have no signs of breaking up, at least any time soon). He has all of this regret on top of him and he feels since he can not fix these mistakes, there is only one thing he can do to make this pain go away, which is suicide. He is currently taking medicine for his depression, anxiety and OCD, and it works and he gets random spurts of happiness, but he still always feels the depression. He also thinks death isn't bad and has come to terms with dying, he thinks it's okay for him to go anytime now. He claims he doesn't know how much longer he has left and if he isn't able to get with this girl anytime soon, he will probably end his life.

I've tried getting him with other girls but he does not care for anyone else, he only wants this one girl. Also, he is already seeing a therapist but it is not helping him. I really don't know what to do and I don't want to lose my best friend. Thank you.",29Dec2019,1
258,"Dear reddit. Ive turned to all your members for legal advice. For some backstory, my fiancè and I live together and bought an acre and a half of land, however we live right by a swamp so a great majority of that land is wet most of the time. Thats why we had put our camper in the driveway, solid, flat land. For more context the land we bought had a house on it that was destroyed by squatters and we are renovating it for living in later on, thats why we are living in the camper. Fast forward a few months and my fiancè's grandmother is being evicted from her home in California and her 1st son will not take care of her due to his wife not liking her. My fiancè's grandmother also has breast cancer and is getting treatments for it in California. She got her last shot a few days ago (we have a cancer center here in North Carolina for her to go to) we naturally told her she could come put a trailer on our land and live with us and relax while she goes through the rest of her treatment here and is surrounded by family that love her. She buys the trailer from a dealership that is in Florida where she used to live before moving to California. (His family is originally from New York but they move A LOT) The trailer is shipped but its placed roughly 15 to 25 feet behind our camper because of the marshy land so thats why it wasnt further back. We notice something strange when its shipped. The propane tanks are already half full. Why would they be shipped half full on a 16 to 19 hour trip. Is that even legal? We dont really think too much into it until we realize the propane is on. Weird. We tested for leaks on the outside of the trailer where its connected and nothing no leaks OUTSIDE. Okay, all good we think. (Im 21 and my fiancè is 19, we dont have much life experience and his mother moved into our camper and shes around 60 she doesnt know much of these things either) December 27th. We woke up and saw two strangers running to bang on the house beside ours ""what the fuck? Is someone trying to rob us?"" We run outside and they yell our trailer is on fire behind us. They call 911 and I run outside barefoot to try and put it out through the window thats already melted open at this point with the fire extinguisher. No luck. We run because we remember the propane tanks are full. Fire trucks arrive and put out as much as they can. The entire thing is destroyed, melted from the inside out. 
The very same day my fiancè's grandmother is supposed to fly in, shes already on the plane to come here. She flies in and the news is broken to her. I should add the fire department said the fire started around the stove/fridge area. Well my fiancè's grandmother is obviously distraught and we had no idea how it could have happened. nobody had been living in there yet or really used anything. We then do some research and see that the exact same make, model, and year of that trailer had a recall on the ovens to which the dealer didnt inform us about. We havent even had the trailer for 2 weeks. The side of our neighbors house, the panneling is melted as well. Red cross covered about $430 of this which were very grateful for but the estimated damage is $29,500. I would really like some legal advice on what I CAN do and what I SHOULD do. The trailer is not insured. We were denied insurance on the property because the house is unfinished and denied insurance on the trailer because its a hurricane area / flood zone. What can I do?",29Dec2019,1

261,"I’m a college gal in my very early 20s.  Right now, I’m in a loving relationship of 3 years with my bf. I have friends whom I love and adore. 

But....I keep thinking of the future. I’m in college, so I still feel like a student. Very soon, I’ll be out on my own, possibly being with my bf. But....I get sad thinking of me and my bf living together. I love him, but if it’s just the two of us in one place, I may feel lonely. Not because he cannot provide enough love or attention, but because I’d miss my friends. And my mom. 

To make sense of it, basically: Whenever I’m with my friends, I miss my bf dearly. But whenever I’m with my bf, I miss my friends and mom. I can never be satisfied. I’m always missing someone a ton... I just wish we could all live in one big house happily forever, but of course that will never be possible....

I’m so used to being with my mom. My mom admittedly has always been overly involved with my life, and in our culture, usually the child ends up living with their parents. This means that my grandparents also live with us, which I don’t mind. But in my future, I simply don’t see that happening. I want to be independent, and yet imagining a life without my mom in the same home saddens me. It’s so conflicting. I want to move out, but I cannot fathom not having my mom with me in my home. I feel so attached to my mom and my friends. 

Another thing is that Whenever I’m hanging out with my boyfriend, I’m used to thinking “okay, that was nice! And now I get to go home and be in my house”. But, if for example, hypothetically speaking, I get MARRIED to my bf....there won’t be “ok I’m done, now I can relax in my own home!” Because....wherever me and my bf would life would BE my new home....and that’s scary to think about, not going home to my mom. 

I feel sometimes that because of this, I’m not meant for marriage, or any committed relationship for that matter. I’m scared the moment me and my bf move in, I’ll feel lonely and sad without my mom and friends always by my side. I feel that the change would absolutely break my already sensitive heart. 

Im the kind of person that needs constant people in my life. I want to always see my friends. When I imagine a household, I always imagined myself living with some platonic friends + my bf, and just having a happy family of my own together. But if it’s just me and my bf, I feel that would not be enough. I want the household to be lively, full of people....I hope I’m making sense. I don’t want to have kids, and I just want friends as my family (since my original family is not too close, aside from me and my mom). 

I just....I’m scared of leaving my mom, scared of being committed to one singular person. I’m scared of growing up and moving on my own. I’m scared of change. Even though this is what I feel I need to do, the thought scares me. I’ve always been terrible with changes. I cry if I’m in a place that is not home. Please don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love my bf. But imagining a house with only both of us....it scares me, because I fear that I would start missing my friends and mother. I feel like I would feel homesick, and get a huge feeling of isolation, despite being with someone I love....I don’t understand it, but that’s how I feel. 

Are these thoughts all normal? Will I be able to adapt to change despite my constant anxiety? Is marriage/living together with my partner meant for me? How can I satisfy my constant need for all kinds of people? Why do I miss people so much?",29Dec2019,1

263,"My best friend of almost 12 years has been struggling with a specific body issue for some time. This friend is deeply insecure and has felt self conscious about themselves for as long as I’ve known them, this specific issue only being one of many they have insecurities about. This month they finally got a prescription medication that should help with this issue and when they found out and told me I was elated for them. One of the rules of taking the medication is very specific and a few days after the friend had started taking it, we were at a Christmas party when a third friend (who has no knowledge of the medication) offered something that would break the rule. The friend quickly declined and was met with understandable confusion (they had never turned down this thing in the past) and when pressed, explained they had started taking a new medication. The third friend nodded I understanding and said “no worries, I was like that for a while when I was taking ______.”(The exact medication that my friend is currently beginning to take). Given the response of understanding and it being the same medication, I nodded along in the conversation and said “yeah, that’s what they’re taking.” And the conversation quickly died down and we moved on. Fast forward to the next day, I receive a slew of angry and upsetting messages from my friend claiming I have betrayed them and that that was “not my secret to tell”. My stomach dropped. My heart sank. I couldn’t believe that I had betrayed them in this way. At the time I had thought that because the other friend was understanding and had been taking the same medication that divulging that small info was of no consequence. It didn’t even register to me that I could have been doing something wrong. But once my friend was sending me messages and clearly was so upset, it dawned on me how royally I had fucked up. I know I am the asshole. What I did was not done with malicious intent and truly was a simple lapse of judgement on my part. I feel awful. I have apologized to this person over and over and I was even brought to the point of tears I felt so awful. I know how much they struggle with their self image and insecurities and I divulged information that was not mine to give in a moment of what I can only describe as complete ignorance and stupidity. What can I do to make this right? I know I need to give my friend time, and space, but this fight feels different than any we have ever had. I am not willing to lose them over this, but they are so so mad at me and the disgust and guilt I feel is eating me alive. In a moment of weakness while I was highly emotional I stupidly told the friend that they didn’t deserve someone as awful as me in their life if I couldn’t be trusted with this simple secret. I encouraged them to discard my number and move on from our friendship (something incredible out of character which i have never said before). I regret that, and I wish I could take it back but that damage is done. We have been so close for so long, our friendship has outlasted numerous friend groups and so many fights before, but this feels incredibly different than those times. I am so lost. We have on multiple occasions declared each other as our soul mates and jokingly “hereto life partners”. I don’t know how to be myself with this person, and truly believe they don’t know how to be themselves without me. We have always had an incredibly strong and healthy relationship, and I don’t want to lose them. Please, help me understand what I can do to make this right. I feel like such a fuck up, and I can’t believe I have betrayed them this way. Please, please help me.",29Dec2019,1

Main Advice I need: What can I do to help her if she's refusing to help herself?  


More Info: Another example is that she sprays her bed constantly with poison to kill these bugs that don't exist, and we can't take this stuff away from her or she gets violent. So she stays in her room 24 7 with things like diatomaceous earth and cedarcide and other such things, popping any pills she can to get away from this feeling. She never leaves her room and we have to deliver food to her daily. She never showers, never cleans, and her room is full of trash that we simply can't clean every single day... I care about her a lot, and want her to get better, but she literally won't do anything we ask... Like taking vitamin D cuz she's in her room all day. Drinking water instead of 7Up.... (If I don't buy her 7up, she will literally break things like a spoiled child...) This story can go on and on and on... It's getting worse as time goes on.",29Dec2019,1

268,"So I (F17) have been dating my boyfriend (M18) for a little over 7 months now. He’s my first boyfriend ever and I never felt like this with anyone. But I’ve struggled with depression for the last 6 years, so figuring out my true emotions or if it’s just my depression talking is a huge challenge sometimes. Recently, I’ve been afraid that I don’t really love him. My heart feels like I do, but my brain keeps telling me I don’t. Since this is my first relationship, I don’t know what love feels like to me. I don’t want to end things with him but I feel horrible that I’m having these feelings. I often feel like my brain and my depression are not the “real me” and I don’t really know how to avoid these toxic though. For some background, this is how my depression tends to work. I view it as an internalization of fears that lead to confusion and panic attacks. I’ve booked an appointment with my therapist but I really just want some good old fashioned advice. My boyfriend doesn’t really understand, as I’m the first person he knows of who has depression and he doesn’t get it/comprehend what Im talking about some times. I just don’t want to break up with him. I want to stay in this relationship but I don’t want to not love him because my depression is telling me I don’t.

273,"I sincerely apologize for this very long post.

I am a Indian-American 25F graduate student from Alabama and have officially determined that I am an aromantic asexual person. I have never been in or wanted to be in a romantic or sexual relationship with anyone of any gender or sexual orientation. I am really not comfortable with experimenting in romantic or sexual relationships. I am completely fine with spending my life on my own with future potential pets when I have enough money and time. I am super comfortable with telling my friends and little sister that I am an asexual person. They are very accepting and do not treat me differently because of it. 

However, both of traditional, conservative Indian parents are asking me to find an educated, rich Indian man like their friends’ daughters. They think that mixed marriages are terrible and only lead to divorce. Even though, my parents have a terrible marriage themselves. They think “India is the best in the world”. My dad has said this multiple times. My mom and other Indian aunties are asking about when I am going to find an Indian boyfriend whenever they get to see me. They make comments about skin color and weight (110 lbs), but I know that they truly are thinking about my attractiveness for finding a boyfriend. 

I do not how I can even explain to them that I am an aromantic asexual person without them getting super angry and argumentative. They argue with me and my sister if something doesn’t fit their fantasies or traditional views whether it’s religion, politics, sexuality, eating meat, listening to non-Indian doctors, and etc. They are still mad at me for telling them that I am an agnostic theist rather than a Hinduism believer. I know that they will try to argue about who would take care of me, giving them grandchildren, and what would happen to my and their reputation in the Indian community. I don’t give a fucking shit about my reputation in the Indian community; I never have. I have never wanted to be a mother because I know that I would not be a good parent (been thinking about this since I was 13). My dad told me that he wants to sell his business, retire, and move close to with me after I get a stable job and find a potential husband in 3-5 years. They want me to be under their continuous watchful eye and to be their golden child for their bragging purposes. I do not want that whatsoever. I want to be able to take a good job anywhere I can without worrying about human dependents. My dad is very kindly paying for my car, car insurance, dental insurance, and surgery bills since he knows that I don’t make a lot of money. I pay for all of my other expenses and health insurance. I’m planning on saving up to repay my dad back. After getting a good agricultural research-related job, I want to be completely financially independent from my parents so they can no longer exert control over me.

Does anyone have any advice on how to tell traditional, conservative parents that you are an aromantic asexual person? Should I wait until I am able to be completely financially independent to tell them the truth?  Should I try to move away from them as far as I can after I complete my PhD? Right now, I tell them that I am only focusing on completing my PhD and finding a job rather than finding a future husband.",29Dec2019,1
274,"Sorry for my grammar I honestly just bad at writing anyways I’m an international student who smoked weed on occasion and Since August I’ve (20M) lived in a 7 bedroom apartment. Until two months ago in November I was living by myself by pure luck. Then I got two new roomates both(19M) one goes to college with me the other does not. The one that doesn’t go to college  lets call him (WHITEY), lives in the loft and at first seemed like just a spoiled kid but, nothing to bad. Then things got pretty bad fast, he started bringing cokeheads to the apartment, he grabbed my two dogs  very aggressively (which pissed me off at the time). But still no reason to hate the guy. Then I started to notice he enjoys doing bad shit and get away with it. He boasts about how he doesn’t care what he does as long as he makes money. Started using a Venmo scam to get 1,000 while also making people owe 1,000 to Venmo. He’s very misogynistic even going as far as getting angry cuz he brought a girl over who wasn’t feeling well and didn’t want to do anything sexual. Which pissed me off cuz she seemed chill. He also Makes fun of me and the other roommate for being broke, and whitey doesn’t clean. LIKE AT ALL. (This is where I know I’ll get shit but hey I’m going to therapy cuz I questioned the moral of what I did and wanted to know why I thought this was a good idea.) I ransacked the apartment, took all his cocaine and money so that he doesn’t suspect me for stealing and he doesn’t have money to pay rent and he leaves. Instead he called the cops which at the time I was thinking what kind of drug dealer calls the cops when his money and drugs have been stolen. Either way I had to admit it was me and prepare for the worst. Lucky me the cop couldn’t careless and thought I was an idiot. He also went online and said that the cop forced me to give his money and drugs back “in front of him” which is obviously complete bullshit and in reality he whined and eventual the following night we gave it back. Moving along. He then kept growing shrooms and buying more cocaine to sell or to do. I’ve now secluded myself in my room with my dogs, keep it clean as much as possible and most of the time have my window open so the dog smell goes away. But now the issue is how  stinky, wasted food, is all over the rest of the  apartment and I would definitely take responsibility if it was me or my dogs but it’s Whitey. He eats with his mouth open, and his hands. And is really disgusting to live with.  The other Roomate is barely here because he hates being in the apartment now cuz of whitey and I’m current trying to move and have someone take over my lease. But honestly I’d rather report this asshole to the cops but I don’t know what consequences happen if I do. Me and the other Roomate did report Whitey to the leasing office and they said “we can’t go in his room” and , “we don’t have evidence, so we can’t evict him”. They said if we file a police report then they can but I’m still hesitant. Not because I don’t wanna send the kid to jail no he threatened my dogs saying he’d “cut their throats in my sleep” after the cop left when I ransacked our whole apartment so I honestly don’t care and would very much like to see him rot. But also he has a safe where he keeps his coke but not his shrooms. I’m rambling honestly but I want to put as much info as I can so that y’all can help. How should I report him? I know I should def make sure all the drugs are in his room cuz if cops find stuff in the kitchen or common area I’m screwed  mentally yea this has been very stressful, we just can’t live in these conditions anymore and the drugs seem to be a way to get him out cuz we’ve tried setting rules, we’ve tried talking to him. Nothings worked. My roommate followed my lead and also got a lock on his door cuz Whitey liked to go into his rooms and shower and just go through his shit. (Whitey has his own bathroom but doesn’t want to use it only cuz it doesn’t have a curtain) anyway after the lock was installed literally an hour after, WHITEY breaks in and goes through my roommates shit.  the whole reason we got locks was to stop him from going into our rooms and he still breaks in and im honestly so fucking done and I wanna move out or have him move out. Aight I said what I gotta say if you got question I’m happy to reply but if you got any idea what the hell is the process of reporting my Roomate for doing drugs to the cops and how do I protect me and the other Roomate for consequences please help",29Dec2019,1

But at the same time, it’s not like I don’t “know my body”, but what’s prompted that successful exploration isn’t anything having to do with ME specifically— in fact, it never has. Sometimes ya just need some you time. The feeling hits, you take care of it, done and done. 

A friend of mine told me she thinks about sex all the time. A few of my other friends talk about relationships in ways I just don’t “get”, and when I say I don’t understand, they’re left baffled.

I’ve been in one short relationship. It ended because while the guy was amazing, I felt NO physical attraction. 

I feel like my close friends are all I need.

I guess what I’m asking is, wtf is “normal”? Do people really think about sex that often? Do they imagine themselves, or specific situations, or other people? Is sexual attraction seriously something that happens off the bat?! Do people see other people and think about how they want to get with that person? Like, SOMETIMES i think about sex in a fictionalized sense, but it’s a choice I make, not something I can’t control, and it’s never about another person I know/have met.

Then out of nowhere, two guys appeared in my life at pretty much the same time. The first one is someone I met at school several years back before going off to university. We got along in class and when the quarter ended he asked me out on a date. Things got busy and the date fell through, but I recently ran into him and we started talking again and made plans to hang. I was always attracted to this guy, though, as much as I like him, I feel like our lifestyles and interests don't overlap much. On the other hand, I have noticed someone at work who works in a position above me. While we work in different departments, we've always noticed each other in the halls and the spark was there. For the last few weeks he had to work on something in my dept., so we started to talk a little bit here and there about work matters. As much as I sense he's attracted to me, it doesn't seem like he's trying to make any moves and things aren't progressing. Between the two, the guy from work seems like the kind of person I'd want to get to know. He seems like someone I'd want to befriend, he's attractive, intelligent, laid back- pretty much my idea of the 'full package'. Though I don't know how long I might be waiting for him to make the next move (I would def. be uncomfortable asking him out myself, especially with our position difference). At the same time, in fear of leading someone on, I feel like I should be putting other opportunities on hold that I'm less certain about. Then that's always a gamble when you put all your eggs in one basked, so to speak, and concentrate your efforts on one person. Sorry for the length, what would  you guys do in my situation?",29Dec2019,1
294,"Long story short, I’m 16 and living with a chronic/terminal illness. (I don’t like to give my diagnosis out, even on the anonymous internet, sorry) I’ve known my life will likely be shorter than most and end in either my late teens or early adulthood for a year and a half now. I’m in debilitating pain and usually nausea daily and even eating food or doing other basic activities like showering is becoming a lot harder. After consulting with my primary specialist a few days ago, my mom and I were informed it’s not likely that I’ll even live to see the end of high school at this point.

I see a therapist and am in a support group to personally cope with this, but my question is about telling others this information.

I’m letting my mom handle telling family so my question is with my friends. I’ve been ill since I was 8, and even though it’s obviously been something incredibly prevalent in my life I’ve been pretty private about this. My healthy friends know I suffer from a chronic illness, but they don’t know it’s terminal. My closest friend knows I’m terminal, but not how bad it is. He’s been great about everything and very supportive, just like everyone else in my life. We are very close.

Part of me feels like I owe it to them to tell them. Another part of me doesn’t even want to, and is so afraid of them feeling pain over this or treating me differently that I’m discouraged from sharing the situation with anyone outside of close family or the aforementioned support group. I also am just generally wary of telling people and like to be very private when it comes to my health.

I’ve gotten good at hiding a lot of this from those closest to me, mostly out of fear or not wanting attention. But I feel like it’s a bit different now.

Another thing to consider: I may still progress and my lifespan could extend pretty significantly. When I was originally diagnosed as a child I was expected to die within a few months but I recovered and things were way more under control. I’ve currently lived twice as long as any medical professional expected. This is just an estimate, a likelihood. Nothing is guaranteed.

What do I do? What’s the best way to tell friends about this? If one of your friends were dying, what would you appreciate them doing?

I didn't like this idea for many reasons but the biggest being she hasnt known him for more than a day and is already meeting up with him. Her date was at 5:30 PM today and its bearing 1:30 am right now. It's been 8 hours and I havent heard a word from her. I asked her to check in with me every so often to let me know how things are going and she promised she would. She met up with him at the mall so very public place and sent me a picture of her there at 5:30. but I havent gotten anything from her since. And shes the type of person that is constantly on her phone and replies back to me within a few minutes. Even when shes at work she replies back within a few minutes. And when shes gone on dates she still texts me back within a half hour/hour. This just isn't like her and I'm extremely worried something happened to her. Her location is on on snapchat and I can see shes in the next county over and is at a house. I've called her several times and blew up her phone on snapchat texting her and theres zero sign of her.

299,"TL;DR My mom has shown nonstop toxic behaviors for most of my life and I want to cut her out completely but there's a small part of me that wants to support and help her. 

This is a bit long, sorry.

Ey all, my mom had me and 2 out of my four siblings fairly young-- the oldest of us at 19 yrs old. She dated on and off with gross, abusive men throughout my childhood and finally got married to a horrible man when I was 5-6. He was incredibly abusive and manipulative. I'm aware that my mom faced a lot of it as well, it wasn't just her children. But she never once stood up for us and was emotionally abusive towards us as well. They ended up having two daughters together when I was 11. I love my sisters so much, they mean more to me then I can express. 
I learned later my mom came from a horrible home, her siblings and parents were abusive to her. She started doing hard drugs around 14 and didn't really stop until she married my stepdad--explains all the horrible guys she'd bring around us when we were small. 
Anyways they get divorced--and this is when shit gets super wild. I'm 17, because my stepdad was so controlling--cameras all over the house, restricted internet use (couldn't even look at Google images for anything), and steep punishments that ostracized us from our friends-- it was like a new found freedom when they separated. I got a phone, talked to boys, got my license. My siblings and mom seemed to be instantly happier too. 
But my mom quickly started loosing custody of the twins. Because of her Rocky history and his manipulativeness he was able to convince the psychiatrist and courts that she was the crazy one. They wouldn't even take testimony from us-the three older children. 
After a two year divorce fight my mom slowly started to lose control and took up heavy drinking. And then when she got 40/60 custody of my little sisters she started to take drugs. Which--to no one's surprise--ended her fight on custody for them and he got full. 
I've supported my mom as eldest daughter my whole life. I was the mother to my siblings when she didn't care. When I started to work I spent my money on helping out as much as I could--groceries ans recreation for my siblings to get out of the house as much as possible. Things like that. I became the little matriarch of our house. 
To get this off my chest--I loathe my mother. Like full on hate. And it's been brewing for a long time. I feel as if she has robbed my from a childhood, she is weighing me down on my adult decisions, and she still refuses to support me in any possible way. 
When my mom had a bad trip and called 911 insisting she was raped, drugged, and that someone had stolen parts of her body. I showed up to the house at 1 in the morning to comfort my siblings and talk to the police and EMTs. 
When my mom got robbed I was the one who helped her fill out a police report and change her locks. 
When my mom suffered another bad trip I came over when she called. She pointed a gun at me and insisted I was a kidnapper. I was the one who worked with the police and was trusted with her gun collection--which I did not want. 
I've had incident over incident where I had to be the one to help her. Where I had to put myself in danger to make sure she was okay. My siblings have also been a huge help, but it always landed on me to deal with the big stuff. And then my siblings moved away to get far from her. But I love my job and life where I live so I was the one to continue to help. 
It's been like this for years. And this Christmas she pulled the final straw from me and I decided I was finished. That I would cut strings and let her figure her own shit out for once. Because it has been taxing. She makes me depresses and anxious. I'm disgusted when I'm in her company, I cannot stand her. 
Then she told me she was going to rehab in a couple of weeks and that she's going to get better. But she's going to need help through the process. I don't want to help, except for the small empathetic part of my body says I should. That after all she is my mother no matter what crazy shit she's done to me. And now I'm confused and lost. 
It feels like I'm trapped between cutting ties off and it being a horrible mistake or sticking through it and it becomes an endless cycle of abuse. Advice would be appreciated and sorry again for a mountain of a text.",29Dec2019,1
300,"I have a best friend for over 10 years, but we’ve been kind of estranged the last 2 years, since we’ve lived in different states. The communication has decreased on his end in both quantity and quality, for awhile I understood he was going through some shit. But he’s in a really good place now, and is him again but the communication hasn’t repaired. There are really good days where I feel like I shouldn’t worry, but then times when it matters and I do need that support and communication with a friend, it’s just not there. I’ve always been there for him, especially when he was dealing with a shitty ex and depression, I always give him a majority of my attention and support when I see he’s reaching out and needs it. 

Now currently: today was a bad day. I have been dealing with some what depression (I take medication but I still have bad days), isolation since moving I have gone from tons of friends to 2 which makes finding someone to hang out with very limited. And I know I can just go out and make friends but there’s some comfort in just hanging out with someone you have known for awhile and have a bond. That’s how I felt today. And the foundation for all this was being really emotional from starting my period. So it was just one of those days. I reached out to him to just have comfort in talking to a friend, support, and to express what I was feeling. The response I got was one where I felt like I was bugging or needy. I basically got “yeah I get you.” “Yeah that sucks”. 

If it is just him being oblivious (which is very out of character from our friendship—though it’s happened a couple times before this time within this past year) how do I ask him for that support without him feeling like I’m telling him “hey! Stop what your doing and your life and pay attention to me! I need attention!”. I just want him to understand I just need a friend to vent and talk to. The problem is 1. He can get defensive when confronted even if it’s not in aggression. 2. I have brought up his decreases communication with me by subtly asking if he was okay, if anything was wrong. Didn’t get get much feed back and things got better for a week or two before returning to the decreased communication.

I don’t know how to address it without him getting defensive or maybe I shouldn’t at all and just let our friendship be whatever it will be even if it means that it might lead to a very surface type of friendship.",29Dec2019,1
301,My male friend always hangs out with this girl. She drives him everywhere since he doesn't have a car. Sometimes they hangout at like 2-3am. They go out for dinner sometimes have and went to the movies a couple times together. I have never seen them kiss or anything but she jokingly gives him hugs once in a while.

302,"And I really like her. I've known her since elementary school, been talking to her for multiple months now (after both of us got out seemingly steady relationships we had been in), we've gone out sooo many times, but idk what she really thinks about being in a relationship with me. I went over to her house and hung out with her fam, her friends were over and I was just entertaining her little sis when they started talking about baby names. It was funny cuz she mentioned we talked about them a bit while we were out that day, then her friends got to looking at her list making fun of some of the names. They said most of them were names for black kids, which I didn't think much about because I'm black (well I'm mixed but whitewashed) and she is white. She just said yeah she knows and she wouldn't give any little white boy that name, she was thinking about adopting, saying it was the only way she would get a black or mixed kid. Idk know about the people on this app, but especially at this point in my life, when I'm preparing for a relationship I'm thinking pretty long term. Now I'm not saying that I was already thinking about having kids with her, but just that I'm not much of a ""short fling"" type guy. So when she said this I questioned first the longevity and the purpose of this relationship. Is that fair? Is this that much of a red flag? Any answers, advice, and/or support is welcome, I just don't really have many answers myself.",29Dec2019,1
303,"So I just got into an altercation with my mother about 15 minutes ago. Basically as I was going up the stairs from my basement, I accidentally stepped on a mouse. I was wearing socks and felt myself step on something furry, then I looked down and screamed at the top of my lungs. I was going upstairs to get something to drink but I left my phone in the basement. I am terrified by mice and was in shock about what just happened. I then told my mother what happened and asked if her if she could please go downstairs and get my cell phone. She said no and kept going on about how she also has an extreme fear of mice (I have never heard this before). Then she suggested I go upstairs and wake up my 90 something old grandmother out of bed (it is the middle of night right now where I am located) and have her walk up and down 3 flights of stairs to get me my cell phone. I asked my mom if she was serious because the fact that she even thought that would be okay to do is very bizarre. Anyway I told her that I couldn't believe she suggested that and I asked her again if she could just get the phone. She again (yelling) told me no she has an extreme fear. Then she suggested both her and I go downstairs to get it. I told her no since the reason behind me asking her is because I did not want to go downstairs period. After a few more minutes of pointless back and fourth I just said fuck it and ran to the basement to get my phone and ran right back up. Now that I got my phone she says to me ""see you did it"" to which I responded to her that the behavior she just demonstrated was totally disgusting. She then got extremely defensive going on and on about how she has her own fears, she is not a man (yeah I know), blah blah she would've gone to get it if I went with her. I then told her that as a mother she should put those feelings aside and try to help me since I am her daughter (is that wrong?). I said that if this was the same situation except I was the mother and my daughter was asking me to do something that scared me I would still do it because I am the mom. After this statement she really went off. She started saying random things like ""sorry I am not perfect"", ""I guess you think I'm invincible"", ""yeah that's right I never do anything for my kids"", and ""omg it's a Saturday night I don't have time for this"" (keep in mind I stopped talking and she was literally talking to herself at that point). Then all I said to her was again that I would not have behaved that way if the roles were switched and the fact that she even thought waking my grandma up in the middle of the night was a good idea was disturbing. She then started yelling again saying ""Is there something wrong with you?"", ""you are sick in the head"", ""wtf is wrong with you"", ""you need help"", ""you are selfish"", ""you are not well"" and ""you are making up things"". It is possible that I could be in the wrong here but I really don't believe I am. And her responses are totally distorted and defensive which just makes me feel like thats further confirmation that she too realizes she messed up and is now trying to make me feel guilty or bad about myself. What I find more hurtful about her last comments are the fact that just last week I had to go to the doctor and get put on medication for severe depression and anxiety which she is completely aware of. I apologize for the length, I tried to keep it as short as possible. What are your thoughts?",29Dec2019,1
304,"For a few years now I’ve taken multiple showers or baths a day, during this time I usually masturbate at some point. I don’t get a lot of privacy outside of the restroom, locks on bedroom doors aren’t aloud and my parents come in when they want (Its their house I’m not going to challenge that). I’ve asked if it was ok doing so, and if it was racking up the water bill. They said it was fine and the water bill wasn’t a problem, so I continued. The bathroom is the only place with a lock, its the only place I’m not bothered. I feel like I have real privacy. 

My sister and I haven’t had a good relationship since we were little. The other night, she had a friend over, I walked by her room and the door was open. I heard them giggling, I then heard her say “yeah, he takes like ten showers a day. I think-“ I stopped listening after that. I think she was talking about me but I didn’t want to eavesdrop any longer and I guess I didn’t really want to know if it was about me.

I thought I was so sneaky. I really thought they wouldn’t notice. I thought the water and music I played would drown out any noice. But thinking about it now, it was probably very obvious. 

I’m afraid shes going to tell other people, or that anyone she has told will tell others. I’m afraid my parents noticed or that I made anyone uncomfortable. I feel really embarrassed and overall pretty horrible. Will they forget about this? Are there any ways for me to be more secretive about it? Should I just stop?

My boss wasn’t my boss that long ago. We were coworkers on the same level and when I was hired he was the one to train me. I already knew a lot of the things he was training me so I’d ask him to skip ahead. At the time he took that as me being bossy and cocky which then made him rude and resentful. At that moment in time we did not get along. 
Then he was promoted to be my boss. I didn’t care for him but I stayed optimistic. Over time we became more friendly, he started opening up to me and flirty.
But one time he told me if I was to do anything with him it would be completely secret. I didn’t appreciate it at all. I told him I don’t want to be someone secret, I would want someone to show me off and be proud. 
He said that our higher up boss would help arrange me transferring if we were to date. I had been at that location first and I thought that sounded unfair. 
Some time passes and all the sudden my boss and a coworker start saying horribly sexist things. I laughed it off and tried giving it back to them but all it did was make my boss say violent things like “I’d love to shove you against the wall”. 
I told our higher up boss what he said and an HR complaint was made, which was not something I wanted, at this time I just wanted to transfer and get away.

312,"Let me start this post by saying that I live in a toxic home. Although my dad has his head on straight, my mother is a toxic narcissist that allows me no privacy and takes a toll on my mental health with degrading comments.

When I was 18, I moved off to college an hour away and made a bunch of new friends. When I was in high school and living at home, I had few friends and was kind of an introvert.

I transferred schools two years ago and moved back home. After reconnecting with an old friend of mine that I hadn’t seen for years, we moved out of our parents homes and got an apartment together. Unfortunately, the “friend” had developed bipolar disorder and didn’t take his medication. He tried to murder me in my sleep that night and after legal action I moved back home.

I’ve been back home for over a year and feel as if I’m not growing as an individual whatsoever. I can have girls over but I feel as if there’s no privacy since my mom is always barging into my room. I don’t have any friends (I have a few but I can tell they keep their distance), and I have friends at work that don’t invite me out at all.

The other night, a coworker of mine came up to me and said that she is getting an apartment and is looking for a roommate. Since I’m not taking online classes so I can work more, I have $2k saved up and told her that I would be down. She came up to me today asking me if I was serious and I said yes. After some further discussion she’s planning on moving in a few weeks.

I came home today and told my dad. He pretty much dismissed the whole idea and told me “don’t be stupid”. I’m kind of bummed about that but at the same time feel as if I should move out to grow as an individual more. I think my dad thinks it’s a dumb idea because I can just live at home for free while I’m finishing up school.

But I have been feeling blue lately.

My productivity has gone out the window, and life seems kind of empty. I want to just sit and do nothing, like a lot of introverts, but I can't.

My sleep schedule is messed up, too. I keep waking up for long periods in the night, or staying up way too late, to the point where doing anything is hard.

But on the other hand, I know I have a good life. The fact that I'm talking to you right now means that things could be a lot worse for me.

And I haven't heard of depressed people being this self aware about it. I'm not suicidal or anything, but I do feel blue. And I keep thinking it's dumb. I hate it. It's dumb that some mental issue is keeping me from being productive. It's stupid that this is even a thing I need to wonder about.

Of course, this could be 100% due to a lack of vitamin D. I do remember feeling like this last year.

I think of how to get away with rape and murder all the time. I hate black women even though I'm black. Plus I'm very sexist and misogynistic but I don't let it show. I have no real connections to my friends, I would be fine without them. I don't know who I am. I don't know where I'm going in life. I feel like a failure. I'm addicted to porn and masturbation. I feel like my family doesn't know me because they don't. I want to run away from life and never come back, no that doesn't mean I want to die. I can't sleep at night unless I'm stressed or putting off responsibilites.

Therapy isn't an option, I could never ask my mom for that. Never.

324,"I just turned 17 less than a month ago, and am friends with this girl my age who went to see her family for winter vacation, and who has a cousin who is also gay. Well she introduced us over Snapchat and long story short we’re kind of romantically involved now? Like as much as you can be when you’re halfway across the country e-dating you know? I thought she was 15 or 16 at first, since she looks that old, but turns out she’s  14, so I’m 3 years older than her. She’s extremely mature and much more experienced than I am with dating (I’ve never dated anyone and she’s had multiple partners), and talking to her is extremely fun and we connect really well.

The thing is I’m kind of worried about the age gap, not to mention she was held back a year so she’s still in the 8th grade, while I’m in the 11th grade and will be leaving for college in under two years. I don’t expect it to last super long but for what time we have to connect and be together I’d like to do it. She’s probably going to visit my town to see her cousin so we’ll probably meet sooner than later, and I would love that. I just definitely don’t want it to be viewed by anyone as creepy or strange because of our ages you know? I don’t wanna do anything sexual at all with her really, if not just for the age gap also because I have no experience in that field and am generally extremely paranoid about that kind of thing due to certain trauma I have.

My question is general advice on the situation, whether I should keep it up with her or if it’s best to end it right now, and an outsiders perspective on the situation. I care about her a lot already and she’s said she likes me a lot too. I feel like my judgement might be impaired because I am neurodivergent and my parents have a pretty large age gap, plus we’re both minors, so it might seem like less of a big deal to me than it actually is.",29Dec2019,1
325,"Ok so this account is obviously a throwaway and I think for obvious reasons. 

So I am under 18. In my country it is illegal to look at porn unless you are 18. Despite this I was horny, and so I decided to go onto a website with porn pictures rather than videos. 

While the website was loading I saw a picture of a young girl, maybe 12, without her shirt on with the caption “YOUNG”. I was shocked, and went to check if I had seen correctly but the page had loaded it and had scrolled all the way to the bottom. 

I reloaded the page and it was there again. This time I decided to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, but the page kept loading new pictures. Finally I got to the bottom, and certainly there it was. Multiple different links with pictures of people who didn’t look over 18. I felt uncomfortable, and immediately closed the tab. 

I don’t remember the tab name, but I’m sure if I looked up the key words I searched before it would be on the first page of Google again. Who should I contact? Will I get in trouble for viewing pornography under the age of 18?

330,"So.. a long-brief backstory. My mother got into trouble and she was incarcerated for 6 months. I live in a different state 800 miles away from them and got a call from child protective services at midnight asking myself and my fiancé to take my younger brother and sister in to avoid foster care. So we said yes. My fiancé’s parents (who live in their same state) went and picked them up and kept them overnight and we met them halfway between states and took them in the next day. All of this happened within two days we were not prepared. We are a four person household turned six overnight in a two bedroom apartment. Now my mother has always had a problem going to jail for drugs and I have been there every time  to care for my siblings since they were born for the last 16 years since I was 14 (and she’s been to jail a lot). I am 29 now and she’s still doing this. So anyway we took them in I rushed to get them into their schools, bought school supplies, clothes bc they didn’t have very many due to being removed from their home, bought bunk beds and mattresses, switched the kids to the master bedroom so they would have enough space, bought them everything they needed, switched their insurance over to mine etc. all out of our own pockets with no help from the states. We had them for the full 6 months and never once qualified for government assistance. My mother is a very toxic, manipulative human being who feels she’s entitled to everything. My siblings have adopted that mindset. They caused so many problems while they were with us and even almost got us evicted from our home (the only reason we weren’t is because we are good tenants and our landlord felt bad for our situation.) My sister who is 15 and brother who’s 12 would talk so much trash about how they hated being at our house. They would cause fights, be sneaky and conniving,  cause problems at school, holler, cuss, and sometimes put their hands on our children ages 7 &amp; 9. They both tried to run away, amongst other things. Our kids even started picking up their bad habits like disrespecting us and saying hateful things to each other, their grades dropped, etc. My siblings made everything absolutely miserable for the four of us the entire time they were here. I understood why they were angry I mean we have the same mother and she has been doing dumb crap my whole life too but they had placed the blame on me like I was the reason she went to jail and made them come to our home. I understood that they were unhappy about the situation but I told them that they needed to just try to take the time they were here to be kids and not worry about when our mother was going to be out of jail and when it was time to go home then they would go home. We let them know the situation right from the start as far as why they were coming to our house and we let them know what their options were (they had two options according to the state they could either live with us or foster care.) they said they wanted to stay with us instead of the latter but still expressed daily how much they hated it here with us. We had rules and chores and consequences to misbehavior, (something they’re not use to). So 6months later my mother gets out of jail in November. We told her and the kids that since she (my mother) doesn’t have a house (she was evicted bc she went to jail),a vehicle, a job, and no way to properly care for her kids that they could stay with us despite everything they’ve done so she could get on her feet. They all three said no my mother caused a huge fight between my siblings and myself (it was bad) so I said forget this mess and I paid for bus tickets and sent them on their way. I also told the three of them and child protective services that our house is no longer an option should this ever happen again. So not even a month after our mother gets out of jail she has already asked me to pay all three of their phone bills for the months of November and December, asked me in a round about way to buy Christmas presents for my brother and sister bc she can’t since she has no job (mind you the whole time she was in jail she called me every other day from jail asking me for money for her phone time and commissary which I did pay the phone so she could talk to her kids) and my sister just text right now and asked me for money again while not once has any one of them apologized for how they acted/treated us the whole time they were here or have they called just to say hey. The only time I’ve heard from them since they left is to ask for money. I don’t feel it’s our responsibility to bail them out anymore. I told my siblings what they were going back to and they still did everything in their power to burn this bridge. So now I feel like they should figure it out themselves and leave us be. My mother has not even tried to use the resources in her state to try and get some help. She just keeps asking me to take care of her. The funny thing is is she thinks I owe her (that woman has done nothing for me my entire life but cause me pain) a side note:  She didn’t even re enroll the kids back into school for almost a month after they got back (which I was getting calls from cps and truancy over them missing school) anyway what I want to know is am I in the wrong for not helping them even though I told them what to expect if they went back to their mother?",29Dec2019,1

334,"I’m a freshman in college and I’m feeling very lost. I just finished my first semester and it was not a fun time. I was away at college and was completely miserable. Back at home we were moving so I came home every other weekend to help pack, and every weekend that I was on campus I just stayed in my dorm and felt miserable. I have made no friends, felt very depressed, and that only caused me to isolate myself even more this past semester. On top of that I’ve had a shitty roommate who made my life pretty miserable for most of the semester by being obnoxiously loud, waking me up early in the morning, etc. and not stopping until I got the RA involved, and even after that she’s still pretty noisy and annoying. I tried to transfer rooms but the two people I was offered did not seem to be like better situations so I chose not to move. Now I’m home and the thought of going back to college for another semester makes me feel sick to my stomach. I did well in my classes and made the last minute decision to apply to 2 local colleges to transfer for the spring semester.  I was very close to applying back in November but after having very frustrating conversations with my mom she convinced me not to. However she now seems a bit more supportive, albeit very stressed out about it. The main problem is that I can’t drive and I’d probably have to take a bus or figure out how to carpool with someone which is stressing me out. I can’t just Uber to class everyday, that’s pretty ridiculous. I know transferring is not the solution to my social anxiety, and I honestly feel so lost and unsure of what I’m even doing with my life. My mom told me today that she feels so stressed about me transferring and how she doesn’t know what “broke” me and made me so socially anxious. That made me feel a lot worse. I honestly don’t know what broke me either. I can’t sleep, I’ve been crying a lot and I just feel like a total mess. I don’t know if I should just withdraw and transfer or take a leave of absence for my mental health. Is it even a value excuse to leave for my mental health if I did well in my classes? Im also worried about financial aid. It might be posible for me to take a leave of absence and take classes somewhere else.

It has been humiliating. In addition, the paraprofessionals are split into 2 groups, and I have been involved with both.

A: man up, tell her how you feel, yolo. risk coming across as ignorant to her situation and creating drama in the friend group. If I flop then she might want to temporarily cut me off in which case I’ll just live in regret that I did something so stupid.

B: let her sort through her relationship and risk losing her forever... you’ll be friends but you’ll always regret not taking action and just living for once. We’re pretty open in front of each other so even if you kiss her rn it won’t be the end of the friendship and you’ll be able to move on.

Hello every kind Redditor who decides to click or press onto this post. 

So, to start this off, I(M) am dating this amazing girl. We have been together for almost 3 years. She is amazing, beautiful, and perfect. I treat her like my queen and do my best to keep her happy. But of course, there are always problems in relationships. We have argued many times about certain disagreements amongst each other. The thing is, I have fucked up many times which has been leading to her slowly losing my trust. Of course I’ve learned from my past mistakes, but a new mistake always slips out and causes a shitty mess that I end up having to fix. However, I believe I am ready to show her that I have changed completely, in a positive way, for the better but she isn’t too on board with the idea as it may TOO late. 


Any advice on what can help me gain that lost amount of trust back? Advice on how to show her that I have changed? Any advice in general?

While I was in college, my sibling came to live with me a state away from our hometown so they could study cosmetology at a junior university and live with me while I was in the process of my bachelor's.  Both were located in the same town so it was convenient. 

Within the first few weeks of my sibling's schooling they met a person who is 11 years older than I am (making this person around 14-15 older than my sibling). This person was separated from their spouse and had children less than ten years younger my sibling. My sibling hooked up with this person and they started a relationship that would last five years and produce two children.

Over the course of the relationship, this person abused my sibling (requiring hospitalization) and was also thrown in jail several times. They (both sibling and partner) were also addicted to at least meth and crack, according to what my sibling has told me after that fact. My parents supported my sibling through all of this (around 5ish year) going so far as to pay off my siblings student loans from three failed attempts at cosmetology school, and to bail the abuser out of jail at least twice. When I was 23, my parents loaned me $3500 to buy a car and they lent my sibling $8500 to buy a car (which sibling's partner completely totalled because, if you could not tell from earlier, was a fucking piece of shit)

I'm struggling financially because I finished schooling for my bachelor's and could not get deferments for my student loans regardless of the fact that I was unemployed or underemployed for four years following graduation. I am deeply in debt while my parents have paid off my sibling's student loans, and they (my sibling) and their children live with my parents currently. 

How do I broach the subject that I fucking need help without being an asshole? I was a shithead to my sibling when they were going through all of this and I've recently apologized and fixed a life long tumultuous relationship with my sibling. I'm still fucking angry about this whole situation but I feel like I'm being an asshole. I'm super angry about the whole thing still, even though it's been at least three years since all of this went down. 

I am currently living on my own (with a roommate) while my sibling lives with my parents rent free? If that makes any difference....????",29Dec2019,1

362,"A friend of mine has been self-harming for years. I wasn’t made aware of this until a few months ago. I do my best to be supportive but something they did recently makes me sick to me stomach.

They sent a photo of themselves posing in a mirror purposely showing off their recent cuts to my best friend. The following messages were directly calling attention to the self harm. This is frankly disgusting to me. Sending photos like that..in a way that glorifies the action that you are going to therapy to stop doing, putting the burden of your issues in another person...it’s all just makes me want to puke.

I want to confront them about this but I don’t think I can. I only know about these photos and messages becuase my best friends mom told my mom about it after my best friend told her mom. My best friend hasn’t told me about these photos.

I have no idea what I’m supposed to do about this. I honestly don’t even want to talk to this friend anymore. They are very reckless when it comes to other people mental health. This includes many other incidents that I have been directly involved in. Such as, Attempting to diagnose another person with depression, drawing graphic art of people self harming and showing it to my best friend even though  they know she hates it, calling me depressed even though I’ve asked them to stop multiple times, telling me that I have been mis-diagnosed in my mental disorders (which were professionally diagnosed by a doctor), and some other less specific incidents.

But all his clothes smell, the bed smells, after 30min of being outside he starts to smell and two hours in, it gets really intense and I have a hard time wanting to hug him..

One time (actually more than once, but this time was especially tough..) we wanted to have sex but because we were at a wedding all day, he smelled really bad, sweat and alcohol mixed together, my libido was gone... 

I've been struggling with my sex drive lately for unrelated reasons but this is not helping at all....
He used to smell so good, now everything smells really bad...
It's not like he forgot to use deodorant a day or two, that's be fine... He stopped using it all together...

I go to his house, and I cannot wear his clothes if I'm cold and forgot to bring a jacket or something... It smells so bad it's distracting...

I don't know how to approach the situation without hurting his feelings.. I never really told him that I LOVE when a man smells good, it's one of my biggest turn ons...

367,"To give context I’m dating his guy and we are both pretty responsible juniors in high school. We get the grades and are respectful to our parents. I’ve been friends with this guy before we started dating and his parents were really lax, he could go out a lot and do a lot of things parents wouldn’t usually let their child do for our age. When we started dating his parents were the same, they helped me when my own parents didn’t know about us yet and were supportive and just the same as they were, when he moved at the end of the school year an hour away they even let him almost go through with the idea of traveling every day just to let him go to high school in my town still, I thought that was crazy for parents to be that chill with that situation. All in all he did leave and we’re still together. Starting from November though his parents started acting erratic, he stayed over a lot with his best friend to see me or other friends (I’ll get back to that) and to make up for it he’d always do practically all the housework. He went to San Francisco with a group of me and our friends after he did endless hours of house and yard work to go and asked his parents multiple times for a solid yes and he ended up going, later his dad calls him and yells at him for going, grounds him from leaving the house for a month and the after actions have been crazy. They have made him work much harder and for one clean the gutters on his steep roof and almost fell off?? They always are yelling at him and when he doesn’t do work for them EXACTLY at the time they want him to or they take away something else (he was supposed to go to our best friend’s birthday tomorrow but they said no last minute because he started doing the yard 15 MINUTES after his mom told him to). It’s mentally draining him and it’s unbelievably rude to my parents to have to conform to whether his mom is having a good day or not when we make plans. I know they’re peeved he came over so much so we are toning it down, if they want him to leave his old life behind and even me that’s fine, I don’t blame them, but don’t do this and not straight up tell the truth.

I’m a young grad with a background in design and marketing- I have a intense passion and interest in creative technology, emerging tech and innovation culture. 

My career paths are; freelance design, work for an agency/studio,  or step things up and become an entrepreneur. 

There is no way I am going to work for someone so I am 110% set on being an entrepreneur. My dream is to build a R&amp;D facility for innovation and technology but the feasibility of me getting funding for that because of my age and credibility is very low. So I’ve become focused on what is feasible, I’m faced with the option to build a creative studio from the ground up but with that I face all the competition and that makes me worried seeing the amount of creative studios that start up, I like creating things that matter, and make impact, not just designing a logo or marketing campaign, but more like designing innovative interactive technology such as digital mirrors, vertical indoor gardening systems, gestural control interfaces and things like that! But if I was to start up shop as a creative studio there is little market for these things I actually want to build. 

I’m lost on where I can go with my passion for building technology with a future-orientated focus, and innovation at the heart of things.  How the hell do I build things innovative for people who will listen to me? 

Please would appreciate any guidance or advice",29Dec2019,1

The first person I talked to is my dad. My dad is a grade a asshole. He has done shit to me and my family for a lot of my life and I hate him but I can’t say he hasn’t been there for me when I needed him. I told him I wasn’t feeling well at college and he said I could take a semester off. I then decided to talk to my mother because my dad was going to tell her anyway so I just decided to tell her. 

I told my mom everything. My suicidal thoughts, depression, etc. I hated my life and I told her and she was supportive. Both my parents were. I can’t believe they actually listened and for the first time in a long time, I feel excited for the future. Thank you everyone who has given me advice.

370,"Back in September, my ex broke up with me on my birthday. It was definitely my worst birthday ever, and it didn't help that my birthday the year before was depressing as well. Her reason for breaking up with me was justified, as she was in a mental state that required someone to give her attention and support when she needed it, and I became too busy to take that responsibility. I've been super depressed since then, to a point where I've been wanting to kill myself, but I can't because I promised her that I would improve my mental state and live the life that I want to live, and I plan on keeping that promise. I was mad in love with her, I'm still mad in love in her today, and it makes me sad knowing I won't be with her, that I'll never talk to her again. I've tried to find a new girlfriend, to see if that would help me forget about my ex, but so far no luck. Now I'm questioning if immediately going back into dating is such a good idea, because I've recently joined the military, and that's not a good occupation to have while in a relationship. I'm super anxious that if I get in a relationship and I get shipped for training or deployed for a while, that I'll just get cheated on, because that happens a lot to servicemen.

376,"Hi Reddit basically I'm having a real hard time with getting wifi coverage throughout my newer 3-4 year old home. It is a 2 story townhome with only one ethernet connection located on the second story furthest from the living room and kitchen on the ground floor. My issue is of course little to no connection in the living room and even worse in the kitchen. 

I'm wondering if a newer home's warranty would have any bearing in this situation in hopes of the possibility of getting a second connection terminal put in down stairs by the builder. This is my first time owning a home so I apologise if I just seem like an unpleasable home owner. 

Some extra information: I am the houses second owner, and it is still under the builders warranty and is in good condition. The layout of the house has neither an attic nor a real way to access the wiring in the floor/ceiling between the stories without using destructive methods. I reached out to the builder for some wiring diagrams or at least a blue print or documentation on the house and was basically told to buzz off. I have asked around the neighborhood and my understanding is all of the houses were built this way and don't even have a downstairs line for cable tv to be setup.
I'm considering things like Powerline adapters or a mesh network and thinks these things could work, but just feel it's a little ridiculous to not have better networking built in.
I figure this is something minor compared to what could go wrong in the realm of home ownership but at the same time its disappointing to pay so much for a nice house that's poorly networked.

378,"(Throw away account)

I am 16, and a closested bi. For a while now I have been using Grindr to find guys to do you know exactly what. Despiste photos and stuff being shared, never met with many guys(only 2, one of which ended quicker than I wanted to). Every time I was prevented from meeting I would sum it up as God stopping me from getting some(and then eventually be thankful he stopped it). 

Despite that, I have tried to meet several guys, made several accounts after they were banned, and constantly repeating this cycle for a month or 2. Then today just 20 minutes ago, after waiting for a half hour for a guy or 2 who never showed up, I went back inside...only for my sister to be there. After many attempts to lie I gave in and admitted what I did. She accepted it but told me to be safe...but I am afraid i'll keep this cycle up. How do I stop myself from downloading grindr each time, how? I'm really scared, especially since I got caught.

Tldr: how do I stop myself from going on grindr at 16 constantly?",29Dec2019,1
379,"I know my mom loves me and truly does care about me. 

However, I don't know how she'll deal with me as I gain more independence as I get older (I turned 18 recently, which led to some questionable choices on my part, but we'll get to that later). As an only child, I was always in the spotlight, for better or worse. She's expressed multiple times how lonely she'll be when I'm at college and that she doesn't know what she'll do. 

Even past that, my mom is incredibly overbearing in my life. She made both my dad and I install the Life360 app (an app that tracks your phone, battery percentage, driving reports, the whole sha-bang), and I've been pretending that mine doesn't work when really I'm just too uncomfortable with the idea that I have a tracker on me 24/7 and my mom keeps insisting that I try checking it again and getting it to work. One time, she even forced me to show her my phone to prove that I wasn't lying (I managed to cover it up). She says that it's not to ""track"" me but to let her know where I am in case anything bad happens. Though that's a reasonable answer, I still feel incredibly uncomfortable with the idea. NOTE: I am by no means an outgoing person and I am at home 95% of the time anyway. I was never in trouble for being in places I shouldn't be or anything of that sort.

I know that the sensible thing to do would be to talk to her about this. However, she gets visibly teary-eyed and upset whenever I do something that goes against something she did for ""my own good"". 

My dad, though still in the picture, is incredibly distant and dismissive of both my mom and I.  He frequently mocks us and I've stopped coming to him for any advice from an early age, knowing that he'll most likely act out in anger or laugh at me. I'm too afraid and/or embarrassed to share anything with him in case he'll make fun of me. Though none of his actions have been especially hostile or violent, they're still upsetting and I just don't enjoy being with him. I don't remember the last time we even had a proper conversation since he'll rather be on his phone watching things like Top 10 on YouTube or TikTok (I wish I was making that up) with the volume on high. 

I can't remember the last conversation my parents had that didn't end in an argument. I honestly wish that they'd be separated, knowing that they both drive each other insane. I have never seen them look even remotely happy in each other's presence. However, due to the stigma involving religion and traditional Asian families, divorce is an unlikely option. 

My parents have both called me fat, among some other names, even to this day. I understand that it is in some part as a joke, but it still affects me and has contributed a lot to my low self-esteem and unhealthy relationship with food. 

The day I turned 18, I went out to buy some vape stuff (cringey, I know). Why? Well, in all honesty, just because I *could*. My stuff was found out not even a week later because my parents like to snoop everywhere and I wasn't being nearly as discreet as I should've been. They confiscated everything and told me that even though I was 18, I was still living under their roof and that I had no right to do things like this. I let it go without a fight, it wasn't worth getting in an argument over. 

Due to this... interesting home life, I've developed a sort of ""double life"" over the years. At home, I am very quiet and overall quite meek. However, everywhere else, I've developed a reputation for being rather rebellious and aggressive. I've also experimented with drugs from an early age (none of which my parents are aware of) and dealt with depression, self-harm, suicidal tendencies, and eating disorders (none of which I get professional help from, due to mental health being incredibly stigmatized in traditional families). My parents have no idea what I'm actually like, and I've kept it that way for as long as I can remember. 

I personally vowed to never be like my dad, and I hate seeing how much like him I can be, and I wish that my mom would give me at least some sense of freedom. 

I wish it was as simple as me standing up to my parents and moving out, but that simply isn't the case. As much as I feel suffocated in this family, I know that my parents do have the best intentions for me and that it would shatter their hearts to see me cut ties. 

And of course, there's that thought that gnaws at the back of my head: *what if I'm just overreacting?* After all, I never lashed out at my parents in the typical teenage angst phase, maybe I'm just a late bloomer and this is my teenage rebellion. Maybe I'm just being overdramatic and it's not a big deal.

I really don't know what to do.

(Sorry this whole post was basically just me rambling, I might come back to clean it up later)

He’s like I’ll ask, and shows me his GroupMe, where he typed “can I let someone in with a picture of a passport”? &amp; so I said “can you include that I also have my license, it’s just a week expired &amp; my new one is supposed to be in within 30 days &amp; theres a 30 day grace period in this state” so they know I’m not a person trying to get in solely with a picture of my passport, I was just trying to appease the bouncer. 

He shows me his GroupMe that says “no” then someone types “unless she gives you a handjob” &amp; he shows me and is like LOL. 

But this bar has three entrances. So I wait then walk to the third entrance, where I’m let in happily. Until the bartender yells at me and is like HEY YOU NEED TO LEAVE. (How he knew I dont know, he couldn’t see me try to get in the first distance. Obviously bouncer #1 had to tell them) 

As I was walking in entrance 3, I didnt know that bouncer #1 literally chased behind me to tell bouncer @ entrance #3 I couldnt come in. Then he went over to bouncer #2 and was like DONT LET HER IN. 

Meanwhile... he’s letting in all these 17 year old kids who clearly have fake ass IDs. 

So I know I’m wrong for trying to get in after being told no, but I’m pissed that the bouncer #1 cared so much when bouncer #3 let me in. Me being in the bar wasn’t bothering him, and I literally just wanted to be with my friends.

Last night there wasn’t any group call because no one showed up.

Today she asked me if I remember our New Year date and I said yes, I still remember it, which is on Tuesday. She gave me an attitude and said that if I were going to call with them about my birthday or if I was going to wait out until New Year to call them and neglect her. I told her no, we didn’t group call last night because no one showed up, I asked the friend who insisted the call and she said she forgot and apologized. I affirmed to her I still remember the New Year date. 

I don’t know why she’s upset, I see no point.",29Dec2019,1

389,"I’m a 17 year old senior in high school with no plan really. I feel like it’s expected that I go to college but I’m just so nervous and stressed. I don’t want to have so much debt and I don’t even know what I’d want to pursue. I was thinking maybe community college and transfer but I just don’t know. My motivation has been deteriorating because I feel so lost but also pressed for time. It’s not the fact that I don’t think I can’t handle college but the fact of not being dead set on a certain college, not knowing what I’d want to study and the debt I’d incur is just too much for me. It’s gotten to the point where I’m starting to panic when someone mentions college or I just shut down. I don’t want to be seen as lazy or anything but I just have no direction. I feel like I’m going to miss all these application deadlines now because of me being so nervous and scared. I don’t know if I should just look into gaining some sort of certificate or something instead maybe? I am a very simple person who doesn’t need much. I am plain and have never wanted a ton of money. I just want a comfortable life and that’s all I’d want to be happy. I’m starting to break down typing this.

393,"I'm 18/F. I was in a relationship with someone for almost three years, long distance, and we broke up in October of this year. 

I was absolutely heartbroken because I was the one who ended it, only because I sensed him giving up on the relationship and losing interest. I felt like he was just avoiding talking about it with me, or that he was avoiding me on purpose, and there's a deeper reason for this. He was constantly busy. He wouldn't even call me even though he claimed to want too. He claimed he was bad at texting. And I flew to meet him when I turned 18, states away, and was there for a week just to see him and only got 2 hours of his time. 

My entire life, I've never felt attracted to guys my own age. When I was 16, I met him, and he claimed to be 38. 

Everyone told me he was a bad guy and that I was making a mistake, but things haven't been ok at home in a long time, and he was the first guy to come along that treated me like a person. It was crazy how fast I fell for him, but I waited 6 months to even tell him that because I was afraid. 

For three fucking years, we talked every day. He said he loved me. But honestly he constantly neglected our relationship while I did everything I could to keep it going. He wanted to be ""friends forever"" when we broke it off, but honestly he doesn't respond to anything I say and if he does it's a day or two later. It hurts. 

And now looking back I just feel so stupid. I honestly at times feel like I don't even want to be alive, but I'd never act on it. Ages aside, he's never admitted his fault in the relationship, but I did. I feel like I want to both kiss him, and punch him in the fucking face. 

I didn't mean to turn this into a vent but like, I'm trying to forget him now because he's doing that to me. But how? I sort of want to tell him I don't ever want to talk to him again but I don't know about that either. But I'm scared to look for another relationship because of this one.",29Dec2019,1

395,"Hey, everyone!  How are you all doing?

I just wanted to make this post because I needed some advice for something that has been bugging me for a while. And as the post title states, it is about a girl I fancy.

EXTREMELY long story short (or I will at least try to keep it short. A thousand hugs if you read this whole thing! )

There is/was this girl, who for confidentiality, we will call Jojo, who I met a few years ago during my time at University. I met her during the final months of my first year and what would be her second year (as she was 1 year ahead of me) and needless to say, she was one of the coolest cats I had ever met and naturally, I fell for her and eventually confessed my feelings after a few months of knowing her. She told me she felt the same way and we kind of had a thing going on and we were inseparable for a few months. We would go to arcades, go to dinner, make videos, do music shows, work on plays acting skits, wear matching outfits, hiking, the typical stuff. Many people said that we were basically eachothers counterparts as in that they said Jojo was the female version of me and likewise I was the male version of her. 

#Couplegoals

However, this all came to a head when 4 months in, I noticed that Jojo began to grow distant and slowly but surely we began hanging less and less as she began to get involved in other projects. Mostly school related. And I know obviously we all have our own lives and can't be with certain people every second of every single day so I wasn't clingy and respected her space but it was a bit confusing to say the least. 

(I also need to mention that during this time, due to my own personal projects and ambitions, I decided that I would have to leave the University at the end of my 2nd year to fully pursue my endeavors. I really didn't tell anyone about this and I felt inclined to tell Jojo, especially if we were together)


Eventually, things came to a toll when I asked her for the 3rd time if she saw a future between the two of us which is never a good sign.


(To provide context, I forgot to mention this but, the day when I asked her out, due to Jojo's strict parents, even though she liked me, she said she couldn't ""officially"" go out with me as they would crucify her basically but that didn't mean we couldn't stop ""seeing eachother"". She then kissed me on the cheek after that. As the weeks went by, even though we were doing all these things couples do, I was still confused as to whether her and I were a thing and I asked her about it, thinking I may have misunderstood something originally but even she herself said she saw a future between the two of us and said we were waaaaay to close and had done too much to be simply friends. Ironically, even though she is the one who kissed me first when I asked her out originally, whenever I would try to kiss her on the cheek throughout the 4 months, she would laugh hysterically and lightly push me away. More ironic, she clearly had no problem wanting to meet up almost everyday, complaining when I had to leave after spending the whole day together, flirting, grabbing me around the waist, getting me presents, writing me love cards, prentending to be my wife, hugging me insanely tightly, spanking me with her belt amongst other things. I am just as confused as you are lads.)

Going back to the main story,

So once evening when Jojo was getting out of work with some colleagues, I texted her if we could meet up and she obliged. Once we left ther restaurant and she said bye to them, I asked her if I could speak with her privately. We then walked to an empty parking lot where there was no one around about a block a way and I began. 

First and foremost, I asked her if we were a thing and she laughed and surprisingly told me ""No."" 

With that response, it it was true that she thought that way, I saw there was no harm in divulging the truth with her. I mentioned how I was going to be moving an hour away and that this was going to be my final year at University.

She then became silent from her usual self and she was very vague in her responses. This is not normally Jojo at all as she is an extrovert like me and is was always happy. Not once had I ever seen her sad and she was always happy, and we would both often help cheer other people up in their times of sadness, which is another reason I liked her. (Even the time when she almost got kidnapped on campus during the middle of the night and I rushed to save her, she still couldn't help making puns in the face of danger, which I called her an idiot and asked why she had to be EXACTLY like me because I would have done the same.)

She said she knew this would happen and she tried to make ""it"" work but when I asked her about what, she became cryptic and said that she knew one of was going to leave. I then began to tell her that inspite of this, I would still come to visit her every week and remain in constant contact her and that I was willing to make this work. Come hell or high water. ( And Jojo knew whenever I put my mind to something, I would do it. Literally 2 weeks before, I did a gigantic serenade for her for her birthday where I had some friends of mine and I jump from the side of one of the University buildings and spray her with flowers and gifts as she was going home that evening, all while singing one of her favorite songs. And no, that is not a r/thathappened I'm just a lunatic when it comes to love. Go big or go home is my philosophy.)

Jojo, however, still remained vague. Seeing as the conversation was going nowhere and how I didn't want to put any pressure on her than needed, I decided to just ask her the final question. I told her that we both knew how I felt about her but I wondered, did she ever feel the same about me. She then looked at me and told me, "" To make it easier for the both of us, I'm going to say no."" And then suddenly her eyes began to look watery, almost tearing up, much to my confusion. We then talked a bit more and I walked her to her car and she drove home as it was getting late. 

We texted eachother later that night and she told me that she recommended to me that it was best for me to move on and that she didn't see herself dating anyone for a long long time. She still wanted to remain friends though as she said that I had done so much for her and that she wanted to repay me for everything one day.

I was okay with this, even though this stung as I would very much have liked to be more, but I rather have had her in my life than not at all. But of course, I would need some space first.

In the weeks that proceeded, I did my best to try and get over her but it wasn't easy to say the least. And it didn't help that Jojo would keep trying to talk to me during this time. It's not like an on and off switch where you can just stop liking someone like that. 

5 weeks later and the summer then came and I thought, this is dumb, why I would avoid Jojo if she is making efforts to talk to me? And also from the advisement of some of my friends, both guys and girls, they told me that there was a high chance that Jojo may still like me but may either be testing me or just fighting her own feelings. So I then decided to toss her a bone and ask her is she wanted to meet up sometime.

Every single time she told me she was busy with work.

I found this really ironic as the months went by because Jojo would often text me out of the blue or comment on almost all my posts on social media and yet whenever I tried to give the same energy back, she seemed to grow cold. Sometimes the conversation would die instantly once I would reply to her enthusiastic texts which she started and when I would respond to her, she wouldn't add anything to the conversation, which didn't make sense as to why she would initiate contact in the first place. She would repeat this process over and over again for the next 5 months. 

Skipping to November of 2018 and 5 months after I had seen her, while scrolling through Snapchat one day, I found out Jojo had a boyfriend.

Naturally, I was a bit heartbroken by this. I then took this as a sign to move on as through these 5 months I still had that spark in me that fancied her and still wanted me to keep fighting for her but upon finding this out, I decided it was over and that it was for the best. Since I saw she was with another man, I knew I had to respect that and let her be.

For the next couple of weeks, she just posted non stop about her and her boyfriend which stung me even more as I remembered all the times she would post about us together. Texting me around 3 am to see if I was up. Being sick as a dog, missing class but still having the strength to drive an hour just to see me and have dinner. Calling me late at night saying someone at work had given her a bag of large cookies and how she needed some help to eat them. Bloody hell, mate.

Seeing as looking at these posts was no good, I just focused on myself or at least tried because Jojo was STILL messaging me quite regularly.

Three weeks later, I decided to host my usual Q and A sessions that I have on my social media where I would answer questions that fans of my work would send in. I dont get to answer all the questions but I do my best.

So as I was with my friend getting ready to broadcast later Thursday night, a couple of fans had sent in some questions and among them, almost if by fate, I recieved a question that asked me "" Have you ever been in love before? Truly in love?"" 

How bloody convenient.

Normally, as I like to keep my love life private, I would gloss over these type of questions and I would not answer something like this but that night I was in a different state of mind and thought to myself "" I'll answer it. What do I have to lose?""


So I hosted my Q and A session live and answered the question but kept everything confidential and did not disclose any names or was specific about location or anything and just gave a brief rundown. I answered how I had been I love with this one person and that basically how we were peas in a pod but how fate had another card to play and alas it wasn't meant to be. I also mentioned how this person got into a relationship with someone else and how I was happy for them and only wished them the best and that this person's boyfriend was the luckiest lad in the whole world.

People found it very sweet in the feedback and also wished the best for whoever this person was also and it felt kind of good to say that little piece and vent a bit. However, later that night as I checked my viewer logs it turns out that Jojo saw that piece.

What follows is even more strange to say the least.

A few days after that post, I had found out that Jojo unfriended me on Snapchat, and was like ""Oh here it comes."" And anticipated the worst and thought that I messed up. I then checked Instagram to see if she had unfollowed me there but she hadn't. 


For the next couple of days, I just continued to post like usual and as usual, Jojo would see my posts within a heartbeat but this time around, she wouldn't comment or say anything, almost cyberstalking me in a way. Curiosity then got the better of me and I then checked her personal profile to see what she was up to and if she had unfollowed me yet but I found something more curious. In her follows, it turns out Jojo's boyfriend had unfollowed her and moreover, she unfollowed him. I thought this was a mistake at first but then as ai scanned through her follows, it turns out Jojo had removed all of her exes from her follows list or any guy who had ever tried to flirt up with her basically. The only past ""lover"" she hadn't unfollowed was me.

I went to go check her last boyfriends page out, and low and behold I was surprised.

Her ex, the guy who she was posting about like crazy 3 weeks before, then began posting stuff on his page like ""F--- women, it's all about making money"" and the like. Then 2 weeks later, he actually deleted his social media account. ( The guy had like 20k followers so that is REALLY crazy as it was his business account) At first I thought he blocked me but it turns out he really did deactivate all his accounts and disappeared without a trace which is really surprising to me. Like what did Jojo do to the lad? He has not come back since.

After a few weeks of just me posting and no interaction, Jojo finally decided to unfollow me, conviently a day after I made a post on Instagram making a short comedy video about missing someone. 

And after a few months later, I unfollowed her.

As of me writing this, it has been almost more than a year since I last talked to her. I can't say that I haven't thought about her as Jojo gave me so much to remember. Through the months I have been tempted to call her but never mustered up the courage in fear of what would happen or what kind of conversation would follow. Would we talk casually like old times as if nothing happened? Would she rebuke me and send me to hell? I had no idea.

It wasn't until just about until a few weeks ago that I finally decided to try and reach out to Jojo during Thanksgiving Week 2019 which was a few weeks ago. I called her in the afternoon. The phone rang the 30 seconds but it seems that she didn't answer. I then tried calling her back a week later and this time I got sent directly to voicemail. Much to my surprise, it turns out she blocked my number.

Checkmate basically.

All in all, after everything that's happened, I don't feel like troubling her anymore as if she blocked me, she clearly has no interest in hearing from me but I can't help but wonder why. I never got an answer and not sure if I ever will. But that is the way the cookie crumbles my friends. I would like some closure but will I just never know? 

(And looking at this text now, I'm like DAMN this was not short at all! I thank all of you though who made it through though! This is also the 2nd time I post this because the first time didn't go through! 🤣)

397,"Hey everyone!

I'm a dude working in healthcare. Been single or without any meaningful relationship for a long time. But lately I've been really missing someone in my life but I feel like I'm too ""f*cked"" to manage dating or being in a relationship. So I'm here hoping I get advice on what can I do to become a better person. 

I used to struggle with low self esteem when it comes to my looks but that changed as I gained weight. I actually see myself as an average okay looking person. Which is super cool with me haha.

One issue is that I really suck at that whole online dating thing. I have no clue what should I write about with person I just stumbled upon online and those generic ""ohh I see you love music I love that too"" conversations usually bore me and I stop responding. On the other hand I can talk a lot in person about pretty much everything it's just the online part that I really suck at.

Other big issue is that I don't consider myself an interesting person to date. My hobbies are pretty much video games and fishing. I used to do other stuff but for some reason stopped. Writing was one of those things. Usually horror and I had a account solely for nosleep stories. Also I did a ton of game development. Never finished a project but really enjoyed the process and will definitely get back to it in January because I don't have much free time last couple of months. I took extra ER shifts and overworked myself haha.

It's just that I don't see a reason why anyone would me interesting because I feel like a pretty boring dude playing video games or watching shows on Netflix when not fishing haha. 

I also switched work places recently and in my new job met this super cute girl. I don't usually even consider dating a coworker but she really got me interested. She's very nice to people and when we started talking trough messages she actually made effort to keep the conversation entertaining and that was very refreshing. I got the idea that she's interested from a few clues. Two months before my transfer I met her outside and she stopped me to tell me that she's happy that I'm transferring. And now whenever we work together and she needs someone to help her she goes for me even if there's 5 other people. Once someone wanted to go instead of me but she refused and so I went with her again. I'm not good at pick up clues but I suspect that she's interested in me. Anyway if she is I don't feel like I have much to offer her. Especially when it comes to emotional side of relationships. I may be overthinking but I believe this is the biggest issue that probably influences everything else. I just can't go all in into a relationship. Lately I've been thinking if this isn't some sort of defence mechanism. It feels like if I go all in I'm gonna get hurt and it's not worth it. I have been feeling like this for years now. 

I really want to start working on myself to become a better person to date. I just don't know where to start. Any advise is highly appreciated. Thank you.",29Dec2019,1
398,"My best friend has been going through mental health issues for about 2/3 years now, and being his only friend, I have been his emotional punching bag the whole time. I’ve received texts from him saying he wants to kill himself, calling me crying, texts basically saying “thanks for a good friend but my time is done I’m killing myself because I can’t handle this anymore,” I’ve comforted him while he cried in the school bathrooms, spent hours out of every day talking to him trying to cheer him up and had sleepless nights worrying about him 24/7. I am obviously still going to be there for him and all, but I have realised that I’ve been there for him too much, and I’ve realised that he sometimes has taken advantage of it to make me feel sorry for him (I have seen him first hand make other people feel sorry for him). 

All of this has taken a huge toll on me, as whenever I try to be happy, I am reminded that he is living a shitty life and that in a way I’m responsible for his wellbeing (he even said to me that I’m the only reason he is still alive right now). 

Recently I have been going through some tough times, but I am extremely hesitant to tell my friends or family about it because I am aware of how it can affect people as I have experienced it myself first hand. I feel stuck, I’m not sure what to do and I really want to talk to someone and just get everything off my chest about things that have been built up for years. I also don’t want to alarm my parents or anything, and I feel like they will judge me for thinking there is something wrong with me and not take me seriously. 

I’ve told friends some of the things thats been going through my head, but a lot of my friends have been through worse and so I feel like I have no right to feel the way I do. I’ve written my thoughts down but it isn’t helping me in the way that I would like, as I need a person to be able to talk to me about it.

402,"So, throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Thing are becoming more ''real'' every day and i'm starting to re-evaluate the steps that brought me here. I'm going to try and keep this as vague as I can while at the same time trying to give enough information so I can maybe be given some advice by some objective outsiders. I posted about this on AITA as well but since figured i might be more helped asking for actual advice. 

So, I got divorced 5 years ago and have two amazing children out of that marriage. Since my divorce i hadn't properly dated (or slept with someone) until I met this man. We broke up, slept together and both went our seperate ways. 

Now, Yesterday i found out ''for sure'' that I am indeed, pregnant. We did use protection, but that clearly didn't work as planned. Now, i'll try to be as structured as I can in describing what followed and why I made the decisions I made to avoid misunderstandings. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) When I learned that the anticonception might have failed I contacted him and told him that it failed. His response was that if I were indeed pregnant, he would ''support the route of abortion''. (Worth noting here that he did not offer to come with or stand by me trough this). Now, approaching this as logically as I could, I figured that as a woman, i do have the ''out'' called abortion. So to me, it seemed only fair that if i had an ''out'', so should he. I don't feel like I have the right to force the man in to a role he is not willing to be in. I stand by that and I have absolutely no intention of co-parenting with this man in any way. I won't ask for child support, i don't want him to have any sort of role. Just to make sure this is known. This is what HE chose. 

2) Upon informing me of his ''opinion'' he told me that he did not want people on his side of life knowing. Wich essentially means i were to make sure that none of his family/friends stumbled upon this child ''excisting''. I promised I would do everything in my power to avoid that from happening, but here's where I think I made a mistake. I do not want to go out of my way to protect a mans ''reputation'' and make my child a secret in the process. Now, here's my thoughts on this. 

\- I don't have the right, the want or the intention to actively contact his family about this baby. As far as i'm concerned they'll be as involved as the father being not at all. 

\- I am fully aware that a promise is meant to be kept and I honestly feel like a proper pos for considering breaking it, but on the other hand I fail to see why I should be protecting his reputation or taking in to account his ''needs'' any more than the need to not be involved. 

\- He has since broken all contact because he doesn't ''want to know''. So he doesn't know there is a baby, and i'm not willing to break NC because of it. I'm trying to be as respectful as I can, of what he wants, but the longer it goes on the more I feel like that once again, i'm being pushed in to the position of ''least important person'' and i'm allowing it. 

3) Just so we're ABSOLUTELY clear. I do not need/want any form of child support. I don't want him to change his mind and be an active father and i'm not about to flaunt this pregnancy/child just to fuck him over. 

I do however, notice i'm angry and incredibly dissapointed. In myself, but in him as well. 

(Insert here, i know the child will eventually have questions about their father and even though i'm yet to work out the specifics of answering that question, that's just something i'll have to deal with. If i didn't want to do that, i shouldn't have offered him an out).",29Dec2019,1
403,So me and my ex were together for two years and things were up and down our first year but became second tour second but we were madly in love. But also we were really insecure. Long story short she joined the air force and I went to college and I didn’t agree with her choice because she alwasy loved music but her family was a past air force family. 4 months in we break up because I can tell she’s getting more and more distant and only wants to party and I am feeling insecure in the way she is dressing and overall putting me on the back burner. In the month we were broke up right now she found a new military man who said how toxic we were and she hopped on him. She’s home on leave but basically says I treated her bad and she loves this new guy but I can tell he jsut validated her and she was lonley. After reading a few stories I am mortified at how military couples just hop on each other for pleasure and cheat so much and I feel so violated. She’s probably gonna Marty this man in a year and I feel just so gross and used. She’s a nasty person now who is so selfish and ignorant more than she was before. How I do I let go of this pain of missing her and how gross I feel for being so easily manipulated by her.,29Dec2019,1

405,"My winter break has been all about my university applications, my whole family is talking about it since I am the oldest of this generation and the first in my family to apply in Canada (I am a relatively recent imigrant). The Big fight between my parents and I is if I should do mechanical/aerospace engineering (my choice) or electrical/computer engineering (theirs). 

My argument is that I am more interested in my choice and that I should pursue my interests since it will be easier to get through and I will be more passionate about my job. Their argument is that electrical/computer engineering has more jobs and that I will get paid significantly more (they say double, but I doubt there's any significant difference). Also that I would be breaking the tradition of the males in my family (grandfather, uncle, dad) all doing electrical engineering.

I have tried getting my grandparents to help me decide, but when they argue my side my parents just start fighting with them and distort the reality in order to get them on board with their argument.

At this point the argument has started to affect my already weak mental health to the point where I have thought about not even going to university and even though about scuiside a few times (not helped by the fact they refuse to accnowledge that I am having issues with mental health and refusing to let me go see a psychologist, suggesting I should be sent to an insane asylum).

So what should I do? Should I fight to make them let me study a subject I am interested in? Or are their points valid and should I sacrifice spending the rest of my life doing a job I don't like for maybe higher pay and the end to this stupid fucking fight?",29Dec2019,1

410,"Damn long but here goes. I'm m20, and I feel like I've completely wasted the last 3 years of my life and hit a dead end in the process. I moved out of home at 17 to go to university since the campus is just too far to commute every day, but I failed my first year since I was in a student dorm and spent too much time partying and procrastinating. I then spent another year trying to work and save but couldn't get enough hours to save anything worthwhile.

We moved to a place closer to more friends at the beginning of this year and I decided to start studying a ne degree, and in the first semester of the year my depression slowly disappeared as I felt I was on track again. I also became extremely confident and felt on top of the world, able to talk to anyone and get a laugh out of them etc. I also found a new waiting job that I felt I was great at and actually loved working there. Then in a space of a week I broke up with my girlfriend after 2 years (our lives were getting difficult to work around) and also got fired from my job for being too cocky with management. I started smoking weed daily and even started dealing, but my confidence and mood was fine for months. I kept smoking daily and doing nothing into the start of the 2nd semester and dropped the subjects since I hadn't done anything uni related 7 weeks in, which now I feel was a fucking stupid idea. I slowly started to feel depression coming on again and started locking myself away from my roommates, it even got to a point where I wouldn't use the bathroom if someone was using the kitchen. I'm not so suicidal anymore but there was a period of time where I just didn't want to keep going and was very close to giving up.

Now I feel like I've completely fucked up my relationships with my friends and roommates even after living with them for 3 years. I don't have a shred of confidence anymore and my brain feels so dull, I'm worried I've fucked it by smoking too much. I find it extremely difficult to talk to people, before I could just go at it but now absolutely nothing comes to me to start conversation and even if someone gives me something to talk about I feel slow and awkward. My parents have been paying my rent for the last 3 years and I feel terrible since I have nothing to show for the money they've put into me living away. I currently have ~$200 to my name and I've been struggling to find work since I have barely any experience, references, and my interviewing has gone to shit along with my confidence. I just feel like a completely different person to the start of the year and hate myself for the position I've put myself in. My parents are now paying my rent and helping me with money for food and such but I have ~$200 to my name that just keeps getting smaller. I feel so awkward with my friendship group and I feel like I'm only kept along because I live with other people in the group.  I just can't find work and I continue doing absolutely nothing with my days and I'm putting on so much weight. I now have no clue what to do and feel so awkward and unwanted in my house. If I want to go back to my degree I'll have to retake another first year of courses and I'll need to have my parents paying my rent again until I can find work, which has been unsuccessful for the last 5 months, bar one job which I got fired from 3 weeks in since I was just too awkward and unable to talk to people. My parents have been trying to convince me to move back home which makes sense for them but then I would just be continuing to go nowhere with my life. 

Everything just feels so overwhelming and I know I need to make decisions asap but I just can't. I just want to be my old self again and be able to talk with my friends and family without being so awkward and mindless.",29Dec2019,1

My bf doesn’t want to continue his education which is fine with me. The university I want to go is about 2-3 hours away from my home. My mom thinks it’s better for me to live in dorm because I will be on campus and focus on my studies. My bf thinks it’s stupid and waste of money. My bf and I talked about it before when I applied for application to transfer and I changed my mind to live in dorm, and that angers him. 

Few months later, we had that talk again, convincing me that it’s better to live in apt because it’s cheaper, more privacy, my dog will come live with us, and I don’t have to worry about roommate. I thought it might be good idea to live in apt so I researched. Oh boy, it’s hard to find good apt that have utilities included in good place near the university. I talked to him about it and how the income should be 3x the rent. He doesn’t have job now and said he will look for jobs but I don’t know when. 

I don’t feel comfortable because this is first time I’m in relationships that long, first time moving out, living in different city, and everything else. My bf reassured me that everything will work out in the end. 

Couple weeks later, my mom and I talked about it again because of semester ended and she wants to know what’s gonna happen next year. I told her the “what if” situations and how I think it might be better to live in apt with bf because the rent will be cheap and everything else. She seems not happy with it. She said it looks like he was trying to follow me and tells me that it’s better to live in dorm and find myself while my bf stays where he is and figure out his thing. 

My mom told me to not worry about money because I will have FAFSA to help pay tuition and dorm and she will cover the rest. And that I can come visit every weekend and still have both social and campus lives. 

I felt more comfortable and confident with that idea but I don’t want to make my bf angry because we talked about it for a while and how we were excited to move together.

People might get the wrong impression of him and accuse him of being predatory from first glance but that’s not the case at all.

He doesn’t want age to be a factor or a deterrent, and doesn’t want our relationship to be seen that way, like most people will view it, or let it be the case where the older guy takes advantage of the younger girl and prey on them for their own gain.
I don’t think he’s manipulative, he respects my wishes and wants to take things slow (he doesn’t mind because he’s also a virgin). He wants me to be comfortable and wants to gain my trust by being patient and gentle with me and catering to my needs before his.

I am always thinking the way I think. I imagine myself and my head thinking in third person.

I have two close friends. We usually do everything together like hang out, drink, smoke weed, play cards, go out etc. But recently things seemed to have changed. One of my friends has gone away with her family and brought along our other friend. I wasn't invited and they both have independently told me there were not free this week to hang out. This didn't make me feel good but I tried to put it at the back of my mind. But now they keep posting Instagram stories clearly showing them together. This is what really hurts I think. For whatever reason they have not invited me. Whatever. But to be posting stories that they know I'm seeing, idk. It's shitty to see your friends hang out without you, ya know. Do they not think that that might be shitty for me? Am I even a thought in their minds? I feel like they are walking all over me because they know I won't call them out because I'm really non-confrontational. They've been away for a few days and I was even getting over it thinking ""whatever they can do whatever they want"" but then today I saw that our other friend that we don't see that often was with them. Presumably only there for the day or one night. But damn. That stung so much. I feel like the biggest fucking idiot. What the fuck is wrong with me that I can't be invited. Am I that bad to be around.

  
I've had a rough year and my mental health has suffered because of it. But I've been seeing a councillor for the last  7 months so I really didn't think it was affecting my friendships. I have so much fun when we hang out. They've never brought anything up about me being a buzzkill or anything. We usually hangout once a week or two. So I'm ultra confused. If they were really sick of me why do they still ask me hang out. But now I'm over thinking that maybe I've not been so fun to be around the last few months so they're just cutting me out. I just feel like I'm being walked over.   
This sort of stuff has been happening more and more over the last few months. They do something together, not inviting me then talk about it in front of me. Like planning things in front of me, talking about things they did together. I don't know what to think anymore. I'm kind of ready for this friendship to be over. One of them is moving away and honestly it's probably for the best. It's taking a toll on me more then I know. I feel like shit every time I remember they didn't invite me. Is this all in my head? Is this how friendships just are? Am I too sensitive? Or should I expect to be treated with more respect? Any advice welcome.

431,"TL, DR: parents forced me all my life to do things, including a cruise instead of a party, cruise went horribly, I want a 18th party styled like a quince, is that too weird?


Things they made me do vs what I wanted to do:

* Take violin in middle school, when I wanted to be part of the drum line in band. ""We don't raise emos in this house, play a real instrument.""
* Made me go on a cruise instead of my quinceanera. I was promised a dress. I didn't get one. I was not allowed outside the cabin unless my brothers walked with me. My brothers escaped while I was waking up, or in the bathroom. I was basically locked in a cabin the whole trip (14 days) unless we left as a family (so to eat and to go explore the islands).
* Made me graduate a year early from highschool, which cause me to get my 3rd migraine diagnosis from declining health. I wanted to stay to get extra credits and improve my GPA. 
* When I did graduate, I wanted to take a gap year. My options were go to college now or they would not pay. 
* I wanted to be an artist (comic), and even had a school contact me, and I formed a good relationship with many of the admissions counselors there and took several ""day camp"" classes like photography. I was allowed to go to college on the condition I choose marketing. (Finally fixed that though)


One of my biggest regrets though, was not having a quinceañera. It's something I always wanted badly and when I was 8 years old, I had a whole binder full of dresses, the activity plan, who would be invited, my theme, everything everything everything. And then at 14 years old, I couldn't leave my bedroom without being hounded my parents asking me to do a cruise. ""We don't like the church people"" ""It's a waste of money."" ""We won't invite your friends."" Etc. 

My dad would call me downstairs and pause his show to lecture me for an hour (literally, I checked the time), about the cruise and how it was way better. My siblings still resent me for the cruise because they are homebodies and hated being without internet (we couldn't afford the wifi plan according to Ma). 

On that stupid cruise, I had a chance to ride a horse on Grand Turk. My mom asked me what I wanted to do. She and my aunt (my aunt and cousin were invited) wanted to go snorkelling _again_. 

I was so excited to ride that horse. I told them I wanted to ride a horse. They both glared at me and my mom mentioned the one time we were in Argentina, when I was 4 years old, that I didn't want to ride a horse. _yeah no shit, it was taller than me_

I was excited and we got to Grand Turk. Mind you, I have a fear of the ocean and of live fish. I spent most of my time on the other two islands being yelled at by my parents for not going in the water even though I told them before and during the trip _I was scared_.

My mom tricked me and signed us up for the snorkelling with sharks. She had to angrily stay back with me and my sister we were too scared to swim with the sharks near a deep shelf. Hell no. She yelled at me the whole time and didn't speak to me for the rest of the trip.

Then my dad took me to an engagement shop on board the ship, and then ranted to me about how much he hates my siblings and Ma and that he's tired of our shit and ready to walk out on us, and that our half siblings know how to handle business. 
Basically the whole thing was horrible and I am more scared of the ocean and live fish now than I was before the trip. 

Sorry for the text wall. 

Anyways I want to have an 18th party styled lile a quinceanera. My birthday is in March so that isn't feasible, but it's common for big parties to not be on the actual birthdate. 

My parents of course wouldn't pay for this. I would be paying for everything myself. Quince parties average out at 10,000 dollars. 

I don't need a giant party. I just want the traditional ceremony (blessing, doll, changing of the shoes,etc), traditional wear(dress, crown,etc), and my friends. We have no family in the US. If I do have a giant party, it would be inviting my favourite people from church, and those people usually help out at quinces by cooking. A lot of quinces are also at our church. I don't know if our pastor charges members to use the event space though. 

Don't get me wrong, I loved the islands I went to and I love the people. I know that many can't afford or find the time to go on a cruise. It was just an awful experience because of my family. 

* Would it be weird to have a quince styled celebration at 18?
* What can I do to save up for one? Some of my friends are willing to help out by donating money and there, but I was raised to feel ashamed of that so, so far I have politely declined their help. 
* Is this feasible or am I just being too hopeful?
* Is it wrong for me to still feel angry about it? My parents told me that it was 3 years ago, and that I should get over it. But I can't seem to.",29Dec2019,1
432,"Before my dad got into crack he was a great guy. Now I have to decide whether to attend his funeral. Or whether there should be one. 

My dad was a very funny, encouraging, and mischievous man and one of my best friends until my early teens. Years of addiction changed him, eventually all he could see me as was another potential source of money for his next fix. He did some pretty horrible things that deeply hurt my little brother and I. We haven’t spoken in about 8 years. 

I’ve done a lot of therapy since, and dealt with the loss of my father as well as I could, but now that it appears he’s on his death bed I’m conflicted about what to do. 

My brother and I don’t really have any relationship with that side of the family anymore, and I don’t feel compelled to rekindle one with them because of his death. Our relationship is strained. I don’t know if any of his old friends would even attend, he burnt so many bridges over the last decade of his addiction...

Our family was never religious. There’s no will with instructions about his wishes. He has been homeless for several years and has no possessions or savings to manage.  

Then there’s the uncomfortable financial consideration. I live on the opposite coast from where he is, flights are about $800. As he has been homeless for several years and I don’t know if his brothers would be willing to pay for a funeral, if I want to have one I may have to pay for it myself. Im the eldest of 2 children. I’m in my 20s and have a job, but also significant debt.  

It feels strange and callous not to mark the occasion in some way, try to find some closure at the end of what has been a very painful family tragedy. But I don’t know that I feel like I owe it to anyone to arrange and pay for his funeral. He abandoned us when I was about 14, only reappearing occasionally to ask for cash until I stopped communication because it was too painful. That was nearly a decade ago. In many ways we’ve all moved on. 

If my brother wants to have one, I’ll support the decision and go ahead with funeral arrangements, but I doubt it, he’s still quite hurt and angry about my fathers choices.

Am I making a mistake here? Is it horrible of me not to want a funeral? Do I owe it to him as my giver of life to properly mark the occasion? Will I be denying me and my brother an important step in the grieving process?

As for my dad, he’s been unconscious since the 24th and doctors aren’t hopeful about his recovery so it doesn’t look like a deathbed reunion will be possible. I only found out about his status today. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.",29Dec2019,1

Her health is obviously deteriorating and it shows in her blood test results. Her answer to that? The lab made a mistake. Various doctors have told her she needs to lose weight but she just says they don't know what they're talking about.

We have literally tried anything. I recently told her she is literally going to die if she doesn't stop and she just acts like she absolutely doesn't know what I'm talking about.

What can I do to help her?

442,"Background info - my parents are divorced. Before my mom married my dad, apparently there was this guy who wanted to marry my mom himself but it didn't work out for some reason. Anyway, after my parents divorce, my mom and this guy started to see each other again. I had no clue about this until recently, like a year ago when I went home (I live in a different city due to university) and saw my mom had a black eye. She told me she tripped over and hit the corner of a table but I didn't believe her. Anyway I didn't make a scene although I probably should have. Since then and even a few weeks before this incident I noticed an influx of calls my mom received which was very unusual considering that the only people she talks to are her sister, me and my two cousins. So in a way I suspected there's someone she sees but I didn't want to involve myself into it.

A few weeks before this black eye incident when I also went home, like usual me and my mom started talking about my job, my life etc. After a while I overheard some noise coming from her phone and when I checked it, she was in a call with someone so that person was listening to what I was talking to my mom. I got paranoid a bit and stopped talking but as you can see, the signs were there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, onto it - my cousin (the daughter of my mother's sister) contacted me yesterday and she told me that my mom is seeing this fella who is speeding like a maniac, he's the one who gave my mom a black eye, and he offered to set up my cousin with a job only to talk shit about her instead. I think this fella divorced his actual wife because of my mom which is absolutely terrible as I looked up my mom as a person with very high moral values. Now hearing this has made me lose tons of respect. Ok for some reason my mom still stays with him even when he beat her up so I'm suspecting she's afraid of him or something, maybe he threatened my mom with something worse if she decides to split up or maybe she's totally brainwashed by him, I don't know.

I haven't asked my mom about him yet because my cousin told me that this whole situation supposed to be a secret and I shouldn't hear about it at all so if I start asking questions of course she's gonna suspect that someone told me about it.

I need a plan on how to deal with this situation. I am not sure if I should talk this up right here but I'd give anything to terrorize this little fella a little bit, to make him fear me because I'm sure as shit words will mean fuck all for him. I'd prefer to give him a good slap as revenge for that black eye he gave my mom but I probably won't go that far. Yet.",29Dec2019,1
443,"I live in Mississippi on the coast. I recently proposed to my girlfriend of 12 years and our date is set for November of 2020.

 I need advice on what options to fix my messed up teeth that I could afford. I have one tooth broken below the gums, but the rest are in pretty bad shape too. I let them go during my depression after losing my dad and I am the only sibling that did not get braces, just never felt like I was worth the financial stress it would put on my mom to push that hard for them. She is from New England area and my dad was not in my life from toddler to teenager so my family is largely unknown to me. 

My options are limited by where I live and my lack of support, and I still don't feel like I qualify for charity. Even if I could put my entire story into a crowd sourcing site I wouldn't know what to do with it if I actually got it. I'm writing this right now with an ice pack in gym shorts on my cheek because my tooth woke me up. That's when it hit me about my wedding.

444,"I love my boyfriend a lot, and he loves me, I know that for sure. I've never been so happy in a relationship and he's treated me better than anyone. The thing I'm worried about though is our circumstances of getting together.  
For context, we've been together almost 4 months. I'm 19 (was 18 when we started dating) and in my first year of college and he's 21. I had a bit of a hard, isolated childhood due to abusive parents and mental illness (a whole other can of worms I won't go into here) so I never had an in person relationship before him. I had an online relationship that lasted a year and a half before, but my ex did not treat me very well and was imo not mentally and emotionally healthy enough to date, so this put a strain on things. We began to have less time to talk once we both started college and I realized the one thing keeping me from leaving him was I was afraid to be alone. I ended up breaking up with him not long after starting college.  
I met my bf pretty soon after starting, me and him and some others all became friends but he was always closer to me than the others, and he always wanted to be around me it seemed. However he was in a relationship. It was long distance as well but unlike mine he had actually met his ex a few times. He said though that he was unhappy, and would rather be with someone who lived close. Anyway about a week after we met circumstances happened so that he sleeps over in my room, we're talking about shit and he suddenly kisses me and says he really likes me. My brain kinda short circuited at that point, I know I liked it and I had feelings for him, so I told him that but also said I needed time to think. It turns out he'd started to fall for me as soon as he met me. The next day he breaks up with his ex. A few days later we actually start dating and everything is great and perfect since then, I'm happy with him.  
However I was telling a friend about this and they said this might be a bad sign and that if he'd do that, then maybe one day he'll get sick of me and leave me for someone new too. I don't think he's that kind of person, but idk. I know the circumstances there were different, this relationship isn't long distance like his last one was, and didn't have the same issues his ex had that complicated things. But also I can't help but worry. I kinda unofficially live with him since I stay over at his place almost all the time, and he often talks about me ACTUALLY living with him next year which I know he wouldn't say if he wasn't committed to me and expecting us to be together that long (his last relationship was about 8 months long I believe). What should I think? Is this something to worry about? Also, he's been in 2 other relationships before the last one from what I remember, when he was in high school for context.",29Dec2019,1
445,"When I graduated college one of my closest friends got me a coffee cup. I wasn't a big coffee drinker in college, but some of those classes could have turned me into am addicted. 

But me being a 12 year old had to show it off to my parents, because I still want to show my parents everything. Especially something as big as graduated college with a bachelor's in biology. Looking back now, that probably disappointed both my parents for different. My dad wanted me to go for a more physical science dealing with textile and things. My mom wanted me to go into accounting so I could make a ton a money so I could take of her so she didnt have to work anymore.

Anyways, few days or so later after I graduated and did show and tell, I noticed my mom was using that coffee cup. No big deal. Its purpose was to hold hot liquids. At that point I have grand total of 3 coffee cups. But then a few weeks went by and she was constantly using it. Everyday. She left in under the coffee maker, stained, everyday for about 2 maybe 3 weeks. The behavior is normal for her, but she usually uses one of her 20 coffee cups.

And then me being the horrible child I am, I said something. Something along the line of, ""why are you using my graduation present?"" And wholly crap she flipped out. I dont recall exactly what she said, but she ended up throwing it into the sink as she stormed out of the kitchen. The handle broke.  I've tried using UV resin to restore it since glue didnt work. But the cracks and the memory are still there. 

What should I have said after that all happened? Was there anything I could have done to prevent this? It's been a few months now, and I've been trying to keep my mouth shut. Everytime I dont or disagree with her, it's just never seems to end well. 

I am trying to move out but I dont have anywhere to go. I'm trying to buy a house and that market so inflated right now. None of my friends have room, they are willing to make room for me but I dont want to intrude. And I really dont want to live with a stranger. Renting is also impossible here. A one bedroom is averaging about a grand here. Whereas I could buy a 2 or 3 bedroom for around 800 if only it qualities for my loan type.

I live in an appartment, it's bought and i have invested money in renovation. So selling is not an option. I have an upstair neighbour who os mentally handicapped.

So here is the biggest problem. I am ill, i need a lot of sleep and rest. But my neigbour wants to be a singer. He has a whole installation that he uses. The problem is, he refuses to turn down the volume, and he doesn't actually sing. He screams. Other neighbours have called the police in the past because they thought he was in distress. I have tried to get him to turn it down, after asking for 10 times and explaining that i really need the rest, he turned it down a little. Not enough. My walls vibrate from the volume. We tried again, so now he now and then sings without the music, which is basically just screaming into a mic. Not great either. Talking to him doesn't help. He gets mad, steals our mail, does a lot of passive agressive stuff. I just don't know whay to do anymore. I need to rest. I have ear infections from using plugs every day (yes they are very clean).

449,"Hi there, I am 27 M. I am a well settled guy and independent in every aspect except for some which I’ll deliberate upon later. Recently I got married as well. I am eldest of my siblings. My father is 63 years old. He retired recently and stays at home with my mom. To begin with I love my father. I know I can never repay the efforts he had put on to raise me. In every sense of the word he is a hero. I remember he got sick when me and my siblings were quite young and doctors said to him he hasn’t got much time to live but he worked hard still, took care of health and raised me and my siblings.
I don’t know why but I always felt that he was a little hard on me. In studies or in general conduct he expected nothing short. I always had to put my best to get to his standards. Still even being a high achiever throughout my life I never heard a single word of appreciation rather there was always that do more from his side.
I used to say to myself that when I’d get a decent job it might finish. But I guess another thing came into his lack of appreciation, his critique of every thing I do. 
Especially after his retirement he became more critical of me. It seems that he is all the time observing me through his scope. Now that I am married I expect that he lets me live my life.

450,"For some background, I’m a 20 year old college student. I’ve been drinking since I was 15, and I thought that was normal because that’s what my friends and I always did. It started out only once every month or so, but it kept progressing and it is now up to 3-4 times a week. Somewhere along the way we started smoking a lot so there are days when I really struggle to be sober. I also have been using a Juul since I was 17. 

I used to be very athletic, confident, and social. Now there are things in my body that don’t feel right and I no longer feel like I can think straight. I feel I no longer have a personality outside of partying. I’m not confident in myself at all and I often find myself imagining when life was better. I can no longer relate to my friends unless it is about things like partying or getting fucked up. Hell, I can barely go an entire day without using nicotine, smoking, or drinking. 

I’m not proud of who I am, but everyone around me is like this and I really do care about all of them deeply. My family is riddled with addiction and I don’t know where to go from here.

I let it sit there for awhile because I was like whatever this isn't sexual, then I started feeling like this wasn't right so I held the dog off my bulge. Then I let go and let it lean back there for a bit before holding the dog off me again and finally just pushing the dog off me all together.

Now I'm completely against zoophelia. Just because the dog doesn't actually know what's going on does not make it okay. I'm just not sure if I did something wrong here. I feel bad about it, but then again it wasn't sexual in anyway, just because I had a boner doesn't make it sexual. Argh

We all had a falling out in July and basically I called them out for not giving a shit about me cause I was always the one visiting them (we lived in different states) and doing them favors but they never once did that stuff for me in the 2 years I lived at my own place. One of the girls and me got into it and she accused me of always having something smart to say or whatever cause we would always get into debates which she would start too.

454,"**Background:** I'm from an Asian background, and from a very young age, sexual chastity was always praised as a rite of passage to adulthood and social success in my household. Since elementary, I was taught not to give in to lusting after girls, rather instead to focus on my studies and to maintain my sexual chastity as a badge of honor, and as a requirement for marriage. Being a non-virgin and moreover, being married as a virgin to a non-virgin is seen as an incredible shame to the honor of my family and the respect of others in my community. 

**Main Story:** So I'm now currently attending college in the United States, and have become westernized in some of my norms. I befriended this girl in my biochemistry class, and she seems to be very open-minded, kind-hearted, and smart as well. However, I recently overheard her talking with some of her other friends about ""this guy I hooked up with on tinder last night"".  I became totally intimidated and nervous after hearing this, as that one statement, changed her image in my head from that of an angel, to that of an embarrassment and shameful thoughts. 

The funny thing is though, I still actually love hanging out with her and talking to her, she's got a vibrant personality, but that one obstacle in the back of my mind just prevents me from ever wanting to pursue her as a love interest. In my mind, she might never love me in the same way that she loved her exes and sexual partners. I'm afraid that she'll always have feelings for them in the back of her mind, and that she'll always be comparing me to her exes in every respect, that I'll never be seen by her as a soul mate, but rather just as another card in her deck.

About two months after we started dating he asked me to send him nudes and I kept refusing so he texted a different girl and got them from her instead and sent some too Spencer told me the first time and that night was the first time I cut I blamed myself for being so stupid a couple days later the girl texts me telling me Spencer asked again and to ask him to stop I stopped talking to Spencer for a while and cut for a week afterwards I avoided him at school until he used one of my friends to talk to me and acted like he was sorry so we talked again. The first time we had sex it was consensual but I didn't know what it was going to cause later on after that every time we hung out Spencer asked for sex always trying to pressure me into it and I'd always give in to get him to stop asking for it I started to get concerned I hadn't started my period after we had sex probably 4 times at most and he just brushed it off and asked me for sex a month went by and still no period and I knew it was to late for a late period so I used homemade pregnancy tests which all reacted which meant pregnant and then I got an actual test from the store it said positive all I could think was ""I'm going to be a mom!"" And then I cried I'm still not sure why I did I told Spencer and all he said was ""ok"" and asked me for sex again that day. One day I started working for his mom it was kinda cool it was my first job ever Spencer worked there too but we worked on different days so I didn't have to see him except some days he'd sneak in to work and instead of working he'd start touching me again and it was really uncomfortable I was probably about 4 months pregnant at the time one day when he walked in and started talking me his mom said she'd be in with a client for some kind of mask and it'd probably take the whole time I was there and I was fine with that but what I wasn't fine with was Spencer stood in front of me and had his dick out of his pants trying to get me to give him a blowjob but I refused and so he pulled up my shirt and stuck it between my boobs it freaked me out and I almost yelled at him there but instead ran to the bathroom and stayed there until it was time for me to go back home. The next day I broke up with him I was done with his crap and Spencer wasn't happy and tried to say we couldn't break up if he didn't want us to but my mom came out in time to save me. I can't stand being near the guy but his family has made it clear if I don't let them see my son they will take me to court they've threatened recently because Spencer hadn't seen my son in about a week because there was a holiday and I got busy. My son is almost 9 months old I'm not sure how much longer I can take this. When I want to keep my son home with me because I'm lonely or emotionally hurt my mom lectures me about it being Spencer's right as his father to see him but she doesn't know any of the things he's done to me and I want to tell her because I'm tired of this all happening but I'm not sure how to. Spencer is bisexual as well and usually I'm fine with people being bisexual because it's their life no one should be telling you who or what you like but I'm worried he will try to do things to my son when he gets older. I'm honestly not sure if his parents even know what he's done I'm sure they don't he thinks he's done nothing wrong. I'm a senior now and Spencer is a junior. He does whatever he can to try to brag about his girlfriend if he finds out I'm dating someone or try to make me feel bad about them.",29Dec2019,1
466,"So, to give context, I started university in a different city this fall. I was very nervous to start, because it's hard for me to make friends. I'm very bad at starting conversations without seeming odd or creepy, and people rarely go up to me because I'm a big guy with a bit of a constant bitch face. If someone goes up to me though, I usually make friends easy. Luckily, at orientation, I was able to meet this amazing person. I saw them sitting alone, so out of a whim I went up to them. We talked, and we found out we are from towns very close to each other, and that we have a lot in common. To say the least we became friends instantly. It was great, but after talking to her more and more, I started to fall for her hard. I've never met a person I've connected with this much before. 

The issue is, is that she has a boyfriend. I knew that from the start, so I respected it as much as I could. I was honestly upset I fell for her. I should know better, but I guess you cant control feelings like that. Anyways, I just ignored it, and tried to keep it as friends. We both needed it after all. 

The issue now, is that over this break I thought I could try to get over her completely, or more at least. That was my plan. I thought that being away from her is the best way to do this. It is not working in the slightest though. I've thought about her everyday now, but I've made sure not to text her to keep with my word of being away from her. She first texted me on christmas, a week and a half since I came back home, just saying merry christmas. As a normal thing to do, I asked her if she did anything special. She seemed pretty distant after she responded though. She said something to the lines of ""nothing really"". Then, to keep the conversation going, I said ""have you just been relaxing then"". She hasn't responded, or even looked at it, in two days. To say the least, I've been pretty crushed by it. It's been keeping me down the last few days. She could just be having a bad time, which I hope she isnt; she could also just be busy, idfk she wont respond. 

Honestly, I'm thinking it might be best if I end the friendship. I dont think I can get over her if I don't cut the ties completely. It's even more wrong considering she has a boyfriend. Throughout highschool, I wasnt able to tell the person I had feelings for that I did. I regretted it more than anything. I know that I feel even stronger about this girl, so it's killing me that I cant do anything about it either. 

I know it isnt fair to her either though. It would be selfish for me to end it over something that, I am pretty certain, is one sided. We talked about being the only true friends we have there. We seemed to only really have each other there. It isnt fair to end it over something that she isnt guilty of. It will also suck to not see her anymore; she was basically the only person I was always excited to see. I just am struggling here; I dont know how long I can keep this going. 

If you got this far, thank you for reading. Please, if you have any advice, I'd love to hear it. I really dont know what to do, and it's depressing the shit out of me.",29Dec2019,1
467,"Man.... I never thought I’d be asking advice for a situation like this but here I am. 

My best friend and I have been close ever since we were young teens and our bond has only gotten stronger through adulthood. I wouldn’t cut her off for this, but I’m *definitely* uncomfortable. 

My friend, who I will refer to as M, just hosted a party at her house. This is a common, and fun, occurrence. More often than not, at least 3 other partygoers spend the night, including myself. My friend and I usually share her bed, but tonight she decided to cuddle up with a friend of ours on the 2XL bean bag chair that takes up half of her bedroom space. The bean bag chair can easily double as a (short) bed, that’s how extra large it is. Anyway, it’s currently 6:30 AM and I’ve been tossing and turning for a while. No big deal. Until my mind fully wakes up and I realize why I’m restless. There’s no delicate way to put this, I really wish there was... my best friend was being finger banged 4 feet away from me. If y’all have had any experience with that, you’ll know that it sounds very.... specific. There is no way it could have been anything else. I had even tried to rationalize it and make myself think it was a misunderstanding... but then other faint noises were starting so that pretty much blew the benefit of the doubt out of the water. 

I’m just wondering how I should go about this?? I was thinking about trying to be lighthearted to spare some embarrassment but at the same time, a bitch (me) is disgusted, so I just don’t know. What I do know, though, is that it would 100% happen again if they thought I was asleep. Whatever going on between them is very new and very secret, so I feel like that plays a part in why they felt like they had to do something like this, but it’s not an excuse. Any recommendations on how to approach this? I’m currently at a loss",29Dec2019,1
468,"About 3 years ago, I moved to the 'country'.   I'm actually about 1 mile outside the city limits so it's the country, but there are a lot of houses fairly close to one another.   About half of the houses have 2 acres of the land... but the distance from house to house might be less than an acre.      It was a quiet little country neighborhood.  


There is a house behind mine that is a rent house.   When I bought my house, there was a couple with a child.      The house was fairly well kept and quiet.

About 6 months later, they moved out and a very redneck group moved in.   All of their backyard and front yard is trash piles, equipment, old trucks, etc. now   I'm OK with that.   However, recently, they've picked up welding and run a VERY loud gas generator.    The generator is on the back of their trailer... and the trailer is completely sealed on all sides except the back.     As a result, wherever the *back* of the trailer is pointed --- that is where the noise is funneled.      At the moment, they have that trailer point directly at my house (versus the field of my house or somewhere else).  And my backyard isn't enjoyable unless you can wear sound blocking headphone or mentally block it out -- it's fairly loud.

How would you approach this situation?    (versus just getting up and moving away.)

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking they'd at least turn off the generator at night -- now, they're leaving it in 'idle mode' when they're not welding.... they might be powering the RV that their uncle now lives in.    They also have acquired 4 dogs that bark often (when they see me in the back yard -- the fence is about 4 feet tall with vines on them).",29Dec2019,1

470,"I've never had a friend in my life and neither has my mom. This is something that I've been battling since childhood when my first ""friend"" in elementary got put in another school because she moved and she never kept in touch with me. The next time I had ""friends"" was in high school. But literally after we had our graduation I felt a shift. We were all going to separate colleges and I remarked about how I hoped we didn't ever grow apart and one of my ""friends"" said ""yeah, I think that's just the natural progression of life"". For some reason I knew then that she had no intention of keeping in touch. And I was right, I would check in with her the summer before college started, I would call to see how she was doing and her mom would take a message for me but only returned my call once during that period. Throughout college up until after we graduated college I only heard from her maybe 5-7 times, although I would call her. She would go over a year at times before returning my call or contacting me just to tell me about her milestones in life i.e. buying a house. I got tired of reaching out to her only to barely get reciprocation. My other HS friend drifted her own way and barely kept in touch.

The last ""friend"" I thought I was forming a real connection with was at work. We would share things about our relationships (I would share aspects of my dating life). I thought we really got along. But when I started a new job and she left the company it's like the same thing, she immediately did not want to keep in touch. She bought a house in a different state and I wanted to come out to see her in a show of support and her response was ""You would come all the way there?"". But in my mind I'm thinking of course, I really thought we were friends and was genuinely happy for her and wanted to show support (isn't that what a friend would do?). But something about the way she said it let me know this was a fake relationship all along and maybe I couldn't see it the whole time. After we both left that job I would check in on her periodically, a text here and here (literally, I did not bombard at all), which went unanswered, and after a few unanswered texts I called her and she said she never got my texts because her phone was acting weird (didn't quite believe that tbh). But then I text and called a month later or so to no response. I stopped contacting her after that as it seemed I was being ignored, and I value myself enough to know when I'm not appreciated/wanted and to walk away.

I'm going to stop there because I honestly could give plenty more examples where I've tried to make new friendships and form friendships to no avail. I care about people and I have an open and honest heart. I understand you cannot push friendships and I never had, I think friendships should be formed naturally and genuinely. I'm a natural introvert but I also understand and make an effort to talk and communicate with others because I do value that human connection. I even tried therapy to no avail. My last therapist made a comment at the end of our very first meeting about moving our scheduled time up in the future because she wanted to get started with her weekend earlier (basically made me feel like my issues didn't matter). I didn't make a follow up visit. I'm Christian as well, I've prayed so many times about this and asked God for help and guidance. I've struggled with being okay that God's love is enough. Not to make this religious, if you're not a believer disregard that. I'm not looking for pity, maybe to get it off my chest and know I'm not alone in this. And perhaps some advice on how to deal. I have hobbies I occupy myself with but this is a nagging constant in the back of my mind.",29Dec2019,1

476,"After my last post about ""Am I sexist?"", I spent the time to think to myself due to the comments... an unhealthy amount of time. I remembered this detail that I completely overlooked even though it has been in front of my eyes this whole time... and I always think about it when I'm alone and only have my thoughts to myself. 

In the past, she was sexually assaulted by someone who she considered a brother at the time due to them spending long amounts of time since her mother had no place to stay and they crashed at a friends home for quite a bit until they were back on track, her mother had just gotten out of a divorce because her father was a drug dealer who was caught (I probably shouldn't be saying all of this cause it's not my information to disclose, but it is digging in my head). She and this ""brother"" had numerous accounts alone together, at night, sometimes in the same room when the friend's son ( who we will call Jimmy- the brother) would crawl into her rooms in that night. First she experienced vile language about what he wants to do, to her being sexually assaulted by Jimmy as he attempted to grope her, to her finally being physically restrained by Jimmy as he raped her. 

She has numerous thoughts after this event saying ""maybe I liked it at the time and that's why it kept happening"", or ""maybe I didn't try hard enough to make him stop"", or ""maybe it was my fault for not talking to anyone"", and it digs into her head... she has been thinking about it all weeks and has been taking her pent up stress on me, which I won't blame her for, but it makes me sad. I also think about this very frequently... and it feels as if I experienced the same thing as her, though I haven't. It makes me feel anxious, depressed, hopeless, all of the above. And it doesn't look like I'm doing much to help her.

I don't know what to do to prevent or help her from feeling like she's worthless, I don't know what to do to prevent or help her from thinking about the incident, I don't know what to do to prevent or help her from freezing up and blanking on me, I don't know what to do to prevent or help her from crying herself to sleep and feeling suicidal...

Everything started when I made a joke about wanting to get plastic surgery, my boyfriend gave me a rude response and I felt really bad, then he turned around to sleep cause he works at the night shift but I didn't let him sleep, I kept telling him that he should apologize to the point I got him angry and he told me he's been talking to another girl for a while now, that he likes her more than me and another mean stuff... Now comes the hard part, he done this before, I mean telling me something really mean cause I pissed him so now I just don't know if it's true or not.

Those are the reasons I think it's true

- I asked him thousands of times if he was being honest and he said it was true

- even now in the morning he still says he's talking to another person

-he changed his WhatsApp photo to a nicer one

Those are the reasons I doubt him

- I always play and mess around on his phone and I never found anything suspicious, he gave me his password, and I pretty much have messed around in every single part of his phone and I never found a sign of cheating

- all the time he was telling me that, he was laughing like ""yeah I'm talking to this girl hehehe""

- his best friend doesn't think it's true, in her opinion he's just being mean

-before the fight we were pretty happy and having lots of fun, he invited me to a new year's Eve party and said to his friend he would only go to the party if I he could bring me too

- he just bought a chip for his phone, before that the only form he had of talking to another person was Facebook messenger and I guarantee you, there's nothing suspicious there

- he always sent me printscreens of his PC when he's playing and I never saw nothing there

- he didn't want to give me any information about the girl he's talking to, a name, where they met, where they talk, first he said he met her one month ago and then he said he didn't remember when they met each other.

480,"# Background: 

* I'm turning 21 in less than a month.
* I'm a citizen of one of the top ten richest European countries 
* I graduated highschool in summer of 2019
* I want to go to university. 
* My highschool diploma is missing subjects I need to get into the university programmes I'm genuinely interested in. I will have to go to ""adult school"" to do those subjects. This can take 6-12 months. 
* After highschool, I decided to move to a less rich, more pleasant country to live in. Getting into university there was taking too long for me to get accepted that year so I decided to take a ""year off"" and get a job in that country instead. 

# My concerns:

1. Family has financial debts. 
2. I don't know what I want to work with: I want a job that will allow me to pursue my interests, which are ever-changing and highly variant. I know not of any such job but the ones with very few spots. 
3. Geographical freedom:  (1) I want to live in the country that suits my personality best but I'm yet to know which it is; (2) potential mate located elsewhere; (3) Economic decline of country I enjoy living in; (4) war in my lifetime. 
4. Passive stable income in 5-10 years: ideally a sum I *survive* off of (pay rent/bills, eat well) in developed countries. Reasons for this are including but not limited to: (1) security in case of switching jobs; (2) More freedom with career paths; (3) Geographical freedom; etc.
5. Mate value/reproduction/finding a mate: (1) My brute mate value as a female and fertility is peaking now and will do for a few more years. (2) statistically, a discouragingly low number of males have my desired qualities. I will have to spend a decent time just searching. 
6. I need to live the university/partying experience: I have done very few social activities in general. I know that even if I do not enjoy them, I will regret not having done them. I'm already starting to regret it now. 

# What I could do:

* Regarding **#1**: Move back to rich country, get a part-time job now and work until summer of 2020, when I will go to university.   
**Cons**:

1. Living in this rich country makes for a very depressing life for me.
2. I will probably be able to help with only 5-10% of the debts. 

**Pros**: 

1. Helping my family.  
2. During these months, I will be able to do some of the subjects missing for university programs. 

* Regarding **#2, #3, #6**: Go to university and just study whatever my heart desires (I was thinking: *Economics, data/statistics/probability, and evolutionary biology/psychology*. Not necessarily in that order) and do years abroad as much as possible.   
I decided to start with a 3-year bachelor program in Economics. (thought this would help with **#4** as well) but I just realized I will be 24 in 3 years. That doesn't sound very accomplished, does it?

# What's the problem?  

Well, for starters, I don't want to feel depressed for 6 months. I'm not 100% certain the solution to #1 is worth it. 

Second, for whatever reason, I'm finding it rather challenging searching for ALL the possible degrees in the possible universities in the possible countries I could study in. I am pretty much structure-less in this area.

Let's call him Alan and her Sally.

Alan (22) and I (25) work in the cubicles next to each other on similar teams so we have a fair bit to do with each other.

Sally works in the office down the road but we still all have a fair bit to do with each other.

Anyways, Sally and I hooked up last night after we went out for drinks with a couple mutual friends, one of which also works in the office (LOL). Said mutual friend doesn't know for sure we did but he will no doubt ask.

Sally has been trying to get me to come over for months but wants me to keep it on the DL and even lie to Alan or anyone else that asks about it which I do not feel comfortable with.

They dated for about 18 months and there are conflicting stories about how they broke up. He says that he broke up with her while she says it was mutual. They are still close friends and talk regularly.

However due to what’s happened I just can’t seem to get happy anymore I get angry at the games super easy now and I’m basically always distracted and i don’t know what to do does anyone have any advice on what to do to make me happier (by the way I blocked the original person who started bullying me first calling me gay a Pusey he wanted to hit me annoying sad a freak a loner a wannabe and that I should go cut myself(I didn’t jic your wondering) 
So that helped a little bit but I just don’t feel happy anymore",29Dec2019,1
488,"Im currently out of state on vacation. I went to the urgent care yesterday and paid 170 for a visit out of pocket to try and get a prescription for a medication that I already have because I was already experiencing bad withdrawal symptoms after leaving it at home. I spent about 30 minutes waiting and spoke to the doctor for less than 2. They ended up sending my prescription that, need I remind you, has an intense withdrawal process, to the wrong pharmacy that had already closed. I found out two hours later when the CVS pharmacy I asked for told me they never received it and neither had the CVS the urgent care actually sent it to. At the urgent care, the lady at the front even ensured me that they had sent it to the correct one after I asked. At this point I had a migraine, chills, dizziness, confusion and vomiting because the urgent care had failed to provide me with the proper prescription. I had to go to another urgent care, get another prescription, and go to a 24 hour pharmacy that was 30 minutes away to finally get my medication. I couldn’t simply go to the urgent care I had been to that same day because they just had to close early for a holiday party. I was up all night because I still had withdrawal. I want my 170 back because this really fucked my whole day up. I’m not really one to normally ask for mindy back, but I’m really pissed. Do you think I can get it?",29Dec2019,1

The second guy said my vagina was too tight and hurt his dick and that it was really painful having sex with me. Both guys had condoms on and they had about the same size on their penis.

Anyways we were talking and we have almost everything in common but I noticed that while we were talking he wasn’t looking at me. At all. I was facing him and he was kinda looking to the side and would make eye contact with me like once every minute. I don’t know if that’s good or bad.

492,"Recently in returned my ex's stuff after we broke up. I went to college and she started in my home town. We tried doing a point distance relationship. I didn't commit to it like I should have and she eventually dumped me. However, the reason was the her family was moving even farther away and I'd never get to see her. I thought that was the end of it. Later, I find out that she is staying in town and not moving with her family. She calls me late at night to tell me this decision and tells me that there might be a chance of us getting back together. I didn't hear anything from her for about a month, so in texted her and I poured my heart out to her and I told her that I still lived her and that I really want to make this work if we do get back together. Instead, all I get is a ""sorry, I've moved on"" text. My heart drops into my stomach. It really stinks in that I lost her. Recently she asked for her stuff back. I met her at work to give her the stuff. It was there I met her new boyfriend. That just killed me. I then just learned that they started going out not even a month after we broke up. I thought I meant the world to her, but I just feel empty.

I know this is kind of long. I just don't know where to turn for advice. I want to be happy but I just feel like all my happiness has been stripped away from me. I was able to put off my feelings while I was at school. Now, after seeing her, I can still feel how much I love her. It hurts knowing that I just f*cked it up so bad. I cheated on her after a month of dating like a god damn idiot. To this day I still can't forgive myself for doing that. I hurt her so much. I was her high school crush and I just toyed with her like a heartless bastard. Maybe this feeling is karma for having done such a terrible thing to her. I'm just trying to feel like I'm loved and cared for. I guess the old saying is true. You never really know how much you love something till you loose it. Boy, did I lose her. I don't know what to do guys. I feel like I've lost the best partner I could have ever asked for. I know I'll never get her back and that just kills me to no end. I just want to be held by someone who cares and cry but I don't even get that luxury. She has blocked me on all social media and the only way I can communicate to her if through text. I don't want to annoy her or stalk her but I want to know how she is doing at least. It just hurts being forcefully ripped away from her life like that. I know I screwed up and I know I don't deserve a second chance. It just hurts so bad",29Dec2019,1

I’ve (M21) been dating this woman (F22) for a month now, and we’re really into each other both emotionally and physically, our personalities are quite compatible, and it’s looking really promising. 

But I can’t help but feel really scared, and wanting out before anything more serious happens. I sometimes find myself thinking about things that aren’t there like “she’s boring” but every time I’m with her I really have fun (not in physical way only), or trying to find a flaw. 

When everything began to look real and serious in short period of time (3-4 weeks), I started getting stressed, anxious, and I guess a bit guilty it’s affecting my sleep, diet, and overall mental stability. 

I want to power through this phase, but there is a “gut” feeling guiding me otherwise, I’ve been trying to figure out what’s wrong but I can’t seem to have a clear answer.",29Dec2019,1

498,"Some contextual information, she's 15 and for a while now there's been family issues involving everyone, essentially everyone hates each other. We also don't have a relationship with each other, tbf i hate her. 

Now last night my mother and my other sister went out to a wedding so they wouldn't be home for a while. I left my room to go the kitchen passing along her room, only to smell a very very strong smell of weed (i think so anyway). Her room was dark so i thought she was sleeping but i asked outside her room so see if she'd respond to me calling her name. She did and so i went into the room to check, and it seemed like she wasn't smoking. I saw a cigarette box however on her bed but she wasn't near her bed. She intended to make food later and when she did I entered her room around where she was sitting to find a lighter. I couldn't find it so I didn't think much of it that night.

Fast forward the next day. Everyone went out and so I thought this would be a good opportunity to try find the lighter. I ended finding it, and it was inside a sock. The same sock that was on her bed. Very fishy. Now I know for certain she was smoking that day. Also that very same sock smelt very strong of the thing yesterday. 

I don't know whether to tell my mother and I know if i said anything to her, she wouldn't listen and find some other way to smoke. Also I feel like I feel don't tell my mother, I'll be basically be betraying her. I am in quite the sticky position.

Tldr : smelt a strong smell of weed last night went into room found nothing. Next day found the lighter and the place it was in smelt very strong of the thing last night.",29Dec2019,1
499,"This is going to be a hilarious and awkward conversation. We live in a small town with a population of 3,000. My brother just left to see his gf for a week, and he sent me a screenshot from his friend who found my tinder profile. He captioned it with “should I be worried?”

I’m 17 and my brother is 20. He sees me as innocent and as a child, and one time he asked me if I’d ever kissed, and was really surprised when I said yes. He sometimes acts a bit protective and like a parent, because he doesn’t always agree with my parents’ style of raising me. I have a pretty *rich* “wild” dating life that my family doesn’t know of, obviously, it’s my personal thing who I see. 

I’m just guessing when he comes home, he’s going to ask me about it. What am I supposed to say? He does have pretty firm viewpoints of love and sex, and he occassionally (when the topic comes up) comments on “*sluts*” and moral, and how anything outside of a relationship or marriage is wrong.

501,"Just gonna make this short and simple. I can’t help but all of a sudden feel self conscious about my size. A little back story I’m 5”9 and 140 lbs. I would say I’m good looking, I model here and there on the side. Last year I worked with all guys at an office and my boss and coworker (who were both 6”3) always made fun of how small I am. I wouldn’t mind but it was all the time. They both said how I “probably had a small d*ck” in front of my face a few times cause I had a small iPhone 5 compared to their big Galaxy phones. Just LOL. I told them my gf would say otherwise. Wasn’t really sure how to approach that. They also told me how if I went to prison I “would be passed around by the inmates” because I “look like a boy” 

Whenever I play lacrosse (it’s with a bunch of older guys) they treat me like a boy and call me “little buddy”. I don’t get it. People always treat me like a little boy. I’ve been bulking a lot at the gym to get thiccer.

At my new work I work with all females. I do get hit on a lot. One of the girls who were into me called me a small boy all the time. Im 2 inches taller than her! I told her I’m 5”9 (after being told by the doctor) she was like “there’s NO WAY”. I was like okay and measured in front of her. 

I guess I shouldn’t care what people think. And it’s not like I only get negative attention. A lot of people find my attractive. But it seems like any time I meet a guy taller than me they don’t like me. They literally look down on me. I’m not even that short. Should I just not care at all and move on?

504,"Long story short, my apartment is a nightmare. In just 2 short months, some insane anxiety about roommate noise led me to develop “psychotic features” on top of my bipolar (hearing/seeing things). I went to the hospital for 20 days and I’ve been staying with my parents for 10 days. Next week, it’s time to go back to my apartment.

As you might expect, I’m terrified to go back there. I don’t want to trigger hallucinations again. I don’t want to be in an environment where I was so scared. Before I went to the hospital, everything developed that weird light quality that horror movies have. It’s hard to explain.

I can’t move out, so I need to figure out a plan for changing my perception of the apartment. Any ideas welcome! If it helps to know, I have a very snuggly cat, a nice computer where I do video editing (favorite thing), and a library card. Unfortunately, I can’t move furniture around, since my room is small and designed for a specific configuration.

I met my wife over the internet, befriended her but noticed it was hard to see her because her family is strict. She had to be home from school right away, can't be outside, nor be at a friends house. They didn't even want her have a boyfriend. Now, I'm the type of guy to show people who am I so they won't think bad of me or instead assume I'm someone I'm not. They punished her for months when they found out she skipped school to see me, and because she was no longer a virgin. Now I do feel ashamed because I feel we moved too fast and shouldnt have done that. It was harder now to see her and talk to her considering her phone was taken away. Long story short, I've tried reaching to the man of the house, the step father, since everything goes by him. That didn't happen, he never wanted, instead I'm being intimated by him and my wife's older brother. They didn't want her to marry me, they didn't want her to move in with me but the end of the day, its her choice. Now I married her because of her religion and because we both agreed its the right thing to do before living together. She moved in, my mom is being kicked out by owner so the owner son can live there, mom struggles but finds a house in another state but its in debt, i cant help because no job and I'm still in highscool but almost done, i don't know what to do with my life, career wise, my wife and I argue often, and it's been close i was certain for divorce. I'm sorry readers if I didnt say things in order or didn't take my time, I just feel stuck. I dont know what to do to fix my marriage, know what to do after school, and the trying to connect with her family is out the window, the step father said very bad things about me and my family without personally knowing them, and her mother is very bias and since her older brother is a boxer, its okay for him to want to fight me.

524,"I am not going to provide advice to her because I'm clueless and naïve with virtually no life experience, and the potential for harm is too grave.

My mom is in dire straits and desperate for a little extra money like the rest of us at times. I am trying to help as much as I can but I work a minimum wage job and barely make rent every month, and have been forced to live a highly frugal lifestyle just to make it every month.

She decided that she's going to sell a set of furniture she inherited from her late mother, which is worth more than something significant enough to make a difference, temporary as it may be. Where it's sitting at the moment (my sister's place) it is abandoned, full of dust and scratches and generally just degrading in quality because of the lack of maintenance. She claims she's too busy for 'trivial' things like that, even though 90% of the time she's at home. She is vehemently opposed to the idea of selling it, even though she doesn't have a right to it whatsoever. So I told my mom to ignore her.

Here's the real problem: my grandpa (her side) wants it back, and he's willing to buy it from her, but for only for an amount that is not as much as the one someone else would offer. That someone else is my dad, her ex-husband. He's willing to purchase it (he's rolling in the money, no alimony for her though) just to spite my grandpa, who knows this. Possibly a result of this is that the already strained relationship (since my grandpa can be a very difficult person) between my mom and grandpa, which is better than it's been in a few years, would break down again and come to a complete halt. So she's very conflicted about that, but she really needs the extra money. If she sells it to him, there's a chance that his current wife (a real 'gold digger') would take it when my grandpa passes away, and this is another concern of my mom.

What is the best course of action for her to take here? I honestly think this is out of my hands and way over me. I'd appreciate some input, thank you.",29Dec2019,1

I recently started dating someone good and worthy, he’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a man and this guy is really important to me. I really want to introduce him to my dad (I’ve never introduced any of my boyfriends to my dad) but idk how to tell my dad about the fact that I’m dating someone without him going crazy protective on me, let alone introducing him to my boyfriend.

I am considering going back for my masters online to hopefully land a better paying job that makes me happier in life. I am worried because I have heard that masters classes are a lot harder than the classes I have finished. 

A little background.. I am 30, I am a mother to two special needs children and I work full time. I also have an amazingly supportive husband. I finished my bachelors online when my kids were younger and more challenging but now I work full time.

The headset was labelled to have a 30 day return policy.

I go to return headset (not working with my employers VOIP)

""But I was not offered peace of mind.""

""There's nothing I can do, the employee should have offered it.""

""YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SOLD OT TO ME!""

""Nothing I can do.""

I've looked around online best I could before asking here, but it looks as though he should have at the very least mentioned it and at the very most provided a hard copy of this ""Peace of Mind"" warranty.

Also I saw and example of where one warranty can supercede the other.

If the bulb burns out on day 31 that would only be around 750 hours, therefore their warranty is still good.

540,So I just moved to another state for my now fiance last year. I had a job making $15 hr previously and didn't really learn much from it that utilized my associates in IT degree. It's a pretty basic computer science degree (AST - Associates in Specialized Technology) Don't even have my A+ plus certification since it wasn't required in my class and wasn't paid for to take it. She's going into nursing and doing quite well. I feel I will be a financial burden as right now I'm just a work at home CSR that pays enough to cover my half of the bills however not a whole lot else. So basically I'm wondering if I should further my IT degree/get my certs or do something else entirely. What's worth getting into as a career now?

Idea: Separate app from reddit. Login with reddit/link reddit. Pick top subreddits (subreddits both of you must be in). Gives you people to swipe/like based on selected top subs, other not top subs you're in, and other preference settings. When swiping/liking you'd see the other person's subreddits and 1-2 pictures. (You'd have the option to hide a few subs Ex: some people might not want to share support group type subs). Option for your gender, their gender, their age range, distance, and wanted relationship type (hook up, friendship, dating for commitment) would be available.

543,"My son is something else. He is one of a kind.

When he was in first grade, he had an accident where he pooped his pants. Ever since that day, I knew there was something not quite right about him. I've NEVER heard of any child doing this. How could he deliberately crap his pants? I only know of people with mental issues to do something like this.

When he was in preschool/daycare he used to cry a lot. His mother worked there. She had to keep tending to him to calm him down. I would have to leave work early to come pick him up because he wouldn't stop crying. Eventually we had to pull him out of daycare and have his grandmother watch him. He was like 3 or 4 at the time.

He was such a crybaby when he was little. He also used to play with his sister's barbie dolls. I did not like that at all. Whenever I would catch him playing with them, I would take them from him and hide them. He would start crying and screaming like a little girl.

Also, when he was growing up, he never really had any friends or socialized. He spent most of his time in the house, watching cartoons or playing video games. He never wanted to go outside to play with other kids. He only interacted with his siblings, a couple of cousins, and his classmates in school. This behavior carried on with him all the way to college.

I always tried to encourage him to go out and socialize but he never wanted to do it.

In high school, he would go to school and come home. He never dated or hung out with anyone. He wasn't working or driving. He didn't want to do those things. When he would be out of school for the summer, he hardly ever left the house.

When he went to college, it was the same thing. He never socialized with anyone.

When he goes to the doctor for a physical, his heart rate is always very high. I don't know why he gets like that whenever he goes to the doctor. He had to do Echocardiograms and Holters to make sure there was nothing wrong with his heart.

I don't know what my son's problem is. Don't you guys think these behaviors are weird? Can any of you guys relate?",29Dec2019,1
544,"Let me start with a little backstory. Both my grandmother and grandfather (both in their 60s) are relentless alcoholics and extreme hoarders. They both smoke upwards of 40 cigarettes per day and show no signs of trying to better their situation. I moved in and lived with them for two years back when I was 14 for unrelated reasons and for a while I done my best to help. I didn’t succeed and it really took a toll on my mental health watching them kill themselves. 

My cousin just turned 21 and he moved in right after I left, around 2/3 years ago. He is an absolute scumbag. I used to have substance abuse problems back then and he was the fire that fuelled the flame, I eventually moved back in with my parents to get better but at that time he was kicked out of his house and had nowhere to go but my grandparents house. To make matters 100% fucking worse my grandmother got diagnosed with lung cancer. After two years of chemo she miraculously survived but still insists on smoking like a chimney. The chemo resulted in extreme weight loss in my grandmother and she struggles to even get up the stairs anymore. Not to mention the arthritis in her back. My grandparents aren’t rich and the pension money my grandfather had saved is already gone

My cousin quit his job because he ‘couldn’t be assed’ anymore and opted to claiming benefits and spending the money on weed and taking cigarettes off my grandmother. If she didn’t give him any he would verbally abuse her. Every time I go to visit they both tell me how horrible he is and the shit he’d said that week. He took my old bedroom and the place is absolutely trashed. My grandparents are buying new dish-ware every week due to the absolute state of the dishes he leaves in his room for weeks at a time.

I rarely visit anymore, the last time I came down when he was there I ended up with my head split open when he hit me with a knife sharpener. The police said that I shouldn’t visit when he’s there as a result. Fair, right? I sometimes get the chance to visit after college as my train passes through the town they live in and I visit for a while but there’s very little I can do as he’s usually not gone for long. I have begged and pleaded for my grandparents to try and get a bungalow closer to where my side of the family live and they obviously want to do it, I just don’t know what’s stopping them...

It’s no secret that they are both probably going to pass on soon as a result of their unhealthy lifestyle. But I cannot bare the thought of their final few years spent living like this. It’s not a life I’d wish on anyone, especially people as loving as my grandparents... I just wish I knew what to do. Please give me advice Reddit.",29Dec2019,1

We’ve been together for just under 2 years and we had a fight about her keeping those nudes. She said that she deleted them all and I very strongly believe that going through her phone is invasive so I didn’t check. Last night I was drunk and she passed out while I was sending myself our most recent photos from her phone and curiously got to me. She had deleted most of the nudes but there were 2 that I think she may have just missed so I deleted them. Then I saw a video of them kissing still in her phone. So I deleted all of the photos where they were touching lips. I’m talking like cheek kisses, everything. Felt like I lost my shit. But.. now they are gone and I’m sober and I’m unsure of if that was an absolutely insane move. Am I crazy? Do I tell her what I did?

546,"The title pretty much. Before my girlfriend lost her virginity she spent a semester experimenting getting ate out by a guy in return for some head. Apparently he made her cum most times. I can't give her head for 20 minutes without her asking for a position change or just laughing (because her clit get ticklish).

It's fucking with me soooo much. She swears up and down I'm her favorite sex partner which I believe because before me she couldn't really handle penetration. Also she had no idea what a G-Spot was so when I finger her it's like no other she ever had.

It just hurts that I can't do what someone else did to make her cum. At first she told me her stimulation needs changed. Before me the only good part about sex was oral, but now she likes other things more.

After talking to her more she just admitted that maybe his head was a little better. I'm not mad because I forced it out of her. She was trying to protect my feelings with whole stimulation need change.

I just don't know what to do? Like this is fucking bothering me. What if the dude had a bigger tongue or its not something I can learn and make up for? I just feel so deflated and jealous and frustrated. She wants me to forget it and stop beating myself up but I fucking can't.

I know him since two years ago and he never has been successful with girls. Something that drives him “crazy”.  

He asked me for sex and I told him no one year ago. I thought it was something punctual but he asked again this year. Also he always has been very obsessive towards my girl friends. I don’t know for which reason but he thinks just for them being my friends they’ll like him. 

He’s always has been trying to set up a date with them. Like for example: Tell X to meet up with you and I can go too. VERY VERY annoying with this. He even asked me this when I began university and I explained him I met a new girl THREE DAYS AGO.
Another example is that in this summer I insisted him so much to go the beach. There was no problem just going the two of but us he always put excuses. However one day he told me to go with some  friends of his and bring X friend of mine. His only interest was my friend

In this summer we were in some park and out nowhere he says: 

-There’s no hot girls here. 

I try to take it nice. And I say: I am hot girl.

And he repeats the same again. 

There’s no reason saying something like that when we are in the park. The comment would have made more sense in a disco or a swimming pool.

In his birthday I brought a friend of mine otherwise I wouldn’t have gone because it’s not nice to be the only girl. He already knew about her and I told him she had boyfriend since three years ago. In the disco he began to grab her around her waist and put his hand on her shoulders. She felt very uncomfortable. 

I told him about how tired I was about this obsession with my friends and he relaxed but I still feel resentful.

I just found out from a trusted mutual friend that he’s been dating this other girl for a few months now and she probably has no idea about me. He did not tell me about her and he is aware that I am not the type of person to be comfortable having sex with someone who is having sex with other people.

She goes out every now and again and every time she’s out she leaves me from the moment she goes out and I’m left wondering if she’s even home safe or not.

Last night she went out with her mum and a friend. I’m glad she went out to enjoy herself. Didn’t get any messages for 3 hours, not letting me know she’s okay or if she’s having a good time. I wake up at 1am and phone her and text her a few times to ask if she’s okay and whether she’s home yet. I ended up messaging the mum as it was now 2am, the mum replied and said that they had a good night and are now at home about to sleep. I’m still phoning and texting my girlfriend as I’d like to know her where abouts. Having her mum on Snapchat, they are not in fact home but rather out still. 

They saw my texts and phone calls and thought the best way to settle me was to lie about their location. The mum and the daughter lying to the boyfriend about their location at 1:30am is worrying.

I never had a problem with her going out at all and trusted her every move. But lying about their where abouts is worrying me as that’s not normal?

556,"Just for some reference, my boyfriend is Iraqi and I’m Lebanese and we’ve been together for a year. We love each other a lot, and his parents like me. But at first they weren’t sure of me because I wasn’t Iraqi but now they like me and have gotten over it.

His extended family on the other hand isn’t able to get over it. I know maybe you think that extended family isn’t as important but in Middle Eastern culture it is.

It’s not the guys in his family that have a problem with me, it’s the women. I met some of them a while ago and they really picked me apart and would look me up and down and judge me a lot. They’d talk about me in the Assyrian language (which is different from Arabic so I don’t speak Assyrian but I can piece a couple words together) and they were saying that I shouldn’t be at my boyfriends house and that I wasn’t good enough. Without even talking to me at all. My boyfriend was there but wasn’t much of a help and he told me that’s just how the women in his family are and that he doesn’t want it to be an issue and that it’s wrong but he’s hoping I’d go along with it?? Which is stupid. Because they’d single me out.

When I’m not around, they ask him questions like if I actually cook or clean for him. If I’m good enough. They don’t even give me a chance by talking to me. 

My boyfriend invited me to his house for New Years where his family will be but this time there’ll be more of them. He told me “not everyone is going to like you when you walk in and they’ll stare at you a lot and you just kinda gotta go with it. They’ll probably not want you there and they’ll make it very obvious. But it’s just because they’re Iraqi and that’s how it is.”

So I turned to him and am like “no it’s not because they’re Iraqi. I’ve met lots of nice Iraqi families. It’s because the women in your family are mean. That’s why.” And he got kinda quiet and told me he wants me to be apathetic about it and doesn’t want his family to be the one to cause problems.

I don’t even want to go on New Years. But I love my boyfriend, so I want to go for him. Any advice on what to do?",29Dec2019,1
557,"So, I'm in a shitty place mentally. I have been for a long time but currently it's being worse. I also know my overall mental state is most likely making me not see things clearly, or blow it out of proportion. 

So I'm asking for an outsider's point of view and advice.

From the top, I have a tough time making friends since I don't work and I have issues with trust. My family are the ones closest to me, in particular my sister. 

I used to live in a town about an hour away so the only contact she and I really had was over phone. Mainly me letting her talk at me since I don't have a lot to share. Not a lot happen in my life and if I do share something with her, she has no clue how to respond to me. Still, she makes me happy, I like feeling needed in that emotional way since I can't do much physically. I am not handicapped, just have a lot of issues with energy and I don't have a driver's license so it's not like I can drive her anywhere. She does have a driver's license and a car. She is fully capable of an independent life, whereas I am not as much.

I moved down to a town closer to my family, and then into the same village as them - mostly because the apartment I had was awful and the one I am living in now is a dream. But my family (mom and sister) did not let me forget about them helping me move for a long time. They have very often, very aggressively, told me how depressed they feel, overwhelmed, stressed. And I have tried to validate their feelings, ask if I can do anything. And the main thing I can do except be an emotional support is help with lending, either my sister or my brother, money. My brother loaned a large sum, which he's currently paying off and my sister has a small loan of about 800 dollars. I have only brought up the fact that she has borrowed money from me once, it was months ago and I don't remember what the argument was about but as usual I guess it was about me being a burden. 

I don't ask for help with cleaning, I have home assistance. I don't need help with buying food since I have a store nearby but I do need help with buying kitty litter. And I also enjoy spending time with her and actually buy food at larger stores to save money and shop in other stores (similar to walmart or target or dollar stores, I don't live in the US though but I guess most people will recognize those names). 

This new year she's hosting a small party. Just her partner's family, our cousin and her partner and me. I felt off about the party since she spoke to me on the phone about how we would all have to pay equally as much for the food, so it wouldn't be unfair. Thing is, I had a gastric sleeve a few months ago and I eat about a fifth as much as a normal person. I said I was fine with paying but it would be nice to just get a little leftovers with me home. She told me she can't promise that since she doesn't know how much people will eat. It's not the money that's the problem it just... Irks me. What would happen if I hadn't had the surgery? It's irrational, sorry. I asked her if I could come with them to the store to shop and if we could get kitty litter at the same time (this was over messenger) and she wrote back that we'll see. The day after I asked her if we could see the new frozen movie together, and I would pay. She didn't respond until late that evening saying sorry for not responding since she has been super stressed about the new year's party. So I told her ok and asked if we could go to the store to shop in the coming days for the kitty litter and things needed for the party. She said they had already been that day, and that next time we get kitty litter I better get 20 cases of them. 4 cases lasts me a month. 

I asked her about why getting so many and she said it was troublesome always taking me to get kitty litter, how it's troublesome going from never having to help me to always having to help me - since I moved down. How zero to everything is troublesome. I told her I would understand this better if I was asking her to do go out of her way for me, but she has six cats herself, she needs kitty litter too. I also said that now I know and would stop asking. She then accused me of guilt tripping her just because she finds it troublesome to be in the store with others she has to wait for 'or something like that'. I responded with that being guilt tripping right back and she told me to stop pitying myself. 

Today I told her I'm not feeling the party and won't be going and she sent me the money back, with a smile emoji added. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the advice is... How should I be handling this? I can't stop thinking about it. Is the load on her and the rest of my family greater than the load on me is when it comes to them? 

Am I overthinking everything? Am I a piece of shit? How should I feel? What should I do? The only thing I can think of is never asking for any help again and try to find a decent and decently priced kitty litter at my local store. Is that the solution?",29Dec2019,1

About a month ago, I arrived to my crappy food service job one morning to discover that I had been CPR/AED certified by my manager, without my knowledge or consent. She “took the test for me”- clearly this isn’t/cannot be legal. I was very uncomfortable with this, because I don’t actually know/didn’t take the certification course. At the time I was kind of unable to decline or fight back about this, as I was relying on her to schedule me adequately and she’s the type who might cut my hours for something like pointing out my discomfort. Now I don’t need this job, and I want to report this to someone to make sure it doesn’t happen again- should I go to the certifying body, the NationalCPRFoundation, or higher management in the company, or both? What do y’all think?
I don’t take food/public safety lightly, very bothered by this.",29Dec2019,1

560,"Okay so.. I’m 13. I normally go to church with my parents and I don’t like it. I’ve tried multiple times to tell them and the timing is never right as I have school or they have work or I’m playing sports or whatever.

Throughout this year, I’ve sat down and thought for a really long time about this. I feel if I say anything i’ll disappoint them (well obviously) but after I don’t know what i’ll do. I’m still kind of young so i’ve just been debating whether or not to fake it until I’m actually old enough to move out and start my own life or just come clean and say it. I feel if i don’t say anything I would’ve been lying to them for... basically my whole life about my beliefs and it’s really nagging at me.


Any advice at all would really help.

561,"For the holiday season the small office I worked in had us working extremely long hours without any days off, in pretty close quarters, and by the end of this several of us have gotten sick. I personally missed two days from the flu, another person was pretty clearly coming down with it as well, and two of the bosses were also sick. This leaves us with nearly 30% of staff and management with the flu or something similar. We have nothing in place for sanitizing things like keyboards, phones, door handles, or anything that several people have to touch throughout the day. My boss also frequently brings in his kids (who are old enough to be unsupervised tbh, I was a latchkey kid when I was younger than them) and two of them ended up with the flu before anyone else got sick, so it's pretty clear we all caught it from them.

We're going to have a group meeting to talk about the holiday season and I want to bring up how they created perfect conditions for people to get sick, all the while telling us we should only call in sick if we absolutely have to and making a big deal out of people calling in. I'm not sure how to do this without getting reprimanded. There's a culture of ""we're a family"" that I find they use to shut down criticisms/discontent. This was my first holiday season with this job so I don't know if this many people getting sick is normal but I'm VERY concerned about how things went this holiday season and the fact that I caught the flu from someone who shouldn't have even been in the office.",29Dec2019,1

563,"I’ve been hanging out with a guy at my hostel (there’s like 30-40 ppl living here, ages 19-60) and I’m starting to feel like it’s more than a hostel fling. Of course people get cozy with other people here and you get to know a few certain people really well, it happens all the time. He will be leaving in 3 weeks to a different city and I’ll be getting out of here to an undecided place within the next 3-8 weeks, so I do want to talk about it before he leaves. I don’t know if he’s planning on talking about it since it’s so far away yet still but I thought I might as well start thinking about what I want to say so if the times ever right I can bring it up! 

Facts:
We started as friends, i actually hired him at the hostel like 6/8 weeks ago. I feel like we can be goofy around each other. We talk about a lot of things, tell stories, haven’t gotten to anything deep and tortured yet lol... 

We hook up regularly. Have sex regularly is more like it, it’s definitely not just hooking up. 
(Tonight I got weird and almost started crying during sex. I don’t know why that happens but I think it’s happened to almost everyone at some point. The sex was off tonight and I think because it was kinda unexpected by both of us and we were doing it just because we could. not because we were really really into it)

Once we were joking about how he was just using me for my private room at first and my big bed, and now since I don’t have those things I asked “yeah then what happened?” And he answered “I just got used to you”. It kinda stung idkkkk why 

We do PDA, initiated by both of us. 

He’s a chef and really into cooking for me. We regularly do dinner and beers then some other fun activity. I cooked for him tonight and it was delicious, so I think it kinda impressed him 

Being honest, I might come off as being really into him. And I am into him, I think he’s super cool and awesome to be around, I think he feels the same about me and it does seem like he likes me so I’m probably just overthinking it. 

I spent the night in his bed last night and left an “xoxo” note on his shirt he lent me to sleep him since he was gone when I got up. Seemed normal to me at the time but I hope it didn’t freak him out 


I don’t know guys. I’m not worried about the talk because if the outcome is just being friends. I’m not too crazily attached or know enough about him to be crazily heartbroken, but I would be bummed. I like the dude, I think he likes me, but this travelers lifestyle isn’t really made for relationships. I guess I just want to know how to talk to a man about something like this without scaring him or making it seem like I’m in love with him, because I don’t know my feelings or the outcome either.

I try to help out as much as I can by cleaning, doing farm chores and driving my younger brother places but it’s not enough.

Now, he is off and I need to cover for him on almost everything as the other junior colleague is not around AND is protected by her manager a lot (ie she never covers because her manager doesn’t think it’s her role... but it’s mine right?). 

Now, I have to create a ppt, which I’ve done 98% but the other 2% is missing (one line in a table and a small breakdown table) because I didn’t know where to find the information.

I’ve done what I can do but I don’t want to attend a meeting saying things I don’t know much on. The intern’s boss, my peer, was not willing to help too.

570,"As the title says, my dad has girlfriend issues and his girlfriend is grieving.

She is used to handle herself and recently lost her mother and a sister to cancer this year. Instead of letting my dad be there for her or talking to someone, she deals with it by isolating herself and will eventually surface (or so we hope). Her daughters are allowed to stay in contact with her, but she lashed out at my dad for being around too much.

My dad's type of grieving is talking it out or discussing problems with people, and it's putting a strain on him that he is being left out by his girlfriend. He's talked to his mother, his friends and a little bit with me, but otherwise he's just quiet and on the phone all the time texting people.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's the hard part: I know his girlfriend's strategy and the pros and cons of it, because I do the same when I get overwhelmed by various family issues. I hide in my apartment and don't go outside for days, handling my issues by sitting in front of the computer instead of talking it out with someone.

Sometimes it helps, but few times this strategy can be really hurtful and this is where I stand right now with how she is dealing with her losses. I too have been too proud to ask for help or tried to spare people by isolating myself, but sometimes it's better to talked to someone before one burns out.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with my dad's girlfriend isn't really all that close and my dad hasn't noticed a similar behavior at me (I've done this for years and he's oblivious as ever, but that is not what this is about).

If I texted her and told her that it's sometimes better to reach out than to keep it in every time, will I be overstepping a boundary? Will I be hurting her or being too direct? Should I let her be until she (hopefully) gets better?

571,"Hey reddit, this is my first post ever so bear with me. I am currently a freshman in college at a school very far away from home. I struggled a lot with depression, especially feeling alone, since i was a sophomore in highschool and my parents divorced. I have always felt like i lost my best friend, my mom, despite having visited her about once a week throughout high school. I never really reached out to anyone as i didnt have many friends at the time and felt my issue wasnt big enough to see a counselor. I sort of came out of this depression towards the end of highschool as I found the best group of friends I could have ever asked for. Things with my best female friend at the time advanced a lot but we never put a label on it because of our new distance now that i moved away. we always kept in touch and i felt we were just as strong as ever, even when i visited home for thanksgiving things seemed to be going great. However, winter break rolled around and I feel as though my friends from home are absent in my life now. Even my “girlfriend” has just all of a sudden stopped responding to me and has made no effort to see me over break. Its just absolutely heartbreaking to me because I dont have any close friends at college and was looking forward to reconnecting with my highschool friends more than anything in the world. At this point I just dont know what to do and feel as though Im moving ever so deeper into my depression that I previously climbed out of.

573,"Thank you for reading.

I am currently a high school English teacher. I’m 28. My dream is to become a novelist. When I started, I thought I would write in the evenings and on breaks.

There is a lot I love about teaching, but I am at the point where I feel like I can’t continue in this career any more. For about 10 months of the year I work 60 hour weeks. When I have a break (like Christmas break), and once I’ve finished grading essays, I spend time recovering (cleaning my apartment and just catching up) before I begin to feel like myself. Then I write.

But for most of the year I feel so burdened by work that all I can do when I come home is crash in front of the TV. And I really mean crash -- I fall asleep in front of the TV after eating dinner every night. This means that my initial plan of writing during the evenings has gone out the window. I’ve managed it from time to time, but it’s not sustainable. I occasionally go the gym, but that really means I have no time/energy left to write. 

There’s also another layer to why I am considering this. This past fall my uncle died of cancer (he was diagnosed in July) and then 17 days later, my younger brother died of a drug overdose. My family is struggling to cope. We were very close to my uncle (I saw him every Friday and Sunday growing up) and it has been devastating to lose my younger brother. I don’t want to go into too many more details right now.

Teaching requires a lot of emotional energy. I feel like I am never myself any more because after I get done teaching and just surviving, I have such little energy left. 

There is a major part of me that doesn’t want to give up on teaching. I’ve invested a lot of myself in it. But simultaneously, I don’t want to continue to work this hard for pretty substandard pay. More than that, I realize now how precious time is, and teaching, for the majority of the year and therefore the majority of my life, rules my time more than I do.

I am hoping it would be different in a different career. What do you all think?

Thank you.",29Dec2019,1
574,"Hello. I’m super wary in posting this as I don’t know what kind of responses I will receive, but I’m absolutely desperate for some advice, support and direction at this moment in my life. I feel absolutely alone and I truly don’t know what my next move should/could be. Trying to be strong and focus on the future is incredibly difficult when all you can feel is your heart breaking. 

We have been married for almost 3 and-a-half years. Between the two of us, we have three children, who, even though they throw down fight non-stop, really, really do love each other. The oldest two even have the same exact birthday, and were born in the same hospital! 

 I quit my job in August of 2015 to be a stay-at-home mom, because childcare is insanely expensive. With that being said, I had no income and I wasn’t building my own 401k. I was ignorant and believed I was going to be taken care of and I wouldn’t have to worry about the future.

Fast forward to this year: husband tells me I need to get a job because financially things aren’t going well. I started out part time, which was great because I was able to ease back into the work force while having children. At this point all of my kids are in school, so we aren’t paying for childcare. I now work full time, but I don’t make NEARLY enough to support myself and my kids. 

So - with kids, life and reality comes stress, right? We both tend to drink too much in the evenings which often leads to our frustrations coming out on one another. I suck at verbal communication and he’s a terrible listener. We should have sought counseling a while ago so that we could have gotten on the same wavelength. 

Now, here I am, at 35 years old - nothing to show of my own, no college degree and basically (possibly) starting completely over! How did it come to this? My kids are going to resent me for the rest of their lives. I signed a prenup so I wouldn’t be getting any sort of alimony or other financial support. 

I really, really want to try and make this work out, but it is going to take the both of us. But if it doesn’t, what do I do? I am so desperately confused and heartbroken, especially scrolling through the memories that constantly pop up on my phone. I’ve made the decision I’m going to have to move a bit of a distance away, because his family is well-known in the small community we reside. 

I just want to make this all end. I feel so hopeless 😢

Just to note: my kids’ father (to whom I was married) and I are on great terms, and he’s there for my kids and I. 

Anything, would be greatly appreciate. Thank you.

575,"My sibling has contamination OCD. He has specific rituals which require him to use the washroom for hours on end. This is causing multiple issues within the family such as huge water bills, fees to unclog the toilet every two weeks, and his general low mood has turned him into a rude, self absorbed and entitled person to the point where family members are often upset by his words and selfishness. 

I will be leaving college this summer and while I was planning on moving back to my family home this summer I feel as though I will not be able to due to difficulty. For example, if I were to have a job through summer, how can I guarantee that I will be able to prepare and freshen up before work? 

I need advice on what to do in regards to my brother and how to help him try and get help. He refused therapy and medication and generally refuses to leave the house as he would prefer not to work anyway and has no life goals.

576,"Hey,

Long time lurker here and not an native English speaker so I apologize for any mistakes. This is also a throwaway due to wanting to stay more private. Mobile user so sorry for potential bad formatting.

 I (23F) am at a bit of a loss of what I should do and I thought why not ask total strangers to give me advice. For some this might be super simple, but I have got a bit cought up in a mindset where I am unsure what to do.

Anyway here is the case. I am a student that studies a double bachelor degree in political science and economics and my biggest dream is to work in either international organizations or in diplomacy. Throughout my studies I have always been engaged in several organisations and in one of them (and the one that is relevant in this case) I have excelled in quite far and I now have an unpaid part-time job there in the national board. It is for one year and I have already worked there for 6 months and it is for a big international student organization.

I have been in it for 4 years now and I really wanted this to work out, but however the case is that I am absolutely emotionally burnt out and I am currently going to a psychologist for both depression and anxiety. I am not in a good place at all. I am also doing extra subjects at uni this semester and the workload equals to is about 1.5 years of university subjects. So I hope that by quiting this part time job I will be able to work more on my self, improve my health and building a stronger mindset and future self. But most importantly I know I would be so much happier if I took some things of my plate. But just to be clear I used to love working for this organisation and has sacrificed so much for it, so that makes it much more difficult to make a decision. Furthermore, the thing I would have wanted the most is for this to work out and for me to continue to stay there, but I personally don't think I am in a state where I am able to do so.

However I am afraid that quitting this will reduce my chances to get a job in an already competitive field. 


What's holding me back from quiting specifically:
- What should I say to my employer and team to explain to them why I want to quit? 
- I have recently applied to an internship where I have written down this experience and how will they take it if they said I quit?
- Will quitting this reduce my likelyhood of getting the jobs I want in the future? Or is this such a good opportunity for me that I should just go through it so that I can improve my chances to get the jobs I want in the future?

577,"I'm back home from university for the holidays and I live with my mom alone (with a cat). We have been through a lot of difficult times together and we're very close. However, when coming back from living on my own (with a roomate, of course), I've realized that i get very irritable with my mom. I used to get irritable with her before sometimes, but I feel like it's gotten worse ever since we moved in to a much smaller apartment.

Because the apartment is so small, the sound issue is worse. This morning was a rough one.

I was waken up by my mom loudly clanking dishes, and then not long after, yelling at the cat. My cat is quite a trouble maker, but sometimes my mom gets overly angry. Obviously dealing with a difficult cat is frustrating, I get frustrated too even though I love him. However, this morning is a prime example of how she freaks out.

I am in my bed, not able to sleep because of all the sound, when she opens my door and basically shoves the cat inside my room, telling me she cant deal with him like this anymore. Last night, she did something similar. She called out to me just as we were going to bed to ""come get my cat"" when he was getting into trouble. I told her I was in bed, and she goes, ""Fine."" And shuts the cat out of her room herself. 

It also seems that I have a lot more patience for our cat than she does, but not for my own mother. She gets irritated with me too, sometimes, but she always puts the situation back on me.

As a result, I am very tired today because she woke me up with dishes, and then barging into my room.

My mom also does this thing where she burps loudly - a lot. It sounds like a very strange thing, but it's true. This morning, after the cat incident, I was in the living room and she loudly burped. She always says the same thing: ""Sorry I burped."" Its gotten very old because it happens over and over and over. I told her to please at least close her mouth, and she always says stuff like, ""I dont want to"" or ""I'm a loud burper"", thinking shes being funny. Then, I tell her again, and she says seriously, ""Are you embarrassed by me?"" (She says this to me ALL THE TIME. And it always makes me feel so guilty!!) I told her to stop (at saying that) (because she says stuff like that all the time and I never know what to say to get her to stop putting herself down). 

Then, she told me twice to get into the shower (I was waiting for her). I snapped at her telling her i would. (She didnt give me much time to act in the first place.)
Then she told me I snap at her all the time, and that I'm irritated with her all the time. I feel so guilty but I honestly cannot help it sometimes.

Last night I also got irritable but I dont even know what for at this point.

I love my mom a lot, and when this isnt happening we usually have a good time doing things together. But its these moments that are very frustrating.

Maybe it's me, though. I'm having a very difficult time handling my irritation with her and I never know what to do when it gets to that point. Sometimes we just snap at each other and I dont even know why. On some occasions it will even resulting in one of us crying for some reason.

I don't know what is going on. I cant tell if it's me or my mom, or maybe even both of us who are the problem. I just wish I didnt get so irritated with her.

I have no idea what to do with this irritation, or how to get my mo mto stop doing some if these things without feeling like I'm hurting her.

We are both very sensitive, and she told me once that she believed I thought of her as someone who screws up/is a person who needs help/that I think she is lesser than me/etc. Nothing could be further than the truth because my mom has been through a lot, especially this year with being in her own without me when I'm away at my first year in university. She is a strong person, but she doesnt believe it. I have told her over and over and over and she still says these things. It breaks my heart.

If anyone has any advice on how I can handle my irritation, what I can do to make my mom stop some of this behavior, or litterally anything, please share.

Thank you, I hope your holidays were well.",29Dec2019,1

579,"First of all, molly dropped out of Syracuse University which is one of the best colleges in the world to go to Seattle, Washington to ""learn responsibility."" Now molly thinks it's too late to go back and is always going through minimum wage jobs just getting by, crying because molly doesn't have enough money for food and shit, in the smallest apartment I've ever seen owned by my dad. Has 4 cats, two birds, and a dog which I adore and the only thing I look forward to when molly comes to my parents house. If molly comes over for Christmas or Thanksgiving, she usually gets pissed at some dumb shit and leaves crying or just leaves as frantically as possible. Last time I remember was, that molly gave my mother a Christmas gift, on Christmas day. my mom tried to give it back to molly cause she thought she can't afford it. Molly thought my mom was doing that out of pity. Molly refuses the return of the gift and grabs her shit as fast as possible, picks up her small fuckin Lhasa apso dog who hates being picked up and almost bolts out the door. Then most recently, my dad turned off the wifi until I get a full time job or get accepted to college, molly allowed me to stay at her house for a night to play with her dog and use the wifi. Before I got there molly lied and said she doesn't have wifi cuz she didn't want me searching for symptoms about a bunch of shit and give myself a bunch of anxiety, and didn't want me to research about drugs and about the brain and shit. Eventually she gave in and let me use the wifi. Molly had rules for her apartment which is understandable, not to disrespect, and do what she says. Understood, and I followed through as best as possible. Molly wanted me to take a shower, I used the bar of soap on my entire body and shampoo once on my hair. Then morning came around, she kept saying over and over and over that I absolutely did not use the soap or shampoo because she put the soap a specific way and my hair didn't smell like shampoo. I kept telling molly that I absolutely most definitely fucking used the soap and shampoo, but no, molly kicked me out because she didn't believe me and to this day doesn't believe me that I used them that night. Molly kicked me out and drove me home, molly said I disrespected her because I lied about using the godamn soap and shampoo. There's been many more incidents more than this but can't remember. Today, molly came to my parents house with her dog, my dad told molly that I got fired for using PCP where I work, not on shift. She comes in my room and starts the conversation, ""you did PCP? How did you do it? Where did you get it?"" I told her that I bought it from a bad area down the street, this guy dipped a cigarette in a bottle of some brown-tan liquid and soaked the whole cigarette in it. I didn't tell her, but it smelled extremely strong and like some gasoline like chemical. Molly said nobody has PCP anymore, you didn't smoke PCP. Molly asked if it was embalming fluid, I said yes, that's another name for PCP.  Molly said I didn't do PCP simply because I would be arrested and tackled by police while naked. I told molly that I did feel very crazy, like I wanted to snuff somebody as hard as I could or lift a truck, even take my clothes off in the street and get myself into that situation she was talking about. I told her that I was just able to handle myself and the high quite well, she laughed in my face believing that nobody can handle the high. Molly hasn't even tried PCP. I knew this was part of her know-it-all personality and that irritated me pretty bad. Then I was in the kitchen, eating while molly was in the kitchen. My mom said I should stop taking my medications and only take the B complex vitamin. I told her that gives me an even more unhealthy appetite. Then my mom asked why I eat a little bit here and there, I told her there's something wrong with my stomach or something because I get full very quickly from extremely little food. I said I get full, but I'm still always very hungry. Molly laughed again, saying ""that and I make no sense."" she made me very irritated and I asked her a question with in her perspective, with a lot of attitude. I asked ""so you don't stop getting hungry when youre full?"" This lead to molly getting pissed again and leaving, before molly left, I asked her to just please answer the question, ""so you stay hungry when you're full?"" Molly said that she eats because the food tastes good. I told molly that means she's overeating, she says ""Ha, you don't think all this fat is from overeating??"" I told her that you're not supposed to overeat. She says ""ok doctor"" I got even more irritated because she's such a know-it-all, and truly believes that I think I know everything about life and stuff. When really, I know more useful real information than she thinks, I just have a bad memory, but when it comes to certain topics and conversations I'm able to recite a lot of real useful info. She thinks you shouldn't trust everything on the internet, but really, you can if you know where to look. I knew I was actually helping here when I told her you're not supposed to overeat, I was giving potentially life saving info by saying that because overeating can lead to long term high blood pressure and more likely of a heart attack/stroke. I didn't tell her this, and she didn't care about what I was saying anyways but after she told me ""ok doctor"" and was about to leave, I did that shoo hand motion while saying fuck off to her, she walks over to me saying ""YOU TELL ME TO FUCK OFF"" and grabs my face, squeezes it and pushes it back, I pushed her away and went to my room and locked the door because I was afraid I was about to punch her in her fat fucking throat.

My gf and I broke up on good terms about two months ago bc of arguing and long distance btwn us with her going to a different uni next year. While dating, my roommate, my gf, and I were all close and hung out when we could, but mainly it was my ex and I. Since we’ve been back for winter break from uni, my roommate has been inviting her to parties at his house and such bc they’re friends, but not me. My ex and I still communicate regularly bc were friends, and we still hook up as well. She admits she finds it weird, but she enjoys drinking and stuff at his house bc of the other people he invites, and overall everyone just has a fun time so I don’t blame her. I know for a fact that there is nothing going on btwn them, bc she has literally zero interest in him and he flirts with other girls when they are there. 

Essentially I’m just asking for advice on what to do here. Y’all would probably assume there is something btwn them and I can assure you that it is not the case. I get bothered by my roommate inviting her and not me, and he lies like he’s not doing anything that night but will invite people over. It feels like I did something wrong to him, but idk what I could’ve done to mess up a friendship. Not like he should be picking sides, but I feel like if he were to pick a side it should’ve been with me, as I’m his friend and have known him for longer and he met her through me if that makes sense.

Something simple that escalated to unrivaled punishments. I should feel lucky I got away as I did.
Please, let me explain what went down.
My family and I were eating (well, the food hadn’t even arrived yet) dinner. I ordered a lemonade for myself. Please note at the time my sister didn’t even want one, openly denying the privilege to have one. Once mine arrived she burst into tears crying about how she wanted one. You’ve probably been in this situation before. I was eventually persuaded into giving her some of mine, note that there really not much in the first place, but she keeps crying. I poured the rest into my cup. End of story. I didn’t really see the problem considering my dad repeatedly said that we could always get another one. I wasn't trying to be mean. I wasn't trying to be selfish. My parents, especially my dad, started laying it on hella thick. Selfish, etc etc was used as I tried to explain my self. My dad stood up, and gave me “chances” to talk to him out side. He didn’t even count. He said nothing but that he wanted me up and our of my seat. People were watching. Had we not been out side he would have started hitting me, in worse case. No, I man not looking for pity, this is just the type of man he sometimes is. I was quite angry. I didn’t want to get up. I wanted to explain my self. There is another one coming! I said. I don’t want to share anymore so we don’t have to work on distributing it evenly! 
I got kicked. Oof.
Now I am back in the hotel room writing.
Normally this would be no biggie for me, but I’m sick and tired of getting pushed around like this. The friends at my compound even say they think he is a bully, a on off one. You know, one second volunteering to get you ice cream, next bringing your neck up against a wall because he can’t keep his rage down. I know I could have it so so much worse, but Im frustrated and want to know how to get back at him. He makes me feel terrible each day. I seriously hate it.

His personal situation now seems to be heavily affected by a state close to depression, probably triggered by a few other things that happened in his life at the same time.

He is turning 21 soon, hardly leaves his room because he feels too much pressure by his folks. He feels like is failing whenever he give things a try, while his employers are generally positive. This leaves him more and more hopeless and socially isolated, living in a small city away from his old friends, just with his father. His motivation and his intellectual capacities are certainly there, but there is too much undefined pain and darkness for him to just move on and try stuff out.

He wants to pursue a career in computer science / programming, but in his current state he probably does not have enough emotional resources to push himself through the hardships of a college education.

I just started talking to a therapist last year when I had been asking my mom for one since I was 15, that I’ve needed help for a long time. I was diagnosed with Chronic Depressive Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, both of which sure do accommodate me. I love my mom, but I feel like there is a fake silver lining here that I’ve curtained for a long time to say she is an outstanding parent. 
Given my mom provided me a house and shelter, a car for my 16th birthday, and pressed me for school, I don’t feel like that’s ever been enough, but anything I’ve done I’ve never felt like it was enough for her. 
When I was 8, I was blamed for my sister getting out of the house and walking several blocks away when she was just 3 years old. 
At 12, I was told how my real father really passed away after suffering from a bad and first relationship breakup.
At 13, I became very depressed throughout my high school years. Later, my drunk step-dad who has been around since I was 3 months old asked my mom why he should take care of me, because I’m not his real kid. 
At 17, I won the highest achievement award in high school for band that is only given to one senior, and I still felt like it wasn’t enough. 
At 19, I won $500 and was on the news for my artwork. 
At 19, I was also kicked out my house and had my car taken away (for not paying a $45 cable bill), and with no help from my mom, I failed one of my classes for not being able to find a ride and show up to school. 
At 19, I was sexually assaulted by two close friends, a guy and a girl. I never told my mom out of fear that I would hear the wrong answer. 

My mom has been there for everything like my band concerts, graduations, awards. 
I am a great artist, I don’t know how to show it. 
My social skills are probably sub-par, I don’t know how to interact very well with people. I have a very amazing and awesome boyfriend, who I’m thankful for. 
I feel like anything I do isn’t enough for her, even getting an associates degree from my college in May or being on the Deans List for having a 3.7 GPA. I’m so stressed out.

&amp;#x200B;

I (F 30) recently started dating a guy. He's great, we get along well and I like him. However, last week he told me that he smokes weed. I'm sober, I don't drink and I don't do drugs, and truth to be told I've never understood any of it (perhaps that makes me stuck up and boring but so be it then, it's who I am). I know weed isn't a heavy drug or anything, but it's illegal in my country. I've got other friends who does it as well, it doesn't bother me much. But dating someone is another thing, and the truth is that this does bother me. 

He seems really chill about it and even told me that he won't do it in my presence, but still a million ""what if's"" popped up in my mind ( I'm a worried person, I overthink and that is something I need to deal with, I know). I know weed isn't considered to have many bad side effects, but I can't help thinking about them anyway. I know I can't ask him not to do it, it's his choise and I've got no buisness meddling.

I’ve been in this industry for roughly 15 years and in management for about 7 of those years. I used to wake up every morning loving what I do. Now I’m filled with anxiety 24/7 and I dread my job. 

Staffing is a nightmare and has been for about a year and a half. I’m restricted in what I can offer to pay people by the franchise owners which limits the quality of employees I can hire. My staff doesn’t care about their job. They don’t put any effort in. Half the time they don’t show up. Even brand new hires don’t make it in the door half the time before their first day. I don’t know how to get around this. Yes, I could fire people, but if I don’t have staff, I can’t take dogs, which means I can’t make money, which means I’ll lose my job. I don’t know how to teach people to give a shit, especially if they’re not making a living wage. I haven’t had solid management support since this facility opened in 2017. It’s been basically me trying to run every facet of my business every single day of the week. I can’t focus on training people myself because I have to handle customers. I can’t focus on customers because I need to train people. I have my boss breathing down my neck about labor but the fact is I have an entirely new staff and I can’t afford to cut corners in training, which I already feel forced to do by my boss. I feel pressure to take dogs who are a risk in this environment to both other dogs and my staff, because my boss is so afraid of negative reviews. I just feel like I can’t do anything right and I’m in over my head. I feel like I’m drowning.

This year I enrolled back in school and am taking classes while juggling 45-55hr work weeks and dealing with deteriorating mental health. My salary is what keeps me where I am and the fact that I have health insurance. It’s shitty health insurance but it’s better than nothing. 

My grandfather just passed and I did not take time away from work to properly grieve. I currently have bronchitis but feel like I have to keep going in because staffing is so rough right now I don’t have a choice. 

I sent my resume around last night to several places and am hoping to find a way out but I haven’t had any luck in the past when I’ve job hunted. If I do find something, it will likely come with a 50% income cut. I’m afraid of how that will affect my finances that I’ve worked so hard to improve over the last few years. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to afford school because I’m nearing the cap in federal financial aid. 

I can’t live like this though. I feel like I’m two feet away from a mental breakdown. I don’t know what to do. I just got engaged and I’m afraid I’m going to let down my fiancé if I leave my job to take something that pays considerably less. I’m afraid of moving backwards at 33 years old instead of forward.

608,"Brief backstory: My sisters and I have known him all our lives. He was a good friend of our father's when they were teens--we've always called him 'Uncle' and his kids were like cousins (most every holiday, birthday, etc. spent together). Our parents divorced when we were teens ourselves. Our mother married 'uncle' after his wife died, when they were in their early 60's. It was a challenge to call him something other than 'uncle' but we always loved him so that wasn't an issue. We settled on 'papa' and have called him that for over 20 years now. We also love our father, our Dad, and he has always been a major part of our lives, like an integral part. There is no animosity between our Dad and our Papa, they remain friends, though distant. They give each other Christmas cards and see each other at family weddings, etc. So...on Christmas Day, this year, completely out of the blue, we received an email from Papa that I'll paste at the end of this. With no warning, no indication that anything was amiss. We had just spent 4 days with him and our Mom. Made them breakfast on Christmas eve morning, he took us to the airport as we were leaving to spend the rest of the holiday with our Dad, as usual, as we've been doing for over 20 years, although the first time we've spent Christmas Eve with our Dad since our folks got divorced nearly 40 years ago. Our Mom's side of the family celebrated Christmas a couple days early this year. Also, our Mom developed dementia over the past 10 years and cannot be consulted about any of this. She's very loving but has no short or much long term memory. My sisters and I are at a loss how to respond to this, but mostly feeling angry for Papa's lack of consideration and backbone. Why not just explain his feelings when were with him? This is, as I said, completely out of the blue for us (addressed to my sisters and I only, not our 5 step-siblings): Title of the email was ""Who I Am"" -- I'm the husband of your mother, a woman I deeply care for and cherish. I'm weary of being called pop or papa, I no longer feel like either. I have five children that call me dad and that is fine with me.

I just got engaged to a wonderful man about four days ago. I know this will sound strange, but it bothers me that he hasn't changed his status to ""engaged"".

He has announced it to all his close friends at the party...but When I asked if he was going to announce it on Facebook, he said that that ""girls normally do that"".

So back to the story  I decided to send a random text to the group chat  that said “frick the flowers” and in another text “ToMmY dOnT f**k ThE fLoWeRs” exactly like that and I would send random things time to time like TikTok Tok thought we’re funny and gay 3 said TikTok is dumb and I messaged back ok but besides that guy 3 blew up after I sent that and messaged back “NOBODY F***ING CARES” “WHY” “JUST WHY”  I asked him why he did that and why everything I do offends him  and he said “because it’s random  and for no reason”  fast forward some bickering  and I said “Why tho were friends who should be able to joke around and not be forced to talk a curtain way or text a curtain way just how ever we want to” and then they had problems with me sending “lol” “ok” “oof” “yeet” a lot because my old friend group texted like that but we all had a falling out. But they started all saying that and then guy 3 said “let’s all just go to the other chat guys”  and guy 4 responds with “good idea” and guy 3 sends a gif saying bye. After that I got a message from guy 2  saying “that was all guy 3” and I said “ i know but why did everyone else play along” and he said “don’t ask me” so I decided to text guy 4 and ask why he played along with guy 3.  Then he said it was a joke and followed up with “you sending random stuff makes you look dumb that’s all” and their I said “everything’s a joke ig” and he said “(my name), we are high school boys your playing with fire.”  Then I asked how and he said “Because it’s kinda weird that a bunch of highschool dudes have one chick in there friend group ya know. That likes girls” then I said “I don’t even know if I like girls and does any one else in the group have a problem with me and it shouldn’t matter my gender it should matter on the friendship if you actually cared abt our friendship” then he said sucks to suck. Then I asked why are u being like this and he replied with “ because I’m curious why u gotta say stuff like that in the chat of course your gonna get dunked on for saying that stuff it’s dumb.” At that I point I was already crying and felt worthless so I messaged him “I just don’t understand why your getting sensitive over a dumb thing I said in the chat or any chats bc it’s dumb that ur getting pressed over words. And I am dumb I feel dumb everyday and even right now I feel like a dumb good for nothing but making her friends annoyed all the time.” Then after that he said “I’m not being sensitive. In fact I speak for all of us when we say that it’s old and annoying. You do it all the time and it makes you look dumb.”  After that I said “I’m sorry I don’t know what to do to make you guys happy all the time like I said I’m a dumb good for nothing who is just a waste of space and time”  then he said that not true just don’t send dumb things  and then repeat of me asking why I can’t send what I want and he said “Do what you want but we are just saying it’s annoying and this is why people argue with you because it stupid and nobody cares sorry it’s the truth.” And I said “no one cares  but I just send stuff like u guys do and no complains when u guys do it.” And he said “cause it’s weird” (Note: I just sent like tik toks from time to time) then I said so you guys can make jokes but I can’t and he said “saying random stuff in a group chat isn’t funny it’s annoying. Then I sent this “I’m sorry I’m annoying I try not to be but everything I do is annoying to u guys so I’m sorry I’ll just stop” and he hasn’t responded since then.  Please give me advice this happened yesterday and has left me very depressed :(",29Dec2019,1

in the time that i’ve known her, i’ve realized she has a tendency to ditch me to do something better.

-she ditched me while i was tripping on shrooms, causing me to have a terrible trip because i was alone and almost kill myself

i’m conflicted because she’s basically the only person i know in this new city, and i have terrible social anxiety so meeting new people is hard for me.

My sister had married this psychopath (yes, he in fact did many questionable things, which are too complicated to explain) and divorced him, after he threw her and their 1 year old son out on the streets. My nephew is now being raised my sister and her new boyfriend, but still has to visit his father, because of law and everything. My nephew does not want to visit his father, as it is always ""way too boring"" etc., but because he is so young he can not decide on whether or not he wants to visit him, so he is kinda forced by law. 

Even though his father is really crazy (stalking my sister, abusing his position as a police-man, coming home with guns etc.), I personally would not think that he would ever go that far to molest my nephew and his son. He simply does not care about his child at all, thus I don't think he abuses my nephew. But after I just played with my nephew a little bit, I noticed some weird behaviours. We kind of fought together, like how you would fight with a 3 year old in a playful way, and he always tried to lay on my face, with his croch on my mouth area.

639,"Hey! 

Need some advice about how to handle this situation. In June 2018 my (23F) boyfriend passed away from cancer. After 18ish months of keeping myself to myself, I feel ready to date again. 

In October I had a brief friends-with-benefits fling with a guy. I live with my parents and am an only child - so my parents hone in on me a little, especially my mum, so she was asking me where i was going in the evenings a couple of times a week. Initially I lied, but when I (mistakenly) thought me and this person were moving towards a relationship I told her that I was ‘seeing’ someone. She LOVED my boyfriend that passed but at 23 she can’t expect me to be alone forever. She reacted badly. She cried cos it’s ‘so horrible’ - not be being horrible by dating again but the whole situation. I get that - I will always love my boyfriend that passed but nothing can bring him back and I am lonely and would like companionship. 

This guy and me didn’t work out which is fine, I also lost my job, and I’ve had a bit of mental distress since. I have struggled with mental illness for years and i’ve been acting out a little lately. An old friend of mine that i’ve known for 10 years, and who is very similar to me in sense of humour, taste in music etc has been really there for me during this time. We’ve been hanging out a lot and he confessed that he had feelings for me and I have similar returning feelings. He’s lovely - makes me feel desired, respected and like i’m worth something again. 

My issue is, i’m very worried about telling my mum about this one for fear of how she’ll react. I’m also scared because it’s likely we’ll get serious and will have to ‘go public’ which terrifies me as to how people will react. ‘My side’ of friends will be fine. ‘His side’ will also probably be fine. I’m scared that my boyfriend who passed’s family will hate me too. I know rationally they won’t hate me but we have such a good relationship that I don’t want to ruin. 

I am young, and I deserve to be happy. I will love my boyfriend that died for the rest of my life, but if the roles were reversed I’d want him to give the wonderful love he gave to me to another person. I just don’t want people to think i’m forgetting about my boyfriend. I’ll never forget him.

I told one professor EVERYTHING that had ever bothered and hurt me, drug addiction, deaths, abuse, back stabbing, suicide attempts and more. He was very kind and supportive and took me under a sort of protection at the college that stays valid if I keep showing up and work.

Later i got a therapist but he doesn't really help with the drugs, only problems that need my drug addiction to cease existing. One of my biggest other problems is I don't eat enough, 45 kilos/ 99 lbs and 167 CM/ around 5'7.

How do I start training myself to knock on these doors fearlessly? How do I fight this anxiety and get comfortable with this concept?

653,"A couple months ago I found out I have a very serious illness. My friend knows this and cares a lot about me and wants to be kept informed. Last week the doctor told me there might not be a way to cure it and I might die from it. I want to tell my friend in person before she hears it from anyone else or online (because my mom posts updates to our friends) but she got in trouble and is currently grounded. I feel this news is too serious to really be shared in a text or over the phone which is why I want to meet her in person. Her mom might let me talk to her if I just show up and tell her it’s important but I’m also not sure if that would be overstepping or not to say “hey I know you’re daughter is grounded but I would really like to talk to her, trust me it’s important”.",29Dec2019,1
654,"Hey redditors. I made an anonymous account just for this. Today, my mom told me that she can't handle my dad anymore, and that she probably wants to get a divorce. I think it's a good thing because I don't want her to live with my dad either.

Background situation: my dad is an alcoholic that has been retired for 4 years. He is in is mid 60s. He has been drinking for over 40 years, with sober periods in between. He usually drinks for a week straight before getting sick, then he's sick for 2-3 days and sober for 1-2 weeks. His sober times are the worst, because he gets incredibly irritable. He shouts at us all the time. Hw constantly brags about how much money he has, which I think is disgusting.

I'm 27 and just graduated. I'll start work in a few days, but I still live at home. I am incredibly scared that my dad is going to kill me and my mom once she reveals she wants a divorce. My mom is not scared of him because he has never been physically violent towards any of us. Verbally abusive, yes, but never physically. I just don't know what to think of that. My brother is in his 30 and has long moved out, so there are no other children in the picture.",29Dec2019,1

I am an 18 year old female who is a late bloomer in pretty much anything, especially the social stuff. I have never been in a relationship or kissed anyone. 


This has never bothered me up until a couple years ago, because I’ve never been “in love” and very rarely had crushes on anyone and so I didn’t think much of it. 


Junior year of highschool (I graduated this year) I started actually making some friends/deeper connections with people as opposed to just having acquaintances and then i started thinking about how little experience I have. 


When my friends tell me about how they started dating the guy they liked I’m always happy and excited for them, genuinely so but there was always that part of me that felt insecure about not knowing exactly what it feels like.


and lately, when my friend tells me about the guy she’s in love with and how happy he makes her feel, instead of feeling happy for her with a little pang of “longing” like every time, all i felt was sadness. Ofc i didnt show this to her. 

Why can’t i just genuinely be happy for her anymore? how do I stop making everything about me?",29Dec2019,1

I've noticed  every since I've been in the relationship for the past 10 months my relationship goals hasn't been met and  i can't help but feel like I'm settling for less sometimes. For example  (even though this is true) I wanted to be there with my girlfriend for new years eve to see the countdown with her and celebrate but instead because she has strict parents and won't talk them she's just gonna do her family tradition every year where she goes to a family member house and spend a night and I just wanted to celebrate with her just like the 4th of July which also didn't happen. In addition to that there are times where we have to stand outside  and wait for her parents to come back if they're gone because the only way I can come in is if one of her  parents are there or if one of her siblings stays(And this issue has gotten worse overtime especially when we go on dates and come back only to either wait or I have to go home thus killing the mood) and lastly it seems like my girlfriend doesn't listen to me at certain times,isn't always in the mood for intimacy and communication in person and  over the phone seems like a obstacle every time: like last week her iPhone got permanently disabled because she forgot the passcode and now she hasn't schedule a appointment yet and the only way we can talk is on one of my old phones and I can barley hear her even then

P.s and I forgot to mention we don't get a lot of  privacy because her parents are always around or her siblings keep bothering us and both are 11 and 12",29Dec2019,1
664,"I just caught my sister today sneakily getting money from my mom's bag. She didnt know I was in the room. She did the action so fast enough to be suspicious, and the fact that I felt her panic when she saw me. I could see in her body language. She tried to play it off and asked an irrelevant question just to get my attention away.  Later, I saw the bill in her drawer of clothes, poorly hidden. The whole time I didn't say anything, but it's hard to register what she did. I wondered how often she has done it as it finally made sense everytime I wonder where she gets the money to buy those expensive stuff online. She'd justify it by saving, but our allowances just wasn't enough for that. 
I'm wondering if should tell my mother tomorrow. 
She's already 19, old enough to know what's wrong. I'm one year older. We never had a close relationship. It's either we're fighting or ignoring each other. She's a total b**** to my parents in general, but acts like a baby (like woo them, being all nice and cuddly) if she wants something. My parents would fall for her manipulative tactics anyway. She's unsympathetic, selfish and lazy. Said those to show what kind of person she is.
I know what I just said might make you say I should definitely tell my mom, but I know the aftermath. I don't think I want it. If I do this, my relationship with my sis will forever be unrepairable and her relationship with my parents would be destroyed. Once papa will find out, there's a high chance he'll rage and throw stuff at her (he's usually very calm) New year celebration will prob not happen too. The tension in the house will be unbearable. and I don't know how that'll last. Also, I'm pretty sure my sister is suicidal or at least depressed. I know what she did was wrong and the right thing to do here is tell my mother, but I'm not a Saint and I don't think I want that aftermath as I write it. But I don't know.

I need advice to know whether I should invest my money on university or an apartment.

If I choose to save for an apartment and I do not exactly pursue the career or major I want, by the time I am 30 years old I will have my apartment, yes, but I will be old to pursue the career I wanted.

However due to failing classes both last semester and this semester I still have 21 credits before I can graduate. This can be accomplished in the spring 2020 semester, but it won't be easy. The circumstances that led me to were I am now is maybe depression, but I don't really think I'm able to be diagnosed.

When I was getting married, dresses were picked and fitted 6 months before, which puts it in February (I'llbe 8 months along by then). There are so many things involved with planning a wedding, I'm sure this hasn't crossed her mind. She seems a little lost so I'm trying to help her the best I can.

I'm not entirely sure why I'm in the party to begin with. We're not that close. The only thing I can think of is the she was in mine when I married her brother (who is a groomsman), and she wants our 3 year old to be the flower girl. She's already said that the bridesmaid to groomsman ratio is way off, so I'm thinking of politely declining (I feel kinda bad about this since I already accepted).

After exchanging some messages my GF discovered that she wanted to do things differently and kinda just stopped talking to them to focus on other ways to sell her content. ""The sole project"" seemed to get frustrated with this even though my GF never made any formal commitments nor been paid by them, eventually they just blocked her. 
We both thought that would be the end of it until yesterday morning when they unblocked her and sent her screenshots of the exact address the pictures they had access to had been taken, our home. As you can expect this came off a little threatening.
She turned off all location based services on her phone after receiving this message. 

How can we make sure that it's impossible for anyone else to pull this info from pictures?

680,"Me (20F) and my best friend (21M) have known each other since middle school. We have that kind of friendship where we don’t have to talk to each other all the time to maintain our friendship and we often go days or sometimes even full weeks without talking. But we’re both each other’s best friend. And we’ve even discussed moving in together. I recently (a few months ago) broke up with my long term boyfriend of a year. And just a couple days after that my friend asked me if I wanted to start a casual friends with benefits relationship. I immediately said no and that I wasn’t attracted to him like that. He said “ok just forget I asked” and things haven’t been weird. But I was also in another city for the semester going to school. I just moved back this last week and he asked me to come hang out with him and watch some movies, which is a pretty normal hangout for us. When I get over there he says he’s going to go shower. I hadn’t seen him in person really since he asked to be FWB so I was cautious and said “haha don’t forget to bring a change of clothes with you in there so it isn’t weird”. And nothing really happened with that. Flash forward to us drinking and watching some movies and he weirdly keeps pushing drinks on me. I’m 90lbs so I’m a hell of a lightweight and I like to monitor my drinking so I refused a lot of them. But still ended up with a drink I didn’t want poured in front of me. While we’re watching he gets a little nonsensical and gets really close to me. I chalk it up to him just having drank a little too much. Then as time went on and he should have been sobering up he only got handsier. I kept having to move his hands and take them off of my thigh, waist, shoulder, ect. He mentions I smell good and I respond in a monotone voice “thanks”. And he’s obviously not getting the memo. The first movie ends and I tell him I think I should go home and he’s like “what??? It’s not even that late. Here drink your drink, it’ll wake you up”. I say no but he’s being insist on me staying around and hanging out. I wanted to give him benefit of the doubt that he’d just missed me and didn’t want the night to end so soon so we put on a show and I tell him I’ll leave after one episode. But he’s still being handsy So I get up to get something on purpose so I can come back and sit as far from him on the couch as possible. He IMMEDIATELY moves over and corners me. Then I see movement out of the corner of my eye as he’s sitting next to me and I see to my horror that he’s touching himself over his shorts. I had had enough at that point and I stood up, announced I was going home, gathered my things and walked out the door like 5 minutes into the episode. He texts me and asks me to let him know when I got home. I do and then he tried to call me twice and this morning he texts me like nothing happened?? Aside from a brief “that was fun”. I haven’t responded but I feel like I need to bring it up and address it as soon as possible. But it’s such an awkward conversation and I have no idea what to say or how to even begin that convo. Again, we’ve been friends for 7 years and we’ve never had a problem with anything like this.

682,"Hi, I am a 27 year old male who got dumped by my girlfriend, who is 28 years old - two weeks ago.

This will be a longer story to tell, so brace yourselfs.. And thank you for reading.

Me and my girlfriend are living together for ten months (still do) and had a somewhat rocky but also happy relationship.

She is an extreme Introvert and I, for a long time thought I knew what that meant or how to behave towards her beeing that way. - I was wrong.

Things like going outside or beeing spontaneous or doing unplanned things were horrible for her.
Even if it meant going for a 2 min walk to the next supermarket.

Also i never truly understood that she really needs a lot of long alone time with herself, so she can reload her batteries.

The problem was that she never truly communicated that to me in a way to just directly tell me to go see some friends for a whole weekend, so she can be alone. 

It also seemed like she didn't have the basics of adult relationships figured out. 

What I did tho was leaving the house right before she came from work, so she can relax and be alone for a while. Usually around 2 to 3 hours. 

The problem was that she thought that I needed constant attention and she somehow felt guilty about not giving that to me, which I never asked for. 

Work really stressed her out but I did my best to make her time with me/ at home as awsome as possible. Talking a lot about her issues at work/family, make her laugh and think about more positive things, giving her warmth and a place where her mind can rest. 

I agree that I did somethings wrong, as i figured out a couple of weeks ago. 
Cause I never was with a Introvert before. 

I made a list about what to change for me and for her and handed it to her. I immediately started working on those important things and also tried to show her that I can change. 

Now, besides that I truly gave her everything a person could want from another and more. 
She told me that a lot of the things I did, none of her ex boyfriends ever did. 

It made me proud to make her that happy, so I was very happy too. 

Two weeks ago she woke up, kissed me on my lips and smiled me. The same evening I got dumped and felt extremely blindsided. 

The explanation was that I focused too much on her, even tho she enjoyed it like no one else when I did it. 

I agree that I should've concentrated on me a bit more and did stuff with my friends more. 

But since when is beeing as good as you can a negative thing? 

I started to dig into the mindset of introverts a lot and figured somethings out. 
Things that she never truly communicated. 

We live together cause moving out right now is impossible. We sleep together/are beeing intimate with each other. 

She seems scared of relationships and scared of losing herself, even tough that never happened. 
She was single for long time and said to me that a lot of men tried to be with her but ultimately failed to do so. 

I just want to prove to her that it can work, if she drops the icy wall she build up and stops over thinking, and those negative thoughts 24/7.

I am truly and honestly in love with her and I am doing a marathon to prove it. 

It's very hard cause she is beeing cold to me to protect herself from opening up to me, cause she is scarred from the past years/ experiences. 

Currently she is away for five days till the 31th.
And I try not to be clingy or pushy, so I don't write her each day and wait till she does. Which is hard for me cause I have to suck up this horrible feeling of vomiting each day. 

We were together on the 24th and will be celebrating the 31th together too. 
Also exchanged Christmas gifts. 

The thing is, I know that deep down she wants warmth and love but currently it's hard to get there, cause of her mindset. 

I want nothing more than to see her smile beside me, when waking up. 

It's hard not to show affection all the time, immediately kiss her or hug her. 

It's harder to wait and fight for something if you don't know the outcome. 

All the things I changed and I am on the verge on changing benefited me to, but her also. 

I need to stay calm but can't all the time. 
I give her a lot of space and don't shower her with emotions, but I am scared to let her loose too much, cause of the thought of she might think that I don't care anymore. 

It's the hardest fight to date for me, cause I really don't want to lose her, she is the love of my life. 

I am trying to show her my affection indirectly with the changes I made for myself. 

Please, dont make it as easy as ""break up"" or leave her immediately, cause she doesn't deserve you"". 

I know that I am overthinking this too much, but I wouldn't if she wasn't so important to me. 

Shall I continue to be somewhat of a friend/distant and show her the changes I made, so she can open up again? 

I would like to hear your thoughts and maybe some positive things on the side.

Thank you.",29Dec2019,1

I also was very overweight and I lost a lot of weight due to medical reasons in a very unhealthy way  and it continued due to my own insecurity. 

She consistently discusses how I look very young and calls me a child as well as treats me like one. While also constantly mentions how I look good because of my weight loss. I have asked her not to mention either of those things and she calls me ridiculous and yells at me for it and continues to mention it.  I understand she loves me and means it in a good way.

I have an allergy to incense, but they don't care how badly it effects me, or our dogs apparently. The smell is overwhelmingly powerful, and the house often becomes cloudy with smoke. It's a sickly sweet scent, it makes me nauseous and have breathing issues, I cant imagine what it does to the poor dogs who have such an elevated sense of smell. 

I have asked politely, yelled, argued, and begged. They think I dont want the dogs around the incense and essential oils because I'm so anti-MLM (mom is Young Living's bitch) and anti-pseudo science. I have sent my mom articles, tried to explain that it's not safe for dogs and can cause issues, they simply do not care.

694,"I’m a 22 year old guy in college. Ladies don’t notice me... at all. The last time I think a girl liked me (or even noticed me) was during my sophomore year of high school, 6 years ago. It does get me down. How can I come to terms with the fact that I’m just not attractive? How can I forget about women?",29Dec2019,1
695,"This is long, and a throwaway acct for obvious reasons. 
So about 2 weeks ago, I (25f) was out at a party with my (ex)boyfriend (28m). We were all getting pretty drunk and just hanging out with each other at a bar. There were probably about 30-40 of our friends there. One dude rolls up that my ex has always had problems with, but he didn’t want to cause any issues so he went up to him and said hey. The dude just completely ignored him and we walked away. Bf turns to me and says, “damn. Dude really didn’t have shit to say to me, huh?” 
The dude in question (we’ll call him Ian) that gave my bf the cold shoulder has always been a shit head.  He has a history of being homophobic, racist, and just in general a piece of shit for shock value. I had never met him, but based on what all of my friends have told me I don’t care to get to know him in the slightest. 
So fast forward a bit into the night, I’m hanging out with one of my girlfriends and Ian walks up to me and starts chatting me up. I don’t give him the time of day, make it blatantly clear who my boyfriend is and just ignore him and continue hanging out w my friend. A few minutes later I start feeling weird and think, “I need my boyfriend right now.” The next thing I remember is walking into the bathroom and Ian grabs the door as it’s shutting behind me. 
I guess after that (keep in mind this is all what I’ve heard because I remember literally nothing) someone saw us walk out of the bathroom together and told my boyfriend, “I don’t know if you’re cool with this, but I just saw Ian and your girl walk out of the bathroom together.” Obviously my boyfriend was not cool with this and came to find him. When he found him, apparently I was standing there just hanging out with the dude, something I would have NEVER been doing in a right state of mind, and talking. My bf says “Whats up dude?” And apparently Ian got this look in his eyes like he knew he fucked up. Of course my bf proceeds to beat the shit out of him and Ian leaves. 
This next part I do remember, is that one of the girls that was at the bar came up to me and said, “no one wants you here and you need to leave.” I was just so confused and had no idea what was happening. 
So at some point, someone took me to the hotel where I was staying with my bf and when I woke up I had absolutely no idea what had happened and was alone in this hotel room without my car as we left it at one of our friends house. I called my boyfriend and asked him to come get me and I need to know what the fuck happened last night. I looked through my phone and I had texted him a bunch of times begging him to talk to me which I assume was after everything went down. But before that, I sent him a single text that said “help” and he didn’t come to find me. It makes me sick to even think about. 
So he comes and gets me and basically tells me he doesn’t believe me and thinks that I was trying to fuck around on him. Keep in mind, we’ve been together for almost a year and while our relationship has not been perfect, I am completely in love with him. Before him I was in a very long term relationship and never even thought of cheating, it’s just not who I am. He’s been through a lot of bullshit though and I get it, it’s hard to trust after going thru shit like that but it’s just not who I am. 
So I’ll spare you the details, but it took me about 2 full days to convince him that I would never do that to him and that I absolutely love him and it kills me that he doesn’t believe me. Even though I have no idea what happened, if anything did happen it was 100% not consensual. I’ve been blackout drunk dozens of times in my life, and this was not that. Something was just off. 
So during all of this, I texted my best friend and vented about the situation. I said some mean things about him that I definitely should not have said, but it was in anger and I didn’t mean any of it. I said he was stupid, I’m stupid for being with him, and I don’t understand why I don’t just leave. It was a total of about 4 or 5 messages. Of course, he went through my phone and saw them and basically said, this just confirms that I can’t trust you and makes me rethink the whole situation with Ian because that dude didn’t like me either so what would stop you from talking shit to him? 
I tried for about a week to explain that I was hurt that he didn’t believe me, I don’t think he’s stupid and I don’t want to break up. Even though I know this sounds awful, I really do love him and we have an awesome life together. It got to be too emotionally draining though and I finally said this morning, “okay I think you’re right and we should probably break up because I know I’m not going to change your mind.” He immediately went on Facebook and changed his relationship status and left. 
What’s shitty about this situation in addition to EVERYTHING else is that I recently got very ill and racked up a lot of medical bills. I absolutely do not have the means to move out, and can not afford this house by myself. I made my home office into my bedroom and I guess I’ll stay in there until I save up enough for a down payment on an apartment which really shouldn’t be too long. 
I just really need some words of encouragement right now. Even after all this bullshit, I still feel like this is my fault. I should have been paying more attention to what I was doing that night and I should have never talked badly about my boyfriend to anyone, but there’s only so many times you can apologize for the same thing. I’m heartbroken over the loss of the love of my life and the fact that something bad may have happened to me and I’ll never know. Please someone, say something that’s going to make me feel like my life isn’t completely falling apart. 

TLDR; went out with boyfriend, mean dude took advantage of me and boyfriend was skeptical. Finally convinced bf I was telling the truth, and he went thru my phone and saw mean things I said about him when I was mad. He says he can’t trust me anymore and we broke up, but due to my finances, I have to continue living here. HELPPPP",29Dec2019,1

720,"Long story short I started off college as a math major, I took about a quarter of the courses required for the major but in addition to getting harder (confident I could complete it, but likely with low-3 GPA) I just wasn't passionate about it. 

I ended up switching to a psych major, which I love everything about. I even got involved in research, and I have a 4.0 in psych so far (also done about a fourth of the required classes) so I'm confident I would be competitive for PhD programs and that this is what I'd want to do for a career. 

Here's the main problem:
By the end of college I'll be about $60,000 in debt. I don't know if you'd consider this irresponsible or not, I got a good deal of scholarships and $15,000 per year is less than most people are paying but unfortunately I'm on my own so it's all being paid for with loans. 

Originally I had intended to get a job related to software or finance, which I know would pay really well but I'm worried it might be soulless for me. 

While I would be perfectly happy with the salary of a psych researcher/professor, my biggest worry is that during the 5-7 years it would take to get a PhD (with essentially no income) the interest would balloon my debt to almost $100,000. I don't know if that'd be feasible to pay back on a starting (probably adjunct) professor's salary. Yet if I went straight into industry with a math degree, I could probably be debt-free within this same timeframe. I'd have a higher salary and more freedom to pursue other passions, even if the work isnt particularly fulfilling to me. 

This whole situation is giving me anxiety and I don't know if I should chase my passion or if I'm just being young, naive, and irresponsible with my future when I have a much clearer path to financial stability as an option. 

Last note:
I imagine some of you might suggest a compromise; eg graduate with a Psych degree then go straight to work. But those jobs are lower paying, and I can't think of anything I'd be passionate about. I like research. And I don't think I'm smart enough nor interested enough to do a PhD in math.",29Dec2019,1
721,"Well the title pretty much says it. Here's the details.

 My sons mother and I were divorced before he was born. He is 11 now. He has struggled with some depression and bed thoughts. We got him some counseling and he is doing much better it. I was diagnosed with bi polar, OCD and severe anxiety when I was in my mid teens. For the most part of my life I have somehow successfully got the better of that wicked cocktail of mental health diseases. Well until this year.

Got hurt at work. The City wriggled their way out of helping me pay bills or wage compensation or anything. I dropped lower than I ever have. I began to self mutilate as a coping method. Scars are all over my upper arm and some on my lower. Unfortunately I am still using this method and I am working on everything that is going on with me, that's a whole other issue and for a different post lol

So to keep a long story... ummm not too long... I bleed through my shirts and have bad scabs and obvious injuries. I cannot decide if I should keep lying to him or tell him what's going on with me, for two reasons. If he told his mother she would use it to try and get primary custody back (another story for a different post). Second, I don't want him to begin to think that hurting himself is an option. 

Other than that I think he is more than capable to understand what's going on and handle it just fine.

When I got pregnant unexpectedly in 2017, my husband and I fell on hard times and moved in with my father who I always considered myself very close to. My husband used to have a friendship with my father, though still having small opinions on his parenting and lack of effort to maintain his own life in a healthy way (he’s always been overweight/physically unhealthy, essentially an alcoholic, is pretty much a narcissist and is not very considerate of the people around him). My husband was fine with keeping his opinions of him to himself and to remain civil (they have had many arguments before) until one night after I had gone to bed, the two of them stayed up together, drinking and conversing about life and raising children and yadda yadda yadda, when my father expressed to my husband that he essentially molested my older sister (28, who has a different father which makes him her stepdad; we have the same mother) when she was about 5 or 6 years old. 

I really do not want to go into detail as it makes me uncomfortable and is hard to believe, also I really don’t know the rules of things like that on here, but she essentially made some sort of physical, sexual advance towards him, clearly not understanding what she was doing as she was a child, and he didn’t stop her. The incident lasted for about 3 minutes or so according to my husband. He expressed this to my husband with a smile on his face, and ever since then my husband has been weary of him and formed a hatred towards him that I don’t think will ever go away. It is hard to accept but well understood. Once he told me, the story was brought up to my mother who never knew until I did (she is still livid about it) and again to my father who didn’t deny that it happened. And the worst part is, my sister “doesn’t remember”. I asked her if the story was true and she got really nervous and didn’t want to go into detail. She expressed the same repressive behavior as she has before about other stories in her life. 

Once my husband brought the story up again to my dad (over the phone) who again laughed about it, my husband threatened him if he ever touched our daughter which I stand by completely. My daughter has not seen him since as he’s been working out of town, and I thought I may be able to mend that but here’s another kicker. 

My father threatened to call DHR on my husband for threatening him, which I just found out today, and I will admit he is a hothead but again, would you not react the same? (I would love another mans and fathers viewpoint on this) I talked to my father face to face just yesterday about my own issues with him and now that I learned that he’s threatened my own family, I wonder if I should cut off all ties with him. I am really heartbroken and in disbelief but I trust my husband, and he and our daughter matter more to me than my father. I just don’t know how to handle this or how to handle the grief and letting go of my father if that is what I need to do. It feels like the world has been ripped from under my feet and I just need some understanding and advice. Thank you in advance.",29Dec2019,1

743,"My husband comes from a pretty rich family and my in laws are fairly generous towards us and our children: paid for half our house (as we live in an expensive area and would have had to rent or relocate otherwise), replace/repair shit that goes wrong and buy us a holiday once a year providing it is with them. They even paid for our honeymoon before they announced that they were coming too! (Lucky us...). It has gotten to the point where if something goes wrong or we need something expensive we will deliberately avoid having them to our house or mentioning it in front of them because they will just pay for it then and there. (Please don’t get me wrong we are very grateful to be so lucky but there are obviously unspoken strings attached.) my father in law is pretty old fashioned - he believes women should not work and often makes dismissive comments if I mention my job (I’m a teaching assistant) such as “oh it’s a just for fun job” “now you can buy pretty sparkly things for yourself” or “just stop working then” if I complain about it. My mother in law has not worked in over 30 years.

Anyway, we were at their house this Christmas Eve and FIL is already fairly drunk by the time we get there. Things are going pretty well and everyone is laughing and chatting. We do get on and my first paragraph is really just to give you the vibe of the family rather than to complain! Anyway after dinner we are all cleaning up the kitchen together and I stepped behind him to put some glasses away in the cupboard, he reached behind him and grabbed my ass and then exclaimed “oops I thought you were MIL!” Fine it was an accident... I didn’t reply and walked away, the kitchen was full of people and it seemed a genuine accident - I dont know if anyone noticed. Anyway that evening it happened another two times and both times it was obvious he knew it was me. One of the times he commented “there’s nothing of you!” As he grabbed me. I’m fairly certain that at least one of the times my husband was also in the room. I was too embarrassed to respond but to be honest I wasn’t exactly encouraging either. I just ignored him and pretended not to notice. 

I was dreading Christmas Day with them but it didn’t happen again. I’ve been with my husband 15 years and he has never been in appropriate before. Nobody has said anything since (I’d be amazed if nobody saw as all three times were in very public locations). And now I’m beginning to wonder if I’m just being a prude? Am I over exaggerating? Is it really that big of a deal? He didn’t do anything further. We are going on a family vacation this summer and I know it will be in the back of my mind the whole time. My husband has great respect for his dad and is also a little old fashioned so to be honest I’m embarrassed to even mention it and would prefer to just forget it. I hoped typing it out would at least get it off my chest. Idk.

744,"To make a long life story short: parents are separated, I live far away with my mom to help her with her business, my dad doesn’t support us financially at all  other than dental insurance. 

I’ve been thinking about nose surgery for a while but finally committed to the decision after summer and after talking about it to my parents (discussing money and doctors etc.) 
We agreed:
Mom pays - food, place, travel
Dad pays - half of the surgery ($5k)
I pay - the consult, deposit and the other half (5k) and  medication. 

I took out a loan to be able to pay for the surgery in full in advance and not have to worry about it the day before. Then my dad could just give me his half when I go. (Because we live 7hrs apart)

Fast forward to today, my surgery is next Thursday. I learned my dad is in California with the whore he’s with and he won’t respond to my texts. Told me he’s coming back on January 4 but when I asked him about the money multiple times he ghosted me. 

It’s my fault that I wasn’t prepared enough.
It’s my fault that I don’t work hard enough.
It’s my fault that I keep giving my father the benefit of the doubt but fails me every time.

So my girlfriend (16f) and I (15m) have been dating for over 2 years now and a few months into our relationship I realized that none of her family wear seatbelts. I was raised with it being mandatory to wear my seatbelt so seeing how normal it was for her whole family not to surprised me. 

I talked to her about it and she said she just wasn’t ever told to wear one throughout her whole life so she never did. I’ve been telling her to wear her seatbelt everytime I’m with her but she always tries to make excuses like “I’m too tired” or “my back hurts” implying that the seatbelt makes her too uncomfortable, so I have to pretty much force her to put it on. She has recently started putting it on everytime I’m with her probably because she knows I’m going to ask her to, but she admitted to me that most of the time she doesn’t whenever it’s just her and her family. I’ve talked to her about it and she says she tries to remember but she always forgets to.

Months have gone by and she still “forgets” to put her seatbelt on. Is there anything I can do to make sure she puts on her seatbelt?

759,"Hello, I will try not make this post big and condense everything that happened, only adding details where is needed. Btw, English is not my first language so I’m sorry for any grammatical mistakes in this post. It’s important to know that I’m in high school.

I’m more of a serious person but I am also really bubbly and like talking and joking around with people. Thing is, my classmates in middle school weren’t the best. When I was in 6th grade, a lot of them stopped talking to me, yet they did not ignore me completely.

Because of that, I immediately assumed I was boring and people didn’t want to speak with me because I was also talking too much. I started staying in a corner, hiding myself from them as much as I could and avoided any attention. Throughout my entire middle school, I only had one close friend. The two of us are still classmates, in high school.

She loves attention, and I also love it but hate it as well. As I told you, I was bubbly before, but now I’m sort of cold/distant and shy when I’m trying to make new friends in high school.

When I’m talking to any of my classmates, suddenly I am anxious. A feeling really close to fear. Because I tell myself while talking with that certain person that I’m boring and annoying them and that I’ll embarrass myself, so I should just stop talking.

Also, because I mostly spent my time in middle school glued to my close friend’s side, when she’s around and we are talking to classmates, I feel courageous and I’m really outgoing. When she leaves, I am feeling shy. 

I tried telling my mother to go to a psychologist to overcome my shyness and try to get over this sort of trauma and anxiety, but she tells me every time that she’s overcame it alone, when she became an adult (she also has been shy before), and that I can also do it. I don’t want to wait until adulthood to get rid of my shyness because it’s affecting my personal life! 

It’s really painful for me to talk about this, I haven’t told anyone this before (apart from my mom, but I only touched the subject of my shyness now and in middle school, doesn’t know the whole story). I want to also hear your opinion and what I should do. If it’s all right, I would like to hear advices that don’t necessarily involve getting professional help, because it’s hard to get my parents to find a psychologist for me.

763,"Hello. As the title says, I'm struggling with a variety of things that I'd broadly categorize as mental health issues. I'm not even sure what it is precisely that I'm looking for in terms of advice. I think the issue I'm struggling with is that my thoughts just feel fuzzy, and I feel like I'm too ""in my own head"" so to speak. Even if no one can give concrete advice, I'd just be grateful to hear any kind of outside perspective on the matter.

I think it would be easiest to explain what's going on in list format. Writing them out, they seem utterly disconnected from one another. But for some reason, my intuition tells me there's a common source for all of these things.

\-I try to avoid clinical terms since I'm not a medical expert, but based on a bit of wikipedia-level reading I think I've been having sporadic episodes of derealization/depersonalization and anhedonia. Just to explain briefly, I'd these episodes are characterized by a distinct sense of unreality, lack of focus, and lethargy. The lack of focus and lethargy are self-explanatory, I think. It's worth clarifying that I don't feel sad during these episodes. Maybe a bit bored and irritated, but I'm never in extreme emotional distress. The sense of unreality is the hardest thing to explain. The analogy most often used here is that there's a sense that one is in a movie or in a dream. I suppose that somewhat captures the feeling, but I don't totally like this analogy for some reason. This might be totally meaningless, but the sensation feels something like my brain is just working at 10% power. I can tell I'm slower at everything. When I read something, there's a long delay between finishing the sentence and actually parsing the semantics. It's impossible to handle any technical information in this state. It feels like there's a lot of ""background noise"" in my brain, but when I finally manage to focus on a thought it just turns out to be total incoherent nonsense. Some of my thoughts are bizarre delusions about the world (weird conspiracies, belief in monsters, belief that others are trying to harm me in unrealistic ways) but I never believe them with much conviction even during the episodes. It's almost more like my brain is passively generating semi-plausible but fictional stories than genuine beliefs. When I sober up, these thoughts disappear entirely. At this point, I'm not at all worried I'll act on these ephemeral half-believed delusions in a way that will cause me to harm myself or others. Worth noting here my diet and sleep habits are absolute shit around the time the episodes happen. I can't tell if a lapse in my general sleep/diet hygiene is what causes the episodes, or if the episodes and bad hygiene are symptoms of something else. 

\-Changing gears entirely, my personality has seen a pretty drastic shift over the last year or two. I used to be an extremely sensitive, emotional person (embarrassing fun fact: I cried at the Bridge to Teribithia movie at age 17). Whenever I formed relationships with other people, I would get strongly attached. This was an ongoing issue for me, since I formed a deep love for my friends that never seemed to quite be reciprocated. I struggled with depression as early as 13, and this continued up until I was 20 or so. I had a few almost suicide attempts during those years, but they always seemed to be thwarted by something (e.g. father's gun wasn't where it usually was, family showed up and pulled me away). By my senior year of high school, my depression was very much connected to my self worth in my academics and I struggled a great deal with my self esteem. I think around 17 I started to mature and develop some coping mechanisms, so the depression became more episodic. 

At around 20 I started to see a major shift in my personality. I generally got a handle on my self esteem issues, and now have an extremely high opinion of myself to the point of being egotistical in most people's eyes. My previously tumultuous and intense emotions mellowed out greatly. I arguably still experience symptoms of depression by way of anhedonia during the episodes, but the idea of me committing suicide now seems laughable. I was always a bit argumentative and really enjoyed getting into debates with people, but recently I've most people find me extremely abrasive and I've had several people cut off contact with me entirely because of how aggressively I push people to talk about their beliefs and opinions. Others have suggested I should seek professional help for anger management problems, which came as a surprise because I never feel authentically angry at all during these arguments/discussions/debates.

The most drastic change (prepare yourself for some real edgelord cringe) is that I feel completely unable to love or care deeply about people. I know, r/iamverybadass. But hopefully I can portray this is a genuine way because it's grown to be an issue. I'm still a basically altruistic person. If someone asks for my help, I'll help. If someone shares their problems with me, I can empathize and share my condolences and generally act like a normal person. I'm not faking it either, that is my genuine reaction. But the idea of loving another person feels completely alien to me now. I feel absolutely nothing for my parents or sister. My old close friends who I used to say I'd die for just feel kind of meh to me now. I still really like being around them, but I don't strongly care about how well they're doing and wouldn't be willing to put that much effort into helping them with their personal problems. I get extremely irritated when anyone tries to share their emotions with me. Mind you, I still get lonely (the episodes mainly happen when I'm alone) so this inability to maintain relationships has taken it's toll.

\-This is getting long, but I want to briefly list possibly relevant details about my life (I'm not shy about sharing more if anyone wants me to, just don't want to give identifying information). I've never experienced any serious trauma: no physical abuse, sexual abuse, rape, drug problems, etc. I've lived a pretty cushy life, at least in material terms. My father would spend ludicrous amounts of money on things for me (consoles, nice computers, etc). Arguably my parents were somewhat emotionally neglectful, and notably my mother was extremely hostile towards me when my depressive symptoms were at their most intense. She'd often threaten to kick me out of the house (though the threats were obviously heat of the moment and not very serious) when I'd have a depressive episode, and she made very clear to me that it was not her responsibility to deal with my emotional issues. Since I was old enough to pay attention, my parents never seemed to love each other. They fought pretty intensely since I was young, and would gossip about each other to me in pretty personal ways. The arguments would start out over petty things, and typically devolve into anger about their nonexistent sex life. When I was older, my father admitted he found my mother physically repulsive and wished she would kill herself. Somewhat paradoxically though, whenever my mother would insist they should get a divorce or that she was going to kill herself my father would always talk her out of it.

The point being that my home life was kind of toxic, but frankly I don't think that experience is at all unusual. I thought it worth mentioning in any case, but it was the closest thing to trauma that I've ever experienced in my life.

Anyway, that marks the end of all of the scattered thoughts I wanted to get in writing. Just to ask some concrete questions people can actually respond to: Do you think these things are connected, or am I trying to spin a grand narrative out of nothing? What parts of this are problems I'm blowing out of proportion, and what things do I seriously need to fix? Do you think that the ""episodes"" are a product of a bad sleep/diet, or is the bad sleep/diet a symptom of something else? Does it seem like my perspective on these matters is unhealthy? I'm not necessarily looking for answers to these questions specifically, really any outside perspective would help.",29Dec2019,1

He started to open up when my grandma died 1 1/2  years ago then he started to paying for dinners (giving his card to the waitress before the meal) and just spending more time with us, after my grandma’s untimely death, my aunt mysteriously went on a 2 week long vacation, as well as taking all of my grandmas clothes to “charity” when Infact she sold all of them. My grandma came from a generally wealthy family and she had jewelry passed down from her mom, she valued these so much she wouldn’t even give my dad a ring to propose to my mom, however she said she’d give them up to his kids (my siblings) and when my dad died (The person who would’ve helped distribute the will, per my grandmas request) from cancer a few years ago, guess who came snooping around demanding for money? That’s right. As well as that she goes on saying there is no will and that “she deserves it”, Anyways she got the whole side of that family to hang up on my mom and now it’s about awkward but my mom makes an effort to rekindle the friendship and is always shot down. I don’t want to sound like I’m entitled to anything, because I’m not but I just wanted to vent as well as get help on what to do, this post only happened because today she was asked where she put the other clothes (she insisted she left clothes) and she became uncomfortable and said “she forgot” then I asked where she donated it to, she paused and said [Redacted so this can’t be traced to me] is there anyway I can prove she didn’t actually donate?",29Dec2019,1
771,"I'm 23 years old and I'm having a hard time deciding what to do with my future: currently I have a very good job, the work life balance is good, the benefits are good, and the pay is phenomenal for where I'm at in life and what my qualifications are. If I continue to do what I'm currently doing, my car, and student loans will be payed off next year, then I can buy a home and pay that money into my mortgage, and start investing. It wouldn't be a glamorous life, but I wouldn't necessarily be struggling either. If I invest early enough, I'd be able to retire at a reasonable age. 

Or

A high end university near me offers a BS-PA program, where after 5 years I'll end up with both a Bachelors of Science, and a Masters of Physician Assistance. The program has 75 limited seats, and I don't know how many people apply for these seats annually, but I can start applying my Sophmore year and again my Junior year to complete it in 5 years. After my Junior year I would either settle for just the BS or apply for the masters the traditional route. I currently work in a hospital and would have an easier time than most finding placement after finishing my degree. 

My dilemma is: I tried college once before and I was in very poor mental health at the time so I ended up dropping out. I'm pretty smart, and my academic profile is good (above 30 ACT, generally good GPA) but even so, it feels like going back to school is a risk. My mental health has improved alot since my first attempt, but 5 years is a long time and I would hate to give up my current position to go back into debt, with potentially nothing to show for it. 

If I became a PA, my yearly income would potentially triple, I could afford to move and work anywhere, I could be the sole income for a family if i needed to. I hate gambling and taking risks, and that's why I feel hesitant to commit to this route. However, I'm also young, if I don't take this path now, it's only going to be harder and less convenient to try and better myself in the future. 

Any advice?",29Dec2019,1

774,"Long post. Throwaway. 

I have been married for 7 years. In the last 7 years we have been intimate maybe 20 times.

My husband and I are different races and ages and I thought maybe he just didn't understand some cultural differences and that was affecting our relationship.

I am also a fat person (the same weight and body type as when we met) and have a lot of insecurities about it so I thought maybe that is the reason we do not have physical contact. We do not ever hug or kiss and i make efforts to look nice at all times and compliment him as well as keep our home neat and clean.

For years he has told me my weight and our cultural differences have no bearing on his low sex drive. Then i found out he is watching adult movies and pleasuring himself often. 

He watches movies with women of his own race as well. I have tried for years to let all this go until one month ago.

One month ago a woman came into the place I work and recognized me. I thought it was from social media (this is why I am using a throwaway) but she told me she used to date my husband and was dating him after we became engaged and until the day after we were married. 

She is his age, race, and ""type"". He has never been with anyone who is not the same race and age as him. 

He finally told me last night after a lot of talking (we do not scream or curse when we argue, it is an agreement we have) that what keeps him from being sexually attracted to me is that I have a condition called H.S. which is when your skin gets infected easily and large painful pustules form under the skin which have to be lanced or large amounts of antibiotics have to be taken. 

I have found in the last 5 years that I get flare ups when I have hair removed from my underarms, legs, face, and private areas. So to keep from having flare ups, I very rarely remove any of my body hair. 

It makes me feel disgusting and not feminine at all and I struggle with it every day. 

He told me last night he hates it that I have body hair and that it is why he does not do anything physical with me. 

I am gutted and in mental crisis. I have attempt suicide before and am fighting feelings of self harm. I don't know what to do. 

I know if I remove the hair I will just get more and more of the pustules and they are unsightly and beyond painful. But then maybe he would want me? Maybe I wouldn't be so alone. 

Please help. Any advice would be great.

Also HS has nothing to do with hygiene or cleanliness. I do all I can, up to three showers a day and more. Putting antibacterial hand sanitizer on my body and more. It is just something bodies sometimes do. 

Thanks.",29Dec2019,1

Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.

Backstory: I'm a 14 yr old boy, in my final year of middle school and recently i've been accused 8 freaking times of theft. EIGHT TIMES, ONE PERSON, ONE DAY, ONE ITEM. I've had my bag searched 3 times. Later they found the item (Apple earpods) in her friends bag. and now there's a rumour that I put it in her bag. Do you want to know why I was the main suspect? I sit in one class with her. (We have cluster classes)  AND THATS IT. I live in a small town and everyone knows eich other so she basicly ruinend my life for me.

777,"English is my second language, sorry for whatever's wrong with this.

So I'm 15 (didn't post in r/adviceforteens because most of teens I know are exactly the kind of person this post refers to. Not trying to be rude I'm just talking based on my experience.) and i have a brother (11)  and he's is one of those people who when bored won't fucking stop messing with you.

I'm the kind of guy who doesn't wanna mess with anyone. 70% the time I won't move nor get into your life. That doesn't mean I'll be bothered by people just talking or being friendly to me.

Then there's my brother  and won't get into details about him but when he's bored he becomes the most fucking obnoxious person in the world (you now that kind of people you really wanna punch? those that cling to you and talk nonsense and you don't wanna hear or poke you and throw stuff at you.) and of course the one he bothers is his brother, me.

So I need a non violent way to get him off me when he becomes like that. I suppose getting him  interested with something else would be a choice but I don't wanna a become his nanny going around looking for things for him to play with.

If you think it's just impossible that works as an answer too.

782,"F/21.  To get straight to the point, When I was in the 7th grade I was sexually assaulted by a schoolmate and for a very long time I believed it was my own fault because i was being too friendly and felt like I egged him on which resulted in that behavior. Fast forward in 12th grade I was sexually assaulted by someone I went to school with when I was younger, same story, I was being friendly and I guess he got the wrong idea and felt like it was okay to do what he did. A couple days ago I was out with a close friend, someone who i consider to be my best friend and we were drinking, we have had sex before and established between us that we are sexually attracted to each other (but it’s complicated because he has a girlfriend) we went to a friends house where I smoked and got high, shortly after (because it was my first time) I asked him to take me home. He got upset with me because he had asked me not to smoke but I did anyways. I felt fine on the way home until he started to touch me sexually, because i was high i felt super weak like I couldn’t fight him off and i was panicking and because we were in an Uber i didn’t want to cause a scene so I pushed his hand away but he kept trying to touch me, he choked me and felt me up in the car and then once we were almost by my house he laughed and said that he would stop fucking with me. Once we got inside i asked him to stay away from me and he was confused, Now here’s where I’m conflicted, he’s my best friend and our friendship seems like a once in a life time thing, I really value it and don’t want to let go but I know if I just sweep this behavior under the rug and let it slide it’ll be like all the other times. Same narrative, I was too friendly, the guy got handsy and now I’m left thinking it’s my fault for being too flirty. I feel dirty and disgusting and I just don’t know what to do.

My friends are really worried about me and my best friend wants me to tell my mom about this. The thing is, I’m terrified to tell her. My mom has depression and she knows I’m most likely suffering from it as well. The difference is that she’s on medication. There have been times where I tell her that I feel like fucking garbage, that I can’t function like a normal person and she just tells me “The whole family has something wrong with them, we still get through the day.”, she tells me I’m taking my mental illness “too far”, or she focuses on the fact that my grades are falling and I’m losing so much weight. I’ve begged her to go on medication or something and she says she’ll find a psychiatrist but it’s been months. I’m scared to tell her about my growing alcoholism because I think she’ll just get on my case for sneaking alcohol or my cry for help won’t be heard.

So in short I changed workplaces a month back. A bit before that I got stopped by a girl outside. She just wanted to tell me she's happy that I'm transferring to their clinic. I had no clue who she was but it was nice. Since than we already worked together a few times. There's the classic ""she's super nice towards me"" stuff.  But there's also other stuff. For example compliments from her. Apparently she wanted to transfer too but changed her mind because I'm here. I found all this super weird so I asked if we knew each other before and apparently she spent some time in training at a place I worked and she knows me from there. We even got to talk about if I'm single and if I'm looking for some relationship. 

After all that I somehow got out her that she thinks one older dude from here looks good. I know him well  so I joked about asking him if he thinks the same about her to which she said she ""kinda put him aside"". Up to that I was sure she's flirting and now I'm just confused. Don't get me wrong it's not like I'm crazy about this I'm just curious. I don't want to get things the wrong way in any case.

I didn’t touch her once, not even to defend myself. I told my friend to go inside and have the cops called and he did.

807,"Good afternoon! I [25F] am casually talking to [32M] and I think I may have messed up big time, I need to know: Did I? And if I did, can I fix it?

The short story is: He is an alcoholic, he told me early on when we were speaking and I have no real experience on how to help. He recently relapsed, had me come over, which even though we are casual and hook up, I was not planning to and we ended up hooking up anyway and now he’s been on a smooth ignore streak with me. He typically goes into isolation when he is trying to recover - but I’m genuinely worried as this is the most he’s ever shut down.

The long of it:

We have a similar circle of friends, and started talking and hanging out, outside of our friend group. We had gone on a trip in the city for fun, and when we got back to his home he admitted he had an attraction to me and I reciprocated. After that night he admitted he was an alcoholic ( which caught me off guard because that night we were drinking together ). It didn’t stop me from being attracted to him and I just told him that I would do my best to be respectful and supportive since addiction is a hard thing to handle. Alcoholism runs in my family, and while I never had to face to face deal with it I know that it can be really devastating.

We texted every day and hung out often after that. I admit was falling for him hard, he’s charismatic, kind, and one of the most interesting people I have met. I probably got too clingy at some point, asking if we could hang out often and being mushy. ( I had asked him if asking to hang out was overbearing, but he said he wasn’t bothered at all and not to worry about it ). Some time passed and one day while we were hanging out he asked if we could just be casual - he was still physically attracted to me but not ready to be in a relationship - but also didn’t want to lose me as a friend because we genuinely get along and he enjoys when we hang out. I was fine with that, I appreciated the honesty and pulled back on the mushy talk and gave him more space. We started to message less, and I didn’t ask to hang out so that he could decide.

Two days after that he had asked me to come over since he was watching a movie I said I hadn’t seen, so I went over with the intent of hanging out. While I was heading over he had admitted to me he was drinking, and looking back now I think I shouldn’t have gone over. But I did. ( Note: After he told me he was an alcoholic I don’t drink with him or be around him if I have been drinking that day )

It started off really normal at first, I showed him some photos I had taken on a trip with my family, we talked about a film he had just seen, and just normal type banter. He was sitting in a chair and I was lying on his bed, and in the middle of talking he pushed me down and started kissing me.

It caught me off guard, I put my hand out and asked what was he doing. He stopped and said he was TRYING to set the mood ( in a joking manner. ) I asked if that was all he wanted me there for, and he assured me that wasn’t it. I went outside to smoke to try and clear my head, when he followed me out and started smoking too and asked if I was uncomfortable. I told him that I wasn’t, but my fear was he would regret having me being there and doing this since he had been drinking. His whole demeanor changed, and he started to explain that he really did want me over, that even though he had been drinking he was in control over his actions. He wasn’t sloppy drunk or anything, just tipsy so I trusted his judgement.

Afterwards, we were laying in bed talking about whatever pretentious nerds like us talk about when he fell asleep completely wrapped around me. I know when he drinks, typically the next day he feels awful and wants to be left alone so I slipped out, tidied a bit, and left him a note explaining that I left cause I hadn’t asked if I could stay over and to text me when he found the note. The next day he told me, in the future to just spend the night and that he wanted me there. I agreed, and then didn’t hear anything back for a day. He finally got back to me and said he screwed up again and just needed some time to recoup ( which is normal )

But now it’s been a week. Which is fine, we’ll be seeing each other soon due to our friends, but all I can think is: What?

I’m so confused, the only thing I understand now is that I just want to be his friend and be there for him. We went from talking every day, being romantic, to just casual, but then he wanted me to spend the night and be with him, but now he’s completely gone and I’m so frustrated. I’m probably being played, but his alcoholism is getting worse and he’s relapsing more often now. I want to be there to support him, but have I been enabling him? I don’t even know anymore and I’m scared I’ve made things worse for him. I don’t have anyone to turn to, and our friends don’t know about his problem.

The advice I’m looking for is this: What can I do to help him, how can I make sure I’m not enabling him, and how do I communicate that I care without being overbearing?",29Dec2019,1
808,"No one ever checks up on me and I feel ignored in group chats.

If they don’t like me that’s fine! I don’t expect them to message me everyday or check up on me constantly but I don’t think they’d care if I left. I want to speak to them but they can be weird with serious conversations so I don’t know if it’ll change anything.

809,"Hi y’all. So I’m white (21F) and my boyfriend is Arab/Muslim (21M) and we waited almost 2 years to tell his parents about us out of fear that they would disown him and not accept us together. Surprisingly, they took it very very well, other than his mom still being strict about rules regarding him having a curfew, no sex, etc. They don’t celebrate Christmas but surprisingly his mom got me a Christmas gift. I had wanted a new purse for Christmas, one that is simple with really no detail and small that I can only fit my wallet and phone in as my current purse is rather large. 

The purse she got me is rather boxy, with a big chain on it and a scarf thing. I don’t hate it, but I also don’t love it. She did give me a gift receipt, but my boyfriend already boasted to her about how much I love it because I didn’t want to seem ungrateful or anything when I was opening it. 

I know this seems like a first world problem, but I don’t want it to go unused and just sit in my closet and I also don’t want to use it and lie to her that I love it. I am a college student and money is tight, so it’d be nice to have something that I like and actually use as I don’t have much extra money to spend. There was a purse in the same store she got it from that I really loved. But, her getting me this gift is a big step and sign that she accepts me. I really don’t want this post to seem like I’m ungrateful, I’m just a horrible liar and also want her acceptance. So do I keep the purse and lie that I like it and maybe only use it when I’m around her, or do I exchange it for something I like?",29Dec2019,1

817,"Back story: I've been adopted several times through my life. The last adoption was when I was 12, I will be 30 in February. Through all the name changes, I never grew attached to any of them. The most recent adoption left me with a name that I'm not really comfortable having because of certain notorious people that carry it (no relation).

I married in 2012 and because of my lack of attachment to my name, I changed it again so that my wife could keep hers. My family was very upset and no matter how I tried to explain it they didn't understand.

I'm now getting divorced and I want to change my name... again. My parents have passed and I'm left only with my brother (50) and sister (52) who both want me to go back to the adopted name, even though my sister is widowed and doesn't carry the name anymore. I want to make my own name, something that I can create a heritage out of, something that I truly feel is part of me.

I have a name picked out, and my sister seems to understand me this time. She still wants me to go back but she isnt upset and is onboard with my choice. She recommended changing my middle name to be the same as my father and older brother's. I'm not against it, in fact, I'm willing to do it to appeaae my brother but I'm not sure that it will be enough. 

I know I'll have to sit him down and talk about it, but I don't know how to word it in a way that will at least convey my feelings honestly and clearly.

818,"Throwaway account

About a month or so ago I [F22] met up with a guy from Bumble [M22] and ended up having sex. He unmatched me at some point after this which is a bit of a dick move, but to be fair I wasn’t particularly attached to him – in my head it was definitely just a one night thing as well. So I moved on with my life until a few days ago when I realised my period hadn’t come. Did a pregnancy test, turns out I’m pregnant, and this Bumble guy is definitely the father.

So, I’m pretty sure I’m getting an abortion, probably about 90% sure. And I know that legally I don’t have to tell him if I’m getting an abortion. But there’s a part of me that wants to tell him, because it does involve him. I’m not sure if I feel comfortable having an abortion without at least letting the father know about the situation, but that might be a dumb way to feel. I just think it might be a good idea to talk to him about options etc., considering it’s his fetus as well?

I managed to find him on Facebook but I don’t know if it seems really stalkerish and weird to message him on it, particularly as he’s the one who unmatched me on Bumble haha. I don’t want to look like a crazy ex-hookup or anything like that.

So yeah, should I message him about this or is it better to just leave it? And if so, any tips on what I should say would be appreciated.

(By the way, in the unlikely event that I did keep the baby, I obviously would tell him. This question is more about whether I should message him now, when I’m not fully certain of what I’m doing, and I’m just a bit lost and confused)",29Dec2019,1

820,"I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years now and from the get go he has been very serious with me. Things are good and we have been speaking about marriage a lot ( initiated by him) He is a respectable boyfriend who pays attention to me and is very patient with me. 
I am 28 and he is 29. 
There is just one thing niggling at the back of my mind. Il start by talking about my upbringing - it was very very conservative and I was always taught that virginity is the most amazing thing you can give your husband etc. So I held it as a badge of honour until I hit 25, met my first official boyfriend, fell head over heels .. got drunk, lost my virginity. I was a fool back then and I hate thinking about it. 

The guy was so obviously still in love with his ex and my gut instinct told me so but I was stupid enough to just trust that he wouldn’t be with  me if he was and that our relationship could actually last. 
When I think back to that relationship, although short lived, it bothers me that 1 I lost my virginity to him when he clearly didn’t love me and 2 the fact I had very little self love and allowed myself to be second best. 

Anyway, after this relationship ended I started sleeping with someone casually and developed feelings for that person but later found out that he was actually engaged to be married. 

And then I met my now boyfriend, the most wonderful person. Sometimes I think about all of the insecure outbursts I’ve had and I’m shocked he is still with me. At the very start of our relationship when things were getting deep, he said that it bothers him that the second person I slept with didn’t take me seriously and that he wishes that  was my one and only. He brought it up for the first month or two here and there until I told him to go and find a virgin as I didn’t want to hear about my past anymore and hung up. 
He called me back, apologised and said he just had random outbursts of jealousy because of how he feels about me and that he will never bring it up again and he was true to his word. He never brings up my past. 

Upon speaking of his past he has been in 3 relationship. I have no concerns about the last two before me but when I think of his first girlfriend I get this weird sickly feeling in my stomach. He has once said that he was her first everything and that they were just too young, the relationship fizzled out but nothing actually went wrong. Had they been older, things could have been different’. ( they were together for four years I think between the ages of 19-23 or so ) first it didn’t bother me, but every now and then when he’d bring her or another ex up just in conversation it started bothering me. I told him how I feel and he said I’m being silly/insecure that they ended years ago and had he wanted to stay in that relationship he would have. 
I can’t keep bringing it up as he’s started to get annoyed saying that he can’t keep having this same conversation but I don’t know, I just want to feel like I’m not a second choice yet again. I just want to be the woman he truly deeply loves and that he’s happy everything else in the past didn’t work out and has no niggling regrets. 

I’ve made it very clear that if he does have any secret regrets to find a reason to break up with me and let me go as it would hurt me beyond words. But I don’t know how honest people are. 
I’m just worried that he secretly wishes he stayed with her so he could be a woman’s first and only? I’m also worried that years down the line he will start bringing up my past again.",29Dec2019,1

I am a senior in high school now and turned 18 a few months ago and I brought this up to my mom and she said: ""well I am paying for your college tuition so I call the shots"". First of all, a good portion of my tuition is covered by scholarships due to my being one of the top students in my class. I got into better more elite colleges but I chose this one because my parents would pay less and I would be in less debt for grad school. I haven't even gotten my financial aid award so they could be paying only for my housing. I'm very grateful for their help but I resent them using it as ammunition against me.

The few times I've been in high-risk situations I've always used my intuition to get out of them.

They allow me out around my town with my friends fairly late (until like 11 ish) as long as there are no boys (I'm an adult for fucks sake).

A little backstory, my dad and I used to have a seemingly great relationship, and I'm thankful for all the sacrifices he's made in order for our family to live the way we do. In no way do I believe I have it bad or anything, because I understand many people really do have issues that are completely valid. But I do feel that our relationship was so great when I was younger because he would buy me toys and such instead of being there all the time. I'm not even sure if it's anything to complain about, but now that I'm older, and I buy my own things, I feel like he doesn't care to be apart of my life anymore. We live in the same household, and I work at his company, but I haven't had a conversation with him in months. I've been going through my own separate issues in the past few months, I even went to therapy for a short time when it was extremely bad. I've broken down on my knees to him and my mother when I was practically begging for help, and my mother seemed to be the only one to feel any sort of compassion towards my emotions. She has been the one to take me to therapy, she has been the one to talk to me and sit with me as I cried. He's missed very important things in my life because of work, and although I see why he would, it does hurt my feelings that he chooses work- where he can come and go as he pleases-over milestones in my life that were difficult to do on my own. I have no resentment towards him, as everything I have is because of him, but I do feel very saddened that he doesn't care to be apart of my life anymore. And in the past couple of days, my brother-in-law's brother passed away from cancer. We are very close to his family, and he even asked to see my dad when he was still able to, and my dad didn't go to see him until his last few days, because of work. I want to know if I am being ungrateful, because I do feel a large amount of guilt for thinking like this, and I also want to know what's a good way to approach this situation. I'm not sure if talking is going to help at all, as I've tried in the past to no avail. Thank you in advance, sorry it was so long.",29Dec2019,1

I then blocked her number because my anxiety was afraid that she would hit me up in the middle of the night and yell at me. I muted her on Snapchat.

849,"I feel this is trivial, but at the same time it is a little difficult for me to figure out how to flow through this. I am a 24f who is currently 6 months pregnant. When in overly social situations, I am usually intoxicated either by drinking or by having a bowl of marijuana before to coax me through. Of course this is no longer an option now that I'm up the duff. I have anxiety issues that are socially ingrained, and usually how I deal with it is I either go with the flow (if other people are drinking then I will drink as well to loosen up) or I will just isolate myself. 

Said all that to say, my husband and I have decided to go see his parents for New year's Eve (as a trade off for not spending Christmas with them), and they've already made it excessively clear that they will be drinking (they're heavy drinkers, e.g. can kill a handle of Jack in two days between the two of them) and husband has said that he would curb his drinking so he wouldn't be smashed, but it's been made clear out of a group of 7 or so adults, I'll be the only sober one.

851,"My sister and I have been going to the same orthodontist for 2 years and a half now. She was scheduled to take her braces off today, and my mom went along with her.

Now, to provide some background on my mom, she has a history of treating workers like shit. It happens quite often, she will yell, scream and threaten to call managers and police, ect. 
I warned my sister to NOT take her along no matter what, because she had been complaining for a while   about how my sister's teeth aren't ""fixed"" yet, and I knew she would throw a tantrum.
She is also not very bright, and any attempt to reason with her won't work.

Unfortunately, what I had expected did in fact happen. I wasn't there, but according to my sister she not only belittled the poor guy but demanded all her money back and threatened to call the manger on him and what not. 
She said that he was visibly shaken and taken back by my mom. 

Apparently, she didn't like what my sister's teeth looked like when the braces came off, even though my sister and I know that the orthodontist performed to the best of his ability, and couldn't do more to help my sister as her jaw is badly misaligned and the only way to fix it is surgery.
But as I mentioned above, my mom is not the sharpest tool in the shed and she still doesn't get it even after my sister's many attempts to explain to her.

My orthodontist is really quiet and sweet, and I feel horrible knowing this had happend. I'm going to my appointment in a couple of days, and I don't think I can look him in the eyes. I want to apologize though, he didn't deserve any of the crappy treatment he got.

856,"I’m a private tutor for a girl doing a a General Computer Science A level course. She explicitly told me to focus on teaching her programming. She keeps insisting she understands but when asking her to use what she understands to write some code she is lost most times. And she finds it hard to explain the code after she writes it. I believe I’ve overstepped in helping with her assignments because even though it works i don’t think she fully grasps how.

I’m tutoring her remotely at the moment because of the holidays and i went home. The last face to face session we had went pretty well. She did had the same shyness but I could read her facial and audio ques a lot better. Online its a lot harder.

Her not asking questions is what’s bothering me the most. I’m trying to tutor her to think more abstractly and not just memorize syntax because i think she’d do better overall if she gain that as a skill. Unfortunately the curriculum where I live HEAVILY focuses on memorization in a way that I’ve come to realize is unhealthy and counterproductive to development in my opinion.

If she grasps that I think she’d she significant improvements since that’s what seems to be the main barrier for a lot of people doing better.

She doesn’t pause to ask and when I finish going over a section and ask her if she has any questions she says no. How should i deal with this situation?

858,"My husband and I decided to have a second kid when we were stable and house hunting. Everything seemed awesome and in place. From the moment I got pregnant, it was the worst pregnancy I’ve experienced consisting of morning sickness that lasted 24/7 up until I gave birth. It was bad enough that it sent me to the hospital more than once for dehydration. I also had symphysis pubis dysfunction from 10 weeks on, so that left me with basically the inability to walk or function without severe pain and contractions, and caused me to be labeled high risk with a fear of early labor. Then early labor came, 7 weeks early, and arrived our Preemie who died momentarily, but is now 20 months old and just a joy. 

This early birth resulted in an onset of delays we are facing with her development, and a poor immune system. We’re handling it with physical therapy, an evaluation coming soon for more therapy that will be state covered, and an uncomfortable amount of doctors appointments for every major illness she picks up. 

Well the initial great job I had fired me during my pregnancy for poor performance (I wasn’t on the phone enough to meet criteria, due to the throwing up consistently, and a boss who was very not understanding. Referred to my pregnancy as the “parasite” and “gross”.) I’m in the US in an at will state, not much I could do there. The next job I got also fired me, for not being present enough even though it was a booth rental job where I made my own hours and did my best to be present for any other work events that were after hours. 

Now I’m working retail, night shift, and they are drastically cutting my hours post holiday. I’m exhausted since we can’t afford daycare so I have to try to sleep around her therapy schedule (usually sleep during her single hour long nap), my other daughters school and activity schedule, my own adult things to do, etc. The cut in hours is making it impossible to pay any bills, and my husbands job is on the brink of firing him for also being over on his “sick time” allotted hours that he used either to take our daughter to the hospital for emergencies, or any other genuine emergency (car accident). We don’t qualify for FMLA since she’s not got any actual disorder or issue that is defined or covered by it, so that’s out the window. 

I’m putting out my resume like crazy, I’ve got a 4 year degree I graduated with in May of 2019. It seems like any job that will pay enough to cover daycare and bills is denying me or I just cannot work due to my youngest high needs therapy schedule and their lack of flexibility. My husband is trying to work into getting something that pays enough for me to stay home and focus on her therapy and not continue this stress cycle, but we’ve been doing this her entire 20 months of life now, and we’re more broke than ever before, and we’re barely holding on to our sanity. 

This isn’t a charity case or anything like that. I want genuine advice on how to handle ensuring my job can not throw me out the door for taking care of my family. How to protect myself if I hopefully get something soon.",29Dec2019,1
859,"I really need some help/outside perspective. 

As a Youtube watcher since 2006 or so, I have enjoyed the site for a lot of years. Resulting not only in a lot of subscriptions on my account, but as we all know the volume of Youtubers is increasing every day.

Now the problem lies in 2 parts, the fist part is that I'm an all or nothing kind of guy, I like to watch and keep up to date what's going on on the site with my favourite Youtubers. I think a roll that's playing as well is a Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). Which may be unhealthy I admit.

This all results however in me trying to watch over 400 Youtube videos a day, now of course this isn't possible. I try what I can after I come home from work, but the bulk of this ends up in Watch Later playlist or thousands upon thousands of bookmarks, with folders in folders in folders.

This is not sustainable, and I;ve tried to filter down my subscriptions many times, but the sheer volume is still too large to handle.

861,"I’ve had a friend I’ve known since high school stay with me for several months, and now that she’s gotten a boyfriend, she’s never really here anymore. She’s told me that he offered to have her move in, but said she told him that she didn’t want to because she likes living with me. This is her first real relationship, and it’s been about a month or a little more, so it’s moving fairly fast. She has known the guy for awhile, so it could definitely work out, I’m just trying to add a little background context. She has also referred to his house as “home” on one occasion. She does have a decent amount of things here still. 

Basically, I just want to be fair to her. We’re not on a lease together, as I own the place where we live. I could really use the financial help as I’m having work done at my home, but I don’t want that to be her problem. I don’t have much expertise on this topic, as I’ve only had one previous roommate, and she didn’t pay rent because she was basically a leech. This newer roommate started staying with me not long after she left, and she’s been very helpful and kind. I miss having her here and having someone help me with the responsibilities of owning a home. Bottom line: is asking her for rent this month fair, even though she didn’t use electricity, stay here, or use the Internet? 

TLDR; is it fair to ask roommate for rent money if roommate is always staying at boyfriends house and has no formal lease with me?",29Dec2019,1

865,"SORRY IF THIS IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

I just turned 20 on Dec 26th and it just hit me that I’m an adult, which makes no sense but idk something in me just started to panic like, time is running out!
1st I wasn’t born in the US, I’m from Tanzania and i came here when i was 9. I did awesome in middle school(honor role, yadayada) but in high school i realized that to my parent whether  i bring home a B or a D I wasn’t good enough either way, so i self destructed for a while before i realized that I’m only affecting myself. 
I cruised through high school and graduated with a 2.3 GPA. I though its fine ill just start at a community college anyways since
1. I cant afford to start at a four year and
2. I was literally told I wouldn’t amount to anything in life ... yeah ok

Fall 2018 i started at the local community college, and like many others I wasn’t ready. I had a 3.0 from taking college classes in High School but i managed to F that up and brought it down to a 2.6 GPA . ok still my plan is to a community college for my A.A to transfer to a 4 year but I’m starting to lose motivation and be stagnant you know. I’m in a shitty town in Iowa and i see so many of my previous classmates getting stuck, having babies they cant afford and stagnant.   I’m afraid ill become like that too!

I don’t know, any ways. What i want to do in life it get a linguistics B.A with a Tesol certificate to teach English abroad but, i feel it slipping away from me. From money, lack of parental emotional support and just general depression about the woes of the world, I’m really scared ill give up on my hopes and dreams. Or worst of all i wont get an education, which is still very very important to me. So, I’ve started to look for solutions on how to get to my goal even if i take a different path(s) to get there you know.

So here are my ideas and i just need some advice on what sounds the most realistic because I don’t really have people to talk to about this stuff.

1) JOIN ACTIVE DUTY AIR-FORCE (ground linguist/ contracting/finance/pharmacy)
+ I’ll have financial stability to go to the university of my choice in my state ( bonus perks like the GI bill for school when I’m out)
+ Looks awesome on my resume for future employment
+ new awesome experience (do it when your young and healthy!)
+i can learn a useful skill
+i may have the ability to travel
+can get my citizenship
- may not get in (i already went through men’s but failed due to my weight a year ago when i was 2lbs over and now I’ve gained+)
- 4 years!

2) WORK (after my A.A)
-may not find a job / job stability / enough to live on
-may live paycheck to paycheck due to paying back student loans
+will finally have money to move out
+ may be able to travel
- - -May get stuck in day to day limbo and will not go back to school

3) Move to another state and fail where nobody i know will see me.


I’m not against people who choose the day to day life but, it’s really hard for me to come from a big city at a young age to a small town. Have people telling you you can do anything and grow up to realize no,  actually you can do 8 things, your not good at 4 and your too this or that to do 3 of them, so yeah.
I don’t have big dreams just 1, get my Tesol and teach abroad, and if i cant do that, I don’t know if i can live like this anymore. I just feel so Stuck, like I’m in chains and no matter how i move i cant break free of them.
I work 30hrs a week and I’m a full time student, i thought i was fine but this last semester I did horribly, like financial aid suspension bad. UGH

The Girl and i were in long distance relationship and everything was going well, better than expected and i loved the girl so much and she told me i was the first and will be the last, we talked nonstop texting, we even talked for straight 2 days with no sleep. i gifted her so many things through online and surprised her unexpectedly,  After a month she mentioned she was going through depression, she was having a hard time as her parents didnt help her with paying her University Fee, she even said that sometimes she has zero money in her account and went to bed with empty stomach, and showed me proof of it, i am from a decent family so i have no issues financially, i comforted her the best i could and she even said that she feels better when shes with me, i was going to meet her in person in just 2 months time and i told her that do not worry about the money i will help you out with everything there is, i will find a job and whatever money ill get ill give it you so that you can pay for whatever debts you have. As we were going deeper into our relationships, there were certain lies i made like for example , ""i did weed"" just to look cool, i havent even smoked a cigarette at this point of my life. So i came clean that i dont do weed or anything like that, but she got angry because i lied to her.... but its a lie that i dont even do in the first place so isnt it good that i dont do stuff like that??  After few weeks past and we started sharing about fantasies, so i was like alright, but please keep in mind that its only fantasy and it doesnt have to become reality, she mentioned she wanted to do threesome, which i was shocked to hear it at first, i was not sold on the idea as i know it doesnt end well, but she was like please i really want it, so i was like ""do you have someone who wants too??"" she said yes, which again i was surprised that she has a man like that in her contact list.... i was like okay... ask him but DO IT ONLY TO SEE HIS REACTIONS to what you say AND CUT HIM OFF, i will not allow such a thing... so she said okay, but i got to know that she sent me screenshot of her explaining to him what she wants him to do with her which made me furious as i told her to only ask him about ""hey would you like to have threesome?"" and whatever answer he gave after that i wanted her to cut him off, but she didnt, she even said to me that ill have sex with you first and then you can go out the room and ill have sex with that other guy... i was like WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?? she said i will  share my love so that both of you feel the same way..... wtf?? i was really mindfucked at this point she said she likes to wear short short jeans which exposes bottom part of your butts, but i said no to that, i didnt say no to shorts which covers butts but i said no to those which exposes it, as it is not safe in my country and people look at it in a bad way and i said no FOR HER PROTECTION. We started to have issues and got into more small fights, we even broke up for like few days but eventually came back together as we made some promises as we both were at faults in some ways. Moving on to the second month of our relationship we were talking and she said she wanted suicide, that she could take no more of the pain, she mentioned suicide 2 times in our whole relationship,  but i talked her out of it and made her promise that never ever commit nor even think about doing something like this ever.... i would be devastated if you leave me alone like that, i said. She promised she would never talk about it nor even think about doing such a thing. When she talked about suicide with others, people left her, but i stayed as i felt a sense of responsibility to help her out not only as a boyfriend but also as a human that :life is a precious gift and there is more to life than giving it away for temporary problems"" i said this to her. On 13th Nov she asked me again that will you be okay if i pass away? i said no i will follow you too and give my life away too, but once again i told her and explained about my strict life, my parents are very strict in the sense of not going to clubs or trusting my friends too much as i am from well known family so i have to be on my toes all the time and be careful out there. i explained to her that its tough for me too but im coping up with it somehow, i live like im caged in my house but this is what life is, you have to live in a certain way for a certain period of time, i told her that even i wanted to run away from my house multiple times but i knew it was not worth it. Anyways, she disappeared for about 2 hours and when she came back i asked her where were you? she said i was just reflecting about my life up until now... i was like are you okay? please tell me honestly whats going inside your mind please please tell me? but she didnt tell me the honest feelings, on 14th NOV it was like 2 o'clock in the morning and she said i have to go now, so i was like okay you must be tired so get some sleep but please text me as soon as you wake up... she said i promise you. so i was in relief that she is not thinking to do anything crazy. 9 AM i woke up i checked my phone and what i see was her status saying ""her birth year and 14th nov 2019"" which means on 14th nov she died. i was shocked at first i didnt know what was going on i called her but she didnt pick her phone i got so worried i tried reaching out one  random guy that she told me about, he didnt pick his phone either, i texted him and he replied saying i DO NOT CARE ABOUT HER, LAST WORDS SHE SAID WAS SHE WANTS SUICIDE.... i got so angry and furious that he didnt even try to help me out in anyways possible, she blocked her facebook, so i couldnt see her other friends but luckily one of her best mates profile came in my recommendation list so i messaged her but there was no reply from her either, i cried and cried and regretted that i shouldnt have gone to sleep that earlier in the night maybe then she would still be with me, i kept calling her number all day and night but no one picked up, i tried reaching out a friend who was from her country but she flipped me too, i did not know what to do as i was just shattered into pieces, i just wanted to kill myself, i loved her so much, nothing felt right, i gave up so many things for her, so that i can just be with her all the time so she doesnt consider suicide for real, but on 14th she committed it eventually, was my love not enough? am i at fault somewhere? on 15th Nov someone messaged me from her phone saying shes in the hospital, first of all i was in relief that i knew and her parents knew where she was, i was under the thoughts that she went somewhere disappeared and nobody know where she is. Her friend told me she might not live which shook me to the core, my girlfriend was in ICU, and somehow her friend entered the ICU and gave the phone to my gf as she woke up and we talked for few minutes, she told me that she will love me forever and watch me from the skies and cheer for me, hearing this for the lack of a better word i was just SAD, i was dead inside, but i had a hope, i told her that you are a strong women and you will go and make it through this and come back to me i believe in you, and she promised she will come back to me. She fell unconscious and went into coma, my girlfriend told me that if i pass away i will leave you with a friend who will take care of you just like me.... i was drunk i had no idea what was going through my mind i didnt even know where i was or what i was saying or what i was doing to myself i just wanted to die. That became my destination. i asked her friend how will you be able to take care of me? she said its my duty, i asked her do you have a boyfriend? she said yeah, so i asked her wont he feel uncomfortable you taking care of me? are you sure you wont  fall for me or anything like that? she said ""somethings wrong with you?"" why would i date a guy who my best friend dated? and me as a drunk mindfucked depressed guy told her "" i dont know you might just fall for me""..... but i straight said after that  there can be no one other than my girlfriend, she was  my first and she will be my last forever and i meant it. i was really fucked up in my brain i did not know what was right and what was wrong. after 2 days i told my parents about this and they told me to leave it you are crazy that you loved a girl like this, they didnt understand a single thing what i was going through. After 8 days my girlfriend woke up, i asked her how are you feeling are you okay? the best i could i comforted her. she read all our conversation i had with her friend and she eventually said that she wanted to break up, i was shunned... i asked her ""you want to break up because i said to your friend that she might fall for me?"" she said yes. i was in disbelief that she would break up for THAT little thing? saying that or not was not even the point here, the FACT the SITUATION WAS ABOUT LIFE here and she did not see that i WAS THE ONE who got to know about her suicide and called her day and night hoping her parents or friends might pick up the phone, i got drunk i took pills i thought of killing myself, i was litrally dead in the inside, even if i said that to her friend, it held no meaning to it. i made up some stories just so that i could get her and make her understand, and i took the dark path and made some more lies. but eventually we both knew this wasnt going anywhere so i just told her the truth, and we were good after that, she understood that whatever i did, it was for own sake, and benefit, we came to terms and promised that, lets forget about this and move on, as we both committed serious mental issues with each other, so we moved on and got back together, but one day my sister told her to break up with me, i didnt know this at the time,, but she told my girlfriend to break up, and next day my girlfriend came to me and said that i regret to meet you, you are a dirty and liar i cant trust you, you are dangerous, i was once again shocked that why is she saying all this once again we were good yesterday and again she tells me to break up? i got pissed and angry and i was so confused, i was really out of my head this time, i did not know what was going through my mind, i was really mind fucked, and then later i found out that she started liking other guy pictures and videos, as i couldnt recover myself from this traumatic events that happened within span of just 10 days, i lashed out and said ill take my revenge you as you have fucked me over so many times that i cant take this anymore, whatever i did was for you. so i went to a dating site and i posted 2 pictures of her face that she posted as her public profile picture and wrote stuff like ""i want threesome"", i posted it and instant regretted it and realized what the fuck i was doing? i removed the post within 10 min, but within those 10 min couple of guys like about 6 or 7 or so guys messaged her saying about sex, and according to what she told me, there was a guy from her university and he spread the rumors around about her wanting to have threesome. I admitted my fault and instantly said i am sorry i didnt know what i was doing i just lashed out and did this stupid thing, she told me she had to leave school because of this, she reported to the police but the police cant do anything about it as i live in a different country, i am not the type of guy to make fun of someone, i got a bit bullied in school so i can understand the feeling of someone getting bullied, I AM JUST NOT THE TYPE OF GUY,  i told her that i will make it upto you by any means possible, i will give her everything of mine ill even pay for her tuition fee if she wants to go to different university but she does not want it. i regret it so much, i cry every single day, i cant believe i did such a thing, but she thinks that i am pretending to be sorry or giving threats, i have even written my will and at any day if things dont feel right i might just end my suffering as all i think about now is to kill myself, or other option is to go to that country and get my punishment, but i do not want to end up in Jail, and even if i go to that country my parents wont support me financially or help me with a place to live, i will basically be living on the streets. i do not not know what to do, sometimes i feel like i should i just kill myself as it will bring her justice, sometimes i feel like she fucked me up, sometimes i feel like i should go there and get my punishment as i deserve it but i do not want to end up in jail. Please help me what should i do. i feel like its my responsibility, and i should clear out of mistakes in this life before i pass away. PLEASE HELP AS ITS BOTHERING ME AND THERE IS NO ONE TO HELP ME DECIDE. I loved her but because of her stupid mistakes i hated her at the same time, but somewhere deep down within me i still Love her and i always will love her no matter how much time passes my feelings wont fade away even if i did such a thing, i know i can give her the best life that she deserves and i know i can fix things she just needs to give me a chance, and i believe she has not lost her love for me too but the situation is making it that, so please help me what should i do?? Whats killing me inside is that, i really want to go her country but i just do not want to end up in jail, and my parents wont help me at all, i wont have a place to live and even if i go will it be worth it? will she give me a chance?  im suffering to make a decision which is killing me whole.",29Dec2019,1

876,"I was born into a very religious family. My family is Muslim and live in a country that is considered Christian, even though most of the population are not religious. When I was younger religion was fine as it didn't affect me too much, nothing other than memorizing stuff from the Quran was forced on me. When I was 15, which is like the ""adult age"" in Islam, my parents forced me to do stuff that I really did not believe would change anything.

In fear of what would happen if I refused, I did nothing. I prayed whenever they told me to and memorized the Quran to pass the daily test. Soon I started lying. I said that I had prayed when I actually hadn't, I said I had work to do when they were going to test me etc.

Religion also made me very irritable. Whenever they told me to fear God I'd mumble stuff like ""I don't care about God"" or ""God can suck my dick"" to myself. It's not good, I know.

I am now 17 and very worried. I love my family, I don't wanna lose them. But I also don't believe in the divine or an afterlife for that matter. I know for a fact that my family will do anything to convert me or smt. They'd send me to my home country and I'd be ""corrected"".

878,"Ever since I can remember (17 F), my mom and dad have been in a loveless, violent and abusive marriage (dad hitting on objects, both of them yelling, both of them being psychologically abusing towards one another, even to my siblings and me. Mom once abused me sexually when I was around 5. So, we’ve all been pretty messed up: resulting in most of my siblings and me having mental illnesses)
So, they separated around summer; my dad left the house. My siblings and I hang out with him from time to time, he pays our bills, mom also does pay for our stuff, but says dad should pay more. Anyways, my mom just told me that her niece (from my dad’s side) told her that my dad was talking badly about my mom, and that he (my dad) with my aunt (dad’s sister) have been talking about hiring a hit man, and that they both have been saying, and I quote: “Won’t rest until she’s six feet under”.
Apparently, my dad has said that he won’t go through with it, because the police will think he did it, but my aunt has been saying that they can make it look like an assault.
These people (family from dad’s side) have honestly hated my mom and my siblings our whole life. They’re so fucked up. And I’m not saying this lightly.
Of course, when my mom told me this I was furious: since she still goes out ALONE outside. I told her that she wasn’t taking this seriously. I told her to go to the police RIGHT AWAY. She said she won’t go, since she used to go when my dad got violent, and they ignored her. Tbh, where I live, police aren’t really good.
Mom told me that she wouldn’t go because they ignored her claims about domestic violence. I told her she should go, because this was a WHOLE OTHER THING: I mean, it’s A FREAKING MURDER ATTEMPT. Right?
Anyway, I told her to go to her niece, and record her saying all of the things she told my mom about my aunt and dad, but she said she wouldn’t do that either.
I told her that she could go to the police, and if that didn’t work, maybe we could post it in FB to raise awareness and such. She told me I was delusional. 
I told her that I can’t get through her if she isn’t taking this seriously. I told her to go to the police, so we can have security while this gets settled. She said that I’m not giving her any advice, and wasn’t contributing anything.
I ran to my room and cried. I’m still crying and shaking. I mean, both of them have been awful to me, but I don’t want to see my mom die. I want to do something to protect her.

I write this for my boyfriend(17 almost 18). Well, his family is quite... complicated. The parents argued a lot and my boyfriend and his sister(15) were heavily influenced by this.
It got better throughout the years. At least they thought. After I got together with my boyfriend we found out more and more about his parents past. We also found out that his father tried to manipulate us (sister, boyfriend and me) to hate the mother. He played the victim card and said that the mother did everything wrong. Well, both of them made mistakes. The mother admitted that she had done so many wrong things.
The father complains all the time that he hates this situation and would like some appreciation. My boyfriend actually appreciates him and somehow his father ignores this. One time the sister begged me to help them. I knew that I couldn't fix a problem that I had nothing to do with. But I helped them to talk... Well at least the mother, sister and boyfriend. But as they tried to talk to the father (in a calm manner) he started yelling at us that we are being sensitive and that he is not at fault.
My boyfriend and his sister suffer. They even considered dropping out of school to get a job in case something bad happens (the father is the source of income). My boyfriend only has a year left until he finishes school and his sister has two years. The mother won't be able to work (personal reasons).

883,"Hello all, first I just want to say thanks for clicking on my post. This question has been on my mind a lot and today more than ever as I’m about to go back to work after Christmas. A bit of background to give you a better picture - I (26M) graduated college 3 years ago and have had a couple of jobs since graduating as I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I finished school. I switched jobs a lot looking for one that fit well and well I’m still looking (although I have a much better idea now). Before I took this job I had been unemployed for a couple months and was living off a credit car. Although I didn’t want to take my current job, I accepted it because it paid well and I had a lot of debt that I have been needing to pay off (student and credit card debt) and so was somewhat desperate for cash. 
The job was a lot different than what I was expecting in that the work is essentially complex data entry. It’s pretty boring to say the least and the company has a depressing feel to it. But most importantly it’s in an industry that I really object to(I guess you could say on political and moral grounds). Everyday I go to work I feel like a total fraud and a sellout knowing that I work for a company that I actively dislike and because of that I’ve had a hard time making friends at the job because most ppl are pretty different from me and I guess I feel depressed when I’m at work. I’ve noticed that the low feeling I have at work has been bleeding into my life outside work. 
I still have some debt to pay but I don’t think I can keep doing this to myself. The thing is, since I’ve had like 4 jobs in the past 3 years I feel like my resume is already a bit weak and leaving this job after less than 6 months isn’t gonna help it. This job was actually the only offer I got when I was looking and I applied to over 60 jobs... and I feel like it’s going to be even harder after leaving this current job. 
I f*cked up taking this job but I was a bit desperate and all of my family was telling me that this would be a good job for me. I should have stuck to my gut and said no in the first place but I knew I needed to pay off my debt soon before the interest kicked in. I should have trusted myself honestly. Any advice would be very helpful and appreciated. Thank you for reading my little story.",29Dec2019,1

895,"Hey all; this is my first post on this sub. I've seen *similar* posts on many other reddit subs/threads, but I feel my situation is a bit unique. So here it goes. My wife and I live in a relatively small town in the Southeast, just a short way outside of a larger, but still small city. I'm leaving the names out, because I think that my situation is unique enough on its own to potentially ID me. So we bought a house last December, in a low-income, but not super bad area. Like much of the South, hard drug use is common in our area (ie, meth, opioids, etc). The street we moved in on has some strange company walking back and forth often, but most of the folks are just nice people who can't really afford to live in a super nice area (housing is expensive here due to the aforementioned ""slightly larger"" city's recent growth). Within the past six months or so, one of our next door neighbors sold their house, and a new guy moved into it. He's a single dad, and seems like a nice guy. 

Recently he approached me and mentioned, very nervously, *that he used to be a drug dealer*. It came off to me as though he had been waiting for some time to approach me and talk to me about it, which was why he was nervous. He explained that that was a part of his life that he's trying to move past, and that it's what had ruined his marriage. He now has a job, and his two young boys are around every couple of weeks for a night or two. He also explained that his past is why I may have seen some strange company coming and going from his house late at night, and his past is the reason he has cameras and a very well-lit outside area. The vibe I got from the conversation is that he was trying to be honest with me about any potentially suspicious activity at his house, and that while he is trying to move past that part of his life, it isn't as ""cut and dry"" as he thought it would be. I'm reading between the lines a bit here, since he didn't explicitly say that's why there's still strange comings and goings.

However, I'm a bit nervous as a result of that conversation. Again, he's a very nice guy, and we've only had good interactions. He seems to care about his kids, and doesn't fit the stereotype of a hard drug user. I wouldn't have known just by looking at him that this used to be part of his life. Additionally, our neighborhood is such that cameras are a good investment in any case. So most of that behavior isn't concerning to me. However, he continues to have really strange company around his place. Much of the time, it's the same folks, but often it's different visitors. These intermittent visitors *do* fit the drug user stereotype (super skinny, sort of dirty looking, messed up teeth, etc). He also comes and goes at strange hours of the night/morning when his kids aren't around. Of course I know that stereotypes are just that, and are often wrong, and that he could be coming and going for any number of reasons. I don't have any definitive evidence that he is still dealing or using drugs, and we haven't had anything negative happen directly to us. I really want to give this guy the benefit of the doubt. I wouldn't want to be judged by my worst mistake, and certainly I don't have any good reason to call the authorities at this point given the lack of hard evidence of wrongdoing. But I am quite concerned. Is there anything I can/should do besides keep a close eye out? Sorry about the long post, and thanks for any advice!",29Dec2019,1
896,"Long story, I’ll try to make it short.

We saw him for birthdays and holidays and that was it. I’m now 34 and my relationship with my dad is no better. I moved 6 hours from home when I was 21, so I don’t even see him on holidays anymore. His been to my new hometown once, and that was for my wedding. He sends cards for birthdays and Christmas and comments on my Facebook stuff all the time. (I call him a “Facebook dad”.) My daughter (18) has never really had a relationship with him. She doesn’t know him at all. He was around some when she was little, but not much. She’s seen him a handful of times since she was 5 when we moved. She recently told me that she didn’t want to waste a graduation ticket on him because of this, that it’s weird for her to even call him “grandpa” and so she doesn’t, she just says “my moms dad”. He texted me today asking if I had a graduation date so he could plan accordingly. I don’t want him here either. I don’t know how to tell him this though without me ending up being the bad guy with that side of the family.  I have this written out, thoughts? 

Graduation is May xxxx, but unfortunately we don’t have a ticket for you, I’m sorry. Graduation will be live streamed though and I will post that link on Facebook when I get it, probably the week of or week before Graduation. We are also having a graduation party in (my hometown) June xxxx. Invites for that will go out early/mid March. 

I don’t want to lie and say there aren’t enough tickets, etc, but also don’t want to go into all the nitty gritty details about us not wanting him here and why (tried that before and nothing changed) but we all (me, my husband and our daughter) don’t want him here.",29Dec2019,1

899,"Pretty much as the title says

I went home for 2 weeks to go celebrate Christmas with my family, and got back to my apartment today (college student). My roommate however stayed at the apartment that we share the whole time. At some point, he had some of his friends over, and one of the couples not only slept in my bed, but had sex as well. I know this since I found an opened condom wrapper in the sheets when I got back home. What really pisses me off is they didn't even wash the sheets or have the decency to throw away the wrapper. 

I texted my roommate about it because I'm understandably pretty pissed about the complete lack of respect and personal space he seems to have, however he never responded. I have yet to see him in person since I came home, and given his past behavior, he's likely to blow it off as no big deal. 

Basically, I'm asking y'all for ideas for ways I can get back at him in a creative way. There's the easy way of just jizzing all over his bed, but that's kinda gross and not that fun

I haven’t been with anyone in many years and it’s always been a problem I’ve had. I tend to either chase girls away or they always become unattracted to my personality or they way I come off. I’m not depressed, I just feel sad, and often lonely. My friend who currently has a girlfriend used to complain about his loneliness, but now he’s got someone. I’m not sure what I can do with that problem because like I said, girls don’t seem to ever want to stay with me. I’m a fairly good looking guy, but no one seems to like the way I talk.

903,"I'm constantly told that in order to get better, that I need to love/accept myself for who I am. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do this. I'm a lazy, depressive, and relatively angry person. If I love myself, does that not imply that I have to be okay with being lazy? And if I'm okay with being lazy, why would I ever change?

I really cant see more than 2 options. Either I stop caring about my flaws, or I obsess over them and try to fix them. Both have their issues, but I'd much rather permanently stress myself out trying to fix them, than willingly let my flaws become me.

Am I just too cynical to actually love myself, or is there any advice that can be given to help improve myself in a more constructive way.",29Dec2019,1
904,"From the time I was put into the position to start making choices to improve my life and my future, I've been failing. I have a severe form of OCD and bipolar disorder. Since I was 9 I've been in hospitals, seeing a therapist and on medication. My mind races, I have brief periods of happiness and euphoria that eventually gets drowned out by depression, I usually think I'm dying of some type of disease, I always assume someone is either angry with me or cheating/lying to me, I have no drive most of the time, morning depression, mid-day high, afternoon depression, constant changes in decisions regarding life, complete lack of focus. I have never liked who I am. My father comes from a line of mental illness. He used alcoholism to cope and my grandmother was in a mental institution almost her entire life. People I meet, I try very hard to hide this from but it doesn't take long for them to figure out something is wrong with me. It sucks because I love people and making friends. I love to listen, laugh and learn about people and their lives. I find people interesting and tend to empathize with everyone I meet. It's really an awful way to live. My dream is to get a degree in something and find a job where I am passionate about what I do. I want to love life and my career, which I'm sure everyone does. I have an associate's degree in general studies but I've been in college since I was 18. I lost financial aid permanently due to constantly changing my major and dropping classes. I still try and take one class a semester but I'm not getting anywhere. I'm miserable at my job but I'm paid enough to support my lifestyle and pay for my insurance. Sometimes I have these stupid ideas about starting a business but they are extremely unrealistic. I'm about 30k in debt from student loans and medical bills. I look at my friends who have graduated or are in college and I see the passion they have for their future and their major and I want that drive so bad. I want to be passionate about something but my mind changes so often I can never be. It's like 10 different people are living inside me. I accept all of my failures in life as my own and no one else fault. I am completely aware that I have something wrong with me and have never been in denial about my mental health. I accept that I'm Eeyore most of the time but I just want to have a passion. I want to fixate on something and stay with it and not change my mind. How do you have a dream and become passionate about something? Why the heck can't I do it?",29Dec2019,1
905,"[Earlier this year](https://old.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c6ouz8/im_going_to_be_sprayed_by_a_skunk_next_week_any/), I posted a thread asking for advice about my impending skunk spraying. 

Many people commented and personally reached out to me, asking why the hell I had to do it. Many were concerned about the skunk's welfare. Many were concerned for MY welfare and warned me I was severely underestimating how horrible this would be.

Sorry it took me a while to respond to everyone and I went silent for a long time, but I'm ready to give an update now.

______________________________________

**I had to be sprayed as part of a plea deal I made to avoid jail time, for animal abuse.** Apparently these sort of ""weird sentences"" aren't as uncommon as I would have thought - a brief look around the internet showed me that people have been sentenced to sleep in a doghouse, to spend a night alone in a dark,freezing forest, or to be pepper-sprayed for pepper spraying someone else.

I knew if I put that in the original post, I'd have a bunch of people focusing on my crime instead of the spraying, asking for sources, etc, and I just didn't want to deal with that at the time - sorry for not posting it sooner!

**As for the skunk's well-being - you'll be pleased to know there wasn't an acutual skunk** which sprayed me. They extracted skunk spray from a few dead skunks, and sprayed me with that.

As for the effects....HORRIBLE. I didn't realize it would be that bad even after reading the comments. I almost think a few months in jail might have been better. It's been nearly half a year and I still swear I can sometimes smell it.

906,"Background. I started dating my now fiancé in 2016 and our big wedding ceremony is in March and my sister is one of my groomsmen. My sister has been dating a loser who already has two kids from a previous marriage and is a total bum. He treats her like a kid and got her into drugs. A few months ago, she got pregnant and when my nephew was born, they found drugs in the babies system and he was taken away from her and given to my parents.  She started treatment and AA but often times didn’t show up and even went to rehab twice but it didn’t help. The second time, she disappeared for a whole month with no contract with anyone. This was kinda the last straw and my fiancé feels like she may be too much of a liability at the wedding with her history of drugs, alcohol, and theft. We are getting married at a historic venue and already removed her from the wedding party but feel our only option now is to un-invite her to the wedding completely.

907,"Person 1, let's call them Zach, used to be my friend, but they aren't anymore and he doesn't want anything to do with me. I wish that we were friends, but I can barely stand to be in the same room as him. Like I literally have had to leave because he is close to me. Person 2, Sarah, used to be friends with them as well.

Sarah and I were talking about Zach. She was just telling me problems with him at first, but I know from Zach's point of view it would definitely be shit talking. I also said my problems with Zach and what I think of him, which is that he scares me and has no qualms about doing what he wants to people not matter what it is.

Later on, Sarah told me a fact about Zach's past that was completely unrelated to her, and that he had purposely concealed from me. I am guilt stricken. 

I think to do right by Zach is to just let it go and not say anything to him, but I am not sure. I don't want him to take it wrong (that I am trying to be in his life or something), and I don't think that Sarah was wrong in telling me her problems with him, only his past wasn't hers to share. When we were friends, Zach was very curious about things people have said about him, but of course people will always talk shit, and I am sure he can guess what kind of things Sarah has said to me. Except about his past. I think I just want to tell him to relieve my own guilt and not because it is right, but I just want to be sure. 

I also don't want to start more shit between Zach and Sarah, or do wrong by her if it's possible. But it is more important to me that what I do be the right thing by Zach.",29Dec2019,1

So my mom (47F) has been on the losing end of her battle with cancer for the last few years and has been in palliative care at home for the last 8 months as her condition continually worsens. I've had a really tough go at it, and it took a 'final moments' type of day earlier in the week for me to truly accept the situation. I've been making the most of my time left with her but one of the things I wanted to do was to record a few conversations with her to keep with me to listen back on. Ideally, I would like these to be meaningful topics where I can get her advice on stuff such as ""how to raise kids"". This is where I would like some help on coming up with some questions and topics to talk about.

917,"I have worked with this guy for about 8 months now and I don’t understand him at all. 

I am 23m and he is 46m and is a bartender. Today he invited me to his house for the first time and I went to be social and I left with an uneasy feeling. 

Background: This guy works at the same restaurant as me. He is a great bartender and customers love him. He is great at socializing and telling stories and making people laugh. He often talks about his past and how much he got laid when he was in his 20’s and teens and how fucked up he would get with people. He also talks about previous jobs he used to have where he was making six figures and having a lot of people work under him. He is also broke and going through a divorce and talks about how happy he is to be almost done with the divorce. He lives with his Uncle in a small home in the middle of the woods which is owned by his Aunt who his Uncle doesn’t get along with. 

This guy went through a stage where he would pick on me at work a lot and he would usually use me as someone to pick on infront of other people he was trying to impress. For example, one time I was sitting at the bar with two friends of mine who were attractive girls. He took a liking to one of the girls so while we were sitting there he served her a Moscow Mule alcoholic drink. He looked at her and said “here’s your Mule and I don’t mean him..” and he looked at me and back to her and laughed at his own joke. She didn’t laugh, noone laughed. That’s the kind of jokes he would make. At the end of the day he would reassure me he was just teasing and that he only picks on people he likes. The other girl I was with claims he used to pick on her too when they worked together in the past. Anyways, he started to be friendlier with me after he saw that people liked me. He invites me to go Skiing and to the bar after work and even to his home for football today. I usually decline but I don’t have many friends so today I decided to go. I went by myself to his home where he lives in the middle of nowhere. 

Upon entering his home I noticed it was very dirty. The walls needed to be painted and had lots of big chips in them. His older very unhealthy uncle lived in one of the rooms and would tell me about all the pirated music and movies he had and that he would give them to me for free. He has a pet python that he insisted on showing me while he fed it mice. He also showed off his huge bass booming speakers that shook the house and I heard more stories about beautiful women he used to sleep with decades ago. His uncle snapped at me with his fingers at one point because I was ignoring him while my bartender was talking to me. Overall, I got bad vibes and decided to leave early. 

I just don’t understand this guy? I have hungout with him here and there to be social but I don’t know if I could continue doing so. 

Advice?

TL;DR: Older coworker invited me over and I felt uncomfortable in his home by myself and not sure if I should continue the friendship.",29Dec2019,1

922,"Okay, this is a loooong story that I will try and summarize as best as possible.

Basically, I moved to another country to be with my ex(we were together at the time) because he was couldn’t live in my country. We have a child together, so I made the move.

His mother was always friendly to my face, but I always had a strange feeling that I couldn’t trust her. I always felt bad for feeling this way as there wasn’t any reason to it, really. It was just a gut instinct. I would see glimpses of a totally different side of her and it would always make me slightly uncomfortable around her.

She had volunteered to watch my 8 yr old son at her house for a few hours. When I came back, my son and his friend were sitting outside the house and looked upset. They told me that she kept glaring at them and drinking, and it was making them feel uncomfortable... although I was under the impression that everything was fine(that’s what my ex was telling me) apparently she was annoyed with the boys at some point. I don’t really know what happened there. 

When my ex, my 1 year old, and I got back to get my son, she was enraged. She gave me the creepiest stare down and I didn’t even know what was going on. She was demanding that my ex and I speak with her in the living room, but after that insane glare she gave me I felt it was best to remove myself and my children from the house until she calmed down. Well, she didn’t like that. When I walked away from her, it was like a switch that flipped and she absolutely lost her shit. I was enemy number one. She followed me outside(mind you everyone always has their windows open so you can here EVERYTHING) and she kept grabbing my arm and asking me “what are you going to do about it”. I tried to stay calm and kept telling her to please calm down, but she wouldn’t. She kept calling me disgusting and vile, and purposely saying it loud enough that the neighborhood could hear(I lived in that neighborhood as well so it was quite embarrassing for me).

I had to go back in the house and gather things up that were left there, and I was trying to do it as quickly as possible. She kept blocking doorways and mocking me/making fun of me. Like, saying really degrading things and trying to belittle me as much as possible. BUT THEN SHE FUCKING CROSSED A LINE... she told me(and I still have yet to respond to anything she was saying other than telling her to please leave me alone) that she was going to get her other son, who is 6 ft tall and a muscular guy, to come and punch me in the face. She told me that he’s on his way over to beat me up. I’m 5’4” and 110 pounds... I felt so vulnerable from that threat because I was in a country with no family or friends. She kept repeating it multiple times and my one year old daughter was in the room with me. Cherry on top was her adding that she’s going to do everything she can to get my children taken away from me as I was finally walking out the door.

So, fast forward 6 months later... I’m back in the USA and my partner is now at his mum’s house(in England). My daughter is turning two tomorrow, and no one from that side of the family has reached out or anything. The father will FaceTime every few days, but no financial help, no plans for being involved in his daughter’s life in the future. Didn’t send anything for the holidays or her birthday. My ex contacted me and told me that his mum and he thinks I should send my daughter to England for a few months every year- I obviously said NO. My ex says he can’t tell his mother that I’m not allowing her around her grandchild after what happened. She’s playing victim and has no remorse or ownership over any of it. 

Help? This is such a hard situation to know how to handle. I just want to keep my child’s best interest first... no, I don’t feel comfortable with my daughter being around someone who flips so easily and cannot control their emotions. She also physically threatened me multiple times as my daughter was right there. The worst part I’m being told to drop it and pretend it didn’t happen. I don’t feel like that’s fair? I don’t need the woman to kiss my ass. I just want some resolve in order to feel comfortable with her around my daughter. 

Am I being unreasonable? Am I right in standing my ground and not tolerating that level of disrespect? How should I handle this situation moving forward? Any advice would be AWESOME. Thanks.",29Dec2019,1

And it's something that has thoroughly effected my life in very negative ways.  I don't even know who I am without sex on my mind all the time.  I wouldn't even know what to do with myself.

I'm 29 now (male) and for as long as I can remember, the only thing I've ever thought about is sex, since I found out Channel 7 played soft-core porn on Friday nights at 12:05pm, when I was like 9 years old.  I used to come home for lunch from school just to get myself off.  Kinks and fetishes developed before anything else - it wasn't until like 2 years later I actually had an interest in sex rather than certain non-vanilla things, which in any normal boy's development should just not happen at that age.

Anyway, for the past 20 years I've had no mental or physical energy, developed into an anti-social, socially-stunted person, done absolutely nothing my life, and complained that I'd gotten dealt a bad hand instead of taking responsibility for my own life.  The only constant in all my life has been the presence of porn and the pursuit of women and sex.

I told my supervisor that I wasn’t attending because I had to finish mileage and reciept paper work I also told him that I wasn’t paying for valet or an Uber.

My supervisor told me that regardless of those 2 factors I could’ve filed a reimbursement claim.  Being aside from the point, my supervisor said I was essentially wasting company money by not going. “When that much money is on the table, attendance shouldn’t be questioned.”

I gave her some time before bugging her about it again, so this morning I snapped her asking if she was still good to go for ice cream, left on delivered. I also sent her a text asking if she was all good (She usually responds to me within 5 minutes). Around 2 PM she messaged the group chat saying she threw up and felt bad, understandable why she wouldn't be able to come or anything. An hour later she sent the group chat a message of her holding her friend's pet ferret. She was hanging out at her friend's house. What really pisses me off is the fact she completely ignored my text and snap, then also ignored the other friend we were gonna be hanging out with and completely neglected to tell us if she had other plans today. Now I want to get the whole picture and try to understand the whole situation before confronting her about it so I asked if the ferret picture was old or if she just then took it. Still no response.

Kia has been talking during months about her birthday. Telling me what would we do and that the people involved would be; Her boyfriend, Lua, Lua’s boyfriend, another girl (Mia)  and me. (A joint party)

Mia is a new friend of Kia and their friendship has grown so much. One week before their party
more or less Mia started dating a guy who is friends of Kia’s boyfriend . 

The day before I asked Kia about her party surprised she didn’t tell me some details like the time to meet etc. Without blinking she tells me the place they are going it’s so expensive and they’ve planned to go the three couples to another site. And that I would be uncomfortable because it would only be “couples” . 

I was astonished. The only reason she told me this is because I asked her. I was rejecting other people’s plans because of her birthday. Besides she literally exchanged me for Mia’s boyfriend. 
She even put on instagram : For more birthdays with all of you. ( Referring to them)

Through this week I got very ill. Wednesday I receive some messages about a group Whatsapp I’ve been included. It was Lua talking about another party they would do this weekend.

They exposed two options and I chose the one that was not the disco. They didn’t seem very pleased with this. To the disco it was the three couples, another girl and I. I wasn’t very fond of this plan either so I told them I have been ill all the week and though I was better I didn’t feel like going to a disco. 

I was inconsiderate?

I currently have a crush on someone else but i know they dont like me back(she told me) and im pretty sure im nearly over her. So im just wondering if it is possible for me to get myself to like her

933,I've always had this nagging feeling my parents are keeping something from me I've asked them upfront before and they always tell me I wasn't adopted. What are your opinions and is there any resources I can use to push this further and get information without my parents finding out. Reasons and possible evidence. 1. My parents have a baby photo of my little sister as a new born in the hospital there isn't one of me anywhere to be found I've asked if there was one asked but my mom said no. 2. My parents filmed my sisters birth but there is no filming of mine(if I'm not adopted I am very thankful) . 3. I haven't ever come across a baby photo or video of me younger then two years. 4. I told my dad I wanted to take one of those ansestory test for fun and he flipped out and told me the government was going to steal my DNA or some bulls hit I asked him if it was because he's not my father and he paused for a second and said no.  Bbbuutt my parents do have a story of how I was apparently born early and premature during a flu epidemic so that could also cover most of it. I feel like honestly a lot of it could be explained away except for the fact that I've never actually seen a baby photo of myself ... I'm not sure if I'm just parinoid or not and also not sure of there's anything I could really do to put my suspension to rest. The older I get (I'm 25 now) the stronger the feeling gets that somethings missing or not right.,29Dec2019,1

935,There is this guy I think I like . Ive barely talked to him in person but I once held hands with him when we were drunk once (Ik very romantic ) I’ve heard many stories about him about how he’s such a dick . I really want to get to know him but I really don’t know how cause I don’t have any classes with him this year . Any advice ? Should I just hit him up on snap or is it just weird because we have barely ever talk in person . I think he’s really cute but im so shy idk what I should do. I don’t know if it’s just cause I look at him a lot but I catch him looking at me a bunch of times too. I don’t ask my friends for advice cause they all just say what a bad guy he just is .,29Dec2019,1

937,"Men that I want and they want me: their life circumstances/insecurities/etc prevent this from happening. 

Men that actually approach me and are nice guys, easy-going and no questioning from the start: major incompatibilities, like religion or lack of 100% attraction. So why continue. 

Men that randomly approach me when out and about: are usually creeps, much too old, not serious “just want to have fun” etc. 

Men that I approach randomly when out and about: taken, or too much back-and-forth when scheduling a date that it ends up best to just let it go. 

How am I supposed to find anyone when life always hits me in the head this way?",29Dec2019,1

939,"My friends and I are doing secret Santa. We’re all international students so we’re going to give the gift when we come back in a few days. Despite knowing this girl for a few years, I actually don’t know much about her. She’s the type of person who keeps to herself and is very private. Even her sister never knows what kind of gifts to give her most of the time. 

Things about her: She’s 24, Indian, a medical student, and quite mature. She likes poetry (she has some poetry books) and likes to write poetry in her own language. She’s also a marvel fan and a huge foodie. 

The budget is €30. I am the worst gifter in the world and I have left this last minute. Any ideas would be appreciated!! I am in Canada at the moment but will be going back to Ireland in a few days.",29Dec2019,1
