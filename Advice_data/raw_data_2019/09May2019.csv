Maybe worst because I live with my section 8 mom and my income like literally 500$ a month...I cant use my fafsa money because they need the transcripts to even pay for college. They don't want to forgive the debt even though it was from 2006-2007 (12 fucking years). I don't know what to do, do I go to the town hall? School district?

2,"Some of my co-workers the other day were rating everyone at the office, and one of them insisted that I'm not particularly attractive and that I was the least attractive guy at the table, but I was ""so sweet, the sweetest"" and ""how could anyone say no to him he's so sweet"". (And everyone collectively agreed with her). I find this patronizing in a way because I'm insecure about how young I look, how skinny I am, and how attractive/unattractive I am. I don't want to be lumped into the ""sweet guy but has nothing else going for him"" stereotype so how can I fix it or make myself more attractive in other ways? Is this something I should just brush off?",09May2019,6
3,"Hi everyone,

Quick preface:

I’m a junior in high school and I have been fortunate enough to have a long standing friend group of about 7 people that have stuck together well since 8th grade. I’ve been really close with these guys for around 4 years and we hang out or go to the movies every week or two. 

A week ago I hosted a Houseparty at my house and had ~30 people over (including my group of friends) to Barbeque. We all had a great time. Later on in the night some of my other friends (the riskier, more popular ones) got out some wine and we drank a little bit and played spin the bottle late in the night when most people had already left. Normally I don’t drink at all but it’s getting close to the end of year and I wanted to have a little fun after my exams.

Anyhow, a few days afterward, I received a text in our group chat that they had decided to stop talking and hanging out with me. Even this guy who had always been neutral throughout all of our fights throughout our time as friends decided he wanted me out, which really hit me hard. They’re had been times for all of us at some point or another where we were mad at someone, but it never got to the point where this guy had gotten mad at someone. 

How should I proceed? All of the people in my group are very religious and think that I have violated their beliefs. They all think I’m a bad person to be around and I really think that this long lasting friendship should be ruined by something this insignificant.",09May2019,4
7,"Throwaway. So we've recently discovered we're pregnant. We've been on birth control for the duration of our relationship and had no intention of having a child now. She has just completed her education and I am going into the busiest time in my professional program, and looking at debt in the 6 figures by the time I'm finished. We both have professional goals and ambitions that she doesn't believe a child will have any impact on. I think she is grossly underestimating the emotional, physical and psychological impact a child will have on both of our lives. Beyond that impact, on a personal level I do not feel ready, or have any desire to be a father at this time. I'm worried about the effect that this will have on our relationship. I

I want to be there for her and support her through this pregnancy, but feel very strongly that I am not prepared to be a father.  I'm worried about the implications this will have on our relationship, and am already struggling with feelings of resentment towards her and this baby, which I recognize is both terrible and unfair. I'm worried about what this will mean in the long-term. An abortion is a momentary decision that one can regret doing. Having a child you don't want to have is a decision that has ramifications for the rest of your life.

I want to be there and support her. I want her to be happy, and would never want to force her to do something that she is not prepared or comfortable doing.

I guess mostly this is an opportunity to vent. I'm feeling pretty scared, sad, and powerless. if anyone has any support of advice, fuck I don't know. I'd appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - My (30m) long-term 3(0f) is unexpectedly pregnant and wants to keep the baby.  I don't, but I love her and want to support her, but am struggling to do so when I feel like I'm already resenting her and this baby for this decision.

Thanks in advance.",09May2019,1

9,"I've done the research, and my mom is emotionally abusive based on what I've read.

She constantly belittles me and anything I've done. For example, if I make my bed, she'll ask why I didn't clean the closet. She's told me many times that I won't amount to anything and that I will fail in life. She swears at me and calls me names a lot, some of which are very hurtful because they were the same things I was bullied for in middle school (being dark skinned, being short).

She often ignores me for no reason, and will just look away when I talk to her, or go talk to my siblings instead. She is incredibly controlling, she has gone through my garbage and always goes through my backpack. She is also very inconsistent with her behavior. 9/10 times she is hostile and cruel, but sometimes she can be kind. This stresses me out, because I don't know what to expect when I go home. I seem to bother her for no reason. Sometimes if I eat or drink in front of her, she acts as if it annoys her. This lead to me having a hard time eating in front of anyone at all.

She has seen me cry because of how she treats me, but she wasn't phased at all.

She makes me feel so unloved. It is hurtful when your own mom doesn't love you.

I also don't want to become her. I can sometimes see her habits in me, like closing myself off or being annoyed at my siblings for doing nothing.

1 more thing, I don't want my siblings to go through what I have. I'm 15 at the moment, and in a while I will be in uni. I'm worried that with me out of the house, my mom will turn her wrath on my younger siblings.

Any advice at all would be wonderful. Thank you. I posted this once already, but it got barely any traffic, so I’m porting it again. Sorry if that’s against the rules.",09May2019,2
11,"My friend (18F),let call her x, is in her last weeks of high school and has a buddy (17M), call him y, who's lately been accusing her of stalking,Harrassment and other things in that manner.

 But backstory is X and Y have known eachother for about 2 years and last year Y moved to X's school. At first they were the best of friends and shared many secrets. X is very shy but a very good friend that would help Y out on school. At first Y didnt let X hang out with her friends because then Y would get lonely. Y also joined all the clubs X has always been in. When Y was sick for weeks X would get his homework for him and even help him do it. 

Also keep in mind Y's family is very influential im town  and tend to do whatever Y tells them to.

 Now about a month ago Y decided to that he didnt want to be friends and blocked X off of every social media and basic messaging. It started with Y telling his teachers that X is harassing him and not leaving him alone. Then Y told his counselors and parents that X itsnt leaving him alone and stalking him. Now this isnt true since Y has blocked X and theres no ways she could contact gim even if she did. X and Y have the same counselor but all the faculty is siding with Y because of his family and not listening to X'S side. Today X tells me that Y's dad called the head of police and they sent an officer to her school telling her to back off and to stop stalking to him (y's parents told them she was standing at their house  when x doesnt even drive and they live across town each other). Cop also told X that if anyone associated with her even tried to contact their family there would be more trouble.

 So X asked me what she should do. So now im asking reddit.

13,"So, if I’m correct about all my classes I’ll more than likely end up having to do a 5th year of HS, and honestly I just can’t keep attention on the class long enough to actually pick up on something. I find it hard to have motivation to actually learn any of the stuff because in the grand scheme of things I won’t use any of it, I would so much rather learn things way more complex but I’ll actually use. Would it be a good option to instead, drop out, take the GED, go to a community college and get a degree in what I want to do (criminal justice to become a police officer).

I feel very depressed at times and that’s the problem, I feel like even if I asked for help with the slight possibility that I have depression I would just be ignored because it seems like everyone I know has said that they suffer from depression or use depression as an excuse to explain bad behavior, I said that I lived a comfortable life and I feel like I’m even unworthy to ask for help here

18,"I go to a college two hours away from my hometown. Tomorrow is my last day before I head home and a friend of mine (I'll call him Don) offered with dead seriousness that he'd probably be able to take me in for the entire summer in his hometown (three hours the other way from where my hometown is). 

My parents are not exactly amazing. They haven't come to terms with my sexuality despite it being six years since I've been out of the closet (which I don't even feel sad about. Just frustrated.) They want respect from me but can't give it back and I've heard my own mother say (in so many words) that she believes I'm thinking practically about my future, that I'm chasing pipe dreams. My high school job back home would be more than willing to take me. However, Don's family owns a really popular business where he lives and he's sure he can get me a job there doing something I've always wanted to try. Even being in my own house feels like prison. My freshman year in college, I've finally been able to be myself. When I went home for Christmas, I felt like I was drowning just sleeping in my bed.  

I have hardly any money to my name. Barely enough money to pay for gas to get home. I would be living paycheck to paycheck. My parents might take it out on me through emotional guilting. If Don can make it happen... Should I take the opportunity? Everything in my heart says ""yes"" but everything in my brain says ""no.""

21,"Hello. 

TL;DR As the title says I was potentially called a ""fuckin' faggot""  at the gym and am conflicted between telling gym staff now and waiting to see if the offender makes another comment, since now I'll be listening when he's around. (Read for why I say potentially)

Backstory: I was at the gym and walked by a guy when I heard him say something behind my back that sounded something like ""Cut it off already you fuckin' faggot"" (For context, I have long hair, and am a guy) but I'm not 100% sure because I wasn't expecting to be talked to, nonetheless like that, and I also had headphones in. The guy also had airpods in, so maybe he was on a phone call and it wasn't directed at me.

After hearing that I looked at him and he was looking at me, and I kept walking, a bit in disbelief that it had actually happened. 1 minute later I was telling my girlfriend about how I may have just been called a faggot, but I wasn't sure and she was looking around for him, and she said he was staring at us from across the gym. As we were leaving he came walking up behind us and asks:, very aggressively:

""Do you have something you want to say to me?""

Given that he was quite a large man, and who knows if someone might be on the ol' roids, I said no and that I thought I heard him say something about me. He immediately responds no, I say then I must have misheard, sorry and left.

Originally I wasn't going to say anything because it isn't a big deal to me, but my girlfriend is insisting that we say something to the staff when we go to the gym next, since he's typically there at the same time. I don't know his name, but I could pick him out also.

But that's that 🙂",09May2019,2
22,So i’ve had this best friend for about a year now. We’ve had our ups and downs but i think we’re at a point thats better than we’ve ever been. But im starting to get confused. Like i think about her a lot. Like today in english class i was texting her all period and while i was waiting for her to respond i was thinking about her and i got called on by the teacher and she told me to stop daydreaming. Like i get really happy when we message back and forth. And we stay up til like 11 texting. I usually go to bed at 8 but i stay up to text her. I text her during like half of my classes. When i think about her and am around her i just get super happy and feel like i can be myself around her. We’ve been hanging out together at lunch and its been the absolute best. I relized today that i think i have feelings for her but i dont know. Im 17 and i dont know what im feeling. And i dont know how she feels about me. There have been multiple points in the conversations when she couldve left me on read but she didn’t she kept it going. She told me that she stopped doing drugs and dating her ex because of me. She keeps really wanting to find days to hang out. I invited her to go to me and my friends lake day to celebrate it being last week of school and she is uber excited about it. Shes always complimenting me to a ridiculous degree. She also asked me to go to prom with her (granted we are going with a group). She always talks about how she loves my taste in music and the two cds i gave her for christmas are always being played in her car. But i always just tell myself that shes just being really nice. Cause i dont want to get any ideas then have it be wrong and things get awkward. I have no clue whats going on. Do i like her? Does she like me?,09May2019,3
23,"I'm a 24 year old male who just got dumped while I was taking a sick nap by my 27 year old (ex) girlfriend, I'm not handling it very well cause before her I'd had been cheated on and been mentally abused by past girlfriends so now I have these thoughts that something is wrong with me.

 I'm deep in the depression hole since traumatic event that happened at a young age and past relationships, I've been to a therapist at 16 where I was told I suffer from depression but I laughed it off back then, I've attempted suicide more than once in my life I have these thoughts of not being worth anything to anyone and how everyone would be better off without me.

When I met my now ex I told her everything and she accepted me and made me feel wanted she supported everything I did and I returned the support when she needed it, now she up and gone saying she cant have me be there for her while shes not there for me and I just feel everything coming back at once, I just don't know how to shut my thoughts off from telling me to do something stupid.",09May2019,7

I thought she was cute and easy to talk to so I followed her on instagram a few days later and tried starting up a conversation based on a common experience of being on the same long bus ride. I tried branching the conversation out but I was texting way more than her and it was a very very awkward short conversation which ended somewhat abruptly and awkwardly (she said goodbye at the end when I said I'd talk to her later which seems kind of final). It was really very awkward and terrible, I just panicked because I have no idea what I'm doing. But I don't want to give up on this so soon. What should I do/ what would be a good way to start a decent conversation with her? What kind of thing would make you interested? Thanks.",09May2019,1

28,"When I was around 13, I was in a relationship with an older guy who subsequently used me, lied to me, cheated on me...pretty obviously, and yet I trusted him so much that I dismissed each and every red flag. 

All and all, he was horrible to me. I recognise that now. But if he came back? I know I’d take him back in a heartbeat. 

It’s been YEARS. I thought I’d be over it by now. I still dream of him, think of him. I never see him irl, I don’t talk to him anymore. 

It’s not that I love him. I’m disgusted by the things he did to me. I just can’t let go of what happened. I have tried counselling to get rid of the trauma element and it didn’t help me. 

I’ve been in relationships since, but I have deep trust issues and distance myself from everyone I meet. I tend to push people away. It’s probably because he was my first love, too, but I’ve never met someone I felt such intense love for.

29,"My whole life I’ve always been a bit chubby. Currently I’m 14yrs old, 5’4 and 142 lbs. So I’ve got a bit of a tummy. I try to not let it get out of control and I don’t it’s just I’ve always had trouble losing it because I never had a motivation to do so. 
So my family kinda beats up on me about my chub. It’s not life threatening whatsoever and I’m just outta shape. I hear , “you’re fat” more than , “i love you.” This has beat up on me so hard. I feel as if my family on loves if I meet their standards. I understand caring about me and my health but the way they do it is just... hurtful
Everyday I’m always reminded by them that I’m fat. This isn’t the only thing though.
There was this kid I knew and he was pretty toxic. He treated me terribly and was very fake. I can talk about that story for 2 hours honestly. Bottom line it was bullying and toxicity. Luckily I found really good friends and they are the greatest people ever. Well anyway, this kid would act fake by bullying me and then acting all shy and kind around  others. So my family liked him. With time I have forgiven him but that doesn’t mean I have to be friends with him. 
I try talking about this to my family but they cut me off from speaking and call me a terrible person. Only my dad has listened to me and that makes me very happy. He’s the one I’m closest with. Why they call me a terrible person? Because I try to stay away from him and because I have told my friends the real side of the story so they know what to believe (he’s jealous of me and my friendship with others so he feeds them BS). I feel as if what I say doesn’t matter. They defend my bully  more than me. All this keeps adding up. 
Now my math teacher, who is an asshole, doesn’t make things better. She always tells the students that they don’t try and how they are wasting time with her (once again I can talk about that for a while). She always picks on me the most. It sucks. I have heard that you act the same way people around you do. I feel like I function the opposite. I like to do the opposite because I do t want to inflict the same pain on others. All these events have made me known as the source of positivity. I love to make people smile and feel amazing. I genuinely love making others feel worth something. 
Yeah it’s great that it’s molded my character but the situation is still going on and I’m unsure of what to do. Sometimes the words get to me and make me think , am I a good friend ? Am I not good enough? Yeah I know the answers to these questions but damn it’s hard to have this situation. Please give me some advice on what I should do. I need to hear something that will really help me.",09May2019,1
30,"I recently finished the majority of an art piece that I’ve worked on for hours and wanted to share with my friend who is in the same art class. I took it home yesterday because I was falling very behind and would most likely fail if I didn’t spend those needed extra hours. 

I send the picture to my friend with a little funny remark and she responds, “wtf you took it home?” Thinking it was just a surprised exclamation I responded, “yeah I wouldn’t have finished and (insert teacher) cancelled after-school tutorials.” She sarcastically texts, “great fantastic absolutely amazing,” about my artwork I’m guessing. I didn’t realize it wasn’t a super positive comment and said, “haha thanks can’t wait to finish this piece and get it over with.” She replies back, “sometimes I wonder if you realize these messages are passive aggressive.” Still thinking it was just a weird joke I wasn’t getting, I say, “it’s a wild guess each time, your sarcasm always evades me.” 

This was on Instagram, so I was liking some of her messages because I thought this was just a normal friendly convo like we usually have.  She says, “there you go again. and stop liking my messages.” She then texts, “((realizes you don’t know that I’m actually mad)) lolollloll okaY.” 

I was a little confused at this point as to why she was texting in this attitude. She’s never been like this to me and I’m confused about what I did to anger her. I apologized anyway because I might have been oblivious and couldn’t clearly see what was happening. “oH sorry I’m bad at guessing the atmosphere over text I’ll stop now.”

I honestly don’t know what I’m apologizing for. I send her my artwork occasionally and so does she. We joke around about how our teacher overworks us and give positive encouragement to each other. 

I’ve come up with a few plausible theories but I wanted the advice of some helpful strangers online. She is completing the same project as me. She didn’t take it home and has said that she wasn’t sure if she was going to finish on time. I think that I may have annoyed her because it felt like I was “showing off” my artwork to her.

I’m currently in college and ever since the beginning of high school I’ve always felt like all my friendships were at the brink of slipping away. Because of this, I’ve had this unhealthy obsession with trying to be everyone’s best friend and I feel threatened if I see people hanging out with people besides me. It gets to the point where I see someone I consider close spending time with someone else and I develop some anxiety. My fear is that they will eventually prioritize them over me. I obsess over small details like who sees the latest message in my group chats, who is where on Find My Friends( our group of friends all have each other on FMF), and what people say to each other and me. The slightest thing that gives me any idea that people might not want to be around me my heart starts beating like crazy and I find it hard to breathe. My mind races and I have to stop what I’m doing to calm down. It’s gotten to the point where in the moment of anxiety I might lash out at someone I care about because i feel our friendship is being threatened. Then I’ll push them away because i feel like a shitty person.

36,"So, almost a year ago, I dated a chick. At first, everything went well, so well. She was my first girlfriend and it felt like finally, life was granting me a break from all the crap happening at the time. We started dating in January of 2018. In April of the same year, she started saying how there was no love anymore and I had to change a lot of stuff to please her. As she was my first one, I didn’t question it, as I thought that it was normal and every couple went through this. Then, in June, I had a mental breakdown, due to her verbal abuse. I'm a bit overweight, I won’t lie. My weight, however, doesn’t bother me. Every time I would take my shirt off, she'd call me “tubby” or other things amongst those lines. It made me feel extremely sad but I thought it was normal at first. In July, the shit storm started. She strangled me, threw knives at me, pushed me off her bed (I actually banged my head so hard I cracked my skull one time), burnt me, bit me, hurt my genitalia with various objects, accused me of sleeping with some people, such as my cousin or her 12-year-old cousin, forced me to take Zoloft, told me that if I attempted suicide one more time she would make sure I would die because of her and a ton of other stuff I won’t go into, because it’ll be way too long. Sexual abuse was also a part of it. Then, in August, having spent my summer drinking, doing drugs and attempting suicide, she dumped me the day of my dad's birthday. By text. She called me once to say how it was my fault but I was a good guy.

2 days later, it was like it didn’t affect me at all. Everything went fine. And then, it went downhill. She kept telling everyone she met how she didn’t love me and she only stayed with me so I wouldn’t kill myself, stuff like that. And, dealing with some mental illness on my own, I kept going further and further in my darkness until, back in December, I ended in a psychiatric hospital due to homicidal thoughts and suicidal tendencies. After that episode, I assumed everything was going to be okay, that she'd moved on. 2 months ago, amongst other things, she started to date some dude. No big deal, I thought. Until the guy came up to me and grabbed my throat, screaming how I deserved to die. Of course, it had to happen. What ended up happening was the guy got arrested for assault and I got off on self-defence for basically breaking his nose. Anyhow, I thought that, after all of this bullshit, it would finally be done. Since then, she constantly abuses me verbally, reveals my secrets and plays the victim card.

I've went to the cops, but they didn’t take me seriously. At that point, I'm really hesitant. I sometimes feel I should just ruin her life by revealing everything about her online, but I also feel like it would be pointless as it'd be doing the same as her. I also sometimes think that I should just endure and shut up, that no one gives a shit about me or that I must’ve deserved it, that it was warranted and that no one will believe me. I also have trouble sleeping, I have irrational fears of female friends screaming at me, I constantly think that everyone will leave me and I'll end up alone, I have intense mood swings, I feel empty, like if there's a void in my body and I have some flashbacks of what happened. I really don’t know what is wrong with me.

So, dear Redditors, what should I do? What do you think? I honestly don’t know what to do, I constantly think of suicide but something is preventing me from actually doing it everytime.",09May2019,1

40,"Today after my sister made dinner, we got into an argument which resulted in her punching my in the face under my eye. We've had a terrible relationship since we were really young and she's hit me numerous times over the years with no repercussions.

But today, after she punched me, I told her I'd be calling the police. I dialed 911, she dared me to continue to call them, and so I did. She then fled the scene, later coming back while I called the sheriff's department to inform them I'd no longer like an officer to come to my location after thinking over how this may affect her life (like losing her job, her son, and my family ousting me).

I live in North Dakota, so I don't have a choice whether I press charges or not, it's up to the states attorney. My sister is a very rude person who always threatens people, but I don't think she deserves this punishment and I've done this to her. I feel like I'm having a mental breakdown at the moment with constant feelings of needing to end my life. I've done this to her and it's real. Really real. I can't help her other than to testify tomorrow in court in an attempt to get her out.

I wish I knew what to ask you guys. Maybe ""what do I do?""

41,"I’m part of a group on Facebook that mostly shows peoples cars, etc... sometimes shows people snapping a quick pick when there’s an accident or road locked down or whatever else. A guy on there had used his drone yesterday to fly over a hit-and-run on the freeway (illegal, flying over police situations). Curious, as a fellow drone user, I pull him up and stalk a bit. He’s got publicly posted pictures of him flying at night time (illegal), and flying very high, maybe 1500-2000ft in altitude (illegal, FAA limits state 400ft max altitude).  

Confronting him, I tell him that I’m myself a fan of drones, however were he caught, he could face some hefty fines. Instead of thanking me and even giving an explanation, etc, he instead blocks me without saying a word. 

Am I being petty? Definitely. However I’m a legal drone user, who’s currently studying for Part 107 permit so I can use my drone commercially and make money off of it, and anyone who’s in the drone community knows that most of us are respectful of laws and most users crack down pretty heavy internally on people flying without a care for laws. This guy would be very similar to the man flying a drone, and the thing went into a Yellowstone geyser. Flying at 2000 ft altitude could cause a wreck with manned aircraft and kill unknown numbers of people, ruining the hobby for everyone. 

Main question is, is should I report this prick to authorities for stonewalling off friendly neighborly advice?",09May2019,1
42,"I wanna thank you fore reading this beforehand. I'm having a bit of a crisis...

So, here's the thing. I'm a fourth year Bolivian economics student. I do fairly well in my courses and I'm VP of the Student Research team. During the past year, I had the opportunity to do an internship for something akin to what could be considered a National Chamber of Industrial Enterprise. I helped the head economic advisor with some stuff and learned a lot. My boss was pretty pacient and great with me, so I have no complaints there. I do have the issue that I grew to resent the businessmen that lead the whole thing. They were clueless, exploitative and greedy. They earn so much in such a small nation and give little to nothing back. 

I realized that I hated the whole desk job thing that's cut out for my field. I didn't get into the game to work this hard and be ripped apart from my family for so many hours, just to feel empty or dead inside. Plus, most people in my major act like wannabe Patrick Batemans and have this gross back stabbing competitive spirit, that can just put anyone with a sense of humanity off. 

I've been looking into places like UNICEF, Save The Children and other organizations to do another internship, but I don't really know much about the work environment or what the work would actually entail. Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",09May2019,1
43,"Throwaway, because all my friends have my main. Before I launch into the situation itself, there are a couple of important things to talk about. So here's some background about me and this situation. 

For better or for worse, I'm super romantic and affectionate, and I constantly want to cuddle and hug people. Suffice to say, this is exemplified when talking about a possible romantic partner. I'd even go as far as saying that I would prefer cuddling and snuggling to sex (KiNdA qUiRkY, I know.) I've also suffered from depression in the past, mostly stemming from a pretty big lack of self confidence and being abandoned by people I trusted. I'm doing very well now though! I'm a lot happier and those feelings hardly ever rear their ugly head. What it's left me with, however, is a tendency to immediately become smitten with people I barely know. This has happened a couple of times with romantic interests, and I'm instantly crushed when they don't reciprocate my level of interest in them. 

Recently, though, I ended up meeting someone in a very unexpected way. I have a very niche fetish (you can all have fun guessing in your heads, my lips are sealed!) that has a relatively small community compared to stuff like BDSM and the like. So, I like to do role-plays online that highlight that fetish. One of my better partners is someone that actually responded to an ""AD"" that I put up on a semi popular server. We talked a bit, set up the role-play, and got to writing. Unfortunately, I suppose they were busy, because they would often go a month at a time without replying, citing that their classwork was bogging them down, or they had family problems. Obviously, these were very realistic issues to have, so the problem isn't that I don't believe her. The problem started up about 3 days ago.

I was scrolling through my DMs and noticed my old conversation with her. It had been rekindled a month ago, and she had responded maybe 3 times before going silent for another month. Because I'm so easy to win over and I get my hopes up so easily, I opted to send her one last message, more or less saying ""you seem uninterested, would you like to formally cancel our RP so I'm not awaiting any more responses from you?"" She actually responded pretty quickly, to my surprise, apologizing for getting busy again and saying that she'd like to continue the RP, but she understands if I've lost my patience. Against my better judgement, we started it back up again, and it was going well.

About a few hours after we'd sent a couple of responses to each other, I had an idea. Maybe the reason it kept fizzling out was that we had only ever been doing the RP, never talking like we initially did. I struck up a small conversation, and brought up the idea of sharing some pictures (pertaining to the niche fetish). I had a large collection of drawn media that is pretty massive at this point, and she eagerly said that she'd like to trade pictures! She offered up pictures of herself (faceless, obviously) in return. She had a very nice body, and a very nice personality, at least from what I could tell from over text conversation. I got a little flirty, saying something to the effect of ""I wish I'd been there when you took that picture"" and she very sincerely responded that she'd like to have me come ""assist"" her anytime. 

This kind of threw up some red flags for me, as I immediately thought that she might want my money or something. I proceeded with caution, but I let her know that I would absolutely love to come see her any time, but, according to one of our earlier conversations, she lived in Oregon and I lived in California. This is obviously not the easiest gap in the world to conquer. She expressed more interest, and we got to talking about the possibility of a meet-up in the future. We shared pictures of ourselves, and this was the first stage of her almost immediately winning me over. She saw like four pictures of me and proceeded to call me a ""fucking qt"". My heart melted, obviously, and it evaporated when she showed me how incredibly pretty she was. 

Eventually, it got to the point where we were serious enough that I decided to ask if she was comfortable providing proof of her identity (a picture off her with her discord name on it) and I would follow suit. She did, then I did, and at that point I was absolutely smitten. She basically started whining about how she wanted to call me and talk about cuddling and fetish stuff, but because I had a lot of people awake in my house who I would rather not have overhearing a conversation like that, we couldn't for quite a while. We continued to talk and call each other cute, and when everyone in my house went to bed, we started a call.

Y'all, I am a fool for accepting that call. Hearing her adorable voice talk about all sorts of cute shit like cuddling, hugs, kisses (which I already mentioned are my kryptonite) and even some lewder stuff, not to mention that the call went long enough that she started getting sleepy which made her even CUTER? it was too much for me to handle. I have basically been roped in by this beautiful girl online, who has confirmed her identity, asked me SPECIFICALLY not to spend money on her, and shares almost all my interests. But she lives a state away, and neither of us are in a position to just move up or down a bit. I'll have an opportunity to see her in a year when I go up to Oregon for a roadtrip with my friends, but I'm scared of one of the following things happening:

(BACKGROUND: we've been talking like this for about three days at the time of posting, so this is a very early stage of the relationship.)

1. She finds someone else and moves on. This seems surprisingly unlikely, as she seems to have a very strong interest in us meeting/being together, and she's mentioned that not many people are romantically interested in her (why, I couldn't possibly fathom.)

2. We lose contact over the next year. This one scares me the most, because I already mentioned that we've lost contact for long periods of time before. Granted, we never talked much then outside of the role-play, and we certainly weren't romantically interested in each other at the time. Still though, the idea is scary.

3. I scare her away by acting overly interested. Fellas, this girl is actually perfect. I doubt I'll ever meet someone I like as much as her. We've only been talking for three days, but I already really like her. It seems like she honestly likes me too, which is the best part. However, it's only been a few days, and I feel like if I offer to move closer to her or if I flirt too much then she could get a little overwhelmed and drop me. It's happened in the past, and with someone I liked a LOT less than her. I'm trying to rein it in, but my personality just makes me want to smother people with affection. It's been rough.

I might have the opportunity visit her semi regularly starting sometime in the second half of next year, but I would have to maintain my relationship with her for over a year, maintain her interest, and center my life choices at least somewhat around her. I'm absolutely willing to do it if the relationship persists for over a year, and especially if the visit goes well. I've thought this through a lot, and I'm trying not to get my hopes up. I could use some wise words, though. Maybe if anyone else made long-distance work? If you've got any recommendations for what to stay away from? Anything really. I think this is my dream girl, and it's not like I've fallen in love already, but I could easily see myself doing so if I got to see her a few times. I just need some help.

46,"TL;DR: Not happy with where I’m at in life at 21 Y/O. Want to pursue  dreams of becoming police officer and eventually SWAT team in Los Angeles. However, I’m too pussy and it’ll hurt family ties and friends.

To describe myself, I’m 21 Y/O. I grew up in NYC and while it has been fun during my youth, I’m sick of it. My family is relatively poor with no strong connection.s. Frankly, I feel within the next decade, after old members has grown too old or passed away, we will be fully separated and barely a family, considering younger members disinterest in maintaining a relationship.

I’m currently in college after fucking up 2 years and starting from scratch. This is mostly due to several transfers, lack of guidance, and not knowing what I wanted to do in life. However, over the past 6 months I have taken an interest in civil service. It began with firefighting, and now it’s police work. I’ve spoken to some great men that reflect my values in the local force and they’re what I want to be. (My father isn’t in my life, yet lives in the same borough so I never had man father figures).

In these last couple of months I’ve devised a plan. I currently has 10k saved up, will graduate with an associates in June of 2020, and will be able to save at least 40k-50k (I’m an EMT in Brooklyn) in total by September of 2020 if I live extremely frugally and work heavily.

During this time, I want to apply for a range of police departments out of the state, preferably LAPD. I have several mentors equipped with the knowledge and expertise to help me tremendously. This would stabilize my life, and give me a fresh start to life. During my probationary period, I plan on attending a local university while on the force to eventually receive my Bachelors by 24-25 Y/O and eventually join the SWAT.

I’m not new to expensive cities, considering I’m from NYC, so this wouldn’t be a life changing environment or too much of a shock.

Now that you have the backstory, and an idea on my mentality, here’s the advice I need. Joining the police force would destroy half my family. The more “street” ones would not associate themselves with me at all. On top of that, leaving NYC would disconnect me heavily. The close people in my family are aging, and the younger ones barely contact me. (Honestly the hangout with my friends more than they do with me).

As for friends, I have a few and a best friend but they’re mediocre at best (don’t even make time for my birthday). Or maybe I’m the mediocre friend. They often don’t invite me to functions or to hang out with the group. It’s more of “if I see you, I’ll see you” type of thing. I feel like they see me as a part-pooper, as I am sort’ve introverted. I try my best though.

In other words, leaving NYC would result in an entirely new life. New family, new friends, and a complete disconnect from whatever is left there after a few years. Friends would eventually stop calling as well as family. I’m on the edge about it, but there something weird in my guy. I don’t know if it’s anxiety from a potential move, or my gut telling me not to do it.

I need you, kind people of reddit, to help me make a decision. What would you do in my situation? Is there any changes in my plan that you would make? Do you think this would be the best for me? I just need some viewpoints regarding this situation and your opinion.

This is my first, or second, Reddit post. So I’m sorry if I left out any key points. I’ll be sure to add any info and elaborate on anything you guys need. Thank you!",09May2019,1

all his friends go on about how much he loves me (in a friend way) and make jokes about it, and they’ll often make me go with them places so Z will pick us up after because they know Z would always do that for me.

55,"Alright, so a bit of background:

I am a part of a jazz choir, lets call it Envision, at my school. It is only available to sophomore+ boys and junior+ girls. It is a decently large group compared to other schools' groups (around 24 usually for us, about 12-16 for them) and because of the large number, there are always a few singers who don't really carry their own weight and are actually pretty bad. 

Because we (my friends in the choir and I) KNOW that quantity does not equal quality, we have told/asked our director MULTIPLE TIMES to bring down the size to 16 or even 18. The choir members are extremely close (basically a family) and everyone that I have spoken to agrees that the choir should be smaller.

My friends and I are very good singers. We go to honor choirs and festivals all the time, and we are good students as well. Of course my female friends and I were bummed we didn't make Envision our sophomore year, but we struggled through being in the bad jazz choir and a HORRIBLE mixed choir just so that our chances of being in Envision were higher. We made it in this last year as juniors and everything was normal. 

But this brings us to my problem.

Auditions for the Envision were in April, and the list for next year finally came out today. However, it includes 6 sophomore boys (okay fine, whatever) and 4 sophomore girls. There are 21 people with more girls than boys (big no-no) and uneven numbers so the part distribution will be off. 

Also, many of the new people (I am a returning member now a senior) do not deserve to make it in at all, and those who did deserve to make it, didn't. A junior-to-be girl got outstanding performance on her solo (the best performance of that day) and didn't make it in.

I am going to be a senior and one of the leaders for the group next year, and I'm dreading every second of it. My friends and I are going to talk to our director about the list, but I don't really know what to do.

Am I being too controlling thinking that I should have a say in what the choir is like? What should I say to her to make her understand and listen to our point of view?",09May2019,1

58,"throwaway account, I was here about a month ago wondering what to do about my relationship because I was conflicted. it's my only other post. [Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b74zbu/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/)

&amp;#x200B;

I think I might be done. Just, beyond done and ready to leave. I've been thinking about it on and off for a while, but I think the camels back has finally broken, and here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

I very recently had to say goodbye to my cat. I had him for 19 years, and he was my best friend and companion through some of the worst times in my life. I held him when he passed, and kept holding him until he was cold in my arms.

I am grieving not for a pet, but for a best friend and companion who meant the entire world to me. If you've ever had a truly special bond with an animal companion, or dealt with the loss of a beloved family member, you know what kind of pain I am in right now.

I'm not a spiritual person by any means, I'm skeptical of higher powers and things like that, but ever since he passed I have a genuine belief my cat has stayed in spirit to comfort me. I hear his meows, his footsteps, his purring. I felt particularly bad last night and this morning, and was really struggling to handle his loss. When I went to sleep last night, I swear I could hear his purring clear as day, and could feel his weight on me as if to comfort me (he always used to sleep on me). This morning, I woke up and laid in bed for a while, too overcome with sadness to make my way out of bed, when I heard him meow twice and then felt the weight of a cat jumping onto the bed, of every pawprint as it weighed down the blankets.

I told this to my boyfriend, and that it was comforting to think he might still be around, trying to tell me he was okay.

I was immediately met with being told I was going insane, and then a bunch of logical jargon about how my subconscious was playing tricks on me.

If someone doesn't believe those things, that's fine with me, but to tell me I'm going insane and imagining things during what is quite literally the worst point of my life and then give me sentence after sentence of how I'm imagining it or just hearing things? I really don't think I can be in a relationship with someone who is so ready and willing to do this kind of bullshit when I am absolutely devastated and heartbroken over this loss.

&amp;#x200B;

I think my companions death might be the push I needed to end this. I'm not only thinking of going through with it because of this one thing by any means - there's been a build up.

My boyfriend has said very hurtful things to me when he is upset, which he rarely if ever apologizes for. I have been told that I'm 'in love with the idea of him and not him' among other things.

His jokes are often hurtful and insensitive, and he only ever seems to be affectionate when he wants something.

We've broken up many times, and I've taken him back more times than I care to admit, even when he very much didn't deserve it, even when he said every hurtful thing he could think to say to try and 'kill my feelings for him'

Over time, my love for him has eroded, and I think he may have just killed what remained of it.

Honestly, I wish I could go more into the kinds of things he's said and done to upset me, but I am honestly nowhere near in a good mental place right now. I'll do my best to answer any questions but please understand that I am very much in mourning.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being too harsh on him for how he reacted to my experiences, or am I right to be hurt? I respect that not everyone believes certain things, but I feel like there's a time and a place to put that aside in favour of supporting someone who is hurting.

I told him that he upset me by saying what he did, and he has apologized, but honestly I just don't think I can continue to be in a relationship with someone who's so emotionally distant all the time, especially when I most need to just be heard and understood and listened to.

He says he's sorry for hurting me and didn't mean to, but then why would he tell me I was going insane in this situation? How was that *not* meant to hurt me?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to think this over for a little while, any advice would be so greatly appreciated.

About two to three weeks ago, my friend was kicked out of her house and got her phone taken away. She stayed at my friends place for the night, and went home the next day. She came to school a few days after and got her phone again, but then she stops coming to school, responding to texts, etc. I don’t know if she ran away, or is staying at home, or if maybe her dad did something. It’s never happened before but I’m not going to ignore it. A few people have tried texting her but nothing has worked. I’m even worried that suicide might be a possibility.

She’s sort of risky, sneaks out, other “rebellious” things (I’m sure you can guess) common for American teens, and she and her parents don’t have the best relationship. It’s never gotten violent to my knowledge. Maybe she’s living on the streets as she was going to do the day she got kicked out, but I don’t know why she wouldn’t take her phone with her. I’m worried she’s either hurt, or doing something really stupid, or (on my paranoid days) even dead. What do I do?

63,"Hey,


I know this seems trivial at first but it‘s a bit deeper than that. (Anyone wondering btw, I‘m F22)


My favourite band is BTS and I have a VIP/Soundcheck ticket, which means I can see them really close. I love them alot since they help me through hard times... These are the positives but now come the negatives.


I‘m from North Germany and I never travelled alone into a foreign country alone. My friend, who originally wanted to accompany me ditched me and my other friends going there are from different cities and are in different hotels than I would book (I‘ll explain later why).

I travelled to Cologne once alone just for one day that was already too much. I was crying most of the time. I had a stay in Berlin too which where I was alone for one day since my friend arrived later and I had a fullblown mental break down until some internet friends came and cheered me up. (That was also for a concert)


I have many mentall illnesses and one of them is an avoidant personality disorder, which is the reason why travelling (alone) is really hard for me in general. I have anxiety and panic attacks, intrusive thoughts like if I go, my plane will crash, something will happen to me, an attack could happen etc. It doesn‘t help knowing Paris is currently not that safe either. 



I saved up alot of money but the plane tickets and hotelcosts are alot. It would take like 70% if my savings without the additional costs from Paris itself. I couldn‘t book a hotel with any of my friends because they have no problem with uncleanliness and 2 star ones while I have a compulsive disorder regarding that and am overly anxious and worried about the bad reviews stating it‘s dirty. Also they booked before me since my friend who ditched me kept saying she will come but she said no in the end.


I also am in an existencial crisis currently. I studied a subject for 4 years that actually made alot of my mental illnesses worse and I want to change. But to change I need to arrange a document with doctor notes and an individual argumentation why I should be taken for the study subject since my GPA might be too bad for it. I have to write one in the next 2 weeks.


I also have 2 termpapers that I need to do which I haven‘t started. And directly after the concert would be the wedding of a friend. And then the actual applying for the ""new"" study subject I want to study (in reality, I want to switch my minor to my major and major to my minor).


There are more reasons which logically would make me think ""it‘s not responsible to travel to Paris"".


But then I start having a fear of missing out and these tickets I got are pretty rare. it just throws me down a limbo of not being able to decide. Also people are trying to convince me and I would love to see my favourite band and have a good time.



But I know myself and I know during travels I‘m not in the best state of mind. Everything makes me anxious, not being able to speak the language, not having safe spaces. I did these travels as ""confrontation tasks"" as my therapist puts it but every time it‘s the same shit for me. It‘s mentally exhausting. No one ever wants to accompany me from my ""safe"" circle of people I knew all my life and I don‘t trust others too much.


My friends from the different cities say they‘d love if I came and kinda try to talk it well for me but they don‘t know all of my problems and mind.


It‘s so trivial but it actually triggers so much in me. I don‘t know what to do.



What would you advice me? :(",09May2019,2

66,"I’m 22(m) and long story short I just can’t find fulfillment in anything I do. Work, school, hobbies. Nothing. I go to the gym every day, I’m in shape, I have a full time job at bank(boring) and I go to university full time(C student, junior). I’ve had a lot of different jobs; food, retail, sales, call center, bank. I’ve had a lot of hobbies and passions in the past; shooting, working out, gaming, etc. I used to consider myself a hard worker, dedicated, strong, committed, passionate, enthusiastic especially. About 2 years ago I was in a sales job making a good amount of money and was really proud of myself, I felt like I was pushing myself, I was challenged, I was killing it in the gym. But slowly that all dwindled. For no reason apparently I just stopped being myself, I was always so outgoing and vibrant everyone wanted to talk to me or be my friend. I made people laugh and always wanted to be the center of attention some way or another. Yes, I put a lot of pressure on myself with my job and school. But something changed and I slowly turned into this person I don’t want to be anymore, I’m not sad, or angry or anything like that. I just feel empty, no tragic accident or love lost. I just feel bland. Like my color has faded or something. I don’t wanna talk to anyone, I hate any attention any one gives me, when my family is around I practically ignore them, I would genuinely rather lay in bed all day, or find a way to stay away from everyone I can. As this feeling continues I have continued to find things in my life to blame them on, I’ve switched jobs because I thought the root of this feeling was my job. I’ve strongly considered moving away because I feel maybe the town I am is the root of these feelings. But I know at the end of the day as soon as the newness fades it will go back to black. I’m genuinely concerned on how I will ever find long term fulfillment in anything that I do. Every new job I’ve had since I think to myself about anyone who’s worked there for a long period of time.. “how have they worked here this long, I can’t imagine myself doing this forever”. I can’t fathom doing anything career wise that I would be happy doing. I’m not expecting a vacation 24/7, 365. I just feel like I need something more in life, and I don’t know how to find it..

71,"Ok now I know what everyones answer will be but hear me out.
I grew up with two older siblings a brother and sister. We were raised by a single mum who was honestly terrifying.  She was very strict with everything, we had alot of rules and punishments. We weren't even allowed to cry it was a rule, so I couldnt very well talk to my mum about this. Anyway mum was a truck driver and she had a collegue who at the time mustve been in his 60s odd. He was mums best mate (no sexual relationship there) and he would visit us once a year for 6-8 weeks during the winter because we live in queensland where its warm. Anyway i enjoyed his visits for the most part he was a low key father figure but lots of fun and a typical truckie with lots of stories, brewing his own grog, chain smoker etc. So having someone so jovial around was a welcome change from mum, we could get away with a few more things and it was fun having him around.  My sister however (2yrs older) always seemed snobbish and distant with him, I didnt understand why untill i started getting older and realising the subtle touches and gropes this man had been giving both me and my sister for years, ever since we were 4 at least. The biggest example is when we would go to bed he would lie in our beds for at least 15 mins and well ""cuddle us"" i always thought it was a bit weird but being the youngest i was dumb. So i just put up with it. And i had my methods of deflections like id show him all my stuffed toys pushing them between us so he eventually got bored and went to my sisters bed (we shared a room) so thats enough details. 
Anyway now this man is in his 80s and im 25, he is also dying of COPD emphysemia. He was admitted to hospital yesterday and hes on oxygen etc. He might make it out but he might not. My mum called me and told me i should give him a call. I said yeah ok but I'm busy at work right now and ended the call. Now the reasons why i want to call him: without his visits my life wouldve been hell and misery because mum was so mean and violent, he taught me how to play cards, games, pool also alot of life lessons, he took us our camping, just dad stuff that i REALLY enjoyed. I inderstand what he did was wrong but without him i feel i would've been alot worse off. And ive kept in contact since i moved away from home, at least once a month I'll send him a message or call.
The reason i dont want to call is now that im older I know the seriousness of the situation, i know its wrong and disgusting. But the main reason is i now know i wasnt the only victim, my sister had it alot worse.... a few months ago i gave him a call and my sister and brother are religous now and really insufferable, they beleive they have to remain separate from people who are non beleivers which includes me, so this man and i were talking about them and then we got onto the topic of my sister during the conversation he said "" yeah i always knew sistersname was going to turn out different, we used to be so close so much so i nearly got the tip in"" im guessing he was reffering to those nighrs in our beds. My insides died when i heard that, disgust and horror washed over me. I know my sister is a bit aloof but now all her actions make sense why she was distant and snobby towards this guy, why she got married into the church at 18 to get away from this family, why she doesn't like talking about her past...... im so sad for her. After that i didnt call or text him untill now when mum mentioned hes basically dying. Do i put on a face and call him out of respect or do i just not call and let him die, but i would feel guilty if i didnt call....help please?",09May2019,3

Before I give yall the details, I know I fucked up bigtime and some of the blame is on me. Also my asvab score was a 90 and I passed the navy advanced placement test for nuke school.

This year I took physics and pre calc so I could possibly get into the navy's nuclear power program. But I enlisted under an (AECF) et/fc contract and this would be my back up if my pre calc grade wasnt good enough to get me into the nuke program. I took physics so I could get some exposure to the subject because regardless of what job I get I'm gonna need it. But I was under the impression that I didn't need to pass it to graduate high school. So when I started falling behind I didn't really put any effort into catching up. Then 4th quarter rolls around and my guidance counselor pulls me into the office and tell me that I needed this class to graduate. So I cracked down and started trying in the class and so far I'm pulling an 85. My recruiters were in the loop this whole time and they knew what was happening and they were telling me that if I didn't graduate on time i wouldn't be able to join the navy and I might be administratively separated from the navy. Summer school graduation for my district is July 24 and my ship out date is July 25th. In my contract it says nothing about not graduating on time it just says I must maintain my qualifications I had prior to shipping and I would still be graduating from highschool.

88,"So first off, I am a long time observer. Sorry for formatting I am on mobile.

So I moved to VA about 2 years ago, and I didn't have any friends when I moved here. On my first day of school I was having trouble with my Chromebook, so I  found a girl sitting next to me that goes by the name of Gianna ( Had to change her name so I wouldn't be exposed because she uses Reddit as well.) I asked her for help with it and she lead me through the basics, as I never used a Chromebook before. After that we became friends. 

Over the days our friendship got stronger and now we are currently like sisters. I try to take her everywhere with me when I have the chance, and I am there for her all of the time. But I soon realized I didn't see her as a sister. She started liking this guy named George ( Again, not trying to get exposed,) and I pretended to be happy for her whenever they started dating. Though on the inside I felt crushed as I had feelings for her like nobody else. They got back together three times in a row, and each time I felt even more discouraged to tell her my feelings.

Then she started messing with touret cards and it told her an ex will be coming back to her. She seemed so happy and was excited to be with George again. Let me tell you I was so angry and sad, I just pretended to be happy though. Now she likes this guy named Rodger, who I used to like but never tried anything. And she's going to ask him to the dance that is coming up soon! When she told me she was going to ask him. I couldn't take it anymore.

89,"(22f) I am going to give a short back story for context. I had to drop out of high school and work full time at 16 after my dad left, because after 20 years of mental and sometimes physical abuse my mom cant/wont work. I would also like to say that I don't blame my dad everyone is human and i still love him. I got my GED when i was 19 i am now 22. Through my employer i can get a bachelors in business administration for $1600 all online. that sounds great but i have always wanted to be a nurse or go into the medical field. But now i am not  to sure of that either. I just know that i love helping people and i also really enjoy helping people with mental health issues/disabilitys (my dad) . while going to school i will also be working a full time job. i am starting in a college prep program that will be all of my pre requisites and because i left school so young i feel pretty stupid and have a hard time with basic math. what should i do? where should i start?",09May2019,1

92,"So it was this year, I had a concussion that wasn’t getting any better and was getting worse, so my regular doctor told me to go to the emergency room. So my mom and dad took me to the hospital. And it was endless ours of pain to the point where I was smacking my head against the wall( while is still had a concussion) they were putting these weird medications in my body through the most painful IV I’ve ever experienced through the whole 8 hours we were there. And they put me through many different scans and multiple MRIs (plus I ha e EXTREME anxiety and chronic panic attacks wit claustrophobia). All to find out I have a cyst in my brain. It’s been a couple of months and I’m going to therapy about it but I’m still having flashbacks to that same day and I still be the pain from my head and the IV. And the restlessness I felt in the hospital bed, and the multiple panic attacks I had In the MRI. 

And I know , people have it WAYY worse. It’s jsut That I’ve never experienced  something like this before and It’s getting to the point where if someone even mentions the word hospital I freak out.

I came out as bi to them awhile ago and they seemed fine with me dating girls, but I’m unsure of how they would feel about me dating guys. My dad is sort of the type that seems like he would be weird about me being with a guy, so idk. Plus, my boyfriend is 2 years older than me so I’m not sure how they would react to that.

96,"I feel so lost. All my life I've had the tendency to be more of a 'backseat driver' and let other people make the decisions and take control, and somehow I have a hard time doing this myself. Whenever I decide something it's usually just the easy way, and I find it very difficult to know and feel what I actually want (in the moment and also in future plans)
Whenever things get a little hard I have a tendency to quit while I'm ahead, because I fear I won't succeed, or I'm afraid it isn't what I really wanted, and the way I'm now is safe and familiar. I convince myself maybe there is nothing better out there for me.

This wouldn't be such a problem if I wouldn't constantly second guess myself and waver between what I think I should do.

The situation I am in now is that I am working in retail. Some days are good, but I'm always wondering whether I really have to keep doing this all my life, and if I can't somehow find a job or carreer that makes me excited.
However when I try to make plans to work somewhere else or try to get educated in a new profession I get scared, take the easy way out and tell myself my job isn't so bad, and that it's normal to not have a job you love.
The same goes for my relationship. We've been together for 6 years, and mostly it has been amazing, but I get into these moods for weeks or days where I convince myself that it isn't what I'm looking for, and maybe I should try something new with my life, since these doubts keep reoccuring, and I feel I am not completely being myself.

I also have trouble deciding between events that fall in the same day, or attending or staying home. One moment I genuinly feel like I wanna stay home and I don't wanna go, the next I suddenly feel a pang of regret and decide to go anyway, and a lot of times I end up unhappy no matter what I choose.

Sometimes I wonder whether this is just normal everyday stuff that everyone deals with. Everyone reflects upon their decisions, it can be hard to know what will make you happy in the end, and in a way it doesn't really matter what you decide as long as you stick with it. For some reason I can't bring myself to have confidence in my own decisions, because as soon as I decide A, I will somehow end up back at B.
This also goes for lot of opinions I have, as if I'm in constant debate with myself.

I've also wondered that maybe I just have a negative mindset, and will always find some way to be unhappy or doubtful, and that I should just practice being content with what I have.

It's driving me insane. I try not to focus on it, or put too much energy into it. Sometimes I give myself a limited amount of time to decide, or I try to cut of my thoughts when I 'm being negative or over analyzing.
However sooner or later the feeling that I'm unhappy and I'm not doing anything I really want to do always resurfaces.

97,"so as the titles says I’m looking to buy a home with my boyfriend and it’s looking like his parents MIGHT tag along. I personally don’t mind short term, but long term clearly no thanks. They’re great people lovely parents and just amazing. I’ve never had issues with them. Unlike my family, they’re sweet and joyful. They’re not catty/gossipy like my family. 

anyway I started mentioning it to my mom little by little and she told me “ oh yeah your grandma already told me you rather help them out instead of help me out but it’s okay” and I explained to her it’s not even like that. 

First I’d like to say my family, including my grandma,
Can take things WAAAY out of context. I simply told my grandma I was thinking of getting a house with them SHORT term to 1. get the hell out of my moms &amp; 2. Cannot leave them stranded. We only discussed this matter about 10 mins. Not enough details for her to completely sabotage what I said. 

Second, I explained to my mom that I would help her out in a heart beat. If she needs more help now I’ll help her out. However, my boyfriends parents are only receiving income from his dad because his mom makes only 100$ a week I think from a family business which is kind of a terrible story for another day. So I understand we will have to help them out for a year or two until they can save and get their own home. 

my mom actually took it well as in she didn’t burst out crying or walking out on me mid conversation. She heard me out and I heard her out, but I’m afraid she might be a little bit but hurt and I don’t want her to be. She gets really defensive quickly and also we’ve lived in horrible situations a majority of our lives and she’s afraid FMIL will try and run a house I partially pay for. Which I understand but bfs parents aren’t like that and I’ve made it clear to BF that my house will be how I like it. My mom is being supportive but I can’t tell if it’s real or fake or if she’s holding her true feelings back. It being so close to Mother’s Day I don’t want her to feel betrayed to belittled or left out. 

Like I said I would do the same for my mom/stepdad and siblings, but I know my mom can afford much more than my boyfriends parents right now. I’m also just really butthurt that my grandma told my moms I know it’s her daughter and all but I asked her not to, but I should’ve known and not said anything. 

Should I reassure my mom I got her back or leave the situation as is?

TL;DR my mom may or may not get salty and or be upset of the situation and I don’t want her to be upset bc I’m willing to do anything to help her out if and when she needs. My grandma is a big mouth and I’m upsets.",09May2019,1

Today, we both decided to clear all our old texts with people, clear our following list of people we don't speak to, and old photos. When my fiance started photos, I saw a full blown dick pick. It wasn't his either. He had just deleted all texts and his secret photo storage app too (I knew about it, my old picture were in there).

He said that sometimes, if you watch something on YouTube, your iphone won't ask if you want to accept an airdrop, it will simple let you.

I have no idea what to do about this. I’ve tried various forms of therapy and nothing has helped with this specific issue.

109,"*I originally posted this in AITA but it was removed by the mods because I'm seeking advice. I haven't edited the post, just copy and paste. I am seeking advice on how to handle this situation...

So I am a father of two, a 6 year old boy and an 8 year old girl. I did my daughters nails the other day and my son expressed interest in wanting to paint his nails.
It's fine with me, I went through a phase of painting my nails but I was in middle school and it was a goth phase.  

I asked him if he thought kids at school would make fun of him, he said that some boys wear it occasionally.  So at bed I mentioned maybe we could do it over the weekend that way we would take it off if he wanted, before school on Monday. 

Now, IATA because I didn't consult with my wife first before telling him yes. It didn't even cross my mind, I guess, because I didn't think she would feel any differently. 

I was wrong.

She says it's not right. She won't tell me the exact reason why, but that it's because he's a boy and basically boys don't wear polish. She asked me ""what if he came and asked us to wear a dress"" and my response was if that's what he wants.

Yes I would be scared for him. If he really liked the polish and wanted to wear it at school, I may try and persuade him to wait until he was old enough to better comprehend the backlash he might face.

I feel it's natural for kids to want to experiment and I don't believe some things are gender specific. I have no idea who my son will grow up to be and to like and I don't want to teach him that expressing himself is wrong.

My wife says I am making it a big deal, its just polish. But I guess I'm surprised she feels this way. I didn't know she had that type of opinion on these things.  I feel like she is being closed minded and defense/scared for him, and also what people would say or think. Especially her parents. 

I just...I'm scared what could happen in the future. What if my kids come forward with other things they want to try or express themselves with and she stifles it because it's 'not right'. I am probably blowing it out of proportion. 

So AITA for being upset with my wife and thinking she's stifling him?

And what do I do now? If I don't help him paint his nails, I feel like I am betraying something I believe in. But also if I do it, I am basically saying F you to my wife.",09May2019,0

113,"Hello r/Advice,

I come to you today asking for assistance on an issue that I don't know where to start approaching from.

My girlfriend hasn't been to a doctor for any kind of care in years. Not because her family doesn't care, but because they cannot afford health insurance.

She has been gaining weight since last summer and we suspect (her and I) that she probably has some sort of thyroid issue because it runs in her family. Her weight has never been an issue in the past due to eating so we don't know what else could cause this (Pregnancy has been discussed but we know that she isn't)

So here is my question. I am a college student that doesn't make very much money currently, but I want to take my girlfriend to the doctor so that she can be checked out. What steps can I take to get her an appointment so that she can be checked on. I worry about her because this sort of weight gain doesn't seem normal for an 18 year old woman.

114,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I’m currently a 20 year old student in college transferring to university pretty soon and I have a job in retail. I’ve limited my availability to around 4 days a week to which I always get scheduled 4 days in a row since my place has pretty bad turnover rates. Essentially only myself and one other associate are still regularly with the store, as other associates have been leaving or greatly reducing availability because they found better jobs. I like a lot of the people I work with and the job itself is easy albeit boring and often annoying (customer service job) and my manager is pretty nice to me, but she is always pushing me to do more and essentially put work in favor of school (the one other regular associate is 100% good with this, and this is favored by my manager). I’m taking summer classes so I don’t really get a break this upcoming season, yet she wants me to open up my availability under the assumption summer is just a free for all where I’ll have nothing to do even though I already mentioned I’m continuing school. I have a huge math exam due Monday night and she denied my request for someone to cover my shift so I can stay home to study. Just little things like these are stressing me to the point I’m having a hard time concentrating even when I am at home because I just keep ruminating over these issues I have to balance.

119,"So I posted this in r/dogadvice as well and I'm not getting much luck there so I thought I'd post here as well. 

TLDR; neighbor out sign on door saying I abuse my dog. I've only had this dog for a bout a month and I'm working through the issues the best I can, but now I'm worried I'm abusing my dog. Don't know what to do. 

So title says it all. My neighbor put a sign on my door saying it's time to re-home my puppy or time to start taking care of it. 

I'm thinking her note is due to constant barking my roommate thinks it's due to my puppies low weight. 

Here's my take on this, I've only had this puppy for about a month she's five months old, honestly she's a dream. The sweetest girl ever but I do know that her barking can be obnoxious when I'm not home. I know because I talked to said neighbor about this earlier this week. I've been working on getting her used to her kennel and we've made great progress, she runs right in whenever I tell her too since I feed her in there and give her special treats in there when I can. My neighbor mentioned she barks constantly and I apologized and asked her for tips and she gave me some, no problem. 

The other possible reason for this could be her weight. I took her to the vet when I first got her and they said her weight was just fine (18 pounds black lab pit mix). I took her again just this past weekend and she gained a pound but I saw a different vet and she said she's on the skinny/low end weight Wise for her age so I need to gradually start feeding her more so she's getting two cups a day rather than one. I just found out my puppy also has roundworm but I'm not entirely sure if this would cause her to be skinny as I thought it would instead cause her belly to swell. 

Either way I'm kinda hurt, kinda confused and honestly kinda mad that my neighbor went about it this way. We've talked about me trying to train her and I think I've mentioned to her before her previous owner left her in her cage for 12 hours at a time so it's been difficult getting her to enjoy being in there. If the barking is the issue, I can understand her concern but my puppy hasn't spent more than six hours in her cage at a time. I'm very busy but I make sure to be come home at lunch breaks and when I had class I'd come home for this time as well. If I'm not home more than likely my roommate will be. She used to sleep in her kennel and she would only bark for about 10-15 minutes then go to sleep but I decided to let her sleep with me so I'm with her every night. 

I try my best to be home with her when I can and I play with her to try and get her energy but I still have to work and run errands and there's nothing I can do about this, but as I said I come home during break to let her out and that's the shortest amount of time that she's in her kennel then has to go right back in. 

If it's her weight I understand she is very skinny but I'm well aware and already taking precaution. Her previous owner also didn't take her to the vet and gave her boosters and stuff at home (turns out you shouldn't do that as sometimes these shots are fake)  so we had to restart her shots pretty late but we're up to date and after we get rid of the roundworm I think we should be golden. I cut back on walking her too much since she was not up to date with shots so I know she never sees me out with her but my house is wide open so she can really run about inside. 

I returned the sign and asked my neighbor to text me so we could talk about this in person since I'm not sure where exactly the concern is coming from but now my roommate and I are afraid we're actually abusing this sweet little girl. I need people to be honest as this is my first puppy as an adult and I know sometimes trying your best isn't enough.

I don't want to get into the details of my work place environment, but there are two people at my job that I have a toxic relationship with, and I am getting very strong urges to kill one or both of them. I'll just say it has to do with romantic feelings for one of them. 

This isn't a ""Oh haha I want to kill my co-workers, they're so annoying!"" post. I'll be sitting there, trying to be productive, or do something at home, and all of the sudden this horrible feeling will brew up inside of me. It feels like the way a wind feels from a strong storm, like at first there is nothing, then all the sudden this powerful force comes in an takes over everything - it drowns out your hearing, it grows stronger and stronger, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. 

I find myself having thoughts of moving towards the decision incrementally - just buy a gun, maybe go to the range for a bit, maybe bring it to work one day in my car. 

I am looking for a new job -  I have an interview next week - but leaving my job gives me the feeling of having ""lost"" - like I lose because I am the one that left, and they won because they got rid of me. Very often everything I have in my life - all my ambitions, plans for self improvement - they all disappear, and all I care about is destroying these two people. Just writing this is getting revved up again. 

It's like I can't imagine anything would make up for the ""defeat"" of having let these two ""win"" - if that makes sense. I can't picture anything wiping it away, it's like killing them, beating them in the end, is the only thing worth doing with my life. 

Right now I am quite isolated. I am single, I go home and I lift weights, I run, I read history, I practice a language I'm learning, and that's it. I've tried expanding my social circle - [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) events, language classes (in addition to duolingo) - but nothing has stuck. I have the suspicion that if I got other people in my life these feelings would go away, but I don't know how to make that happen.

Then the feelings go away some how, and I can forget about it for a bit. But they keep coming back. Even when the work situation vacillates and I'm on reasonably good terms with them, I'll go home and then I'll start to think about killing them again.

I tried going to my doctor for some kind of meds, but he put me on these anti-anxiety pills that made me feel so bleak and sad and flat. Obviously I have stopped taking them.

I took physics so I could get some exposure to the subject because regardless of what job I get I'm gonna need it.

So I cracked down and started trying in the class and so far I'm pulling an 85. My recruiters were in the loop this whole time and they knew what was happening and they were telling me that if I didn't graduate on time i wouldn't be able to join the navy and I might be administratively separated from the navy.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been at my work place for about 6 months now. For the most part, everyone has been fine. I work with a bunch of men and a few women. People can sometimes be crass, but it's generally not terrible. A few weeks ago, one coworker made a comment about someone being a ""faggot"". Before that, someone bragged about not letting their child date a black guy. I was immediately put off by those comments. I lost respect for them, but just kind of turned a blind eye. Well, about two weeks ago, my boss performed a very disturbing gesture that was witnessed by myself and the manager next in line to him. I sat on this for few days before I told my husband, and with his urging, I went to HR to report. He was shocked and was like ""that is not OK"".

HR took it seriously and started an investigation. They kept it anonymous, they even had me be ""interrogated"" to make it look like I had no idea what was going on. All of my coworkers denied everything and the investigation was closed. the HR department promised that they take retaliation seriously and this would not affect my changes of changing departments.

Now, all my coworkers are talking about who reported these ""false"" accusations and when they find out, they want to make that person's life ""a living hell"". I know this is retaliation, but I am fucking scared to go back to work. These are grown adults making horrible comments and gestures and we work for an international company that says it cares for their employees.

My husband told me to back to HR and tell them about what my coworker are saying. About how they are trying to find out who said it. I think they are suspicious of me, especially since these comments were made in my presence. I have just anxiety, I can barely sleep, and I have been nervous all day. I am trying to look for another job or at least change departments at my current job, but I have no respect for my boss or coworkers anymore.

My husband has been 100% supportive, but he's talking about contacting attorneys and I just don't know if that's the next step. I don't know what to do. I want to back to HR, but now I just feel like I shouldn't have said anything. I know I deserve to work in an environment that doesn't make me nervous or feels hostile, but now I just feel like I fucked up.

This job wasn't going to be my career, so it's not like I'm worried about being black-listed. But I am still pissed that I have to deal with this. I guess I just want some support, maybe some guidance. I don't know where else to go or what I should do.",09May2019,2

145,"House flies. Not just a few, but dozens every week that appear in waves. Door always stays closed, and all windows are closed and have screens.

I noticed this last year around this time as well (spring time in CA). One day I came home to find about a dozen flies just perched on our window, inside of our home. They were easy to kill off, but they seemed to appear overnight and I would like to find out how they are getting inside.

After a fly-free fall/winter, this week I began to see them lazily flying throughout the house (making them easy to kill), but found most of them aggregating on our windows again and not flying much.

Now the second, more disgusting part. Last year, in mid-late spring, we found maggots crawling into our dining &amp; living room from underneath the floor moulding. The wall they were coming in from faces outside. There were dozens over the course of a week, with the majority of them coming in over two consecutive days.

After some research, I learned that they were likely in the later stage of their larvae form and simply seeking a location to pupate (they were not coming inside to feed on anything).

After witnessing that, we promptly called several pest control agencies who all reached a similar conclusion that there is likely something small that died (we could not smell any foul odor that would be given off by something larger) inside our wall, and the best thing to do would be to let whatever died just naturally decompose. The alternative would have been to do some investigative searching through the inside of that wall; cutting into the wall, etc.

Seeing the flies again this week is making me think the maggot problem isn't going away either. 

My guess is that there is an opening somewhere in our window unit(s) where the adult flies can enter from the inside of our walls. They must be pupating inside our walls, maturing in there, and entering our home through the openings in the window. And as for the maggot problem, I believe the moulding simply is not creating as effective of a seal as it should be and we are getting some adult flies in our home that way as well.

Currently, our solution involves using sticky traps for the maggots and an electric fly swatter for the adults. Any advice on what we can do, or what else I should investigate? Thanks for any help.",09May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So I turn 31 years old on Monday, I live in the state I was born in and have lived in my entire life and absolutely hate it here. I work a shitty retail job that I've worked for the last 5 years that I absolutely hate and every day severely impacts my mental and physical health as all I do is sit in an office chair all night. I have had severe depression for as long as I can remember and I feel as though every time I take an initiative to change my life something always ends up happening that throws a wrench in my plans. 

So the crossroads that I'm at currently is, I dream of just packing up my car and leaving the state and start a new life somewhere else. I think about this constantly how nice it would be to start over somewhere where it's warm all year around and I don't have to worry about brutal winters every year. The only problem is, I have a family who even though they don't say they do, I know they depend on me. I live in a house full of people. My grandmother, Mom, Sister and my niece who is 8. My mom has an OK job, my Grandmother who's in poor health has a fixed income and my sister does not work at all. I bring it up quite often how I wish I could leave but I feel like they need me around too much even though my mom insists she'd be OK without me but something deep down feels wrong about leaving them. My niece has had a tough life, for her age. She suffers from mental health problems, such as ODD, Depression, and Anxiety and is bullied at school as a result. Her father is currently in prison and won't be released until she's well into high school and I feel as I'm the father figure in her life, even though my depression has gotten so bad I'm rarely around as I work 3rd shift and sleep all day then lay in bed all weekend until it's time to go back to work again.

&amp;#x200B;

All I know as of right now is that something in my life needs to change, desperately. This is probably the worst I've been off mentally in a long time and turning 30 has really made me feel like I am a complete loser in life. Still working retail, still living at home, I have no idea what I want to do with my life at all other than knowing that whatever it is I don't want it to be here.  I feel like there's 2 sides constantly tearing me down the middle trying to figure out if it's the right time to leave and try and start a life or if I should wait it out until she's a little older. Is it selfish to just want to take off? Am I an asshole if I do? I just hate feeling like peoples lives will fall apart if I'm not there. I'm not a family oriented person, I have no desire for relationships or ever having kids of my own but I feel like I owe it to my niece to be there for her and if I leave she'll grow up horribly.

154,"Sorry if this is messy, just got done crying

Alright here's some background, I'm currently doing a marching band camp for beginners, and even thought it's only the third day I keep getting mad at myself for not playing my music correctly.
 I really should be able to play it, it's pretty simple and the rhythm and notes aren't that complicated. I've clapped, counted, and looked through every measure to make sure I have my fingering right all day but I just can't get it.
 Not only that but I suck at stepping. I keep pointing with my left and ending with my right when it's supposed to be the opposite. And what kind of idiot doesn't know how to step to the beat? This one!
 As a seventh grader I was told that it was still okay for me to write in the fingering for my notes by a high schooler, but it really isn't. I can tell all of the older kids are disappointed that I can't seem to get any of it right. I can't even seem to memorize the first three measures!
 I've wanted to cry so many times today, and not just because of the physical pain, but because I'm so disappointed in myself. Of course I haven't cried until now, which I've been crying for a looong time to make up for all tears i kept in today.
 I really want to be able to hug somebody who isn't my parents and have them tell me that everyone was just as bad as I was at this stage, but not only is it not true ( everyone else is doing really good ), who would I even be able to hug.
 Despite talking to so many people these last three days I guess my quietness just pushes me away. Or maybe it because I'm such a needy asshole. Nobody should really  have to listen to my problems when they already have plenty of their own.
 I'm sorry if this became rambly, I just need to get this off my chest. I guess what I really want to know is how to stop fucking crying just because I'm having difficulties. I really shouldn't be crying so much over something like this. I know I can't be good at everything and I know that just because I'm trying hard doesn't mean I'll do good, but man it hurts bad when I can't do something so simple. This entire post is just me beating myself up, rambling, and just in general being a nuisance. So anyways how do I stop crying about this, and how do I stop beating myself up about it.

I’ve recently stopped drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana and tobacco (I rarely smoked tobacco), as well as stopped caffeine. In addition my diet has been pretty poor, primarily I believe I’ve been putting too much acid in my body. Recently I’ve had no appetite, I’ve been burping a lot, my doctor says it’s possibly due to some digestive order, possibly GERD or gastritis, I get these weird sensations in my head (I can’t honestly distinguish whether they’re headaches or not), I have a staph infection in my right ear (this was probably caused by the fact that I have eczema in both of my ears, I’ve also lost partial hearing in that ear (this is what scares me the most), also I get these weird pangs of pain in my chest and in the back of my head. There are other symptoms that I can’t think of right now as well, but I was hoping people who have had experiences with cancer before or who are medical experts can help me out with what I’m dealing with. The people around me tell me that I am alright, but I can’t stop thinking that I might have it. I don’t want to ask Google because every search result just confirms my suspicions. Please help.

She is hesitant to give me anything just saying it's a mood/faze shes going through. I am no dummy and know shes just not willing to tell me the whole truth. I keep pushing, and pushing. Maybe it's me and how presistant I am.. then the other night comes out and tells me she thinks she is self conscious about her weight, that she use to be ""100 times thinner"". I try my best to make her feel as if she's the most beautiful thing in the world every day, it seems nothing is working anymore. She doesn't believe any of my complaints or small gestures anymore.

She explains that she told her that she eats loudly but she does nothing to correct it. I should also say my friend has issues. Like I don’t know if she’s on the spectrum, she did see a therapist for years, but she can be very sensitive and forget social cues.

169,"Hi, so I'm a 16 year old girl and like any 16 year old girl, I have those impending feelings of loneliness. I've never been in a relationship or even had my first kiss. But it's something I crave constantly. I think about it all the time, all I want is a boyfriend. Sometimes I go through phases where I dont feel as lonely, but other times I feel incredibly lonely and it's like a pain I can even describe. I'm going through one of those phases right now. 

Something I really struggle with is feeling sad after I hang out with my friends. Two of my really close friends are in relationships. One of them is my best friend of 10 years, who's boyfriend I haven't met yet and the other is dating a boy in our friend group. Within my other friend group, at school, only one of them has a boyfriend who is older than us and their relationship isnt anything to be jealous over, to say the least. But pretty much every one of my other friends has had experience, at the very least, even if they're not in relationships currently. And then there's me. The one who hasn't even had their first kiss and probably wont for a while. I mean, I always knew I would probably be the last friend to experience this stuff, I accepted that a while ago but I just didnt expect it to hurt his much. And it's not that I'm insecure. I've always been incredibly confident and self aware. I know I'm not the most attractive girl out there but I also know I'm not the most unattractive. And what I lack in looks, my personality makes up for. I have plenty of friends, I'm very sociable and friendly and I'm an alright person in general. I've never looked in the mirror and thought ""wow that's ugly"" or anything. So in short, I love myself. I just cant figure out why nobody else loves me. 

Anyways, back to my original point. Whenever I hang out with my one friend group, I feel incredibly lonely after leaving and sometimes even during. This last weekend I went to a party with them and I've never felt lonelier. For one, they all go to a different school than me and I didnt have my other friend from the same school to tag along with. So the entire time, I was standing there awkwardly while my friends talking to people they knew from school. Even when I tried to talk, they just ended up giving me weird looks. Secondly, my best friend got wasted by accident and we had to take care of her most of the night, which made it kind of crappy in general. When we got back home, and got ready for bed, to top it all off, as we were laying in the dark talking to each other, my one friend (not the drunk one) starts going on about how much she loves her boyfriend. I'm lying there doing my best not to cry or yell or both. It's not that I'm not happy for her. I mean her and her boyfriend are the cutest couple ever. Seriously, they arent even like a cringey high school couple, I could see them getting married one day, that's how good they are. I'm so happy for them both. But these feeling of happiness are over shadowed by my intense feelings of hatred and resentment towards them. I'm so jealous that they're a happy couple, that my friend has a boyfriend and I dont. It makes me sick to my stomach, it makes me cry. 

After we talked about her boyfriend, I started to express some of these feelings. Not the ones of resentment, but just how I feel lonely and like I'm going to be a virgin forever. Both my friends tried to reassure them that it wasnt true and I would find someone soon. They both said that they can't wait for me to find my ""person"" and itll be awesome when I do. They also said that if theres no guys my age that I like, then theres no reason to date anyways. My one friend tried to tell me that dating wasnt that crazy, it was just like having a best friend that you can kiss. A lot of what they said was true. And they were being really sweet and genuine. But still, for some reason these words of encouragement just made me feel even worse about myself. 

Whenever I'm at school and I see couples together, it makes me so angry. Especially when there's terrible people who are in relationships. How is it fair that these people have found someone and I haven't? I know I'm only 16 and I have nothing to worry about. I'm not really behind and theres tons of people my age who haven't kissed. But theres also a ton of people who have and who lost their virginity recently. It's all happening around me and I feel fucking awful and lonely. I dont know how to stop it either. I'm usually really great at handling my feelings and moving past them but this is something that has been a running theme for me this year. It's kind of bringing me down a lot. I feel like crap after I hang out with my friends which sucks because that makes it feel like the entire day was crappy, even if it wasnt. I just dont know how to deal with these feelings.",09May2019,1
170,"One week ago today I got in trouble with my college. Fall semester 2018 I got a girls information to log into her college account and looked at her grades without her permission. There was 4 other people involved with getting the information and looking at her grades. This all came out a week ago because I had a falling out with one of the girls in the group and she went to the teachers and told them we were looking at the entire classes grades. The teachers and their boss all pulled us out of class and took statements and typed them up and gave them to the dean of students. We got pulled into the office yesterday by the administer of the health program I am and we got told that all 5 of us will be on probation for the next year. I reached out last night to the girl who I logged into account and sent her an apology and asked if she would like to meet up and talk about anything. She agreed to meet me today after a final and we talked about everything that went down. She told me the girl who had a falling out with was trying to get the other 4 of us kicked out which is why she came forward with this information right now around finals. I apologized to her and explained what happened and took responsibility for my actions. We talked everything out and she's accepting my apology but not forgiving me. The victim also told us that the rest of the class is very upset with us. There is another student who is so upset that we did not get kicked out that he is e-mailing an organization that grants our college the accreditation in order to licensed in the state. Our entire class is 10 people. There was 5 people in the wrong so 5 people in the class are mad at me and will not speak to me. I was told the 5 people in the class feel like they are also victims and will not be able to get over what we did. I have an entire year left working one on one with these people along with going to clinical with some of them. I was planning on apologizing to our class but finals are over so I will not meet with again until next fall. I could reach out and message each individual and send an individual apology, message in the group chat, or just wait until we come back over the summer. Also how do I go about an apology to them when I did not harm nor intend to harm anyone of them. Would if be okay to say something along the lines of I let you down as team members and show some serious remorse for my actions? Or would if be okay to just not message any of them and hopefully we can just move forward as a class from this entire situation.",09May2019,2

To explain the title more, I don’t mean like financially independent, but mentally and emotionally independent. 

I honestly cannot tolerate being alone for extended period of time. It drives me nuts. It feels like death is slowly swallowing me, until I’m with someone I’m comfortable around again. 

When I’m in class, if there’s no one around me who I’d be comfortable speaking with (though I don’t need to actually speak with them), class can be torture, and I can barely focus. 

It’s even worse when I’m separated from my twin brother. If I’m away from him too long it feels like I’m hollow. 

I think it would be really cool to be more independent, so I wouldn’t have to feel like I’m practically attached to someone else’s life. I think it’d also be nice to feel like an individual person.

I'm not looking for a pitty party whatsoever just to start here. I just wanted to explain my situation and ask a question.

So, me my daughter and partner have been saving up for VIP tickets for a meet and great for my daughter Scarlett, she's the ultimate fan, she has gotten ever single merch she has found with her own money each time. 
Recently, we got evicted from our home due to me being on Ontario works (welfare) and not being able to afford rent as well as them using those terms to evict me so they could raise the rent as I was grandfathered in at the lowest rent rate. 

So since now I had to spend my saved jojo meet and greet money (which I've been saving since we heard about the concert) for first and last on a new place that I'm hoping to find. 

All of this is causing me stress as I've already told her I've saved.. as a family unit, were devastated. My question to you or any jojo people is:

Are there any more meet and greet packages available for 3 people including my 7 year old Scarlett. And what are the lowest prices for this.. honestly I've got like 47$ to my name.. 

I'm doing the best I can and I am desperate. I want to take her, for a moment she will never forget, for her to view a true role model. And also so that I can show her that I can do this for her. Something I try to do myself is to make her feel as though she can count on me for anything. And letting her down is my worst fear, with my mental health issues I tend to be in psychiatric care but I'm doing well and then this happened... so I'm lost. I hope to get a response soon.

This is gonna be awkward for some people to read and potentially answer, and I understand that. I simply need advice from someone with an open mind.

First, I have been with the woman of my dreams for 4 years now. We’ve been married just short of a year. While we were engaged I joined the Armed Services. I have now established a home for us and she will be joining me this Friday at 2330. Quite literally, 48 hours. 

Here’s where things get weird for some people. 

I have been wearing women’s underwear for several years now. Much longer than I have been with my wife. I wear them for many reasons, a few of which include comfort, multiple different styles and materials, and the exhilaration of the taboo surrounding it while I remain the only person knowing the secret. 

I’ve never been good at revealing some of my older secrets to my wife. Any advice on how I can bring this to her without changing things, or having her feel like I’m a different person from the man she married. Any advice helps. Thank you.",09May2019,2

190,"This happened today. My parents got a phone call from the teacher, saying that I had either copied another student, or let them copy off of me. I was unaware of this before my dad confronted me. As the teacher did not talk to me about it. The assignment was a very easy major grade, find 6 quotes from 3 sources that go with a theme, and give your opinion on them. It took me less then 20 minutes to complete, and I let my friend copy it the day it was due, as he had only finished 30%~. I thought nothing of it because I assumed that he would change it up enough that it wouldn’t be recognizable(he didn’t), and that the teacher wouldn’t care anyway(he did). Now I’m weighing my options for tomorrow, when I’ll see this teacher. My current plan is to say I had no knowledge of this, and let my friend confess to copying it in the morning when I went to get breakfast in the food line. The plan has some flaws, most notably cameras in the dining hall, and my friends lying ability. The food area does have cameras, but this was almost 2 weeks ago, so the footage is probably long gone(but it still worries me). I talked to my friend on the phone earlier, and I told him this plan and he agreed with it. Option 2 is that we just come clean, and see what happens. The problem is that in my school, if you’re caught “plagiarizing” you are taken out of all AP classes, as well as National honor society.

194,"Tl;dr is the title.

I have a pretty boring life. School, work, and gym are the 3 reasons I’m usually not home. I do go out every few nights to hang with friends, but we don’t really do anything special. I have only 3 close friends. Other than that I don’t really have any friends. I know a lot of people, but I wouldn’t really consider them friends since I don’t hang out with them. 

About me: I’m muscular, 6’4, I’d say I’m attractive, I have a veryy nice and loud car, expensive clothes, and live in one of the richest cities in California. 
Not to sound cocky but on paper, I sound like a guy plenty of girls will want. The height, the body, and the money. But that isn’t all girls look for. 

I just don’t have the personality. I’m boring and i’m very quiet. I definitely have the romantic part down, and the loyal part because there isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for my friends or my girl. 

But I’m very boring and I’m very quiet, and I am very insecure about it. My first and only serious relationship was after high school, and after we broke up she went off on me about how she always has to be the one to make conversation and she gets bored. So I kinda have some PTSD from that, along with trust issues but that’s a long story. Anyway.

I’m the first date champion. No matter who the girl is, I can give her the most amazing first date and we do something very fun. I can keep this up for a few more dates, but the first is always the best

After I start going out with a girl a few times and I’m at the phase where she sees me as the “about me” part of this post is when I get very distant, then we stop talking. I don’t want her to get to know about the “boring and quiet” part. 

I’d rather stop talking to her and she sees me as what I want people to see me as, or I feel like I keep talking to her and she realizes how I actually am and we stop talking anyway

195,"It's currently 4.45 in the morning where I am and I was violently sick around half an hour ago. I've been suffering from emetaphobia (fear of vomiting) for over two years. I don't know why I'm sick, I don't know where I picked it up (considering I wash my hands 24/7, with both regular soap and water and hand sanitizer) and I have no clue what to do about it. My throat and side still hurt a lot and I will probably be sick again as there are still fluids in my system. I don't want to be sick again, this feels like a nightmare to me and I can't do anything but wait it out. In the past two years I must have had over 100 panic attacks and at no point have I been physically sick until tonight. What's worse, my birthday was 3 days ago and I planned to meet some friends at the weekend. Is there any advice or reassurance anyone can give?",09May2019,1
196,"There’s a guy that I’ve been seeing for the last month and it seems like we’ve bonded a lot. Today, he replied to a Snapchat story where I didn’t look very happy (personally I didn’t intend to look sad at all, but a couple people thought I was upset in the pic) asking what was wrong. 

There was a few things on my mind that gave me an annoying buzz of anxiety so I decided to tell him about it. Basically, it was an issue where he said I should stand up for myself, bc I’m being taken advantage of, and I told him that I hope that I wasn’t, which he wrote

“Either speak up about how important it is to you or keep telling yourself that it’s all harmless”
Alright, I’ll give him that, it felt a bit harsh but okay. I replied “Lol that’s asking a bit much, You should know me, I’m the village doormat” (referring to how I get walked on all the time). 
Then he writes “Well if you’re not gonna lookout for yourself you’re fucked.” Which again, I found to be a bit harsh, but this time I told him that he was being insensitive and why would he ask what’s wrong when he’s gonna make me feel like shit when I’m honest? It *really* upset me and put me in a bad mood all day.

He did apologize, and explained that he wasn’t trying to make me feel bad but thought that that kind of advice would be helpful (and that he’s said similar to others, but never got my reaction) and I explained that it’s hard for me to know when someone’s being mean or not, and that when something makes me feel a certain way I just go with it. I also told him I felt like he was lowkey telling me to “toughen up” and it felt really hurtful.

I’ve decided to leave him alone for a little bit, but I’m a bit confused as to if my feelings of him being cold were founded. Was I being too sensitive, or was he actually being insensitive?",09May2019,1
197,"Hello. I am posting here because I need advice with my rather personal problem. 

Here's the gist of it: I'm 22 and the thought of sex makes me dizzy, lightheaded, and physically ill. Sounds crazy right? It's pretty common for guys my age to clean their pipes. However, no matter how hard I try, I can never give in and just go for it. I have an irrational fear that something will go wrong and I'll permanently damage my body. 

It's easy to see this and instantly think ""well you're just asexual, deal with it."" The problem is that I'm definitely not asexual. I still have many romantic feelings for other guys and would absolutely love to be in a relationship. I always go to sleep wanting to do something cute with a guy, such as stargazing, seeing a romcom movie, having a relaxing dinner, going deep sea fishing, heralding to the world just how much I adore, cherish, and want unfettered happiness for this person, etc. These are all romantic fantasies of course, but it's inevitable that the sexual aspect of a relationship will always be there. Very few people would be a part of a sexless relationship, which heavily cripples my dating prospects. 

My past with sexual things is very muddy. I was taught the basics of biological sex in 7th grade at a non-religious public school and have never touched on it again until 12th grade. During my senior year, I took Anatomy and Physiology because dissecting things sounded fun to me at the time (and a bombshell cute guy was in the class!!) However, the sex unit came up, and we got into penises. I have no idea why, but when the teacher started putting up images of male genitalia, I got pretty lightheaded. I realized that something was wrong, so I got up and tried to ask the teacher to use the bathroom. When I got to where she was standing, I suddenly fainted. They said I was out for a mere few seconds, but I almost hit my head on a desk, so it was kind of dangerous. I was ushered out of the room in a wheelchair and into the nurse's office in a few moments. It's kind of funny thinking back because I kept on apologizing for fainting (and I might have left a bad impression on cute bombshell guy!). The nurse guessed that I fainted because I hadn't eaten enough due to skipping lunch, but I knew that this wasn't the sole reason. I'm not a sickly person and have no health abnormalities as far as I'm aware of- no low testosterone or thyroid problems. Something was wrong, and penises had something to do with it. 

Now I'll get this out of the way before it's brought up- I don't experience body dysmorphia and the sight of my penis doesn't frighten me. It's only when I'm exposed to other parties that may show penises, such as in porn. I've never taken the plunge into porn to desensitize me, and the thought of watching porn and seeing all the gross bodily fluids come out is gut-wrenching. 

As the title states, I've never masturbated or even seen cum before. I do experience nocturnal enuresis, or ""wet dreams"", but they only happen once or twice a month and that's it. I feel so disgusted and ashamed when it happens because even though it's involuntary, I still feel like I did something dirty. I definitely don't go long enough to climax, it's pretty paltry.

Since I'm this far, I might as well mention past trysts. I have made out with 2 guys in college during parties where I got mightily intoxicated. The sessions only lasted 10 minutes max each and I'm glad because both guys took advantage of me. Neither got far enough to even get any of my clothes off, though one of them did stroke my dick in my pants and I didn't feel dizzy or lightheaded. It sounds bad, but the only time I feel like I can consent is when I'm drunk. I'm way too scared to even think about sexual acts with others without being under the influence. Perhaps this could be a remedy for a future relationship? It doesn't sound healthy, but what can you do. 

I haven't mentioned any of this to my family or friends because it's kind of embarrassing and they may think I'm sick. It's a tacit, self-evident truth that humans love sex and it's crazy to think otherwise. Look at any media in any culture and sex will likely be either explicitly mentioned or superficially hidden in not-so-subtle layers of subtext. Whether religious or not, people know that sex is great and it makes you feel good. 

I might as well mention my most recent attempt at curing my psychosis. I downloaded this cheesy fujoshi game that involves a bunch of gay guys in a camp setting and you get to choose between 4 of them. I'm not sure why I thought this would be a good idea, but seeing real porn and people spewing their fluids everywhere sounded too gross for me.

Everything was going fine in the game until the shower masturbation scene, where the protagonist goes into the shower to fap to the cute guys around him. God it was DISGUSTING! It wasn't even real and it gave me nausea. It even showed the white cum jettisoning out of the bubbles! I couldn't take it and I haven't touched the game since. I'm sure it gets way more explicit too. I would have loved to see the romance embedded in the game, but seeing that cum made me have second thoughts.

After all of this...what do I do? I know what I'm attracted to and I can find good fap material. However, something in my gut gets physically antsy whenever I even think about masturbating. I'm scared that this psychosis will continue throughout my adult years and I'll never find happiness with someone else. Is there anything I can do? I apologize if this post is long-winded and tedious, but I'm not sure what else to do! 

Thank you for taking the time to read this! It's very personal and not something I would ever be comfortable talking about elsewhere.

199,"I've been battling with gender identity and self expression for my whole entire life. I don't really have a good concept of gender, to be honest. I get that people are born female or male or whatever, but I don't really understand the differences between people. Personality, habits, tics, etc. is something that I can't understand. When I was around age 4-7 I remember I didn't understand why people separated themselves by gender, and as a child I always wanted to be more masculine. I've always aspired to be what the world would consider 'manly' and I look at boys and wonder why I don't look like them. Though I don't always feel that way. Sometimes, I am completely fine with womanhood and female things, however, I find that a majority of the time I want to uphold society's standards of being a man in myself. 

I go through times when I just wonder where I fit. I don't understand the difference people feel between male and female. I have an idea of what the difference is, but I personally don't really feel it. I want to be masculine and feminine, sometimes I want to be seen as female, other times I do not. I don't want gender to be a big deal in my life, but I'm surrounded by a society that is separated by gender, and I'm so confused. Where do I fit? 

My self esteem isn't very high, either. I've always felt that I was 'lesser-than' due to my height (let's just say I'm not far off from being considered a little person), I had very bad experiences while living presenting and acting like a girl. I did many things that to this day I still regret and hate to think about. A part of me wonders if my gender confusion stems from my bad experiences living as a girl, but at the same time it doesn't feel that way. I don't have a twisted idea of what womanhood is, or of women. My most prominent role models have been and are women. 

Self expression has been a dead end in my life. I've attempted clothes, art, music, etc. and none of it feels quite right. I can't artistically express myself, I feel like. I have no trouble explaining how I feel and what I like and dislike, but it's not very productive, as I don't have people who are willing to listen. 

I don't know where I fit. Gender, society, etc.. I'm at a loss. 

Not to mention, the feeling like I'm a much older person trapped inside of a young body. Maybe it's just because of my life experiences, but I'm often mistaken for someone older than I actually am. I often forget my age, too, and my youth.",09May2019,0
200,"i took entrance exams in 5 schools, and i got into 4 of them, including my dream school. this university has a great architecture program (if i recall correctly, it’s top 2 out of all the schools in the country), and i was one of them very few in my batch who were able to pass the exam (out of 20 of us who tried out, only around 7-8 of us were able to get in. it was difficult, not gonna lie. i barely reviewed too, so it was a huge thing). most of those who didn’t pass, including two of my close friends, filed for reconsideration. they both took civil engineering.

okay, back to what i was saying: here’s the thing. it all came down to choosing between two schools.

school A has a fairly new architecture program, which isn’t really a bad thing, but it’s a big leap of faith. it’s a fairly new school, actually. it’s a modern, advanced school with the best technology and great professors (from what i’ve heard). it’s pretty pricey, especially considering the fact that it has three semesters per year, not including all the other fees like textbooks and the materials i need. i don’t want to stereotype, but the people here are known to be snooty rich kids. i know not all of them are like this, but i’ve met quite a few and observed the others, and i sincerely am worried about making friends here. the thing is, though, they’re really generous with scholarships. and they give them out at any time to any one, regardless of their financial situation. so that’s a huge factor, since i don’t really want to be a financial burden to my parents. plus, it’s the closest college to where i live, so i don’t have to dorm anywhere. easy commute there and back again.

school B is my dream school. my parents both graduated from this university, and so they’ve hyped me up my entire childhood, telling me that they hope i go here. it’s one of the oldest schools in the continent and one of the top universities in the country. the people here are a mixed crowd, and the events here are the best. plus, they have a great quality of education, with years and years of proof to back them up. the architecture program here also has three semesters, with about the same tuition as school A, so big yikes. plus, they don’t offer scholarships until after your first year, and they scarcely give them out to students, so even bigger yikes. worst thing is, if i chose to go here, i’d have to dorm, since it’s far from where i live, and commuting to and back isn’t practical at all. so that would cost us even more. 

my parents told me the choice was mine, but i wanted to be practical, so i chose school A, so as not to be of burden to my parents. it was a tough decision, and i spent hours and hours thinking about it, but i’m slowly starting to accept it.

but remember my two friends who filed for reconsideration? they received the news that they got accepted into school B, and as much as i want to be happy for them, it just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. i could have chosen school B, i know, but like i said i wanted to be practical. i sincerely want to be happy for them but i can feel my heart sinking into my stomach. i know i’m coming off as selfish, but can you blame me? i congratulated my friends then turned the app off, and now i feel like crying. i know that your future doesn’t depend on which school you go to, and that it all depends on how you do in the situation you’re in, but holy shit, this was my dream school and i’m sorta regretting my choice now. i don’t know what to do.",09May2019,1

207,"(Kinda gotta get some background to help you understand, bear with me; may be a long read)

When I was young, younger than I can remember, my parents divorced. This did not cause any issues at the time. My mother lived in Kansas, my dad and I (and my brother) in Washington. We saw her for 4-6 weeks every summer.

Eventually my dad re-married to my current step-mom,  Lily. I was fine with this change. She wasn't the nicest, but she was tolerable. One of the summers while at my mom's house, 2016 maybe, my mom noticed cuts on my older brother's arm-he was going through some things at the time. Instead of talking to him, my mother quickly made the rash decision to accuse Lily of child abuse.

She got extended warranty of us, but eventually we got back to Washington, but we lived with our grandma because there was a restraining order stating that we couldn't be within 500 ft of Lily.

There was a lot of moving during a period of time up until 2018 or so, when it was just decided that my brother and I should just get to choose where we wanted to live. My brother chose Kansas for his own reasons, and I chose Washington because to me it was more ""regular."" Over the course of the year, I came to regret my decision, as tjings had changed a lot amongst the family and social stuff at school while I moved around.

The next summer, which happened to be this summer, I decided that I wanted to lie in Kansas now. I didn't really know why I wanted to, but I made the decision anyway. My mom simply canceled my plane ticket and let me live there.

Life was great there. A bit of an Eden. I had a romantic partner (who I still talk to), lots of friends, and lots of great times were had. I loved it and most certainly did not want to return to Washington, but that's exactly what happened in December.

I've been here for 6 months now-I am still sure I don't like it. Courts have decided that it is not in my power to choose where I live, which is what I though, and is the reason I was forced back into Washington. Trial is still at an undecided time, but my GAL has said that she will ""recommend"" to court that I stay in Washington.

I don't want to upset my father here, but I still would like to move back to Kansas. Here is a stark contrast to Kansas-big cities, suburban oceans of houses, lack of friends. I feel like a social outcast even though I know I'm really not, just because people liked me so much in Kansas.

How do I convince my GAL to ""recommend"" differently? Or get to Kansas some other way? I know its in the Judge's hands, not hers, but I'm sure they will strongly consider her say. It feels like she's against me even though she's working ""for my best interest.""

However, I am the youngest out of all my coworkers, and all of them (there is 7 of us in total) are a lot older than me (I am 21, and my coworkers are all 34 and older), except one girl whose the same age. 


All of the older people do not take me seriously. Most of the older coworkers have been there longer than I have. There was even a coworker (35 female) who was hired 6 months ago to actually be our manager, but she unfortunately was not fit for the job, so was downgraded to a regular employee. 

This specific coworker absolutely refuses to listen to anything that I say. For example, there is a specific and STRICT rule about not being on your phones during work ( you can get written up for it). She will pull out her phone during busy hours, scrolling away and away. I try and tell her to put her phone away, but she ignores me. She will ignore any and every task that I ask her to do. I have told my bosses about it, they know it already (they have seen her on the cameras), and yet she is still doing it. 

This is the same with everyone really. Some of them see me as like, a little sister or niece. I’ll ask them or remind them of their daily duties to which they jokingly say something like “Why is a child bossing me around?” Or “Girl, i know what I need to do.” And will still not do what I ask. But when customers complain or get upset with something, my coworkers will gladly acknowledge me as “Their Manager”, and hand off the customer to me. 

I want to believe this is happening because I’ve been pretty friendly to all my coworkers, never had anything against them. But now that I have a title, they still treat me like a kid. 

None of them (excluding the ex-Manager) treat me badly, they are nice. But i just want them to take me seriously now. 

Anybody have any advice on how to be assertive to older coworkers? I really need help.

211,"\[TL;DR: My step mother was abusive and its seriously getting to me. How can I prevent my past from effecting my future?}

&amp;#x200B;

My\[F27\] step mother (I dont even like to regard her as that anymore) was physically and mentally abusive towards me when I was young and it still haunts me even after I think I've gotten over it.

&amp;#x200B;

I lived with my Step Mother and Father from age 2 to 15. During that time my father stayed in his room for most of the time (later I found out that their relationship was strained, so I guess he kinda avoided her), while my stepmother was around the house a lot, so my father was kind of absent during this time of abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few things she did;

\-Beat me with whatever she could pick up whenever she was upset.

\-Pull my hair, dragging me around the house.

\-Choke me.

\-Threaten to kill me, call me a bitch and slut.

\-Never let me go and hang out with friends outside of school, and I was to leave the kids alone that came over, so my brothers could play with them outside because they 'weren't my friends' even though we all were.

\-She had this LOOK she would give me whenever she wanted me out of my Fathers room, when I would go in to try and spend time with him. Every time, about 5 minutes or so after I went in, she would poke her head in and ask my dad a random question, then give me that Wide Eyed, 'You'd better get out here' look.

\-I was forced to lie to my dad on multiple occasions whenever she would hurt me. One day she woke me up by whipping me over her knee to spank me and cracked me head open on the dresser. She told me to tell my Father that I tripped. 

\-She would get my brothers to laugh at me while she told me to pull down my pants in the kitchen and bend over to touch my toes while she spanked me in front of them because she was mad, or I couldn't find something she was looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

And much more...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, after 15, my Father and she divorced. He and I had a rough time and I went to live with my biological mother.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 18 I ended up giving my step mother a second chance, mainly because I almost ended up on the street after moving out with a boyfriend, who was the type of guy to punch holes in walls, and lose his temper.

&amp;#x200B;

I was naive enough to let her put an electric bill in my name because I didnt know what bills really were and she said she'd pay it. She didnt and when I moved out, I found I was stuck with a $1400 bill.

&amp;#x200B;

I never gave her any chances after that but had off and on communication with her solely because my younger brother lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

23 - Now, Im way out of state and have a going on 5 year relationship and my stepmother still tries to get in contact with me through forms of manipulation, having my previous high school friends spy on my facebook profile and knows any (probably all)  conversation(s) I have with my younger brother.

&amp;#x200B;

For a long while, I thought I had put all of this behind me. I thought it didnt bother me, and that I got over it.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I found that this was not the case...Memories of everything she did to me still haunt my thoughts, and the other night, I ended up having a panic attack because I was wondering why I'm so disappointed in myself sometimes, before reading a passage about how it goes back to your childhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of all of this, I;

&amp;#x200B;

\-don't do well with mother figures, in fact I try to avoid them.

\-think I disappoint everyone.

\-try to do everything as correct as I can the first time.

\-If I slip up and think someone is mad at me, I unintentionally  'attack' myself, thinking that I'm worthless and shouldn't even be around.

\-I dont even know if I can put panic attacks on this list because it was just that one.

&amp;#x200B;

This all being said, I am a happy and optimistic individual and I face my fears as head on as I can. I fought the majority of my anxiety and low self esteem, and I can happily say I'm doing good for myself.

Me and my girlfriend sleep on an old, squeaky twin bed frame and raggedy mattress in the living room. My sisters all have their own rooms, my 18yo sister has a job and isn't made to pay a single dime towards anything simply because she's saving for college, but if I was to go to college, I'd still be made to contribute financially. My mom doesn't clean, cook, walk the 2 dogs, NOTHING. So there's always dog piss and shit everywhere. My dad is out of town for work nore often than not and when he is home, my mom puts on a show and cleans, cooks, the whole fuckin 9 yards. And when I act like I shouldn't have to pay them anything, they threaten us with an eviction. I don't get it. Plus the lights are in my name because they owe past due bills, I think that's payment enough for this shitty situation, not to mention the depression and suicidal stuff I deal with daily (mainly due to the living situation here) that makes it difficult to even function. Idk. Opinions anyone?",09May2019,1

220,"This will be a fairly short explanation. As well, throwaway account for VERY obvious reasons. TL;DR at the bottom. 

For a good couple of weeks my best friend was having a hard time dealing with his mental health. To be fair, he’s always having a constant battle with his mental health. Most days he’s chipper and handles it pretty well. In my eyes, he’s strong and he’s usually got a collected head on his shoulders. He got through those couple of rough weeks and is ultimately doing a hell of a lot better now. 

So how did I find the note? Well he asked me to do him a favor. We live together and he wanted me to make sure that one of his pets wasn’t going to die from cold weather symptoms since we’re having a cold spell. So I went into his room to do what he asked and this box was in the way. I wanted to know why it was so heavy and looked inside. It was all of his typical belongings but this book stood out to me. It had an interesting cover and I was curious if it was a journal or an actual book because I like to read. I open it up and the first thing I see is my name written down. I couldn’t not read it. I’m not nosey. I would never have opened it if I had known it was a personal journal for him. 

Currently, he’s in a much better place and I’m pretty sure this note is fairly old. Old by about a month or two. And yes that’s not necessarily old in the eyes of some people but a lot happens when you live together. I don’t think he’s at risk to himself right now and obviously he doesn’t want to do it. I’m fairly certain he hit his rock bottom for the first time in awhile and writing it out made him feel a lot better. My question is, what do I do? I love him. He’s a brilliant friend and I want to do what I can. Should I bring it up to him? Should I leave it? I don’t have much time to care for him since I’ll be leaving soon. 

TL;DR found a fairly old suicide note that my best friend wrote and I don’t know how to go about it. I want the best for him and I don’t have a lot of time to try to provide that.",09May2019,1
221,"I’m an 18-year-old guy, very popular at my school, with lots of friends, and I’ve never had even a taste of alcohol in my life. Of course, this is highly unusual. But I’ve never done anything “harder” than caffeine - not one rip off a pen, vape, nothing. My reasoning for this is two-fold. The first is that I do have a family history of drug abuse. My dad’s side has a couple drinkers who are abusive, but the relationship between the drinking and the abuse is still unclear to me. On my mom’s side, my mom has also never drank a day in her life because her mom was and is a raging alcoholic, who is now homeless because of her drinking. The second reason is that my personality tends to be very obsessive. When I started working out, I wanted to be in the gym every day for hours a day, to the point where I even overtrained and injured myself and had to sit out a while. Whenever I meet someone new, particularly in the girls department, I want to talk to them all the time (although I don’t indulge this tendency). When I find a new book or tv show, all i want to do is consume it. I bake chocolate chip cookies, I eat the whole batch. You get the idea. This makes me fearful that I would not handle alcohol very well.

As you can imagine, this choice on my part has been somewhat socially exclusionary, although less than you may imagine. I don’t mind being around drunk or otherwise under-the-influence people, and I’m not on a high horse about my own abstinence, so I’m welcome even in spaces where the booze is flowing freely. Sometimes, I’m even appreciated as being the one guy with his head on straight enough to see to it that stuff doesn’t get out of hand. I can really think of only one formally organized event that I was left out of because I wouldn’t have been drinking, and although it sucks to not get invited, I know up top that I wouldn’t have had a good time if I went, and the organizers of the party knew that too. To be perfectly honest, alcohol has no allure to me whatsoever beyond it’s social ubiquity. I don’t really care about experimenting or seeing what I’m missing out on. If it wasn't such a common social fixture, I’d face no dilemma.

Of course, I’m posting here, so I do have a dilemma. I’m about to move to college, where the frequency and social importance of drinking is likely to be a lot more than it is now. Right now, the group I spend most of my time with is comprised entirely of drug users - ranging from occasional drinkers to frequent users of coke and psychedelics. They are great guys, and I enjoy spending time with them, and I know at their respective colleges, each of them will be joining a frat. The college I’m going to has a very small emphasis on greek life, but it still is social clout, and the type of guys I’ll probably want to be friends at uni will likely be frat guys too. My point here is that I don’t want to be socially limited by this choice, which I know is to some degree an unreasonable ask, and I’d, frankly, like to be cool and popular in college the same way I have been so far. As I type this out now, I’m sensing that I’m coming off as incredibly shallow and immature. But my social life has been my single greatest source of satisfaction over the past four years, and while I don’t think anyone would consciously decide “jeopardyman doesn’t drink. what a weirdo, let’s exclude him,” I can’t help but feel that, by not drinking, I’m shooting myself in the foot.

In two weeks, my friends have planned a huge grad party, and I know one purpose, among others, is “let’s get jeopardyman fucked up before he ships off to school.” I’m very nervous about this, and I’ve gotten conflicting advice from a lot of people close to me who I think have my best interest at heart. Some people say, “You’ve made it this far, I really respect you for it, don’t give in just to fit in with other people.” Others say, “try it once just to see if you like it and be disciplined about it going forward.” Some others say, “dude you’d totally crush it at [insert frat]” or “you’ve gotta learn to drink before college.” And I see merit to all of these points.

The fact is that alcoholism has wreaked havoc on my life and, often indirectly, has been a big part of the struggles I faced growing up. I don’t want to be a blowhard, but I’ve overcome those struggles and done very, very well for myself. I’m going to one of the five best universities in the world this fall, I’m graduating high in my class from a very good private high school (full scholarship for both of these), and I truly believe I’ve set myself up to pretty much accomplish whatever I want to do, and to be the dad to my kids that I didn’t have, and to give them a stable upbringing that I never got. And the thought of having worked nearly two decades for all this only to throw it away so I can party in college makes me nauseous. I don’t wanna be David Foster Wallace or Kurt Cobain or pick-your-promising-young-person who derailed what could have been a long and successful life with substances. On the other hand, a part of me thinks, “You’re being so overdramatic and embedding so many assumptions into your thinking about this. There’s a huge chasm between trying a couple beers with your friends to cap off senior year and being institutionalized for dipsomania. Just practice healthy drinking habits, and you’ll be good.” Note on that last part: I know that the culture that entices me to drink in the first place will not be one that puts a premium on healthy drinking habits. Fuck me, I guess.

For obvious reasons, I can’t talk to my mom about this, and she’s really the only adult I have. So, drinkers, teetotalers, alcoholics of /r/Advice : WTF do i do?",09May2019,1
222,"I was diagnosed with depression a little over a year ago, but had not been dealing with it too much since then. For the past month or so, though, my depression has been pretty bad. Within the last couple of days, it's been crippling. I don't feel very suicidal. I'm too exhausted to try to make that work. I really just want to stay in bed all day or go to some random isolated forest and just lay there on the ground and let nature take its course. Like, I want to die, I'm just too lazy to do anything about it. I don't know how to stop feeling this way. Honestly this is probably stuff I should talk to my therapist about but I don't see her for another week and time is going by so excruciatingly slow.

223,"We're both of college age, but I've literally been with her all of my life so I just don't know how to process it. We've had some traumatizing things happen in our childhood, and it's so strange that I feel like we've coped so differently despite being twins, and I feel horrible that I feel good while she's been suffering this whole time. I've handled things pretty well and I'm really optimistic about my future, so when she told me that she has been having suicidal thoughts and hate herself, I was in shock. She's my twin sister, we're supposed to be able to understand each other more than anyone else, so I was in such shock. I've tried giving her advice and support, but she's outright said she will not talk to a therapist nor will she give me all of the details, and she don't think she ever will.

225,"So the situation right now that is that I’m a college student living at home, looking to move out, most likely into a nearby apartment since it’d be most likely cheaper. San Diego is a really expensive area, so it’s kind of hard to do this alone and I don’t think my parents would help me out.

I think if I continue to live the way I’m living, I’m not going to make it past 30. I know a lot of people but only have a few close friends, but I don’t have anybody close enough if I wanted to invite them to my birthday for example. I spend most of my time alone, and I think living close to campus would put me in a position to make more friends. 

My parents are also extremely overbearing and strict, and it’s only until later last year that I had to convince them to stop tracking my phone 24/7, and my mom actually cried about it, and was sobbing that she couldn’t track my phone. They always suspect I’m doing something, and it’s always a hassle to hangout with anybody.

I just feel so trapped and constrained compared to some people I know, and I feel like if I just got away then I’d be able to reach my potential or at least grow as a person. All I want is the ability to grow as a person, and actually get some real life experiences because right now I feel like I’m living the life of a depressed 14 year old.

I’m don’t like the path I’m going on and I want to change it. My plan right now is to get a job and save up money for an apartment but what would I do, if the average rent around here is about 700-1000 dollars and that’d be in a really small apartment, with multiple roommates. That’s not even including food or any other things too.

228,"I (f) have a cousin (m) (let's call him cousin C, for Creepy) my age (30) who's always been a bit creepy (asks strange questions, doesn't talk much, hides in rooms, and other strange behaviour). Today something happened that freaked me out and don't know what to do. Please help!

My house is an office on the first floor, and the second floor is where I live. One of my aunts and another cousin (let's call him N for Normal) work in the office from 8am to 5pm. I haven't lived in this house for years, I was overseas, and I only arrived a few days ago. Since I arrived, cousin C started texting me things like 'hey, are you home?' or 'what are you doing? Is my aunt (aunt A) with you?'. Every time I asked him why he was asking this he didn't give me a concrete answer or gave me some stupid one.

Today, just a few hours ago ""his mom"" (aunt B) sent me a text asking me if I wanted ""mazamorra"" (a dessert I really like and that she makes well). I had this feeling it was cousin C, so I said: ""no, thanks, maybe tomorrow""; then ""she"" asked me if I was home. I said that I wasn't there and asked why she was asking; she said it was because she wanted to invite me the mazamorra. 

I forgot about it and when I got home I was surprised to find the doors unlocked. Usually, when aunt A and cousin N leave the office they lock it. I thought they were working until late for some reason. But when I opened the door I realised the house was empty. This was very weird. So I didn't dare step inside the house, and from the door I just said: Hello!!! Nobody replied for like 5 seconds, and then cousin C said Hello. He had been upstairs, where I live. I freaked out and left the house immediately. He followed me and started walking with me. I was angry at and afraid of him at the same time. I just asked why he was there and he apologised for scaring me and said he was there to fix a computer (although I had seen computers were off).

I walked towards my aunts' apartments (they live in the same building), which are only a couple of blocks away. Aunt B saw me enter the building and I asked her about the mazamorra because I wanted to put cousin C in evidence. She had no idea about our conversation. I showed her the text messages and said she didn't know anything about them. She showed me her phone and there was nothing there. Then I went to aunt A's apartment to ask if she needed a computer fixed, she said that yes, but she hadn't asked cousin C to repair it. And that she had previously given him explicit instructions not to enter the house if she wasn't there. That's when she explained that cousin C had the keys to the office/house!!! She promised to take the keys away from him tomorrow morning, but I'm very scared.

I'm back home. I have checked every single room in the house to make sure that I don't lock myself in with cousin C. He can't enter the house now because, even though he has keys, one of the doors has a lock that can only be opened from the inside. 

Also: a few months ago, ""aunt B"" texted me (on Whatsapp, cause I was in another country) to ask for sexual advice. I remember this was something upsetting because my aunt and I had never had that sort of relationship. Back then I also felt that it was cousin C but didn't know how to prove it. I tried to call my aunt B to clarify things with her but she never answered her phone and I forgot about it. Now... with this thing that just happened I feel that cousin C has some weird fixation with me, and it makes me really afraid that he's passed from being creepy and quiet to actually taking action and entering my house. Should I report this to authorities even though there's no ""crime""? Should I tell my family the whole story? (I've only told them that he was at home and I didn't like it) What extra security measures should I take? 

Nothing happened to me tonight fortunately, but I feel like crying. Any advice on how to calm myself down?

229,"Sup guys, I don't know if i should consider this as social anxiety or pathological lying, regardless it annoys me, so I need advice on how to combat this. I don't lie about major stuff, like how or what I did during my days/normal routines, I tend to lie about minor things, like life experiences, I can kinda dull it down to a kid telling ""stories"". A good example would be when I was hanging out with a girl I would like to hopefully have a relationship with, and she had asked if i'd ever been to a certain restaurant, (which I hadn't) and I said ""yes I have, they have good food"". I think this kinda stems from social anxiety because growing up, I was raised by 2 cops, and was always kinda sheltered, and anytime I would want to go out with friends, I would have to give a laundry list to my parents about who I am going with, what we'll be doing, where we're going, what time will be going and be back, who is taking us, we need to meet the parents first, we need contact information from both of their parents and the person(s) I am going with. I was that kid who never really hung out because to other people it wasn't worth the effort, and because of that I somewhat developed this bad habit because I always wanted to be included in interesting conversations. Every time I think back on my days when I am at home relaxing or something, I always ask myself ""what was the reason for telling so-and-so that"". its just a flaw I have that I hate about myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",09May2019,2

I also want ask about benefits (what kind of benefits should I ask for/about) and also about paid leave and holidays.

Should I ask questions such as ""if I finish my work early would I be able to leave early or just sit around doing my own thing for the rest of the day?""

I know it doesn't work that way. I think because i was mocked a lot and kids make fun of me, that stayed with me up to this day, i can feel they can see through me and i don't want them to see who i truly am. I just don't. I can't.

Experience: I've been painting houses for a total of five years. One of those years I worked for this redneck old man who made it his personal mission to make my job miserable even though I never missed a day and worked more hours than everyone else in the company and still got a bunch of crap every day. One day he really pissed me off and I just walked off the job. I had no choice, I dealt with so much crap from the guy I actually have high blood pressure now and I'm only thirty. Now I just don't want to work for anyone around here because he is good buddies with all the other paint bosses around here, and he did tell me once that he would make sure I never got another job painting houses cause he would tell them I'm a worthless painter. I pick up random jobs to get some cash for food so my mom doesn't have to give me money so the time.

Family: I wish I wasn't complaining so much but my mom works alot. My brother lives here too and he's almost forty and I've been feeding him about 90 percent of the time the past about four years. We're always here together and he just hovers around alot and has chances to work but it just for some reason never happens. I have the feeling that he just knows that food will be there every night. He's a smart guy just always in the mode of telling us, you should, we should, why, all this stuff. Like I said I have high blood pressure or something and I just shut down like I can't handle it.

Job Opportunity: In the state I was planning on moving to I sent some resume type stuff to some companies who were looking for paint sub contractors.

It's pays really well. They even offered to help me out financially for the first few jobs. I have the opportunity to actually start making a decent living again after a while.

What options do I have to better protect my privacy? Can I request a break-the-glass on  my own records? Can I request that certain visits (old visits over a year ago and now resolved) be somehow specially protected ? If so how would I go about making that request?

247,"I've spoken about my SO on here before and I've received a lot of great advice on certain situations.  We've gotten much better since then and I've since been thankful for the help.

This time, instead of asking help for myself, I am wondering if there is any way that I can successfullt help him.

For an overview, we've met almost a year ago in person and it's a long distance relationship for now.But since then things have kind of gone downhill for him, home life wise. His family is emotionally and physically abusive. He has been sent to mental hospitals and even jail just for defending himself. He is currently unemployed due to his last physical altercation with his dad. 

His next court hearing is in next month and he most likely will not be able to work until then, which he's really upset about. But he plans on moving to my state while staying with somewhat better family and working for them after the hearing. He's just 1 state over right now.

But earlier last night he said that his dad had had another ""outburst"" towards him and that he couldn't really do anything about it defensively but take it. He also said because of that, he wasn't really feeling all that positive. He really just used the word 'sad' to describe how he felt. 

It hurt me a lot inside when he told me that because I know how he actually felt about it since he's a sensitive bean just like me. 

I ended up playfully roasting him and sending him memes and that seemed to help a lot but what if it gets to a point where what he goes through can't be helped with humor? We have talked things out before with whatever may bother him and they were very successful but his family hasn't exactly been apart of that kind of negative subject fully until now.

I just wish that I could've done something better to help him to start looking back to the bright side of things or help him to somehow better handle things like that mentally.

He does take certain medications for certain mental illnesses, so I know that may be something to keep in mind of.

For those that may have been in the same position as him or as either of us, is there anything at least somewhat helpful that I could try to do to help him out until he's in a much better position to do things? Again, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",09May2019,1

250,"Warning long though necessary/relevant! 

I was in for a follow up appointment with my doctor today. I was in a bad car accident and had 4 surgeries within the last few months and have had severe leg and low back pain since and we are working on a plan to get it under control. I still work full time, refuse to go on disability, have kids/husband, and an active life and do my best to remain active and a active member of society. I work out, am in good health/shape, have a great career etc. 

Today, I had a follow up apt to a procedure I had done and had asked the front desk gal if I needed to make an apt for a refill of my meds as they are really cracking down on the docs and everything is a pain in the ass to get refills and follow ups are mandatory for refills. 

Once In the patient room the medical assistant asked why I needed a refill and I stated that I didn’t yet, was being proactive to schedule the apt for it since that is what they required. She also asked me to verify my dose and I confirmed the doses I was taking and stated that some days I didn’t need as many as prescribed and others I needed more. I said “more” meaning more than less of the dose not MORE than prescribed. 

She leaves and about 10 minutes later she and the doc come in and he’s livid. You can feel the tension, he was tense, and just fucking boiling mad. I assumed maybe just a bad day and did not think it was about me. 

He starts SCREAMING at me telling me he should call the cops on me, I was abusing the medications he prescribed, that I needed to take the meds exactly as prescribed and this is a felony and on and on. (I take a very lose dose of Vicodin, the most in a day I’ve taken is 4 and typically only take 2 if any is needed, never more than the 4 written out)

I immediately started crying because I was in shock and I’ve never had anyone treat me this way. I am very conservative with opioids and only use them if absolutely needed and it’s only been a few months since the surgeries and there are days I need them to stop the leg pain so I can walk and go about my day. 

(In fact, he wanted me to take Oxycotin (60mg) a day which I flat out declined a prescription for any of those at all when I started with him.)

He is staring at me as I’m sitting there crying and asks me to explain why he shouldn’t have me arrested for felony misuse of narcotics. 

Luckily the MA was in the room with him and she came to my defense as she seemed just as in shock as I was and told him that I was not abusing them and that I not even take the dose he recommended daily, and that he misunderstood  what she had told him. 

I could tell he felt like a total asshole but I was just at the point where I was not even sure how to react after his outburst and I was completely shaken up. I stood up, and through my tears stated I didn’t have to put up with this harassment and walked out. 

His receptionist called me 10 mins later (I didn’t answer) asking me to call them back and that they needed to reschedule my refill appointment.

What do I do? Report him? Forgive him? I’m still very shook up about this and upset about his treatment. He’s a well respected doctor with amazing reviews and a lot of docs recommended him for pain management and prior to this we had a good plan going. I thought my husband was going to go there and have words with him after I called him crying. 

For the record I am a mid 30’s woman, well educated and not typically a crier. It just shook me to my core.",09May2019,25

253,"Let me set the situation, There are two girls and I need help this has been tormenting me for weeks. I really enjoy both of these girls a lot and have known them both for the past year I really don’t know what to do but i need to decide but there’s a lot of unknown Im hoping input from others can help, maybe people have been through this.  Girl one I’ve been talking to a lot but majority over snapchat however we just connect on so many levels and I tell her pretty much everything Im not sure I tell anyone else more about myself than her. I’ve been sort of playing dumb assuming she doesn’t like me but we’ve spent significant time hanging out, in groups and alone. It’s become a habit she calls me when she’s partying and I pick her up we hang out it’s a lot of fun. Most recently, the same thing happened I snuck out met up and were laying in the back of my car just talking about a lot of things (we can always about anything) and she starts telling me how she feels about me which we both kind of talked about and were expecting to happen and it made me feel so nice inside and I felt the same for her and it’s really intimate etc. Then we hook up and we’re talking more how this changes a lot and shes not sure if she wants to get into something deep due to both of us leaving relatively soon. I give her some time and space then we talk again and it’s get kind of heated because she talks about these times I’ve hurt her because I’ve been inconsiderate, because I’ve been considering her as a friend and I’ve made some mistakes 100% and she really has feelings for me but says we need to cut it off for now because she can’t get hurt again rn but left it open for a future time. Girl 2 is again super nice and I think I can actually talk to her for longer about anything and we’ve had an interesting relationship almost hooked up at a party and have been talking on and off but are in the same classes. She’s really amazing and so nice to everyone seems to get along with a lot of people and when we almost hu was one of the problems with girl 1. I have a lot in common with both girls but they kind of appeal to different sides of me. I would want to be with her for the next 3 months we have and so my dilema is i don’t know whether I go for girl one and try some gestures to fix what happened but will she ever forgive or forget how I hurt her or move on like she says I should try to do and go for girl 2 which I would have so much fun but isn’t a for sure thing she could not be into me but I think she might be. Also, I’ve already been in a 1.5 year relationship that ended more than a year ago which was a really bad break up for me she kinda destroyed my heart the usual it changed me I think. Through that I’ve gained so many great friends who are girls and I’m afraid how this will change things but girl 2 is part of those friends so something with her wouldn’t really affect those friendships but girl 1 is a separate “social group” and I feel I’d lose some of those friends or the friendships would just be changed. And some of those friendships I’ll keep through college. There is an end in 3 months despite either. I guess a third option is neither but I really like both of them I am torn. Please help and thank you to anyone who read that whole thing. Hoping this Can do soemthing for me. 
Side note: girl 2 is better looking and is more “in tune” with her sexuality if that’s a good way to put it, has some experience like me. I’m not considering that a big deal but it certainly has an unconscious effect on me.",09May2019,1
254,"I’m not one of those girls who dates “bad boys.” I mean, I have and I don’t really like it. I actually date stereotypical “nice guys.” I have a really hard time connecting with people, so the people who I do connect with I try to keep around. Otherwise I would be lonely.

I feel like I’m doing this too much with relationships. Like, romantic ones. I do not date men with alcohol or drug issues. In fact, my most toxic relationships were with avid anti-drug guys, two of which also did not drink. They were all considered “upstanding” guys. Guys everyone liked. No one could see being toxic or abusive. They also had tons of common interests, and I really loved their personalities. They made good ... friends. Just friends.

The moment I got into a relationship with them it got toxic. I’ve been put down for my looks, for my intelligence, berated, devalued, cheated on, manipulated, used, and disrespected.

I’m 24, and I really just want a healthy relationship. Not like I’m looking, but I don’t want to be blind sided and fall for another guy who charms me with his common interests, cute smiles and witty personalities. I want to stop thinking “Well, he doesn’t do drugs, he showers daily, he doesn’t go out all night and he doesn’t hit me so I’m lucky.”

Now, take in mind, I have dated guys who were very good boyfriends. They were very respectful, sweet, caring, etc. But they usually have some core things wrong with them. Like morals, values, hobbies and interests. And I just do not feel emotionally connected with them. The relationships were pleasant, but I couldn’t stay with someone who, after the spark is gone, I don’t feel a deep connection with.

My best friend, a guy, tells me that I have terrible taste in men. An ex of mine always told me his favorite quality about me was how “dedicated” I am to a relationship.

I want to take these two comments and use them to better my relationship life. 

If anyone else has any other tips, particularly anyone who can relate to my situation, it would be deeply appreciated.

TLDR: I tend to seriously date people who, in almost every way, are perfect for me. Down to similar interests and emotional connections. But they’re very toxic and borderline abusive. Whenever I date a guy who actually treats me well, I cannot force myself to develop a real, lasting connection. I am looking for some advice.",09May2019,1
255,"About 2-3 hours ago I M[18] was studying while my younger brother who is 16 was in the other room trying to sleep, (this was around 10:30pm) and I heard random gunshots go off realllllyyyyy close to my house, I ignored it at first because it has happened before pretty randomly, but then a second wave of bullets go off and I immediately peeked through my blinds and couldn't see crap. So I then went into the hall and started talking to my brother and we were both like wtf is going on, and just to add fire to the flames, a man likely acquainted with the gunshots outside the house starts yelling in a scary loud panicking voice, and that alone scared the absolute shit out of me and my little brother. The yelling happened a solid 20-30 seconds after the last gunshots we heard, but then a bit after, the same yelling man started banging the shit out of our front door as if he wanted to break in by force, the doorbell was being spammed as well and his terrifying aggressive yells did not help in a situation like that.

At that point me and my brother feared for our lives so we ran into the restroom and started looking for my dad's pistol in the room (the restroom and bedroom are connected) keep in mind we are alone at home at the time bcz my dad was picking my mom up from work.

I called the cops while keeping my voice from sounding how I actually felt, panic, and gave them all the details of wtf was going on and how me and my brother were scared of this possible drug head banging on the door and the possibility of him having a gun.

My parents who were hella farther from the nearest police station arrive before any cop does, and that was 30 min after the call, and that is because here I am at almost 1am with no cop ever arriving... all I am saying is that if something happened to me and my brother the police would not have been there to help... and that honestly scares the shit out of me because I don't know what to do... 

Should I report this??? And if so to who??? Thank u for reading if u made it this far, I need advice on this...

256,"I've always had a suspicion. When I was a child, I didn't really see a difference. But as I grew older and met other kids my age, I knew something was different. Even my brother became different and know I realize that they matured. I don't think I matured at all.

My parents started homeschooling me so maybe it was my lack of contact with other people. I do weird things that I know that people don't do. I sometimes randomly make faces in the mirror, I poke my body for fun, I mumbled to myself whenever I felt awkward, and I never really knew that they were weird. Cause when you're a kid, it's perfectly acceptable. I recently read a book about schizophrenia where I realized that mumbling to yourself is weird. I forced myself to stop.

I have no self control either. Like a child, if I don't want to do it, I don't. Even though I know that I should do it, I just don't bother with it. This has caused lots of problems and I know the problem but I just don't do it even though I try. I cry very easily. I don't cry at things I'm suppose to cry at, I cry over the simplest arguments with my family or at a task that I don't want to do or a task that I don't know how to solve.

When I was really alone as a child, I would masturbate a lot and did really fucked up shit that I didn't know because the internet wasn't really accessible and I thought that it was all ok.

&amp;#x200B;

But everyones now matured and I'm still stucked in this shitty form of a child. How does one mature? Is it only experience? I can't explain it all but every action that I've done is done in the mind of a child. I fluctuate between emotions as well. Sometimes I panic and and am determined to change myself while other times I am in child mode. I feel extremely depressed for one moment sometimes and feel extraordinary happy for the rest of the day. 

I avoid my problems too. When someone is seriously talking to me, I smile and laugh at them even though I know I should be taking them seriously. I've learned to put up a facade when people talk to me like that. I cry at simple problems  of my own that leaves me frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

There was this one time when I was a kid (when my family was gone for most of the day) that I looked at my dog. I looked at a kitchen knife. And I thought of stabbing him.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought of every single scenario. I thought of the noise he would make, the blood, the wound. What I would do with the body. What kind of excuse I would make. I thought of cutting his muscles and separating the body parts. I love my dog and I would never hurt him but why did I think those thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought about my mental health a lot. Psychology is a subject that I am very interested in. I have often wondered if I am schizophrenic (I was very surprised by how much I fit in the category). I could have BP, OCD,.... I don't really know. I really want to know what I need to do because I hate my fucked up self. But I also know that this emotion will change later and I won't even care about subject later only to care about it much later.

257,"Let me start by describing my position:

* 20 years old
* Professional Software Developer
* Live in London, work in Central London
* Earn £50,000 GBP per year
* Save £2000 GBP per month
* Live with my GF's family
* Currently have £10k in savings

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked as a software developer for 4 years now and I simply can't do it anymore. My politics have changed, my beliefs have changed, my view on the world has changed. I go to work every day and to me it feels like so much is going on in the world and I'm tied to my desk in a room. I have freedom at work, balance my workload, leave and start when I like, but usually I stick to the 9 - 6 routine.

I started a new development job this week with a new company, really exciting and enjoying the work - but I'm still *stuck at a desk in a room*.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm pretty sociable, I really enjoy being adventurous. I love motorcycles, tattoos, live music, festivals, traveling, exploring, camping, etc. Not your usually developer hobbies, and it makes it difficult for me.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next year, I'll be moving to Cambridge and so I can either get in to another development job, paying the same amount letting me live a comfortable life. Or, I can move in to a new field. I'm just not really sure what field I want to move into since everything is paid so poorly. At this point I'll have around £30k in savings, but would much rather not spend it.

&amp;#x200B;

Eg:

* Cocktail bartender
* Motorcycle Mechanic
* Photographer (my favorite clothing brand P&amp;CO recently hired a photographer and this seems like it'd be my dream job, travelling, working with motorcycles, etc.)
* Tattoo Artist (Can't draw for shit!)
* Festival Event Planner (How the hell do I even get into this)

&amp;#x200B;

All of those roles are either extremely niche or extremely underpaid.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't spend really any money on anything. I live out of a draw at my GF's house. Most of the items I buy are either 1 tattoo a year, food (terrible habit, I'm always buying food) or some clothes every now and then. I spend a lot of my allowance on Socializing too, which is awfully expensive in London.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a point, where I need to know I'm not going to be sat at  a desk writing code for the rest of my life. I need something that excites me but doesn't make me dirt poor, because I have been fortunate enough to earn a comfortable salary pretty early on in life.",09May2019,0
260,"My (19F) best friend/roommate (20F) just broke up with her long-term boyfriend about three weeks ago. The breakup was good for her because he was verbally abusive. In the weeks leading up to their breakup, I noticed that she began drinking a little more, but I didn’t think too much of it since we’re in college. 

Fast forward to after the breakup. The first week after the breakup, she got drunk 3 nights. The second week, she got drunk 4 nights. So far this week, she has been drunk every single night. She also drinks a LOT. She takes 10-12 shots per night. She finished a 1.75 L bottle of vodka in 27 hours. 

I am very religious and do not drink at all, so whenever I try to gently talk to her about it, she always assumes that I’m judging her. She then accuses me of hating her and thinking she’s a horrible person, neither of which are true. She has been diagnosed with depression but refuses to take her meds. I try to help her learn healthy coping strategies, but she always just laughs at me and says that I don’t understand how helpful alcohol is. 

I am at a total loss of what to do. She overheard me saying something about pouring her vodka out while she wasn’t looking, and she threatened to hit me (I’m not sure if she was being serious or not). She also says things like she wants to jump off our balcony and that she wants our apartment to be hit by a tornado and for both of us to die in it. I am genuinely concerned for her wellbeing and I don’t know what to do. She will not listen to me at all, and she doesn’t really have any other friends.

I need some help or advice. I have been in a long distance relationship with a wonderful lady that I love with all my heart. I would do anything to make sure she is happy. The only problem is that I find myself having trouble opening up to her when something is bothering me or when she asks me questions. 

There has been times when I have expressed my feelings and she took it the wrong way. I guess I don’t have the best choice of words when I’m trying to say things. Which is why I feel like I am less likely to open up because I don’t want to be taken the wrong way.

She has told me that she feels as if I do not take the relationship seriously because I don’t open up and it frustrates her because she has to keep asking me over and over and over. As she told me she is “tired of this shit.” She feels that because I don’t open up to her, it makes her feel that i don’t trust her and that we can’t really grow together. She also has the fear that I will probably find someone else that I will have a much easier time opening up too. 

I understand where she is coming from and I really do want to open up to her some more, but it is hard. Especially if I say the wrong thing and it turns into something else. 

Do you guys have any advice on how to open up more and prove to her that I do take this relationship seriously? 

I’ve told her multiple times that I don’t open up to people. We are in a relationship and I understand that we need to have that level of communication. Not sure if it matters, but we FaceTimed everyday.

Idk what kind of advice I'm expecting here. I've worked in the construction industry for years now. For a while now I've been wanting to move out of state, I did it before and actually had some success. Moved back home and had some tough jobs here. 
Experience: I've been painting houses for a total of five years. One of those years I worked for this redneck old man who made it his personal mission to make my job miserable even though I never missed a day and worked more hours than everyone else in the company and still got a bunch of crap every day. One day he really pissed me off and I just walked off the job. I had no choice, I dealt with so much crap from the guy I actually have high blood pressure now and I'm only thirty. Now I just don't want to work for anyone around here because he is good buddies with all the other paint bosses around here, and he did tell me once that he would make sure I never got another job painting houses cause he would tell them I'm a worthless painter. I pick up random jobs to get some cash for food so my mom doesn't have to give me money so the time.

Family: I wish I wasn't complaining so much but my mom works alot. My brother lives here too and he's almost forty and I've been feeding him about 90 percent of the time the past about four years. We're always here together and he just hovers around alot and has chances to work but it just for some reason never happens. I have the feeling that he just knows that food will be there every night. He's a smart guy just always in the mode of telling us, you should, we should, why, all this stuff. Like I said I have high blood pressure or something and I just shut down like I can't handle it.

Job Opportunity: In the state I was planning on moving to I sent some resume type stuff to some companies who were looking for paint sub contractors. They saw my website and pictures of my work and one company wants me to sub for them. Keep in mind this is their first reply since I responded to their Craigslist ad a month ago. It's pays really well. They even offered to help me out financially for the first few jobs. I have the opportunity to actually start making a decent living again after a while. The only thing is it's a big risk to take. Plus I gotta leave my family behind and start all over again. I don't know what gonna happen with my family my brother hasn't had much success in his life and he gets extremely depressed over it, it could be worse if I leave. My mom is a great person and I want to help her but I won't be able to make a living here. I'll basically just be disappearing idk.",09May2019,0

We're madly in love, and I think being the only woman he'll be with is amazing and romantic. You don't find that often anymore!! HOWEVER.... I'm coming to the conclusion that waiting into his 30s to lose his virginity has made him not care about getting laid or not! Like, he's used to not having it, so if he doesn't now it's no big deal! I need sex, often! Lol So this is an issue for me!! Nobody likes being turned down and it makes me question his attraction to me. I know he loves me, but we all want that sexual attraction! When we do rarely have sex, he struggles to keep an erection and absolutely cannot climax from sex! Not from regular sex, oral, or my hand....only his own hand! Which I understand since be spent so long doing it himself, it's what he's accustomed to. But it again kinda hurts that I can't make him orgasm. Makes it seem like he doesn't enjoy having sex with me! So I wanted to see if anyone has experienced this and knows any ways to help resolve these issues?? Were far too young to have this sad of a sex life! Just for clarity, when we do have sex, it is GREAT! I've gotten to teach him only what I like so it's awesome lol So no complaints there. I just need to feel like he enjoys it more and need him to be able to finish with me!!",09May2019,7

The plan has always been to move back home when she finished and now I’m thinking about staying, I’ve asked her if I stayed would she stay with me and she said no.

270,"I was just invited to a younger relative's graduation party. I have never been close with any of my relatives, kind of as a result of debilitating social anxiety and a lack of social skills/confidence. The party is also many hours away. I'm not sure if I should go or not. 

I really hate socializing with people I'm not comfortable with, and my relatives are in that group, through no fault of their own. I just do not feel comfortable opening up to people about even the most mundane things. This makes socializing a huge struggle, and in a party enviornment? I'd hate it. I'm sorry, I just can't click with and get along socially like a normal person can. Don't ask me why, for the most part, I don't understand why I'm like this. I'm just shit at conversation and being social just makes me very uncomfortable regardless of the context. 

I want to support my relative by going, but I can't even express that kind of love and affection the immediate family I see every day. I don't want to be rude either. Another thing I'm thinking about is not many people showing up to the party, which would make my no-show even worse. On top of that, this relatives father just finished a battle with cancer I just found out about, and I don't know, I want to show concern for that as well. I can't do that either. Fuck.

287,"Accidental alliteration, haha. 

Anyway, I had a seriously toxic friendship in high school and ended up finishing that era of my life isolated, with only a few people I was willing to call friends -- but who, looking back on it, were probably little more than acquaintances.

Since coming to university, I've found a great community of people that I think really care about me. I've even found someone I'm finally happy to call my best friend.

But last quarter was really stressful academically and I became less involved in the community while my best friend grew more and more integral to it. I'm not envious of her -- couldn't be happier for her, honestly! (Both of us had a rough time in high school.)

It's just that because I haven't had real friends in a while, I feel like I've both lost any sense of personality and become unconsciously selfish. I've learned to prioritize my own emotions, but I think I've done so too well to the point where helping someone deal with their emotions feels like a horrible struggle. I feel detached, sometimes, and it hurts because I thought I was empathetic and compassionate but now I keep wondering -- did I lose that? What if I never had those traits?

And going back to the personality thing, I used to think that I had regained my sense of identity this year. I thought I was funny and that being funny was my thing, but then I read somewhere that the funny person was the annoying one, and now I'm anxious that people secretly find me irritating, but they're obligated to like me because my best friend is so close to them.

And what if I'm not even funny? I just feel lost and guilty and I don't know where to start. I feel like I can never be as good a friend as these people are trying to be to me. What am I even contributing? I feel so useless. Like a personality-less, flat third wheel but to friends.",09May2019,1

289,"It’s my first year of college and six or seven months ago this guy I met on tinder took advantage of me; I honestly don’t know how to categorize it because I went over to his place knowing a hookup might occur, and when he went for it I didn’t say no. I guess I can’t expect him to know what he did was wrong, but it made me feel violated and used, and I didn’t like any part of it. The night after it happened I told him I wasn’t really interested in hookups, he basically told me to hit him up if I ever changed my mind, and we didn’t talk after that. It was upsetting but I kind of repressed it, and I didn’t see him again; it was almost like he didn’t exist.

Flash forward those 6 months, he shows up to this meeting and completely throws me off guard, but we say hi to eachother and make small talk (I kept my cool pretty well). It freaked me out though, so I tell my girlfriend, who I find out knows him too. He hooked up with one of her roommates a while back, but that was consensual. I learned he’s also made a lot of homophobic/sexist comments, and just isn’t a good guy in general. This was repeated by one of my friends in the club, who mentioned he doesn’t seem to have much respect for women. Anyway, now that I’ve given some background, here’s where I need advice. What do I do? 

This was MY club before he showed up. I love going to meetings and I don’t want to drop it because of him. But this also means he now knows some people in my circle, and I’m worried he’ll talk about it to them, which I don’t want. However, I’m not going to have him kicked out of the club or anything, because again, he probably doesn’t even think he did anything wrong and I don’t want his attention or anger. But I need to stay away from him. His presence makes me sick to my stomach.

291,"TL;DR: School and my family's expectations are so overwhelming that I would rather not go on than reject them. However, I have dreams of the future and enjoy so much in life.

This is half asking for advice and half confession since I know there are a million of these posts already. It still feels good to get it out somewhere and maybe someone with some useful advice will happen to see it.

To start off I'm a 17 year old boy in the US.

I'm lucky enough to go to one of the top high schools in the country and I know it is an amazing privilege to be in the position I'm in. However, I despise nearly everything about school. I just can't help but see how broken the system is and hate the idea of preparing for the next step of education rather than for life. I absolutely love learning and often surpass my courses. I go out of my way to connect with my teachers, asking them for books or further sources if I am especially interested or have a question beyond the course. Despite this, my grades are average, if slightly below due to my hatred of school.

 Outside of school I am generally very, very happy. I enjoy life, my surroundings and am in awe of the world around me. I actually can't express how happy I am when I lose myself in it. Even when I am doing typically unenjoyable things, I can't help but be happy. I spend a lot of time thinking about my life and the world and feel very content. However, the stress of school always comes creeping back and strangles the happiness out of me. ( I know this kind of sounds like I'm just high all the time. I strictly don't do any drugs due to personal family experiences)

School has simply gotten unbearable and I can't see a way out. Ever since I was very young it was expected I would go to a good college and become something like a lawyer, engineer or doctor. For a long time this was my plan but I always questioned it. At this point though, I have a college fund and every single person in my immediate family expects me to go to college. I simply cannot stand the thought of letting them all down. Beyond this, too, is the fact that I would be denying all the privilege I have in this situation. If I were to take a different path it would also alienate me from many of my friends which I couldn't bare to do. I only have a few close friends that I have known for a long time. If I gave up, they wouldn't abandon me but it would definitely hurt.

I just don't know what to do. Every day I want to end it all just to get out of this cycle. I don't hate my life and I love my family, my friends and the thought of experiencing the world, but I can't stand it. It feels strange but I would truly rather die than continue this into my twenties. I have hinted about my reluctance to this expectation but have only gotten ""We'll see"" in return. 

It's weird to get that off my chest but if you've made it this far thank you very much for reading. This next part is somehow even harder for me to reveal, perhaps because it actually goes against those expectations. 

I've never said this to anyone but my current plan after high school is to join the Air Force. This would hopefully give me the chance to get out with very little expenses and build up some money while I pursue some practical college courses such as business, accounting and maybe real estate. From there I would be happy working a smaller job, perhaps something in the shipping industry. I could also try to transfer into an equivalent civilian job depending on what I do in the Air Force. The National Guard or Air National Guard is also always and option for some extra income. My eventual goal would be to buy a house, hopefully straight out of the military, and try my hand in real estate. I know this sound silly but I love houses.

I just can't tell any of this to my family. I know I sound like a typical angsty teen longing for some freedom but I feel unbelievably stuck. One part of me loves everything in life and want to live it to my fullest but another part is barely making it through. I have dreams but what do they matter if I can't get past the present?",09May2019,1

293,"So, my partner (NB 19) and I (M 18) have/were together for a little over two years, now. When we first started dating, things were really great. We'd been friends for a few years already, so we got along really well and made each other laugh and all that stuff, yadda yadda yadda..... about 7 months in to our relationship, I find out that they've been smoking weed behind my back for about a month, which I'm really not ok with. I confront them about it, and they agreed to quit. About a year and a half goes by after that, with few problems, when they reveal to me that, over the previous summer, they'd bought a vape and had gotten high a few times, and that they didn't really have any intention of quitting, after that. I broke it off at that point, because I'm not comfortable being with someone who uses any kind of recreational drugs, regularly, and I felt really betrayed. After that, I decided that if they managed to get sober in the next couple months, then I'd get back with them, which, so far, they've done. There have been a few other problems with communication and emotional support, and they're also currently looking into casual hook-ups with other people, which I'm ok with, but they're already starting to get attached. Part of me feels like I should wait it out because they do make me very happy, usually, and, the first 7 months especially, but the last 2 years as a whole have been the best part of my life, but part of me also feels like I'm afraid of being alone, and the only reason I stay is because I'm more afraid of uncertainty than of disappointment.

Let me explain. He’s much older than I, and usually prefer that. He’s not the first of his age that I’ve dated and like it. I like that he intellectually challenges me. 

So here’s how we’re opposite: He’s very meticulous, organized, highly educated (he entered college by age 15), comes from Chinese background (don’t know if that matters but wanted to say that perhaps there’s a culture difference) . He cannot wrap his mind around that I’m a bit disorganized, can be a bit of a procrastinator, (I say *a bit* but it’s probably more), and I kinda live life by the seat of my pants. I dropped out of high school, I’m doing my best now to fix where I lack in my life, and progressing in my career. I think he kinda starts losing hope in me at times. I’m more free-spirited, kinda do my best to live with less worry. Only because I deal with anxiety and things tend to overwhelm me easily (trying to work on this). He can be overbearing, in a way of “HE KNOWS BEST” attitude, and it can drive me crazy. And this where we clash. I don’t want to be treated like I’m a 16, and he doesn’t want to feel like he has to construct a 16 y/o. I think he feels I won’t get things done, so he looms over me to make sure task are accomplished. What he doesn’t understand, is I WILL get things done, just not the way he would get things done and not in the same time frame. (My procrastination)

On the other hand, he’s sweet, nurturing, can be a very good listener, (if he isn’t being a bossy pants), he’s fun, giving, even making my dreams come true in many ways. He teaches me, in ways I was never taught, and is supportive of my dreams. I want to be a better partner for him and it will take time, I see my faults, I know I’m not perfect, I think he just gets a little impatient with where I’m at because I’m behind in life. (31 and finally getting my career started) Education is very important to him. 

I feel that with our opposites, we could be a dynamic duo, if we could just communicate better and grow past these roadblocks. Perhaps I get too moody, perhaps he can be tyrannical, but at the end of the day, we genuinely love one another. I just don’t want to let him go because he’s my rock.

302,"Hello,

So, this might be kind of lengthy. To make a long story short, my boyfriend broke up with me recently. I got some feedback from him, not long ago, and while I’m not entirely happy with how he’s treating me or how sudden the breakup was, he listed a lot of problems that I didn’t think were problems. 

For further context, I am a nineteen year old woman with autism, and so I think many of my social and relationship problems stem from that. 

I would like some advice on how I can better myself, because I don’t want future partners to break up with me suddenly, too. I’m going to paraphrase my boyfriend now. 

- I need too much alone time. I often need a day or so after dates or social events to recharge in solitude, especially if it’s on top of other stresses and problems. I try to make an effort to still text and communicate. But he said that he couldn’t take the fact that I needed those days. 

- I over share details about our relationship with others and friends. This is a criticism I can understand but also struggle to put a limit on. I try my best not to share anything that might be personal or private, and so I don’t know what else I can do. 

- I go on too much about boring topics. This really hurt me. I have some niche interests, I will absolutely admit, but I always stop talking about them when someone asks and I don’t understand why he spent so long with me if I bored him. What can I do to not go on about these topics?

- I’m a hassle to bring to parties and social events around friends. This is somewhat true. They can be very overwhelming to me, as there’s so much stimuli. I much prefer 1-on-1 interactions, but I’ve gone to many events for him and I don’t have regular breakdowns or anything. I’ve had to ask him to leave early only once, and that was during a really big party when fireworks started going off. Outside of that, the only ‘hassle’ I can imagine is that I often stay very close to my boyfriend so that I feel comfortable, but I’m never hugged up right against him or anything. What can I do to better manage these social situations, so I’m not a hassle?

- He got tired of being embarrassed for me. He said that in basically everything we did, he would always be on guard for when I might embarrass myself, and when he might swoop in. He couldn’t name a single instance where I did embarrass myself, but he said that constant fear was too much for him.

- I asked too many questions about too many things. To me, this feels necessary; I’ve spent a long time talking to my therapist about this, and in situation where I can’t pick up cues I have to rely on communication, and so I have to ask my partner questions to understand what I can do better and what I’m doing wrong. 

So, I hope this list is okay. In general, I would like to know what I can do to be better so future partners don’t face these problems, too.",09May2019,2
303,"Good day all, I'm hoping someone here can give me constructive advice on this matter. I'm a first time poster and was told this would be the best place to ask for advice.

Background: I'm male, 32 and in a relationship. My girlfriend fell pregnant after just 2-3 months of dating and I couldn't be happier. She already had a son(almost 5) when we started dating. My GF and I moved in together so I can help with all aspects of the pregnancy and gave birth to our baby girl together(I literally sat behind her holding her legs open to help bring our baby into the world). 
When I met her son, he had no manners, no respect and absolutely no discipline what so ever. He was never taught how to say thank you, how to ask politely for something and never heard the word ""no"" in his life. That is, until I came into his life.

Fast forward to today: Been with my GF for almost 3 years now. Our son is almost 8 and my baby girl is turning 2 very soon. I'm working from home to support my family and my GF is working as well.

Problem: Since the 3rd week of Feb, all forms of cleaning has been left to be done by me. When I say cleaning, I mean: Washing, ironing, sweeping and washing of floors, dishes etc in every room of the house. 
I've also been doing all the parenting in the house. All discipline is done by me, helping with homework, me. Sorting out problems at school, me. Teaching why lying and stealing is bad, me. Literally everything a mother and father should be doing, I'm doing by myself. GF does change baby's diapers every now and then.
When baby cries at night, I wake up(since she's been 3 months old, it's only been me). When the children are hungry, guess who makes food, me. When she gets hungry she makes food, for herself. I pick up after her, pack her cloths away and sort out her dresser.
Let me just add, for the last 5 weeks I haven't been sorting out her cloths or underwear. When she leaves her stuff laying around I put it all into a corner where it's out of sight but still in her way. Basically with the hope that she'll do something. . .Which she still doesn't.

Now I know what you're thinking, what is she doing if I'm the one doing everything else around the house? Easy, she reads. All she does is read novels, stories or anything else that tickles her fancy. 
She eats dinner and reads on our bed(while we sit at the table), reads when she wakes up, reads on the bus, reads at lunch, reads when going to the bathroom and. . .reads when our baby girl needs to go to bed. I put baby to sleep as mommy can't put down her phone for 20 min to help baby fall asleep.

Funny thing is, I've spoke to her about this 2 weeks ago.
Scene: Driving on the way to drop her off at the bus stop. She can't drive.
Me: ""I want you to take everything I do for you and our family and compare it to everything you do for me and our family, then tell me if you think it's a fair comparison.""
GF: Immediately ""Yes!""
Me: ""How do you come to that conclusion?""
GF: ""Well, I go to a job I hate. Work with people I can stand. Is tired everyday after work and is stressing about our finances.""
Me: ""I also work everyday, I'm also tired, I also stress, but it doesn't matter because I still have the responsibility of being a parent and partner when I come home. I literally do everything in and around the house while you just sit back and read. (Raising my voice a little now) You did the dishes 3 times in the last 11 weeks! Look, I think it's awersome that you found something you like, but you have to consider us as well.""
GF: Silence. . .
Me: ""Feeling everything you're feeling about your work and being tired all the time doesn't give you the excuse to treat me like a slave. And quite frankly, it's not our family's problem either.""
GF: ""Oh nice. Now I know how you feel! And don't tell me what I should and shouldn't do, I hate my job and have a right to have time for myself.""
Me: ""So do I! But Dobby don't intend to spend his freedom serving you, Dobby is a free elf!""
GF: ""Can you stop, I don't want to talk about this any more. You work from home and what you're doing isn't a real job, so you don't stress as much as I do and have much more free time than I do""
Me: ""I have more free time to do these thing because if I don't make the time, it won't get done at all! ""
GF: Silence. . .

It's been 2 weeks since this conversation. I'm still the one doing everything, raising 2 children, cleaning and cooking. I have no idea what to do anymore. 
The way I feel now, I don't even care should our relationship end. All I know is, I'm worth more than what I'm getting. I'm not a slave. But our children will suffer should our relationship end and I cannot under any circumstances let my baby girl end up living with her mother. She'll go back to her parents who will then be the ones taking care of the children(Doesn't sound that bad? That's why her son had no discipline and respect, they raised him).

I'm currently seriously considering a career change, but I really cannot think of a job which would use one or more of my talents which a) doesn't involve me going back to university, or b) doesn't earn shit money.

313,"Hey everyone, 

I'll try to keep this short. My dad just recently passed away. His arrangements included a visitation on a weeknight from 3pm to 8pm and the funeral the next day (also a weekday). The arrangements on the day of the funeral stated at 9am and by the time the funeral lunch was over it was after 1pm.

Over the two days only one of my friends showed up over the course of the two days. Only two other people made an effort to message me personally. No one else reached out. Nobody else  sent me a private message, sent a card or flowers...nothing. I am very upset by the lack of support from my friends. I feel that they could have made an appearance on the night of the visitation, as we were there well after traditional work hours, and the drive to where the events took place was only about a 30 minutes from where we all live. At the very least a card in the mail would have sufficed.

319,"Hello.

So I am not really sure what to expect from the people here, I guess the obvious answers that I'll get it

""Well just get your shit together"" and etc' but I guess writing about it will give me some comfort.

&amp;#x200B;

So let me start with some context, I was always a problematic child , I was born with heavy ADHD and that caused me to be a vile little s\*\*\* when I was little.

I used to pick on other kids because I was also very heavy and big , and I used to neglect my studies , as such the students excluded me from their social events and avoided me and the teachers all but gave up on me.

This is not one of these ""love stories"" where a teacher goes out of their way to really help a problematic child, nah I was just left under the bus.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as a child with almost no friends I just sort of grown accustomed to being on my own, I took solace in my PC and whenever I felt down I just went to play video games. ( this is still the issue today )

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my heavy reliance on my computer to  keep me company , I neglected the people who were actually there for me , and with time they just sort of left me or forgotten about me.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I am 24 y/o , I have a job and I am studying to be a video game dev , I have friends from a lot of places in the world and I went to Japan on my own for a 20 days trip and met with my friends there.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is still one main issue , I am lonely.. but by choice.

You see , I am accustomed to being on my own , and that's where I feel most comfortable.. alone.

I always can find something to do when I am at home.. reading books, watching Anime or TV shows , playing video games etc', but I am grown so reliant on those things that I am willingly declining actual invitations from my few friends to go and do something together.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know how to explain it so well, whenever I am asked to do something (like go and have some beers for example) I am feeling a harsh feeling in my stomach, like my body is screaming at me "" DON'T DO IT! "" and often I succumb to that feeling and just avoid the activity altogether.

Whenever I do force myself to go out or do something I actually have fun, but I am literally going through hell just to get to that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to keep on being like that, I want that feeling of companionship to come to me at ease ,  I  want to be happy when people are inviting me to do something together and NOT feel so scared and against it because I ""want"" to do something else like playing  video games.

&amp;#x200B;

I am afraid to be honest, I am afraid that my few friends will leave me because I neglect them almost every chance I get , and at the same time I just want to feel grateful and at ease whenever I am getting asked to do something, I just don't know how to do it.",09May2019,1

Mutual friend = A, Acquaintance (Friend to A) = Z


Around a month ago A was banned from the only group they were a part of and who A considered to be their soulmate blocked them (I don't wish to disclose the reasons without permission from the parties involved). A has been left with only me to talk to, with the exception of Z who has only talked to A once since this incident, and was harsh towards A, and given how distraught A was at the time (and still is) it could very well have been considered too harsh.


Currently A has not made any kind of recovery from this but is only worsening, with time nor therapy helping. I'm helping as best I can since I care a great deal about A, but what happened isn't the kind of thing A is capable of getting past. I've tried asking around for help in other places before but to no avail and such I'm contemplating asking Z for help with A.


I'm honestly clueless as to how Z feels about A, or if they wish to associate with A anymore but I have nobody else to turn to anymore, so this is kind of a last resort. I've only spoken to Z a couple of times myself, they were somewhat distant but Z assured me that it was because of them feeling down instead of any animosity between us.


I've been around A for long enough and am close enough to them to know that their bonds to others need to be repaired for their mental state to improve, so should I reach out to Z for help relating to that or just any help at all in an attempt to assist A?

324,"I'm a transgender escort in Singapore. I met B as a client in January this year. We had a lovely time and we met the next evening as well. When he left, we kept in touch via whatsapp &amp; email. He's married. However, his wife and him had several threesome experiences with women throughout their marriage. He had several experiences with transgender escorts himself.

Then we planned a trip together to go to New York, and he had to go there for work as well. He lives in LA. Everything went well except for the fact he loves to ogle at women. We spend about a week there. He paid for most things including my travel expenses. 

About a week ago or so, he sent an email out of the blue saying he constantly check his email inbox but was let down when there's nothing there. I found that strangely sweet because we chatted about 3 days ago and I believed he needed space. The phone he uses to text me is always in the office, not his main phone. 

Fast forward to May 3rd, he sent a selfie of his new haircut and said I loved it. He had to go for a meeting so it was very brief which was common for his job. A few hours later, he apologized in an email for having to leave so quickly and asked me if I could send him a selfie of my new haircut as well. I sent a selfie I took about a week ago as it was about 1am.

We sometimes have a break time in between emails, maximum 4 days. Even when he went on a family ski trip, he made an attempt to email me. Now it is already May 9th, and i checked on his facebook and he shared 3 posts on world news a few hours ago. He did share a few as well from May 3-May 7, which was during our break time. 

Have I offended him with my selfie because it was not taken on the spot? Was he caught? It is highly unlikely he was caught by his wife. If he was, he wouldn't be in the mood to use facebook, and he told me he set the emails in a way to be deleted in a few days.

Is he ghosting on me because he is developing strong emotions for me or he decided to end this on a quiet note? It would be better to let me know so that I can have some closure. I'm really tempted to drop him a message on facebook but it might be too risky. I have sent 2 emails and 2 texts but to no response.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I followed him on Instagram recently, and noticed he posts 3-15 times a day, with most of his posts being related to a specific voice actress with only about 100 followers. Every post about her tags her, and is almost presented in a way to suggest that the posts are specifically ""for her"", often asking for direct input. She usually responds to most of those posts, too. I don't think that she understands what's going on, or that she could be putting herself in danger by giving him constant feedback whenever he asks for it.

I said no and I agreed with her it was suspicious. Anyways that was about 6-9 months ago. 

Just today my older brother came over and went to drink some water and brought up the water again being a weird colour. My dad got defensive and kept saying “there’s nothing wrong with the water” 
“If you think there’s something wrong with it go pay for it then”. We kept telling our dad to stop getting defensive as we’re not attacking him for the water, we were simply bringing up an issue we found with the house. 

My questions is what do I do? My grandma and dad pay the bills and I have no clue about who I’d call to fix this issue and how much it would cost!! I live in Melbourne Australia.

357,"I love my job- though it's very frustrating and I have just received a job offer from a company that I think will be pretty good and less frustrating. For the sake of this post- let's say I'll be equally content at either with the work itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

The non profit I work for now is 10 minutes away from home- always an easy, traffic-less drive. The new job will be a commute that is a minimum of 45 minutes each way, often more, to an area with horrible parking and which is very congested. The new job offers higher pay, but if I factor in my commute time the hourly ends up being pretty close. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I think the new job will probably lead to better career advancement in the long run, this commute is really bringing me down. I feel like I won't have a life outside of work because I'll be giving up so much of my time on the commute. The new job offers VERY GOOD health benefits/dental/vision and retirement- my current job offers a stipend to help me purchase my own insurance (which is crazy expensive and not very good) and no retirement. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only other major factor is scheduling and flexibility. At my current job I have a lot of control over schedule, hours worked, and the structure of my day. At my new job I will have worse hours, an inconsistent schedule, and no control over schedule.

359,"So, fair warning, you are probably about to see a whole lot of complaining from someone who actually has a very good life and nothing to piss and moan about, but, right or wrong, I just need to get this out because it is tearing me apart inside.

Basically I feel like my friends are only friends with me because the pity me or cant get away from me. With that said, I have always been aweful at the whole social thing. I dont think im an asshole or a bad person, I always try to be there for those I consider to be my friends and help them in whatever way they need but i just cant do the whole interaction thing very well. I try, but it just doesnt fit together in my head so I come off as very awkward and get extremely anxious in large groups, so maybe this is all misinterpretation on my part, but it is the not knowing that I am really struggling with.

  


I have always had a small group of close friends, but I have always been the backup friend. In school, all of my friends always had a 'best friend' that wasn't me and I was that guy who they would be nice around and include if I was there, but never got invited to things. Whenever I would see them after a couple of months (I went to uni a town over from all of my friends, only a 30-45min drive but most of them were living together) I would get the whole 'Hey its great to see you! We were all wondering if you were still alive. How come you dont stay in touch?' type questions, but couldn't help but wonder why if I dont stay in touch no one ever tried to get a hold of me. In any case time went on and I gradually lost touch with all of my school friends. When I met my now wife, I had been very lonely for a few years and was self harming. She really did save me. She is the only person other than my mother and father (not even my siblings) who I ever felt like truly loved me. I am now in my late twenties and have a great marriage with wonderful kids, but the same old concerns with friends are coming up again. I now have a new group of friends but they consist of my brother-in-law, his best friend, and the only person I stayed in contact with since my uni days.

  


I feel like my brother-in-law only acts like my friend for his sister's sake, and his best friend only acts like my friend because I hang around with brother-in-law and because he works for me (just coincidence). I also feel like my old uni friend is trying to distance herself from me. She has since gotten married and is now pregnant (after a long time trying and some complications, super happy for her that it finally happened!) so the demands on her life have increased significantly lately, so I am trying to remember that. With that said, for the last year or so she has become very difficult to pin down for a lunch/catchup/whatever, to the point that for the past 4 months I have been able to get her to show up to a single thing. There is always an excuse for a raincheck that never comes. But I notice that she still catches up regularly with other friends of hers (FB updates the the like) just not me.

  


Here is the thing, cos I am so bad at social interactions and cues, I have no idea if this is all just in my head and I am being a clingy little bitch about nothing. It's the uncertainty thats fucking with me. Do I just need to suck it the fuck up and be a fucking man? I dont feel like I can actually talk to any of them about this because, firstly I dont want to come across as a whiny pussy (despite evidence to the contrary in this post), and because I feel like if they are just being polite out of pity or obligation, I want them to be able to make a clean break instead of just reinforcing the pity bullshit.

365,"Hello reddit,

My little brother has several issues i need to fix before its too late. I had my own fair share of problems in my life, but since i sorted it out a bit i can know focus a little more to improve my younger brother's life as i see him twice a week now. Here is his situation:

* 22 years old, no real life friends, in his hopefully last semester in business studies with barely passing grades in all subjects.
* Obviously no romantic relationships whatsoever
* Watches anime/league of legends streams and plays league/ anime mobile games all day, like for real no other hobbies or skills
* he has that  frail kind of bodytype, with visibly bend back, because he sits all day and does not really work out
* his conversation skills are zero, whoever talks to him, you ask him stuff and he gives shortest answers possible

&amp;#x200B;

He owes me around 1 grand already and is he not able to even find some minimum wage job because of his social anxiety or whatever. To be frank in my eyes the way he is right now i consider him human garbage, but at least the non harmful kind.  I want to help him stand on his own legs. The kind of teaching him how to fish, before i feed him fish everyday in the not so distant future. He will have severe problems in his job hunt for a ""real job"", being a slow learner also does not really help. 

&amp;#x200B;

What i did so far: 

* i forced him to my kickboxing club, half a year ago. He is still far from being in shape, but at least he has a reason to leave the house now twice a week (he is not friends with any of the clubmembers, still him just going at all is big achievement in my eyes)
* i tried to bring him with me to hang out with my friends a couple times (i gave up on that, it is just too awkward for him and my friends). They know his situation and try to engage him in a conversation, but without any results
* i try to suggest games we could play together (i have a nintendo), so we could at least do small talk or have a common game to play with. (He is not really interested, because he always loses when we play together on nintendo)

I consider taking him to therapy, but i lack the financial means to pay this. My parents are asian, so mental issues are not existant in their eyes, aside the occasional, you need to be more assertive they neglect him, as long as he passes his exams. (They think a degree is like an easy ticket for a job or something). Since he never opens his shell and talks about his feeling or the like so i am not too sure about his mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you can give me some advice on how to deal with him.",09May2019,6

374,"So I’m pretty sure this girl (named T) likes me. There are many things to support that and a few major clues to deny that. Let’s take a tour, shall we.

The positives

-She has told me she loves me

-She has called me a snack and a full course meal

-we are besties on snapchat

-A year ago her friend said she likes me

-She glances over at me during school and once even took a double turn to look at me

-She smiles around me a lot

-She laughs at all my jokes even things that aren’t remotely funny

-She sends snaps with kissy faces

-She has sent a bra pic

-She sends a lot of pics of her in her undershirt

-She definitely tries to look good in her selfies

-One time she had me pick her nail color

-She never has said she likes another boy

-She usually will want to continue snapping me even
 after our conversation died out, but not always
-She took a post shower towel snap

-She once sent me a mirror selfie of her in this hot crop top

-I stoped texting her August and then in December she texted me wanting to become friends again and then immediately asked if I had a gf

-A week later I forgot to text her again and then we didn’t talk until February 25th and we’ve been in constant contact since

The neutral
-She usually will leave me on opened at school after maybe like 10 snaps while at home she’ll leave me on opened after like 80

-Some days she will barely snap me (usually the days after we have big conversations) (I’m also not in the mood to snap her during these days)

-She is super shy in public (so am I) 

-She claims to have social anxiety 

-We are different races and I don’t know if she is attracted to white people but I know her parents don’t  disapprove of interracial relationships as her brother is dating a white girl
-We don’t have classes together

-She said to me “boys suck” which I don’t understand what she meant (she’s straight btw)

-Other boys have tried to make advances on her but she told them she isn’t interested


The negatives
-I’ve asked her out twice 

-The first time was a month ago when I asked her to go to the zoo. She wanted our friend to come along. (Her friend wanted to set us up last year) and then she asked if i had a ride and I said no. After that she said maybe but we didn’t go

-The second time I tried to ask her to bowling like e weeks ago and she didn’t see the snap until the day before (I sent it Friday night she saw it Saturday afternoon) she said it depended if she had to workout and then I told her to update me the next day but the next day she had to go to the ER so she didn’t bring it up again

-She wanted to matchmake me like 2 months ago and I was hesitant and made an excuse not to do it so then like a week later she tried again (I AM NOT SURE IF THIS WAS A TEST OR NOT)

-She hasn’t FaceTimed me in 3 weeks (prob because she knew I didn’t like them)

-Recently she asked me if she should go out with “a friend” I said “wut” and she replied “never minddd” and I am not sure if I was the friend she was referring to or not

This morning when I went to the library for recess the librarian asked if I was sitting at those computers yesterday, did I have USBs there. I said I didn't I was on the computer next to it and my friend (let's call him John) had been sitting there. John walked in shortly after and was confronted by the librarian, and was asked to write on a sheet of paper who did it. He didn't end up writing anything but he was held back after recess and questioned. Supposedly she asked if my other friend (let's call him Bob) and I were doing it with him. He didn't say anything, so she knows. I ended up during class writing a letter saying sorry, we didn't mean to break it (broken software wise only) and that I believed it was easily fixable. I said that Bob had nothing to do with it and that if they wanted money paid for ""breaking"" it then I was happy to pay it.

379,"Hi folks, I have a real conflict with myself right now and even though I know it would be way smarter to just let it be, I just can't stop thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also sorry that it turned out to become so long, TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all some context: I found a new apartment with my girlfriend (we were living together for 4 years now) and let's just say we have a tight schedule for moving, that is, we need to move there within about 1 week. In turn, we need to get rid of our current apartment just as quickly, which is actually not really a problem where I live as there is always more demand than supply. Anyway, my landlord is fine with this and just wants me to pick three candidates, from which he will pick the new tenant, when we all meet together in a few days. So far so good, I put the apartment online and invited people to see it on the same day (mostly young student couples just like me and my girlfriend when we moved in, but also single persons) and as it is actually a pretty good deal, most of them were really interested.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where my problem starts: There was one woman around 30 years old who sounded kind of desperate in her message. I actually wouldn't have called her to come as she kind of didn't fit my scheme (rather unnatural look, bright blonde hair, too much make-up, could as well have had plastic surgery), but not everyone was answering immediately to my invitations and I wanted to have the day filled so I let her see the apartment. Unsurprisingly, she was immediately available and happy to come. When she was there she was actually very nice and seemed down to earth, which was kind of against my expectations. Most importantly, she really appreciated the apartment and also immediately agreed to paying the price I was asking for all the furniture I wanted to leave there (nothing too crazy and everything in pretty good condition), no questions asked.

&amp;#x200B;

So the next day I wanted to set the meeting with the landlord and confirm to him that I would deliver the candidates according to his wishes. So I made my thoughts, tried to be fair and still take into account all the conditions from my landlord. In the end, I picked three couples: One who I know will be the underdog compared to the two others in the eyes of my rather conservative landlord (girl has long dreads and her ears tunneled, works as vet assistant), but who was actually my personal favourite, basically because I sympathize with that kind of style and I think that the work with animals in general is kind of underestimated and not so well regarded in our society, so I really wanted to give them a chance. Also they were financially backed by their parents, so on paper they were still good. The other two couples are more like what you would expect a conservative landlord to want, nothing unconventional, calm, and also financially backed.

&amp;#x200B;

I consciously decided against the woman I mentioned earlier, because I think she's not exactly what my landlord would approve of, despite being good on paper, and also because of my personal gut feeling. This was a hard decision for me, especially because earlier that day, she texted me again, pointing out how much she would appreciate the apartment and how long she was looking for her own place to live, as she was aiming to finally build up a life and start naturopath studies next to her regular work. Still, all in all she didn't convince me, and I wanted to stick to my intention to pass the apartment to another student couple.

&amp;#x200B;

However I found myself thinking about this all the time the rest of the day, I lay awake in bed for quite a while next to my sleeping gf, questioning if my decision was biased because of her appearance and my negatively shaped associations with her intended occupation, and if I was being unfair to turn her down for these rather superficial reasons while I could have easily given her the chance for a potentially new happy life. 

I am even thinking of revoking my invitation of one of the couples (I already told them they could see my landlord) who are in a much more relaxed situation and wouldn't have problems finding another apartment. Sure it would disappoint them at first, but very likely wouldn't cause much damage. The woman however is really desperate and giving her the apartment would potentially be a major turning point in her life.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, she reminded me of another girl I know, who is \*in fact\* not really trustworthy, and sometimes does stuff without thinking about it which got her into serious trouble a few years ago. This is where my own personality gets involved and it gets really complicated...

&amp;#x200B;

I actually think I have similar personality traits, I (24yo) kind of have been with my head up in the coulds for all my life. While I was really good at most things I used to do when I was a teenager (sports, music, school), I always was, and still am, just as bad at everyday life. I am really unorganised, I forget important things all the time, I let down pretty much all the people in my life especially my gf (which is a whole other story), I hardly have any friends, basically I feel like I am a big disappointment. This has even gotten worse in the past years to the point that I really hate myself and feel like I am at the edge of depression. Still doing good at uni though, so there's that. I was thinking about doing therapy for years now, but I never got my lazy ass to actually try because basically all the psychologists are completely occupied and I would have to wait for months to get something started. I generally tend to give up at the slightest sign of obstacles.

&amp;#x200B;

Still all this is not obvious for other persons, and I managed to hide all my faults and self-doubts behind a confident shell. Because of this, and also because I appear really competent on paper, people often see much potential in me and on several occasions in the past, I was given chances in life that other people wouldn't get. But no matter if that was at child-age, as a teenager or now as a young adult - I would always find a way to just let it slip. Basically something like a slightly uncomfortable phone call would cause me to avoid it again and again until it is too late. That kind of stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

So, finally, here's my point: Is it acceptable for me to turn down the other couple who I actually already invited to see the landlord, in favour of the woman who appears to be much more in need? Basically, I think it is worth causing a little bit of disappointment for one party, so that unproportionally more happiness is created for another party. But on the other side, I can relate to that woman so much, which could in turn mean that parts of her personality align with exactly those personality traits that bother myself the most right now; which is my constant failure in many parts of my life. So should I actually give her the chance she is so desperately asking for, if I see a significant chance that she might as well be the type of person who constantly asks for chances and wants to change her life for the better, but in the end never makes anything long-lasting out of it just like me? Or am I blinded by my own self-loathing and making things unneccessarily complicated (like I always do), while it would have been much more fair giving her the chance in the first place, instead of the other couple?

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any thoughts on this and would also be really interested if anyone has had similar experiences and how it turned out. I really don't know what to think anymore and I am doubting everything I do. This goes really deep into my brain and I just can't stop thinking about it, which is why instead of packing all my stuff for my new home I spent almost 3 hours writing this for strangers on the internet, with little hope of improvement of the situation. Well done, once again!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am thinking of revoking my invitation of a couple to see my landlord, in favour of a woman who appears to be much more in need of an apartment. My decision could significantly change her life for the better, but regarding everything I know from myself and others, there is a good chance that this would be all for nothing due to toxic personality traits that she might share with myself. I really want to do the right thing morally (as always) but it could turn out both ways and every decision could leave me regretting everything I did (as always).

381,"He’s a good guy really but like he’s a real extrovert with a lot of confidence and I met him in community college, he’s brought me to a lot of parties and shown me probably the hottest girls I’ve seen in my life which I’m grateful for but the only problem is that he can’t grasp my anxiety, what I mean by this is every time I’m put in awkward situations, I’m nervous and take a bit long to react as I feel like I’ll be judged for what I do next but he takes this as me being “slow” or “a spaz”, he’s my really good friend and I try to explain anxiety to him as well as I can but he thinks it’s something I can just get over and have to “be a man” it’s really annoying.

On top of that he’s friends with gang members who are actually pretty cool people but the one of many things that gives me anxiety around them is that I know if I say the wrong thing (mention a rival gang members name, mention one of their sisters name) or even look at them the wrong way I’ll be killed on the spot which always leads me to involuntary shaking.

382,"I recently went to the dentist due to serve gum pain. I was told it was a wisdom tooth and they scheduled for me to get them taken out. The day I'm supposed to get them out is about 4 weeks away from today. I asked if I can do anything for the pain and she said just rinse with mouthwash.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in complete pain. I can barely close my mouth and woke up around 3 AM due to my gums hurting. I want to call back and ask them if they can give me anything for the pain, especially since I have to wait 4 weeks per their schedule before I can get them taken out.

I don't want to come across a certain way though on the phone. I just know other people that were prescribed something for their wisdom tooth pain before they had the surgery to hold them over.

383,"Hey, I’m 21 and graduating in the summer with a bachelor’s degree in theology. I’ve been offered an apprenticeship with a church in Ireland, and I’m going to take it to see if it’s the kind of thing I want to do.

However, I’m also a fairly hard-working musician, and I’m doing quite well at the moment (it’s a pretty sustainable full-time job for me). I really don’t want to sound cocky, but it is something I’m good at, and things are only getting better for me. I’m releasing an album this summer and I’ve showed my demos to a few people (nothing huge, but stepping stones in the right direction), who are digging it. Obviously it’s a big risk, but I’ve dreamed about being a full-time musician since I was little. I could also give guitar, bass and music theory lessons for a little bit more consistent income.

There’s another part of me that wants to go back and study music - I would actually _love_ to be a music teacher. I’ve always been good at explaining things and I love seeing people improve and grow in their musical knowledge.

The way I see it, I have 3 options after the apprenticeship, all of which I’d love to do:

-Continue to work for the church
-Take a risk and try to do the whole music thing
-Go back to uni and study to become a music teacher

This chick I work with is definitely my type 100%, smart, twiggy, etc. I'm pretty sure I've caught her grilling me and I've seen her light up a bit when I've said hi in the past, though i tend to try to ignore her for the sake of it.  


See the thing is, Office relationships are really the shittiest idea, sure they can work, but if they don't work out it can fuck up the actual team. and as a wise man once said 'Don't shit where you eat'. on top of that, the company is a family company and I'm part of the family (No she's not don't worry, this isn't THAT bad), that puts me in sort of a place where I bet it could seem.... way more malicious if i approach her then would be intended.

Dear people of Reddit,

I need help. I have many problems right now, but there is only one that I really want to ask your kind of people to help me with. I'm having trouble with a guy in school, he's been harassing me for the past two years of high school. It's nothing sexual or like what you are thinking, and he is always careful not to actually touch me so he doesn't get in any trouble. Teachers who know about this and my boyfriend tell me to ignore him, but if I ignore him, he just keeps hitting harder. If you ignore someone who treats you like shit, are you basically telling them that it's okay for them to treat you like shit? I had problems with someone like that, who I didn't notice was mentally manipulating and abusing me fore three years, but with her I was able to get out of the situation not long after I noticed it. With this guy, he's in half of my classes. I can't just switch schools like I did then, I have nowhere to go. He says illogical things just to piss me off, and acts all cocky and shit when I point out that he's wrong. He breaks rules, and I just freaking hate when people break rules, maybe I am overreacting to that part a bit though, because he isn't actually hurting me. He laughs at me for no reason and makes sure every day to remind me that I'm shit. Recently it has caused mini panic attacks, where I just can't think straight anymore, and all I feel is that I need to get away. I think these also might be caused by other things, but if he was taken out of the equation it would probably help a little. Half the time, I just want to choke him out, or put my right foot through his stomach, but I know that I would get in trouble for doing something like this. I have heard that you redditors (I think that's what I would call everyone on here?) have good ideas, so I am asking you, how do I get him to stop without getting in trouble? Even if you have no ideas, thank you for reading anyway, and have a good day.",09May2019,1

391,"I don’t know how to word this properly, I never thought I’d have to experience this in my life of having one of my best friends have a 180 in life. He used to be such a positive, hard working, careful soul. Now he’s just shattered and I’m at a lost for how to help. Here’s a little context.
My best friend decided to go get a tattoo 2 weeks ago. He has other tattoos and loves them all, so he figured he’d have no problem getting another one done. He ended up hating the placement of the tattoo, it is right on top of his forearm and it constantly reminds him of his poor decision and he regrets it. It’s not a bad tattoo, it just didn’t heal properly and clearly wasn’t done by what most would consider a good artist.
One late night he decided to try and cut it off his forearm... He knows that it wasn’t smart but he just couldn’t didn’t want to see it anymore. He was unsuccessful and ended up only making 2 small cuts on his arm. 
However this was enough for his school teacher to notice the next day. She noticed the cuts on his arm and reported it to the school. I’m sure she only had good intentions but this is where it goes downhill quickly.
He was called in to the counsel center and from there examined and determined he needed to go to the hospital to be further checked out. The hospital essentially told him that given the state we live in all self harm cases are taken extremely seriously so they determined he needed to visit a mental hospital. All my friend could describe to me was that it was like a prison to him. He was told if he didn’t cooperate and go to the hospital the police would get involved and force him to stay for an even longer period.
My friend spent a week in the hospital and hated every second of it. He begged the nurses to let him out. He was missing school, his job, and reality itself all against his will. 
2 weeks later and now he can’t stand to see his tattoo. He’s looked into surgeries, home remedies, coverups... everything to get rid of it. Any look at the tattoo is associated with negative feelings of regret of getting it and the traumatizing experience of the mental hospital being forced on him. He told me he keeps trying to cut it off of him. He knows that won’t fix any thing but get him admitted to the hospital again but in low moments he finds himself with the knife again ready to go down this road again.
I’ve done everything I feel I can as his friend to help him but I don’t know what to do. I can’t be there 24/7 with him, but when I am with him he’s a completely different person. He’s perfectly fine and doesn’t seem to be the person I just wrote about at all. He knows this too and doesn’t know how to stop it. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated

I've been renting my room to someone else, so i don't need to search for another one when i want to go back to studying at my uni. The deal was (with my subtenant) she would move in during april and move out 31st of august. Now she sent a message out of the blue she will be moving out immediately, (7th of may) but can't take her stuff out of the room for a week or two. I told her if she wants to use my room as storage that's fine but she will still be renting the room. 

She didn't agree, and doesn't want to pay the monthly shared fee of electricity water etc. Since we agreed on monthy rent and the fee, this doesnt seem logical to me. Her argument is she only filled her bottle of water once so she doesn't have to pay. 

I get that if you move in halfway through april, and leave at the start of may its annoying you have to pay for 2 months (which she refuses to do) but that's what we agreed on. 

She now sent an angry letter to the guy that owns the house and rents to me and the other people that live there, where she totally twisted the truth (she thinks its obviously the only truth). Her dad is a client from my landlord so i think he believes her.

411,"This is so messed up, I don't even know where to begin; maybe from the very start? As I freaking child I feel so unfathomably immature and lost. I'm taking a leap of faith posting this here my friend and her sibling do occasionally browse Reddit, so I'll probably take this down if I do get any replies.



For context, I joined my current educational institute some 4-5 years ago. My friend joined two years ago. When I first saw her, I didn't really like her (she was not exactly... visually appealing), and felt she was a bit pompous, so to say. So I'd never really talked to her. I'm usually a loner and a wallflower, and I've been battling depression and bipolar disorder since I was ten due to a history of being abused when I was in a previous school. Hence, I've never really had friends (the only two other people I had considered as friends became rather ill-mannered, and one of them beat up a mildly mentally ill kid — I obviously cut communication with him). I had been coping with the pain of daily life by suppressing everything with perhaps too much dissonant laughter (still doing it), and by venting everything into videogames (where I'd troll and be on my worst personality; that was a year or two ago).



Fast-forward to two months ago. The school, or rather, educational institute, decided to implement a system similar to those U.S. systems where you'd go to different classrooms to attend different classes (I'm not an American citizen). And by some cruel fate, I had been arranged to attend the same classes as this individual, who was actually studying one grade lower than me at this point (she's extremely intelligent). I felf that there was something about her, maybe a hint of maturity that I had not seen in many others. She seemed slightly introverted as well, which was an additional point that gave me a bit of hope.



I decided, against my gut feelings, to attempt to talk to her. We started by talking face-to-face, and then via an online messaging application (I do not feel obliged to reveal what this app is). I began to gradually find out that we were very much alike, sharing similar interests — music, literature, food, people, and our mutual loneliness (she did have friends, but was apparently still lonely?). It felt so euphoric and blissful to finally have someone to relate to. We would talk everyday, and she'd text me everyday after our classes. I'd sometimes initiate the conversations, and she'd initiate a lot of them as well. She would greet me excitedly, and we'd talk for literal hours. She'd even leave the side of her girlfriends to come sit next to me and chat with me. She told one of her friends that I was interesting and funny, and she told me that I was her closest friend — to which I replied, honestly telling her that she was mine too.



Unfortunately for us, her friends would tease her regarding her conversations with me, and as a result, she would occasionally shy away and she stopped communcating with me verbally.



However, as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. Somehow, and I don't even know why the hell, I began to like her about one or two weeks into our newfound friendship, and quite seriously love her. Don't get me wrong; I've been through infatuation after infatuation, crushes after crushes, puppy-loved nonsense. But this is different — it's that feeling that you get when you don't mind giving your life for that someone (not that I have anything to lose). I truly feel like she's a part of me; a missing fragment of my soul that I've always searched for but could never find. She would be in my mind, thoughts, and prayers throughout the day (everything I do makes me think of her); she'd also be in every dream I had at nighttime. 



And me, being the unwise and immature bloke I am, I made up my mind to confess my true feelings to her. Unfortunately for me, she did not take it kindly. She apparently found me [unsightly]; however, we still agreed on a platonic friendship. We resumed talking for a day or two as if nothing had happened, but then she started talking less and less. She then told me it was because she had connected with an old friend of hers who had been through a significant metanoia or something like that. And therefore, she stopped texting me. She would not even meet my eye when we do see each other physically in real life. I messaged her a few times, trying to spark some conversation again; but she would always reply with those despicable monosyllabic responses or just plain one-word answers. Keep in mind, I had acclimatized and adapted to the desolation before I had began talking to her. But when she stopped talking to me, only then I realized how lonely I am. She continued to give me a cold shoulder.



I finally broke and had a nervous breakdown (I have anxiety disorder as well. Messed up, right?). I told her that she could leave me if she disliked me that much, and that “There are plenty of fish in the sea”. In my subconscious rage, I had just told the one and only person I valued in my life that I did not want her. Anger is such a chaotic entity.



She didn't immediately reply. An later, she sent me a message saying that after pondering my message, I was right that she was not a good person, and I quote her commenting about herself, “bitchy and immature”. She then told me she didn't want to talk to me because she felt pressured and that her friends were constantly teasing her. She then said that she would perhaps to be ready to talk with me again next year.



I feel so disgusted at my own repulsive behavior. I made her depreciate her own personal value. I immediately tried to apologize, and then tried again on the next day, but to no avail; she'd sent me “K” as a response and ignored further communication. I just feel like such an absolute failure of a cuntish dickwad. My depression is back and I'm just bearing the full brunt of the consequences of my own rash actions. I've even contemplated suicide, but I came to the conclusion that ending my own life would be an absolute immature way of not solving an error, and besides that, I am a religious person: it would not be the morally right thing to do as well, to inflict any grief upon my family members.



Right now, I really want to mend my friendship with this person. I feel so lost, so deserted, so depressed and despondent. I can't get her out of my head.

This anxiety causes me to constantly use the toilet as it enables the fight or flight response.

419,"This is my first time posting something that actually is a problem, and I need help. So my sister, 18, has been living back at home with us since December, due to her boyfriend and her breaking up. My sister has many problems including self harm, extreme anxiety, terrible panic attacks, and has attempted suicide before. But that isnt the worst part. The worst part is, is that shes a terrible person. Shes highly selfish, and on many occasions has stolen things including money from me and my mother. She does not pay rent, gets free cigarettes, weed, food, electricity, and living space as well as my mom to do almost whatever she wants. We are unable to tell her no to most things, because if we do she argues and argues and argues, and if she loses the argument she starts to have a, ""panic attack"" where she puts herself down, runs into her room, screams like shes bein g murdered and throws and breaks things. My mom usually responds with trying to call 911 because she is unable to calm the situation, but my sister always stops her.  My mothers bank account has been drained by my sister on multiple occasions, and pulled the same stunts to get what she wants over and over without any sign of change or growing the fuck up. I need advice on how to help the situation, because it's not only affecting my mom, but me, my grandfather, and my brother (who is stationed in Japan atm for the U.S Navy) and I dont know what to do. I've thought about having her entered into a psychiatric hospital to try and help her, but theres no way she would let me, and we cant let her suffer by kicking her out and forcing her to fend for herself, because my mom wouldn't be able to handle that, my sister wouldn't be able to fend for herself and would most likely break into the house, or commit suicide, which would absolutely kill my mom. I cant see any outcome where things end well, because it's either my mom files bankruptcy and has to start over, my sister kills herself, or I kill myself. This has been bothering me so much so that I'm actually supposed to see a therapist about my depression and anxiety. I just need some advice, and I apologize for laying this all down without really taking a breather.",09May2019,3

I am now fifteen and I visit my dad’s house frequently. I came home to his house six months ago to find him sitting on our couch holding a baby. My first blood niece. I didn’t know what to do in this situation. I wanted to get that baby girl out of his hands as fast as possible and bring her into proper care, but I can’t. He has a sweet wife and I doubt she knows about his history. 

So much time has passed and now that he is back in my life should I befriend him? He seems to have changed but I don’t want to believe that. I don’t want to be his friend but the second I can I want to take away his child so that he can never do the same thing to her. I also want to be the reasonable person in this situation and prevent awkwardness in the family.

Backstory: I’m in an accelerated masters program that allows me to take grad classes and it counts to both my undergrad and grad program. I took 5 classes (3 undergrad, 2 grad), and had a full time job for the first time in my life last year. 

In the mean time I was depressed and barely hanging on. I felt overwhelmed, tired, sick, and just like I wanted to give up everything but I kept going. Ended up with an F on one of my grad classes. 

This year I’m taking medication (anti-depressants) and feel myself again. This is year two and the rest of my grad classes have been straight A’s. My grades for undergrad is around the B/C area. 

My current situation: I am retaking that failed grade and asked for it to be wiped from my transcript. They said unless extenuating circumstances and I can offer a life event that led to this failure they will not let me retake it for the final grade. 

What do you guys think I should say/do? This is the first time I ever feel motivated in school and want to prove myself. I didn’t care up until now and i want to prove to myself I CAN be a school person. I’m worried mental health isn’t a strong enough reason.

They’ve been going very well. There has been a few ladies trying to take over my meetups and I’m getting a little frustrated. There’s a separate group for older ladies who meet up before ours and who have dinner. They usually stay for our meetup. Totally fine. I don’t personally like to discuss the time or date, people can discuss to death and nothing ever gets booked so I choose to just set a date and time and who ever shows up, shows. There’s one lady who keeps asking to change stuff. She wanted an earlier time, I said no, please feel free to meet with the other group (which is spun off of ourselves totally cool) but too many of us needed the later time and I was never going to make everyone happy so it was what it was. She then cancelled totally because something came up. Now she’s trying to turn it into a game night because she doesn’t just want to eat and talk and drinks. I’m constantly suggesting in the group for others to set up their own events and she does not. I’ve told her directly a few times now to set up her own events (she wanted to host a potluck but didn’t set it up), she has lots of ideas but does not follow through and keeps trying to piggy back on mine. any advice on where to go from there?

I went through a break up before they were engaged and it really placed me in a depression.

I know she asked me to be nice and she felt like she had to. She and I used to be close but we’ve had quite a few issues and still do. 3. I can not STAND her sister, mother, and friends. I don’t know if I could not snap at them and cause an issue for the bride.  4. I don’t believe in their relationship. Since day one of them being together she has tried to quit whatever job she has and let him support her. They do not have children and since they only just got engaged I don’t think he should be the only one having to be financially responsible but I do think that’s their choice, it just bothers me. 5. She cheated on him and then in order to win her back he bought the EXACT ring she wanted. It breaks my heart. What do you guys think? She asked me again this weekend in a not pushy way if I was sure I didn’t want to do it. I am feeling less depressed. I’ve lost some weight and I have a bit of success in my career but I’m torn.

432,"Hello reddit!

Yet again I've decided to come to you for help. Long story short, my mum and stepdad are moving from Slovenia to Scotland and we have a french bulldog. I love him, but we have a problem. They are leaving in november and in july I'm moving into my own apartment. The main problem is that, when they leave, I won't have as much time to be with the dog, because I'm currently working/studying. Until now there was no problem regarding him, because everyone took him out when we had the time. 

Here's how I see the problem. 

My parents can't take him with them, because the transportation will either be costly or very stressful for the dog. 

If he stays with me, I'm scared that I won't be able to properly take care of him, because of my work/school. I will absolutely try my best to take him out, play with him, but I'm afraid he will become depressed and maybe even get sick and die. 

My mum wanted to give him up for adoption, but he's been with us for 5 years and I don't want to do that, unless there would be no other option.

So my question is, would it be a smart option to adopt another dog so they have eachothers company, while I'm gone or would that be a stupid idea.

Thanks",09May2019,1

One of them is excellent at planning events and has wanted to plan me a baby shower since finding out I was pregnant. The other one is my best friend but she is completely spur-of-the-moment and even just trying to plan a night out with her is chaotic at best. I really only want one person to know the baby's gender to help me plan the gender reveal party and my best friend had kind of invited herself in with my other friend to help plan.

434,"Hello everyone! I'm unsure if this had to marked nsfw or not, just in case I marked it.   


Obviously, being a lesbian is not a problem. Unfortunately, it is a slight problem In my circumstances. If I could dodge this bullet and be straight my life would be a million times easier. I am certain I'm sexually attracted to girls, that is not even a question. But, I feel I could be emotionally attracted to either sex. But, emotional attraction is more just friends and trust or asexual relationships, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are both Christian. They are not extremists, but they are anti-gay. They are love the sinner not the sin anti-gay, so they wouldn't hate me nor disown me. They both love me to death. If I came out to them, they would be upset but still love me and allow my partner to join family events and such (I think, I could be wrong). If I had a wedding with a woman, they would not show up for a fact. I don't think I'd have a wedding to counter that, though. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, most of my friends are Christian. Words spread fast in my city, and I know a lot of people would be unfollowing me on social media and such. Not a big deal, but I'm unsure how big of an impact that could actually have. I might not be invited to go to certain get togethers anymore which would suck... I adore those things. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got my first boyfriend at 17, my mom CRIED TEARS OF JOY because she was scared I was into girls, she was so happy that I was in a straight relationship. She was so scared for me, in her mind she really believes I am destined for hell if I date girls. If I believed that too it'd be scary, but to me that's all baloney. To be fair to my mother, her view is to help me and save me not because it's 'different' if that makes sense. She has good intentions is what I'm trying to say, they just aren't good in motion. She just wants me to go to 'heaven'. Ugh. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19 now and that boyfriend and I broke up about a month ago. I found out how to orgasm a few months back, and all I have to do is watch a sexy video of a girl to be able to do it. It put me in a spiral of worry, a spiral of doubt, and I just didn't want to be touched or kissed by him while I figured myself out. That's all he wanted to do with me, so it unfortunately ended. 

&amp;#x200B;

If there's a way around this, my life would be so much easier. If there's a way to know for a fact, that would help to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also can't really ask my parents because they've been a bit against the idea of me moving out. So I don't think they'll be of much help.

I need to tell him that I'm quitting table tennis, but I don't know how should I tell him that to not make him blame himself, feel sad, frustrated. The sooner I'll tell him this the better for me, but I just can't figure out how should I approach him with this. What should I do?  
I'm sorry for the long text, just wanted to let you know everything that I wanted to say, as I have no one to talk about stuff like this. Thanks

EDIT: Forgot to mention that he's going to hospital in two weeks for 1 week, not sure if I should should say this before or after that.",09May2019,0

 When i saw her post my first thought was to send her a message and ask her what is wrong.

451,"Let me start off by saying, I know I shouldn’t have slept with him. I fucked up. Really fucked up. I just please need some advice on how to go forward with this situation. Please, please don’t shame me. I know it’s wrong on ALL levels. It never happening again.

For context, I’m a 22f and I’m sexually active and have had a few different partners since I was last tested. I test for STDs every 5-6 months, including HIV and all that. Well, I got drunk one night with my manager and we ended up having sex and it’s obvious from the title, but he is married. 

We bought condoms, but when it came time to using them, he refused. I kept saying, let’s use a condom, and he kept saying no. I let it happen like a fucking dumbass. 

I didn’t know or suspect I had chlamydia since I have no symptoms at all. I slept with him last week and I got tested yesterday, results just came back. 

I don’t know what to do or how to tell him. I feel so fucking bad, but this is WHY I wanted to use a condom. I have no idea who gave it to me, but he’s a fucking dumbass for refusing to use a condom with a girl who he knows has other sexual partners. Like he’s so fucking dumb. I am too though. 

Please help. I’m going to destroy this marriage with this conversation. Please don’t shame me for this I am freaking out enough. 

TLDR; Slept with manager who is married. He refused to use a condom. I just got the call that I have chlamydia and need to tell him.",09May2019,0

453,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on here and I’m not too sure how reddit works entirely. Anyways, I just finished my freshman year of college. While I was in school, I had a pretty good job working as a page for a senator at my statehouse. It’s a really easy job where you pretty much get paid to do your homework and run a few mundane errands for people. Sadly I took advantage of this position and there would be days that I wouldn’t show up or call to let them know I wouldn’t be coming in. It happened twice before they told me that I couldn’t be doing that. I know this is a really shitty thing to do and I’ve worked before in the past at a restaurant that was strict and I never called out or showed up late. I really think the easiness and how relaxed everyone was is why I took advantage of it. It gets much worse though because I completely forgot to put in my two weeks which is one of the worst things you can do at a job. Time got away from me and really there’s no good excuse for it. I call them yesterday to apologize and tell them that I’m home now for the summer and my boss goes off on me about how I can’t come back and work and how she doesn’t want me there so that really sucked. My dad did a lot for me to get that job and I know he will be furious when he finds out that I got fired. I don’t know how to tell him. On top of all of this, I got my final grades back for the year yesterday and I lost my scholarship that would’ve paid for a full year of college had I kept it all four years. I needed to keep a 3.0 gpa and I ended with a 2.85. There’s no probation period or anything, I 100% lost it. I have no idea how to tell my mom because it’s the only thing she asked me to do all year. I really feel like I let everyone down including myself. I’m not making any excuses either. This was all my fault I majorly slacked off this school year. Does anyone have any advice on what I should tell my parents?",09May2019,1

455,"I'm 17 years old (M) and as long as I remember I know about my father and mother fighting and quarreling. I am so depressed about that I only think about keeping an eye on them. Note due to my father's job I was living alone with my mother . And whenever my father comes home there is not a single time there has been a fight.( Note it is my mother whi initiates the fight always).

Even a doctor told my mother to have a psychiatric help for my disease ( i get sick very often ) but my mother became very angry and never visited that doctor again. ( Note I didn't knew about that . The doctor told her when she went to his house to take medicine , as he leaves very near house . I knew this because my mother talks to her friend on a call). I thought this was a very good opportunity to seek help for my mother also . But now she talks like the doctor is fraud and thug and charges extra money. ( Note he has hospital of his own so obviously he will charge more than simple doctors who own a small clinic). Earlier she always told to do namaste ( a form of showing respect) and always wanted to have a good image in front of them.

I have confronted her many times about the fight she only replies she is doing this for me . She told how her mother-in-law treated her and my father not supported her. She tells she had done nothing wrong then also my father's family had been blaming her . But I feel she is not telling the full story. I have heard many times talking about their fight on a phone call with some relative or that friend i mentioned earlier  telling incomplete stories in which she clearly speaks in her favour and gain fake sympathy. 
 
She thinks about imaginary situations and cusses people in her imaginary world. I drives me so crazy living in a negative environment because she speaks rather loudly in that situations. This whole situation had made me soft voiced on a level that people cannot hear me because I hate loud speakers because of my parents fight . 
 
I believe my mother but not 100 percent. I feel it's wrong to blame my father for so long even though he said sorry and had done everything to gain my mother's trust. But on the other hand my mother keep thinking about past events and ways she can defame my father by telling every single person she talks to be it relatives , friends , my father's colleagues.

Not long ago I started talking to this guy who I found really attractive but I never thought I’d have a chance with (not only because he’s out of my league but he has a girlfriend). We eventually became close friends, we have similar jokes and I’d say we get along really well.

However, times passed and I fell for someone else, and eventually started dating. Shortly after that my friend who’s really attractive tells me he likes me. 
Which I found a bit annoying because he told me this as soon as he found out I was dating, not before. He knew the situation was obviously complicated and although I found him attractive and all I had feelings for someone else already.

Nowadays, he barely talks to me and he’s super rude, and when I confronted him about it he said he was joking... He told our mutual friend I sound very uninterested but I’m the one who tried to talk when he seemed distant.

Should I talk to him again? Or should I drop it? I’m very confused and don’t wanna lose a friend.",09May2019,1

Stopped coming in the house for family dinner, was distant and cold during the holidays etc. In January he moved out of the house and into an apartment because he claimed he needed a break from the chaos of our family. My mom really hoped he would come home and that this was temporary... she re did the whole house (he is very type A and complained that the house was unorganized and messy). He has been taking trips to our vacation home once a month instead of every 4 months. My mom found out he’s been booking hotels in nearby cities for 2 adults etc. He suddenly is very into energy healing and yoga and it’s like wtf. This is a guy who has never worked out a day in his life and has resorted to beer to solve his problems. 
He’s a very successful doctor. I did some digging and I found a video of a woman that he follows on instagram(the only person he follows on Instagram) and she made mention of my dad. Talking about how they are “collaborating”.... she’s the fucking energy healer that he’s been seeing when he goes to our vacation town. 
He’s obviously seeing her. I am sick to my stomach. She also mentioned that “soon I am going to be buying a house for the first time in Sacramento”... my dad tried to buy a house in Sacramento 2 months ago and when my mom saw the papers he played it off and withdrew his application for a mortgage. 
What makes it worse is that he has given up on our family and states that he is done with the holidays, done with birthdays, done supporting anyone, but this lady has 2 teenagers. I can’t wrap my mind around the fact that he won’t take responsibility for his own family but he will so easily be with hers. 

I know that I need to tell my mom. She doesn’t deserve to be toyed around with. I am just not prepared for what will come of it.",09May2019,1

She saves all year for it, my dad brings her to the airport and picks her up. However on her trip she never has any pictures, it's to a state she says her friend has a timeshare at, never brings back souvenirs and the one time she did you can tell if it was bought at a truck stop, not from a place in particular. She uses her cash not debit card. She says she just likes to lay around and have no responsibilities. She's almost 60 and I have racked my brain on whats really up.i have brought this up to my dad before and he said she told him it was an only child thing where she just likes to have her own space and do nothing. There is nothing about her trips that are concrete, generic things you would say about any trip. It's in a state that we have NO family or friends. When they had to use some of the money to fix their car she flipped out!

That's the \_RIGHT\_ thing to do.""

My  retort was that she'd be rolling in from Beantown knackered from having a tonne of fun with her lady friends and driving all evening to watch the show that evening.  As a result,  I would have to suffer and wait 24 hours to watch with her.

The money I get is to pay for health insurance (it doesn't pay half of it). He started complaining about how much I cost. I stopped eating, I haven't eaten anything since 4 days. I will shortly be calling my doctor to get off of my medicine. I can't suddenly quit or else I have some major brain damage. After that I will cancel my health policy.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't earn much. I get may be $300-500 a month. I usually walk 3-4 miles. Currently, I work at a gas station, I do stocking/cleaning up. I used to be a cashier but my social axiety freaks customers out. I applied for other jobs, they asked why I have state issued ID instead of driver license and I gave them the answer and they gave an unusual face expression and rushed me out.

I got the medicine I needed. I could escape reality by reading books, and imaging a world where I am not me. I was homeless for 6 months, and that was a nightmare. I couldn't 'panhandle' I couldn't sleep anywhere, I had to go to forest to sleep. Cops said I couldn't sleep in the city. He calls me pathetic for using the system or begging for money...

He kept bringing up how I was waiting for him to die. I told him to locate his will and scratch my name off of it. I do not want a single thing from him. He says I should be earning 40k. How he should have basically physically hit me. He does it to some extent now.

I called the suicide hotline. They were totally useless. Told me that I should seek help. What help will help me? Call 911, hold me for 72 hours?

She says I love you a lot to me, she asked me to my school's dance with a poster and everything, we hug a lot, she talks to me about things that she talks to no one about because she feel like she can trust me, we're best friends on snap, she got my number, she told me she wants to hang out with me more, we joke all the time, she calls me cute, and we spend sooo much time talking. I really like like her.

But the other day she brought up how she's ""talk talking"" to someone very non chalantly in conversation, and i'm so confused on what to do. Should I tell her that I like her?  I know that's probably the right thing to do in this situation, but I'm terrified of losing our friendship.

476,"So my brother recently got back with his ex after about a year and a half of not dating following a 3 year relationship. When they were together I absolutely Loved this girl, I really thought she liked me, too.  A couple days ago him and I were on the phone and knowing that she is a bit timid to meet us again I offered to reach out. He thought it sounded good and I even said ""Hey! I will facebook her instead of you giving me her number in case thats not ok!"" sounded good to both of us. I spent 5 minutes on the phone trying to login so I know this happened. Why would I not know this happened? I called her, we had a good talk - ""Hey! welcome back, I missed you!"" 

Then my brother called me ""HOW DARE YOU CALL HER!"" Gaslite me so hard. You would have thought I had called her and told her to fuck herself.  

I am starting to feel like maybe I've always been his punching bag and I don't want to be any longer. When they broke up I was always there for my brother. I listened to him grieve about the relationship for over a year and was basically the only one in our family who didn't shut it all out. After they had broken up I learned about the abuse she constantly put him through - very narcissistic and nasty. TBH I didn't want them to get back together. After they did I told my brother that I am on his side 100% and that regardless of my feelings that if he was happy than it was all water under the bridge as far as I was concerned.

I thought my brother was my best friend. I can see now typing this that maybe its that he missed her a lot and the fear of losing her again got the better of him. Heres where I'm having a hard time though, She is an abuser and is so obviously two-faced to a degree that I cannot stomach being around. WHat my brother did though instead of telling her that the way she was acting was no ok was to come at me for a situation that I was kind in and had agreement from him and tell me how shitty of a person I was. He enabled her abuse and became abusive to me through it. 

I think I need to walk away. I have held my brothers hand this past year and a half and in return he spit on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the advice I would like: Do I just walk away or do I tell him whats up? Whenever we've argued in the past he makes me feel crazy and irrational.

I started studying medical natural sciences (BSc) this year, which is die hard science (imo). It started okay. But slowly, it got harder and harder. I started to doubt my choice one month into this year. Which is pretty soon. Right now, I feel like the future I see in this field is pretty depressing. A lot of signs tell me I should stop. But I don’t know what else to do?
I applied for Biology, Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence, so I could start one of those programmes next year. 
I’ve always been focussed on science, but now I don’t know if that’s who I would want to be, or if it is who I really am. 
I’m interested in the human brain, and am kind of craving for something more abstract. I don’t want to study something like psychology, since this would put me in a field in which I’m interested but don’t really see an appropriate function in. 
One study that interests me is psychobiology, but that would mean I can only start IN one year, and not NEXT year. I turned 18 november 6th, so I am still young, but I feel like I would lose a lot of time with taking this choice. And what would I do if it is the wrong one? 
Above that, what if I should go in a totally different direction? Maybe seek education lower than university, maybe go into the social field, maybe ditch science completely. I don’t know, and it stresses me out so much.

I was thrilled because I love competing, even if I'm not the best player we have. Skyler was kind of a mess about it. The pressure would get to her at competitions and she would play quite poorly. I wasn't amazing, but I could hold my own. We both trained really hard and wanted to prove that we were the more valuable addition to the starting line-up.

The thing is, at the beginning of the year, during a team bonding activity, Skyler shared that she was bisexual. I shared that I was gay. The team was nice, very supportive, and we seemingly moved on with our lives.

Then Skyler started acting weird. She would say things about how relationships between two women don't count and make broad generalizations about lesbians under the auspices of ""educating"" other teammates. She was crying at a tournament one time and I offered her a hug but she turned me down because she ""didn't like hugs"" even though she would hug basically everyone else all the time. She asked if anyone wanted to partner stretch and when I offered, we stretched for like 30 seconds before she said that she felt uncomfortable. When I confronted her about some of her comments, she cried and told me that I shouldn't have been eavesdropping and that she could never say anything offensive because she's bi, and she refused to talk or train with me for weeks. All of this made me really miserable because I'm still coming to terms with being gay.

Skyler is allegedly transferring schools, so I might never have to see her again. That said, during our hazing investigation, I told the investigators everything she had done and they said I could file a harassment report. But Skyler is leaving. If I report her, even if she's instructed to keep the complaint private, I have no doubt that she'll run her mouth to the rest of the team. The school she's transferring to might see that a harassment report against her and rescind their acceptance. That said, I hate the idea that she's just going to get away with all of this because it hurt me so much.

This has been a very long process and I feel like I've been waiting for a long time for a decision - my question is, would it be seen as selfish to see if they wanted to schedule a call before the weekend to talk about the update? i am very aware that this could end up with more bad news, but honestly at this point I'd like to know either way.

481,"So there's this guy, B, who's liked one of my friends, A, for a while and has been trying to see if she was interested in him, and she clearly told him that she wasn't. So, I was at a party recently, and B and A were both there. Skip forward a few hours and we were both drunk, kissed, and did stuff we probably shouldn't have done. I didn't realize it at the time, but A had seen us kissing and had got upset. Then the next day we found out that A had recently realized that she actually liked B back. Me and B have spoken to each other to reassure each other that neither one of us was more to blame and that it only happened because we were drunk, but now my friend is really confused about whether she wants to have a relationship with B after what happened between me and him. She's forgiven us both for what happened, and we've both apologized countless times, but I still feel awful about what happened because I know that if I'd just said no, they would probably be getting together. And then, to make things worse, B messaged one of my other friends to say that he was confused about if he had feelings for me as well. I think that he's probably just confused because it turns out that I was the first person he'd ever gone that far with, but it's just made the situation worse than it already was and I have no clue what to do. The thing is with B is that he's really genuinely nice, like he's messaged me a few times to make sure that I don't feel like he took advantage of me and to make sure that I don't blame myself for it all, but I don't think it's fair for him to go from saying about how amazing it felt being with me, to saying how much he likes A.

485,"I can't tell if I phrased the title right. Let me explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19F and I met the aforementioned friend  (19F as well) in highshool. We clicked almost instantly and she especially took to liking me when I told her about my passion for music, that I write my own songs and play a lot of instruments. She was absolutely enamored by this and would constantly compliment me on my skills and tell me how I should definitely pursue music as a career and how absolutely sure she was that I was gonna be famous one day and that I should remember her if I do so. She also started flirting with me in a very obvious way. She would tell me how special I was to her, how cute and pretty I was and she even managed to steal an occasional kiss from me.

So far so good, right? Honestly, I was falling pretty hard for her as well and would find myself on the brink of declaring my love for her on multiple occasions.

But something always seemed...off about our interactions. Or the interactions she had with other people for that matter.

First of all, I quickly noticed just how incredibly wide her social circle was. She would constantly talk about her other friends and take weeks off school to go visit them in other countries. If you were having a conversation with her you could be sure that at some point she would have to excuse herself to respond to a text or a snap from someone. Going out to town with her was a neverending game of ""I wonder how long it will take before she spots someone she knows and will have to stop and greet them"".

This seemed...odd at first but I thought that it's a given since she's one of the friendliest and most extroverted people I know.

The other weird thing is that our interactions, especially those at school would be...extremely...""contained"". Like she could be telling you how much she liked you one second but in the next it's 4 in the afternoon and that means school's over and she would just shout a quick ""bye"" in your direction and run off because she has errands to run or she's meeting someone else. Almost every single time. If you wanted to meet her after school one day you better tell her that one week prior 'cause she's all ""booked"" by other people. Also don't expect her to be invested in you when out of school. She won't respond to your texts or will just keep it brief when doing so. 

Okay I say. I can accept that.

&amp;#x200B;

 Until that one time when we were hanging out we start talking shit about a person in our class.

I had some personal beef with said person and personally disliked them, an opinion which I was eager to share with my friend since I was sure I could trust her with it and I was sure she shared it as well.

So essentially our conversation devolved into me saying: ""That person is a loser and I know this because they said so and so to me and treated me poorly and that's why I hate them"" and she would respond right back with an eager ""Yeah! I agree! They are such a douche lol you're so right in hating them"".

But turns out that she lied. She's actually friends with that person and asks them out to the movies on the regular.

Turns out that person is an aspiring artist as well.

I even spoke about this incident with another mutual friend of ours and he said: ""yeah, she does that sometimes.""

All in all, recently I told her that I'm not gonna pursue a musical career and as you can probably guess the ""deep, spiritual connection"" we shared sort of fizzled out. I guess I stopped being interesting enough for her.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm...confused. On one hand I understand why she chooses to live such a busy social life. If you know the right people you can pretty much get anywhere in life. And she's really friendly! What's wrong with that?

But on the other I can't help feeling sort of hurt. I can't ""unsee"" all her flattery as plain emotional manipulation. I can't ""unsee"" the persona she puts on whenver she meets someone new.

Am I right in feeling this way? Or not? Is she right in acting this way? Or not? Honestly this has been gnawing at me for a long time and I really needed to vent :c",09May2019,1

487,"So, this situation is causing me alot of anxiety.   The reason why is that Im a 250lb male, shaved head, always get told i look  like a ""mma fighter"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The confrontational neighbor is a 100 lb girl who is very attractive and put together, but gets EXTREMELY aggressive when she drinks.   As a guy my size, this is the LAST PERSON I would ever want to be in an argument with as I know if things ever escalated, chances are things will not go my way.  If this was happening in public, I would probably legit run away as fast as my legs would carry me.

&amp;#x200B;

The situation is this and yes i know its fairly trivial and petty atleast IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

  She has the apartment by the stair case and has a fairly big noisy dog.  So, every time anyone walks their dog by her apartment, her dog and the other dogs always bark at each other.  She has singularly put the blame on me and my dog for this.  Even after I started literally walking across the entire floor to go to the stairs on the complete opposite side. 

&amp;#x200B;

She will just come over to my apt bang on the door and give me the riot act.  Completely unreasonable and extremely loud and causes a huge scene and my neighbors have all heard it.

&amp;#x200B;

I ignored it for a while and like i said avoided going any where near her or her apartment.  I finally snapped back on Tuesday and told her if she touches my door again, i will call the police.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day my leasing office called me and said we have had a bunch of complaints about your dog.  So, i go oh really alot? Sounds like its just the person in apt XXX to me that keeps banging on my door all the time.  They said they would talk to her about my side and call me back.

&amp;#x200B;

They called me back and said i approached her at the dog park and she claims i started the confrontation.  I go well thats funny, because all my neighbors heard it on our floor.  Go talk to the person in apartment YYY or ZZZ.  And I go can you please give me a written description of the complaints.

&amp;#x200B;

They called me back an hour later and said no one has ever filed a complaint against me or  my dog and they have no complaints to write up to send me.  So, I go well what are you going to do about her banging on my door.  And she goes, we can not stop people from knocking on your door and told me to contact the courtesy officer on site if it happens again.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I literally dont understand why they did a complete 180 and told me no complaints have ever been called in about me after telling me all day that there has and going into detail about what she said.  The only thing I can think of is that she got called out on her lie and rescinded the complaint.  That or it was too mcuh of a headache for the leasing office to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

So two questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Why do you think the leasing office pulled a 180 about there being complaints about me?
2. How would you handle this now?  I feel like the situation is escalating.  I feel like my apartment complex doesnt want to step in.  I can not avoid it as it is occuring at my door of my apartment.",09May2019,1
488,"I’ll try to keep this short. 

I’m 21 and my brother is 19. We both study, work, train and have side projects, so we aren’t exactly leeches. We both are still  going to stay with our mother for a few months, so we have more money for our project. 

Here’s the issue: our mother is OVERLY caring about everyone but herself. Her quality of life isn’t great either - she works long hours, buys groceries, cooks, goes to bed and repeat. She hasn’t advanced in her career, because she thinks she has to provide 24/7, so she hasn’t finished her degree yet. She sometimes is even so tired that she takes multiple naps during the weekend. 

 Here are a few examples to put things in perspective: 

- She will cook food for us during her lunch break 
- Always after work will go to the grocery store 
- Has near panic attacks when we don’t reply within a few hours 
- Always asks us like 3 times if we packed lunch for work 
- Can’t sleep at night if we go out 
- Says yes to every favor made by a person (now with her busy schedule she is even working as a janitor at their restaurant) 

I keep explaining to her she doesn’t have to do all of this and she should focus on improving her own life, but she always has a reason or excuse. I am getting depressed seeing her tired and stagnated all the time and whenever I bring up that she should start living for herself more to have more happiness, she gets upset and thinks I am unappreciative for everything. 

I’m not going to lie - this is making me agitated. I can’t understand how a person can’t see the source for her fatigue, depression and lack of time. It truly is a miserable existence and I know, because she is always depressed and tired. She barely does anything fun, maybe twice a year.

I regretfully lost interest as I felt it was pointless to try to grow a relationship if she was leaving within the month. Ever since then I’ve regretted in losing interest with her when I did and I think about her a lot.
     Flash forward to yesterday, I posted a YOLO to my Snapchat story. A YOLO is a little tab/sticker to where any viewers can send anything anonymously to me. I got a few responses, but one in particular was accidentally sent to me in a way that it was sent through Snapchat, not YOLO, so I was able to see who sent it. Funny enough, it was the very same girl. She responded with a “I would totally want to date you” and my day was made. I sent her a paragraph expressing my feelings right after. A moment later I realized she has blocked me.  I figured it was a panicked move as she may have realized that her response was not anonymous. After a couple hours of waiting and some thought, I messaged her on Instagram with a “Hey 😅”  and got an immediate “That was a joke and I’m mortified. The end”. I responded “It’s okay honestly. Are you sure?” She responded “yes” and I ultimately ended the conversation with a “Have a good night, and you can add me back on snap if you want”.

&amp;#x200B;

I (21M) have realized that my mom (55F) and step-dad (53M) are narcissists. There's been years of neglect and gaslighting, and after reading so many stories of others with narcissist parents, I realized how I've been mistreated over the years. I've known I've had problems with my step-dad since the beginning, and my Mom has acknowledged these problems, but when push comes to shove, she never stands up for me and takes his side. So I guess she's an enabler. She hasn't been innocent in this either. 

I visited them last Thanksgiving, my mom asked me what was going on and why I didn't like my step-dad anymore. Told her countless reasons and examples to state my case. She kept trying to say, ""I'm sorry you feel that  way,"" but I stood up for myself and told her that wasn't an apology. I told her all she had to say was, ""I'm sorry."" It took her a full minute to choke up the words, and once she did, she broke down crying. 

She asked how we could fix the situation. I told her I didn't know (since I'm not the one who has to fix things; I didn't emotional abuse and manipulate myself), but I'd be willing to talk to my step-dad if he wanted to start a conversation. At the very least, I know starting a conversation could help. Since November, I haven't heard one word from the man. This tells me he doesn't really care about having a relationship with me. I should probably mention that nearly all contact I've had with my mom has been started by me as well.

I wanted to visit this April. I miss my mom so much despite everything that's happened. However, I'm a very broke college student and needed help buying a plane ticket. Anything would help, I wasn't expecting her to buy the whole thing for me. I texted my mom about it, and I received her response a few days later. She told me that I was shunning her husband and until I could reconcile with him, she wouldn't be helping me with anything. I couldn't think of anything to say that wouldn't make the situation worse, so I didn't respond. I haven't spoken to her since then. 

I miss my mom so much. I honestly believe she was a different person before she met my step-dad. 

My siblings have a phrase they love to repeat

""\[Step-dad\] is an asshole, but at least he makes our mom happy."" 

I used to say and think this too, but I've started to tell them that if that's our step-dad's only redeeming quality, then that's a problem. 

I have no idea how to proceed. I've been very low contact with them for awhile now. I feel estranged from my family because everyone else is willing to put up with the status quo. My entire life, I've been bullied, physically and emotionally abused, and I've finally had enough.

That said, they also tried to raise my brother and I to be money conscious. We lived in a nice house and took a few nice vacations, but for the most part my parents tried to raise us like middle class kids. If my brother and I wanted to buy something, we needed to earn the money for it ourselves, or save up our allowance, you get the picture. I’ve never owned name brands or a fancy car or anything. After I graduated college, my parents gifted me just enough money to make rent for a year and told me that they weren’t giving me any more and it was up to me to find a full time job and figure it out. I am incredibly grateful for everything they’ve done for me, and tried not to abuse their generosity. I got a job within 6 weeks of graduating (entirely on my own, no help from my parents) and have lived frugally ever since.

We’re okay with this, except for my fiancé is almost ready to go to med school. This is an expense we can’t afford without taking out a ton more student loans, but we already have a huge debt we’re paying back. My mom wants to leave CA, but my dad wants so stay, so he offered to pay for any med school within 100 miles of them and a position at the company he partially owns at with a salary of 48k. He knows that if I live nearby, my mom won’t want to me. Obviously this is incredibly generous of him and it’s blowing my mind that he would offer this.

However, my fiancé and I love our city, we love our life here, we love our friends, I just got a new job (still $18 an hour), we signed a year lease last month, and we are planning our wedding in the city and have already put down a few thousand dollars in deposits. So i’m seeking advice on what to do. I don’t know anyone except for my family in CA (they moved there after I went to college). I also feel conflicted because I know it’s partially motivated by a desire to keep my mom in CA (they’re not on the verge of divorce or anything, but she would insist on moving to another state if I weren’t there). It’s also not certain that my fiancé will get into med school in the area. We have to decide within the next two weeks if we want to move cross country, break our lease, leave our jobs, and give up our deposits. Advice please?

NOTE: My brother is still in college, and goes to school near where they live, by his own choice. They also offered to pay for his college regardless of where he went, but he wanted to stay close to them.",09May2019,8

As in the topic 

I don’t take things easy, I watch my colleagues at work are taking things easy like it’s nothing and they worry about nothing and they seem chill! While I on the other hand take things so hard and so personal and I get nervous about anything!!

And the worse part is it’s shows!!! Everyone know I’m very nervous! And everyone keep telling me to take things easier and not to worry, that we are a team and we will get your back and your not alone, but I can’t, I keep worrying about the smallest things 

I’ve been her for 2 month, I work as a Social Media Manager and it’s not a routine job

512,"Hi all, 

I'm looking for some advice on how i can continue to improve my health.

I'm a 31 year old male who works full time (around 55 hrs/week, rotational 3 week rota). 

For the past 8 or 9 years I have suffered with my knees. I was tackled in football training quite hard (by my own goalkeeper) when I was a teenager. I underwent physio and rehabilitation for nearly a year afterwards. They have constantly been hurting and more recently have been locking up completely. When I am at home, the only time the pain wains is when i have my knees bent up underneath me or when I am trying to shove them in the corner between the floor and the sofa. But as soon as I straighten them out, the pain comes back just as bad.

 I have seen numerous doctors, and all bar the most current one have just fobbed me off with telling me to take low class analgaesics. My most recent visit booked me for an x-ray (which came back clear) and referred me to a physiotherapist (which now has me on a waiting list, with no date of when i can attend).

My last visit to the doctors, I was prescribed Neproxin. The problem is, that after only two days of use I began to experience excruciating stomach cramps. So I stopped taking them. However, ten days have now passed and I am still experiencing these stomach pains. I have another appintment tomorrow morning to try and resolve this issue.

Since the stomach pains began, I have started to cut out anything that I believe could contribute to the stomach pains. I am now 5 days free of anything caffeine related (coffee, energy drinks, cola, chocolate have been a staple of my diet for many years), and have only been drinking water. I don't drink alcohol and I am also free from cannabis for nearly 2 months (cannabis is due to financial commitments, but I did notice that my knee pains were nowhere near as bad when i had smoked a few). I'm not overweight (6'1"", 92kg).

So what I am asking is; is there anything I can do to alleviate my pains? I can barely walk most days with my knees as it is, and I can't afford to lose money by not being at work. I'm hoping that when attend my appointment tomorrow, that my doctor will refer me to a knee specialist.",09May2019,1
513,"So 3 years ago my then boyfriend broke up with me in a terrible, drastic and hurting way. He fits totally in the evitative attachment style description and when in the relationship he would suffer from fear to commitment. When he broke up with me, he abruptly said he didn't love me when I finally believed we were all right. Which I just accepted, I just wished he had handled it with more empathy. Anyway, I was left hurt and disoriented, it took a lot to recover but with time I started feeling better.

Well, ever since, he started following every step of mine online. It started with liking all my FB posts and pictures. Due to the terrible breakup I decided this time was definite so I asked for NC and deleted him from my FB. Then he would like my ""public"" posts on FB which pushed me towards blocking him there. Then, he started liking every one of my pics on Instagram and watching all my IGstories. I made my profile private. But then he wrote me several messages about being friends and not loosing contact. There is were I caved. I felt like the bad guy of the movie, I believed he legit appreciated me and cared for me so I didn't manage to block him for messages. So I started receiving weekly messages from him. Like nothing had happened between us. I initially tried to answer with grace, but then I would always find mixed signals that would take me back to square one of my recovery. So I blocked him on IG too. Then, omg, I realized he had been stalking my last WhatsApp connection, he would connect every hour all day just to check my connections/last profile pic/etc. I don't want to make it very long but I have proofs about this.

The last I know about him is that he's dating a new girl now and seems like serious since they live together. But last week he was stalking my LinkedIn. My tumblr flag counter shows the flag flag of his very uncommon place. I've blocked him  on LinkedIn. I've set my Tumblr private.

 I just wish I had never met him. His incoherent behavior truly hurt my self-esteem and my ability to trust other people. Every time he would reach I would fall in depressive spirals that I've overcome with a lot of effort. It wouldn't matter how many times I'd say he contacting me was hurting me and I needed space, he always reappears.",09May2019,9

As I come over the hill I look up at the last second to see a construction worker frantically waving his hands. But by this point I was going 60 (the sped limit in this area is 55, there were no construction signs showing a reduction in in speed). The construction worker was walking from my left and waving his arms and as I drove past I saw him shaking his head at me but then walked over to the right side oft the road and picked up his stop sign. 

Again I admittedly was a bit distracted and am sick over the possible consequences of my actions but I was looking up periodically and didn’t see him holding a sign or anything.

After I went into the intersection the man on the other end was furious and trying to get me to stop my car. The left lane was blocked off but no cars were approaching from the front. 

I absolutely panicked at the thought of getting one of those monster fines for driving improperly in a construction zone and drove off. They didn’t appear to have cameras or anything set up. But I’m extremely worried about the consequences of my actions. And I feel terrible I was stupid enough to not be 100% alert and I could have hit someone or something...

And so far I like it here and hoping I can make some friends.  
I wasn't really ever able to make friends where I'm from locally, due to my anxeity and not really fitting in. 
The other day my husband was talking to our property manager and told her I was wanting to start using the gym. 

She said that she was looking for a workout buddy and if I wanted to work out together, just stop by the office and ask. 

I found her on Facebook and have been debating on weather or not to send her a message, telling her I'm interested, I rather not walk into an office in my gym clothes,asking if she wants to hangout because thats not easy for someone with Anxiety!! 

But I'm afraid if she says no that it will make things awkward for rental related stuff. 
I know that's a risk factor either way, by becoming friends. 

I'm really tired of only having one friend, who I never met but I now only live three hours away from and she still isn't making an effort to see me.

I'm sorry if this is not the right sub to post. So the other day I got to work with a cup of coffee. I'm always desperately in need of coffee so it's a very big deal to me. When I got there there were just me and this other guy. I had nothing to do with him and didn't want no problems. I put my cup there and go out of the room to get some water. And when I come back, I caught on sight that mf drinking my coffee. He was just like ""oH sORrY"" and run away. I didn't think of it much back then, so I didn't do anything but giving him a middle finger and got over it. I hadn't even touch that mf. But just today, when I decided that I shouldn't have been so childish not showing up at work (this is another story) and that I should be productive for my own good, I got back to work. That mf was in the room, had a long stare at me then give me back the middle finger. He showed no mfing remorse. There were many people there so I couldn't do anything. But I truly lost it then. All I wanted was to be good and go do my thing, but he just straight up pissed me off. I was so angry I got off work immediately. Then I started plotting my revenge. I could hit &amp; run him right in the parking lot, or get something to come back and hit that mf in the face, I don't know,... Just, it's very infuriating when you don't want no trouble but people just keep fucking with you. I've already had enough with my life, I don't need another mf to push me off the edge. So I'm thinking that, he usually shows up at work very early, so I'm gonna be there before him and give that mf a good beating, I can't use a club or maybe a knife, I don't know, I can't think clearly right now... I just... don't know. I don't want to be an asshole but people around me keep being so, so I feel that my action would be justified. If they don't leave me be, then I won't. I just...

533,"Depression is seriously a bitch and at this point, I don't even know if antidepressants are helping at all. In fact, I think they're making it worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on Lexapro for 2 years now, and it's stopped working completely. Sure, I felt better initially, and it practically saved my life when I started taking it during a seriously low point in my life, but now, two years after it, I feel completely emotionally numb, like a zombie, and completely unable to feel absolutely anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last time I saw my doctor, we talked about the possibility of having to either up my dosage of Lexapro or change medications entirely because my depression wasn’t improving. Initially she decided to up my dosage of Lexapro from 15mg to 20mg. However, after two weeks on 20mg of Lexapro, I found myself feeling worse rather than better.   


Then, my doctor decided to try out a different class of medications, SNRI’s instead of SSRI’s and put me on 37.5mg of Effexor ER (the generic Venlafaxine ER) and told me to stop taking Lexapro entirely and simply switch to Effexor.   


After three days on Effexor, I noticed I started experiencing panic attacks at night, even worse insomnia, fatigue, and debilitating migraines and nausea. On both Monday and Tuesday of this week I spent 90% of the day in my room dealing with the nausea and migraines because they were so crippling.   


Because I felt so terrible, I decided to stop taking Effexor and return to Lexapro without talking to my doctor. After taking the Lexapro, most of the nausea and migraines have subsided but I still  feel the same depression/emotional numbness I’ve felt before.   


I’m really at a loss on what to do because I’m really tired of feeling so emotionally numb, hazy, and lacking feeling from antidepressants. To me, experiencing no emotions at all and feeling like I’m constantly in a dream feels so much worse than being depressed.   


I miss when I used to be able to feel things, I miss it when I used to be able to wake up and actually feel like an active participant in my  life. But now everything feels so muted, dead, and lifeless, and I really am considering tapering off of Lexapro and antidepressants as a whole and working with my depression through therapy, exercise, and other methods.

534,"Hey. I know that the general sentiment is that Reddit is superior to Instagram, but hear me out.

All of my friends have Instagram. They tell me that it is great and all, not really because of the memes (they have Reddit too), but because they get to connect with other friends, and even new people. A friend literally told me that he once got a message from a girl saying ""I want to hang out with you"". Not gonna lie, that's something I'd like to have.

But, I do know the risks. First of all, social media isn't exactly the healthiest thing. The biggest problem I see here is that I'm not exactly one to record what's going on in my life. It feels so fake and unnatural. Once I had invited friends over, something funny happened. I laughed, but then they just reenacted the scene so that they could get it on camera. I was pretty repulsed by that, not gonna lie. However, I feel like that's the reason why my friends can connect with so many people. They record just the interesting parts of their lives, or even lie to make their account more interesting. I'm just not capable of that. I could create an account and just not post, but a) that wouldn't get me to connect with more people, and b) I feel like there would be a toxic element to just watching people's made-up, fantasized lives.

I always need to talk to happy people or watch YouTube videos alot and listen to alot of music so I can get distracted and not be sad af. then when I'm not entertaining myself or something I remember how fucking sad I am and when I try to do homework or something or like even sleep. I always start thinking about all my problems. I couldn't focus on a big test today and I finished last way after everyone else because I kept thinking about shit and how fucked up everything is for me. I dont want to tell my problems specifically it's personal. But still my brain just thinks about it all the time and I can't be productive cuz it makes me so fucking sad so instead I try to forget about it by doing something fun to make my brain be happy as it can be to get away from real life.,09May2019,1

My child good was on hard mode and I just wish people cared, sacrificed and looked after me. I have a job I'm in college I volunteer and I give blood without getting any money. None this has helped me at all. My life is still bad and I cant get out. I cant find a way to get financial independence. I just want to be safe. I've never been able to get there. Suicide is my only answer to end my suffering. I'm too poor and mentally disabled to live a good life. I cant find a reason to live. I just need a real answer. If not why keep playing a broken game. The poor and the disabled clearly dont have a place in this world. At least not me. If I could find a reason to keep on living I would. But if nothing comes of this post, I'll just accept that my sucks and will never get better. After that I'm giving up and I'm going withdraw from life. I desserve to live a stable and great life. I've already stopped donating blood and volunteering. Ill quote my job and school soon if life isnt going to get better. What I ask for is simple as fuck but your all to morally dense and selfish. Yet your handed everything. So fuck being good if I dont get shit out of doing it. Im not giving to human civilization if it cant do anything but abuse my ass.

547,"Hi Reddit, long time lurker but first time posting... I need advice on a problem that is really making things tough.

I have a circle of friends that I love with my life and all of them play Super Smash Bros (SSB). They're particularly good at this game because they grew up playing SSB or other games so they got quick fingers and reactions and all the good stuff. On the other hand, I've rarely had a chance to play this game until this semester when one of my friends got a Nintendo Switch. Since then, a good chunk of our time hanging out has been spent in his room playing SSB, and I absolutely suck.

A good majority of the games we play, I get tossed around like a rag doll until I get eliminated. Sometimes, very very sometimes, I have a lucky break and I can land some good hits against my buddies and get a stock off of them, but this is rare. They tell me it's ok, so I stick around for hours while they're sucked into the game and trash talk each other and get loud and roudy and all, but I can't help but think to myself \`what's the point of sticking around, I'm not having fun like this'. When I tell my friends about how I'm so terrible at the game and how it's frustrating that I don't get a chance to really feel the fun in the game, they tell me it's o k to lose, everyone loses sometimes, but I think they're missing the point. I've tried to learn the game and get better, and my buddy lent me his switch a few days here and there so I can get a feel for the game. At times, I feel proud of how much I've learned about SSB and how good I've gotten with my character, but I get my ass handed to me the minute I go back to play with my buddies.

It sounds awfully silly but I feel a lot sadder on average since my friends got really into SSB. I don't have very good self esteem, and this has been the case in a lot of other things I do. I've been terrible at sports and video games since I was little and got left out of a lot of things. This kind of left a sore spot deep down inside and I'm sure it has something to do with the whole issue, in that it reminds me of how I grew up always being a lonely loser kid. But the point is that losing so bad and so much at this video game is making my life sadder and darker. I want to show my friends that I can take a beating in a video game and laugh it off, but hanging out with my friends isn't fun anymore. What do I do? I feel like such a loser...",09May2019,3
548,"My mom has been with her company for 25+ years now. Has always been rated very high by past executives and bosses that she has been an admin for. Her new boss started back in January and has been a total jerk from the beginning. He is VERY condescending towards her, passive aggressive, and demeaning. He refuses to use email or anything that will leave a paper trail with proof that he is in the wrong. He demands that she Skype and have all conversations over the phone. She will write down word for word what he asks over the phone, do exactly what he says, and then when something goes wrong he will blame it on her and say she didn’t listen to what he said. And since she has no emails or paper trails to prove what he said it is basically her word against his. He constantly throws her under the bus and blames her for everything. She can’t do  ANYTHING right. He is currently trying to take responsibilities that she has had for 25 years from her because she’s not doing things how he wants, but he won’t tell her how he wants them. He just expects her to know? She has come home several times crying and in disarray by the mental abuse. She has a history of depression that was well under control with medications under her previous boss. Since he has started I can tell that maybe it is getting worse and her meds need adjusted. 

My dad and I have both recommended she go to HR. However in the past, she had a boss that was similar to this and HR did nothing and she went through severe psychological trauma because of it (that previous boss is now in jail for fraud). My mom fears that if she goes to HR, they won’t do much about it, and then her boss will know she has complained and be worse to her. I suggested my mom set up some ground work before she goes to HR like set up a doctors appt to have medications for depression adjusted, her company also offers EAPs for mental health which I suggested she have a couple sessions under her belt before going to HR. This way she has some sound proof that he is causing psychological stress. I also suggested she start recording phone/Skype sessions with him so she can have proof of the way he speaks to her. My only concern is the legality of recording these phone calls. She is 4 years from retirement and I don’t want to see her lose it all because of this asshole.

Any advice from outside perspective? I think maybe she should contact a lawyer?",09May2019,3
549,"TLDR: I think my ex may have baited me into coming to him in a time of need, and then did the opposite of help, jeopardizing my safety. He's now a huge mental health advocate and encourages suicidal strangers to reach out to him.   


Apologies for the length here but I think the details needed to be included. I had a complicated relationship with a man when I was 20-21 and he was 25. He was in the same line of work like myself, very successful and I looked up to him, we went on a few dates and he kept contact when he left the country. What ensued was an unhealthy long distance relationship between two people who both had severe mental health issues. I definitely had many issues at the time but looking back, he was the source of most of the drama - he was controlling, jealous, manipulative, and I now believe he lied constantly about irrelevant things. He was the master of guilt tripping and always talked about how he was worthless and I would be better off without him - which made me less likely to break things off because I was sincerely worried about his mental health. He would talk about wanting to meet my family one day, and then ghost me for weeks. He broke things off with me, and after finding out I was moving on, reeled me back in with skype tears until 3 am, claiming he loved me. He knew I was having mental health issues and made it clear that he would be there for me and if I ever had bad thoughts, to come to him about them first, because he had experienced the same and felt strongly about advocating for mental health. Eventually, he suddenly dropped off the face of the earth for months. This first long distance relationship had lasted about four months.  


I was in a downward spiral due to other life events and medication side effects, and eventually contacted him again some months later to see if we could catch up, because I was confused about what had happened. We caught up for a few days, he claimed to really miss me, etc. Eventually on the phone I told him about the issues I was having, that I was right on the brink of hurting myself and didn't know what to do. I want to add that this wasn't done in a threatening way, I wasn't using this to try to get back with him, I reached out to him for help because he had promised I could do that no matter what the state of our relationship was. I would never randomly have reached out to an ex with this issue.  


He then immediately took the opportunity to tell me all about how he had invited a friend to move in with him after he ghosted me. He had instantly fallen for her, he was so happy with her etc. He told the story like it was a complete fairytale. When this obviously upset me even more, he told me he didn't ever want to hear from me again and hung up the phone. You can probably imagine the effect this would have on somebody who was right on the edge of suicide and I won't get into the details of what ensued. As I've gone on with my life, I look back at this conversation as one of the most irresponsible things anyone could have said at that moment, and I really have to wonder whether he knew what he was doing. Why would you blatantly rub your new relationship in an exes face at a time like this?  


Shame on me, but we did fall back into contact again some months later when he was back into the country. I actually don't remember who initiated it, he explained he had broken things off with the other girl and of course, he was very sorry. I was doing much better at this time, I had discontinued the medication that had definitely been affecting my brain in a very negative way and was rebuilding my life. We went on some really odd dates, it was like he really wanted to see me but wasn't interested in any physical contact. He again left the country and we were still in touch for about a week. He texted me one day and asked me if I was happy, and I told him that things were looking up, I was doing much better and starting to feel happy again. I thought that he would be happy about this response, since he claimed to care a lot about me, but it made him incredibly angry. He responded that he was worthless, I was happy without him, and he didn't want to hear from me again. At this point I had my head on straight and immediately moved on with my life.  


Fast forward - this year I found out he's been married for some time, I'm not sure about the wedding date, but I can now look back and it makes complete sense from some of his behaviour and lying that he had either a girlfriend/fiance/wife the entire time. He also wore a ring that 20 year old me never considered could have been a wedding band. That might not be relevant, but to me it really seems like I was some side project to toy with emotionally. Especially considering the story about the woman moving in would have been untrue if he had a wife anyway.  


He is now a huge advocate for mental health and gets a ton of media attention, speaking at conferences, encouraging those with suicidal thoughts to reach out to him. I can't escape the feeling that this isn't sincere, I don't feel that he should be handling these things when he handled them so irresponsibly with me. Perhaps he really does want to redeem himself, but I just don't trust him and there's too much at stake with people's safety. There's a small chance, to me, that he could be up to something really screwed up. I have thought about reaching out to some of the organizations that he's speaking at but I highly doubt I can make a difference as one person and I don't want him to find out I said anything, he was always so unpredictable. I guess I'm posting this to ask - do I sound crazy? Am I just overthinking this and creating a narrative that didn't exist? I'm very stable now and in the healthiest relationship imaginable - I now realize what it's supposed to look like so it raises these serious questions about the old one, and that maybe I wasn't the problem. I'm happy but this is really bothering me.",09May2019,8
550,"Hellooo.

I have basically stopped drinking, because I don't really like it and it's really bad for you. I have switched over to vaping ejuice. 

I know weed and ejuice is bad for you. I don't know what ejuice does to you exactly that is so bad for you, except for some myths that have been debunked or not really proven. 

Weed can apparently affect learning, remembering, error detection and other abilities negatively. It slows down brain growth and it makes you want to smoke more. It also makes you lazy apparently. 

E-juice has its downsides as well. Some people say that propylene glycol is bad for you, others say that nicotine thins your blood, others say that it's best to move to MCT instead of VG and PG etc. 

Since I don't have all the facts, I want to know which one is better and how it affects you in the long run. I am currently vaping 3 mg of nicotine or CBD ejuices. I like the flavor. It's helps with sweet tooth. I might go back to 0 mg if it's a lot healthier.  I just want some idea. 

Not vaping isn't that big of a problem, however, I do get sweet tooth often and I crave other things such as a beer, which I also don't like. I guess I could resist the cravings, it would just really suck if I'm honest.

Some people tell me there's not much to worry about or anything to worry about at all, especially if you have low nicotine or 0 mg nicotine or CBD. 

Thank you for reading.",09May2019,3
551,"My friend and I have been texting a lot and sharing a lot of Snapchat stories and photos. Recently though I found that the context of the texts they are sending me do not correlate to where they are/what they’re doing at the time. For example saying they’re in one place but the snap map says they’re in another, or telling me they’re going somewhere but are mapped someplace entirely different. 

I haven’t called them out on these discrepancies, rather to just keep my cards close and play it out and see what happens; but this weekend was the last straw.  I was told they were home but Snapchat (which was just updated as saying “seen just now”) put them hours away.  Within a minute they updated their ghost mode and disappeared.  Again I didn’t call them out on it and just let it play.

I finally said something about this and they denied having any explanation for what I saw. This friend and I haven’t met or spoken in person in months so text/snap is our primary communication. 

We share many common interests and have similar knowledge about things, but what I can’t get over is the fact they may be lying openly to my face. I do not think GPS can be spoofed in this manner outside of jailbreaking, but again the triviality of these lies makes me wonder if I’m wrong about the gps. This has happened on several occasions, and I keep trying to justify my conclusions by thinking “there must be a rational explanation for it”.  People are entitled to their privacy but they could have just said “I have plans” or something, rather than lie about where they are. 

I guess it matters to point out that I feel a certain affinity to this person, but at this point should I just cut my losses and move on?  Confront them with all the discrepancies I’ve observed?  Pretend nothing ever happened and I’m reading into it too much?  Honesty is a cornerstone in any friendship and I feel like I’m getting the short end of the stick here.",09May2019,0
553,"I made a post yesterday where I bared my soul and asked for advice and got some friendly but not helpful suggestions that I need to set a budget.  Well, I already have a budget and Dave Ramsey is not going to be able to help.  So I'm reposting to clarify what I actually need.  It's not a money problem, first and foremost.  I mean, there's money involved, but there's money involved in everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately this is about my kids.  They are all teenagers.  I live less than a mile from their mom, with whom I'm on pretty good terms.  I'm on good terms with my kids.  The problem is that trying to maintain this modest-but-costly lifestyle, which I've been doing for five years now, is getting extremely difficult as I'm getting older and tireder.  I just lost my job.  I'll probably find a new one before long.  But after working my absolute buttocks off for years in this mode, I have nothing to show for it but a house that is falling into disrepair because I don't have time to work on it, and living close to where my kids are in school does good only when they need a ride.  The rest of the time I was working to pay ALL the bills (including their mom's, over which I have \*zero\* budgetary control).

&amp;#x200B;

The question is, is it \*ever\* okay to move away from your not-yet-adult kids?  Wherever I move, I won't have the big five bedroom house anymore where they can all fit, where they all grew up.  And for reasons that aren't important and I won't go into, I won't be able to live nearby either.  I can't afford it anymore, not just in money but in time and upkeep.  If I stay, I don't know if I'm doing them any good.  If I leave though, I'm very afraid of the harm to them and to our relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up I always taught my kids that you take care of your children, always.  My parents were always there for me no matter what.  I feel like I'm breaking that with my kids if I move.  Even considering this is killing me.",09May2019,1
554,"Hi! I'm a twenty year old girl, I am living with my parents, am currently jobless, house two sister kittens in my room and am engaged to a man who lives in Canada while I love in the states.

The last year has been a flurry of emotion. And currently, I feel both at the lowest point in my life and at the best at the same time and I don't even know what that means. I'm super happy, having found the perfect man for me after fearing for so long that I'd be alone. I've always had body issues and being a generally creative and quiet person, never got along with my cousins and many people. I'm so excited to be engaged and do some wedding planning. I met my fiancée online and he has to stay in Canada another year to finish college.

During the month of December my, then boyfriend and now fiancé came to visit me. I had had a few issues at work and was planning on quitting at some point and since they wouldn't give me the vacation to be with him. I ended up quitting then. He proposed, I said yes and he left at the beginning of January for school. I was depressed for awhile because he was gone and a month later, my best friend dumped me for reasons I won't state here after she had been living with me and my family. I had trouble looking for a job, or mainly I wasn't really trying all too hard if I'm honest. And that's really where things got worse.

Since then. I've been in this slump that I haven't acknowledged or admitted to myself until yesterday. I don't really job search. I do when I fight with my parents. And I know I really need money to start building towards my life with my fiancé. And even then. I just don't have the motivation for anything. I've always known this and worried over it but never allowed myself to dwell on the fact that nothing in my life has ever motivated me. I've loved things and have had passion. But nothing has ever given me the confidence or strength to get out of my comfort zone and actually grow. I suppose what's finally bringing me to open up, is what happened recently. Over a month ago, I sent out quite a few applications to jobs. But my main goal was GameStop because I'm a huge nerd and I wanted to be in my own zone. I hadn't heard anything and I just kinda ignored it for a few weeks until I went out physically to apply to places and I stopped at GameStop to ask what was up. One of the employees told me that he knew my name and that GameStop had been trying to contact me because I was at the top of their list. I got super excited but he told me that the Hiring Manager wasn't in and that he'd pass the information. I was super happy. Told my fiancé and my parents. I sat on it for a few days and waited for a call and. Nothing. I should've gone back in or called. Something. But. I didn't. I'd like to say I forgot. But part of me felt like I didn't. Well. I allowed TWO WEEKS to pass and I was watching a YouTube video about Reddit and someone said that jobs have a ""Do not hire after six months of employment"" rule and I was treading that line. I started freaking out and verbally abusing myself. I called GameStop and an employee answered and told me that the Hiring Manager would be in the next day and took my information. I couldn't sleep. My anxiety was through the roof and I waited the next day and ended up calling again. I talked to the Manager and he told me he was sorry but that they had tried to contact me and that the position was already taken but to resubmit my application and I'd be on the shortlist. I hung up. Bawled my eyes out. Cried to my mom. And she apologized to me for not being mean and strict and pushing me harder.

And that brings me to now. I tried to resubmit my application but the website won't allow me to. All it says is that I already applied. I don't know what's wrong with me. I had talked about working at GameStop for three to four years. Longer I think. I'm an avid gamer. I have extensive Marvel, DC and HP knowledge. I've got anime knowledge. Doctor Who, SPN and all of that. It was right there. In my hands. And I let it slip so stupidly. But my biggest concern, is that at every moment in my life. Where I've been given a motivational speech. Where I've been told my life is literally screwed if I don't do this or the bad thing that could happen if I don't do that. I have never been motivated. The ONE time that I kinda had something was when my best friend was kicked out and I told myself I needed a job so we could love out together soon and that's how I got my first job. But beyond that? Everything that should make me get up on my feet and make me do my best. Doesn't. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't understand why I can't just.... Function. I feel broken. I'm constantly hit with this feeling of ""I'm going to be here forever and live in my parents attic when I'm fifty"" and I'm scared. But I'm still not doing anything??? I genuinely feel broken as a person. Like I'm supposed to be plucked from society and placed into the reexamine pile to see if a wire got fucked. I don't know what else to do. And my parents don't know what else to do. I feel so sorry for them. I'm so sorry this is so freaking long.

She is in pain, she is in a miserable state, if we try to wash her she screams so loud the entire neighborhood can hear her.

My life’s basically come to a stop.

Honestly even posting this is stupid but I don’t care anymore, not like I know anyone here personally.
All my friends have moved away so I can’t really be with friends, and it’s impossible to make new friends cause I get too stressed out by what they think of me, and honestly people don’t really like me anyways so what’s the point.
The only good things in my life right now are my cat and my girlfriend, but my girlfriend lives an hour away and has troubles driving over, so I don’t see her very often. I know they’d be better off without me anyways, I’m just too selfish to let them go.
It’s hard to even just kill myself cause I’m a coward, so I just sleep until work and watch mindless videos of people talking while I stuff myself with junk when I’m awake. Just the same day over and over and over again.

561,"-First of all I’m sorry for the long post!! 😬  
-Second before you read just know I’m very shy and scared of meeting new people.
-I live in a small town and with my parents still. 
-I’m more of a reserved person and don’t have a lot of friends at all. 

So, I’ve been talking to two guys on the app whisper. 
First guy I found on there figured out who I was (over time which is okay with me) I don’t know who he is though (which again is okay with me, I like the mystery!) we’ve talked for almost a year now....lots of sexting. 😂😂 He’s older by 2 years. Is very kind, willing to let me rant if I need it, respectful of me and my wishes. Had his life together, but also very busy all the time. He’ll make time for me every few days when he can and make sure I’m doing okay. We have discussed meeting up with each other. He would want it to be in a very public place and he would keep his distance and not make any advances unless told it was okay. All around just a great guy! 😛 

Second guy I found on there is actually a friend of a friend he want to hang out to. He’s a great guy to from what it seemed like at first. He’s younger by 3 years. We talked nonstop for about a week on there then slowly he stop talking all together. He messaged me this morning excited to come home and told me he thought of me the whole time he was at work.

562,"I don't want to go into too much detail about exactly what I did, but I was around 7-8(f) and the kids I messed around with were about 12. I was never forced to do anything I didn't want to, but I was pretty young and just went with the flow a lot of the time. Eventually I told my parents and they freaked out on me and made me repent to my church bishop and I went through depression at a really young age and that shaped me into the withdrawn and honest (sometimes too honest) person I am today at age 20.

It's come up in my relationships where people ask if I'm a virgin or if I've ever messed around before, and I usually say no since what I did was so long ago I've forgotten most of it and I'm about as inexperienced as someone who really hasn't done anything before. 

I still feel guilty though, like withholding what happened to me is a lie. I just don't want whoever I'm with to feel sympathy towards me like I was raped as a child. I know I was young but the way I remember it I wasn't too against what was going on and if I never told my parents I probably would have forgotten it happened in the first place. My question is, is it bad to just take this secret to my grave, or is this something I should just be up front with in my serious relationships?",09May2019,0
563,"So I am currently going to community college and I am about to finish my second year and going into my third year. The problem is I never knew what I was going to do until this last year and I finished my transfer requirements but  I still need to do my pre-req's for my Major before transferring, that being BioEngineering. The problem is that whats left is a bunch of Math, Chemistry and Physics classes and they all conflict with each other. I am doing a math class that will be from Mon-thurs 10am-12pm but I can not find any classes for chem or physics that isn't earlier and the one class i find that are later at night are already all taken and fully waitlisted because of how packed the community college I go to is and they have that reputation of being extremely populated. But even then, if I take those night classes it would be several days and then I would not be able to work much and my family does not provide much for me so I have to pay gas, insurance, my classes, books, and then I don't even have much to save or use on my social life. I'm so lost... at this rate I would be taking 1-2 classes (Including fast track courses) a semester and I still need 10 more classes before I finish my pre-req's and with 3 semesters a year, I'll be so much older than everyone else by the time I just TRANSFER... I don't know what to do and I'm so lost, what is there I CAN do? I was thinking about maybe trying to transfer now but even if I transfer now, what good would that do.

I’m looking forward to it and excited to get involved with the Church but there’s one thing I can’t make my mind up on. Should I continue having sex? I have been with my boyfriend for 18 months and in September we are moving into a new flat together. The Bible says you should only have sex if you’re married but we’re in a serious, long term relationship. So does this make it acceptable? We have been having sex since before I found religion and I’m not sure I want to stop and I know my boyfriend definitely doesn’t. But I want to follow the Bible and be the best Christian I can be. I don’t want to sacrifice an important part of my relationship either. Both are equally important.

566,"So, my wife and I hired a photographer to capture our wedding and he sold us a package that had a lot of extras and whatnot. He came to the wedding, took the photos, but then when it came to giving us the photos so we could go through them and select the ones we like to be edited, he demanded full payment. We naively agreed and paid the remaining balance. Since then, he has taken to ignoring us and all attempts to contact him have gone unanswered. We took him to court - which he never showed for by the way - and the court ruled in our favor and the court order says that he must pay us back the money.   


Now, he never registered his business, paid any VAT or tax, so the court can't issue an executive warrant against a company, and as a sole trader/freelancer, he doesn't have enough in his personal bank account to cover the court fees, legal fees and our restitution. This legal loophole means that there is nothing that can legally be done via the courts. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is still taking bookings and shooting weddings as of today, meaning he has money somewhere, but he has hidden it so that he never has to pay. After digging, he has more than 40 court cases that all ended this way, so he knew exactly what he was doing and is doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what on earth do we do next? If we post in local wedding groups and warn others, we could damage his reputation, meaning he could sue us for libel... If we rob him and take our money back then we go to jail... Is there a solution or do we have to just take this as a lesson learnt?",09May2019,6

573,"I am a first generation college student of  immigrants and in the usual fashion, I was expected to go to university, the med school.  I'm now at the end of my sophomore year in attempting to get a biotechnology degree (as long as it had ""bio"" in it they thought it was ok) and have barely been able to pass (when I pass) the pre-requisite courses needed to apply and get accepted into my major. The only thing that has been somewhat saving my GPA is the extra required courses needed to graduate (like scientific literacy or english and such). By now my parents have accepted that I will spend an extra year in school, and my Mom's new plan for me is to finish my degree and then become a registered nurse.

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me because a bs in biotechnology won't get me anywhere, and I only chose it because I thought that I could make it through undergrad and go straight through med school, and then do whatever it is I actually want to do. That's what my parents told me, and my dumbass never tried to challenge this despite knowing how long it would take.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the majority of the reason I ended up in this situation is my own fault for not taking a firm position. I talked to them the summer after my freshman year, and then again after the first semester of my sophomore year about changing my major. Every time I let myself get talked back into completing the major I started out with because I'm ""trying to run from my failures."" At the same time, every other person I've talked to has told me to switch my major except my parents. To what extent is changing my major running from failure though?

&amp;#x200B;

The only two options I can find that I think might work is switching my major to either accounting or public health. Either one I can graduate within the same amount of time, with possibly one or two classes over the summer. The thing is that public health is sort of on their ""shitlist"" because one of my cousins graduated with a bs in it and it took a couple of months for her to find a job after graduation (mostly I'm pretty sure it's because she deviated from the engineering/medical school path and everyone's still upset over it). And I'm still a little unsure about accounting itself, but I know that it's straightfoward at least. I think I'm pretty ok with math so it might be fine, but I also feel like I don't have a concrete understanding of the subject.

&amp;#x200B;

I see them in a week again and I don't know if it's better to tell them over the phone or in person and get everyone upset on the 6-hour car ride back home. I dropped a course that I needed for my current major a couple of weeks ago because I was definitely going to get a D and never told them, so that's fun.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you break the news that you still aren't doing well in something you've been at for a while?

Basically, I just feel kinda stuck and not looking forward to the next couple of years. I'm 17 and male. Most of my school days are really short without many school hours. I've had to repeat this year sins last year I didn't have sufficient grades to pass. After school, I come home and spend the majority of the rest of the day on my computer watching yt videos redditing and playing some video games. I have few friends but the ones I do have are in the grade above me. I never hang out with them sins they live far away and have a busy schedule. Where I live I don't get to drive till 18 so I need to bike everywhere I go. My best friend lives 1.5 hours biking from my house so that really isn't that feasible.  I feel like I'm wasting so much time that I could use to learn useful skills, or having fun with other people. I understand how important school is but the reality is that I just really dislike it atm. I'm not doing that well this year either b/c of that. I have more than a year left of school which I'm really not looking forward to. Also, I live in a village where there isn't much going on. My parents are divorced so I have to move a lot which makes finding a job kinda hard. I don't have any girlfriend and my life just seems to be the same every day.

My BF has been friends with Jeff since they were teenagers and Jeff &amp; Kate have been together around 10 years, as have I and my BF. So we’ve all subsequently been friends for around 10 years. 

Recently Jeff, my BF and some of their friends all went on a night out which we later found out Jeff had met a girl on this night out &amp; had been texting this girl behind Kate’s back.
There was another night out arranged and Jeff asked one of the group to get him another ticket for the event (he hadn’t been paid so was asking them to buy it &amp; he’d pay them back.) he initially failed to mention the ticket was for this girl. He later started boasting in a group chat that he was meeting up with some girl behind Kate’s back and that the ticket was for her (know idea why on Earth he felt the need to boast about it??? But it didn’t go down too well in the group as everyone knows Kate, she’s a lovely kind hearted woman and he also has a child with her.) 
No one could believe he was actually going to do it .. but he did! He went to the club with the guys and met up with this girl and disappeared with her all night. Who knows what he actually got up2 with her?? 

He now just expects us all not to say anything to Kate and he’s made every excuse how “it’s not cheating blah blah” “he’s been having a hard time lately blah blah.” (which in my eyes, it is cheating!) I asked him what he’d do if she did the same and he said “kill her!” So it can’t be one rule for one and one for another.

I haven’t spoken to him since I found all this out and my BF hasn’t much either. He thinks it’s not a big deal, we should just forget about it and he doesn’t seem to grasp why we have an issue with what he did. I’ve only spoken to Kate briefly by text. But she wants to meet up as we haven’t seen each other for a while but I just don’t know what to do?? Like I don’t want to tell her what he’s done and break her heart like that but I also don’t want to be disloyal to her, see her, feel like I’m lying to her face knowing I know all this. I just don’t know what to do?? So I’m kinda just avoiding her at the minute. 

This isn’t even the first time he’s put us in a position where we have to lie to Kate either but before it was all drug related. He has a massive drug problem but hides it from her how bad it is and how much he’s doing and spending.

Throughout college, I found myself struggling more and more, at some stage abusing adderall just to make myself capable of showing up. I began to feel depressed and lonely. Last year, my final year of college, I had a friend of mine pass away. I spent the next three weeks getting drunk day in day out. Looking for the answers, I decided to try acid. I had an estranged experience, on the fence between positive and negative.

 I don't know if a days gone by that I haven't thought about it. Nonetheless, the recent passing of my friend weighed on my mind, and found it too much to bare alongside my study - I pretty well avoided contact with everyone. In the time I spent avoiding my friends, I managed to get my first job, as a cashier, which was short lived (approx 6 weeks), though at no fault of my own. A month went by, and I'm now onto another job. It pays about $20 more. They've told me I have the job. Only issue is, it's been 6 weeks and I'm yet to be asked in for their medical. All that said and done, I failed that semester and will have to return to college at a later date.

Not just that, my vision is extremely blurry for anything over 4 or 5 meters, it's certain that I have short-sightedness so please, please don't start saying that I'm lying or something. I had this problem since 8th grade, when we moved to another city. Being new to the city, I went to school by a taxi at the beginning. Guess what? I don't see if it's empty or not until the driver gets so close that when I give a sign, he stops few meters away. Some people in the building (we lived in an apartment there) were making fun of me for this, not knowing that I couldn't actually tell if there was someone in the taxi. They even asked my brother why I do this and he just started joking with them about it. I thought it was normal and told my parents that I couldn't tell if there was anyone so they carried on (mostly because they were busy with more important stuff since we moved). In the apartment, I  couldn't see the TV which was like 6 meters away. I ignored it because everyone said that the TV was crap and they also couldn't see it clearly (the tv actually was crap). I could ignore all this because my vision wasn't as bad as it's today. I could see signs on shops just not the far ones. Fast forward, I'm at 9th grade and we came back to our original city where basically all my friends are. When I walk, someone suddenly walks to me and say ""dude you won't say hi?"", except that it wasn't just someone, it was most of my friends. I couldn't (and still can't) recognise faces or people few meters away! I could tell that my vision is already bad but I didn't tell anyone because my parents are as I said, traditional. Their answer to anything is ""It's because of the smartphone"". Plus if I had told them, they would shame me and yell at me every single day, literally. That's why I kept my mouth shut. Fast forward a year and I'm at 10th grade (highschool). The same problems with taxis and not recognizing the faces of people who are 8+ meters away which I get around by saying ""Oh sorry, I wasn't paying attention"". It's just bad I couldn't even see the the second whiteboard (the one on the opposite side) in my classroom even though I was sitting at the first seat! I spent whole nights crying about my vision to 4 am until I get too tired and eventually sleep. Or shall I say ""spend""? Today only few days are keeping me apart from 12th grade and I still haven't told anyone. ABSOLUTELY NO ONE except my one best friend who I hadn't told him but he noticed it by himself. No one else knows. I just can't handle it anymore! I can hardly see things! If I tell my parents they will keep shaming me and yelling at me every single day for the rest of my life!! I literally spend the night thinking and crying about this problem! I'm just too tired of it! I'm already crying while writing this! I wish no one ever gets to be in this situation. Now aside from tears, I really don't care about what people think or say about me. I'm confident enough to wear glasses. The only problem is my parents. Aside from the yelling I just can't imagine their disappointment and sadness when they get to know this. I really need help. Please give me an advice about what I should do or how I should tell them. I can't handle this anymore.",09May2019,0
596,"So I was asked to be in a friend’s wedding. I’ve known her since middle school, but now we’re 25 and have grown apart. We don’t hang out, we talk every once in a while, but she asked since I’m her oldest friend that she’s in contact with. I said yes because I like being in weddings. 

She chose a date after I committed, and it’s the same weekend as a music festival I’d like to attend with my current set of friends. We all went last year, they’ve been going regularly, and they all want to go as a group again this year, and that includes my boyfriend. I told her about it, and she said she wouldn’t be upset if I backed out because she has alternates. I haven’t committed to backing out, I haven’t really committed to anything 100%, but I know I need to. 

My question is do I miss going to an amazing festival with my current close group of friends and significant other to be in my teenage friend’s wedding, or do I skip the festival that I really want to attend to be in the wedding of someone I don’t even hang out with anymore?",09May2019,1
597,"First and foremost, this post will probably be drawn out and unorganized, so I apologize for that.

Anyway, like the title says, I'm just tired and I don't know what to do. I'm a 25M, and my lack of financial/career success is the crux of my depression and subsequent failures.

I have an Associates in a field I don't want to work in, I haven't been at a single job for more than a year, and I haven't been successful in switching career fields.

My Associates is in Industrial Technology, as I was trying to get into a maintenance type of position at 21/22. This was the last time I would describe myself as ""happy"". I managed to land a good job at a motor repair shop - cool coworkers, clean shop, decent pay, and a company focus on safety. However, I was only there for a month before the management moved on and the company decided to downsize my location - getting rid of me and other new hires. 

After that, I started work at a plastic sheet production plant, which is where my depression started. It was 12 hour shifts of the most monotonous work I've ever done, usually in hot/cold conditions with few upsides. I hated it, and near the end of my time there, I started having suicidal thoughts and my mood was rarely ever positive. I'm there a year and then I'm fired based on a misunderstanding. 

Fast forward 3 months and I'm now a laborer at a local machine shop. Nothing fun or exciting, but better than the factory. Get wet some days, dirty most. Can at least listen to music while working. Sometimes I get to go out on a delivery and get out of the shop. Have a few coworkers that I'm friends with. Unfortunately, my personality didn't mesh well with my boss', and I was let go. That was 8 months ago. 

A family member of mine is an insurance broker, and suggests that I try to get into that field as I've expressed interest in getting out of the blue collar type of work since it hasn't been working for me. I've tried getting into the safety field, but I don't have any experience nor a safety degree. Early October, I get my Property and Casualty License. I don't really want to sell insurance for a variety of reasons - I'm not really a salesman, not generally a people person, etc. - but I thought it would be a decent knowledge base for future insurance jobs and show that I'm capable of understanding the subject.

I'm unable to find a job with just the P&amp;C license, but I get an interview with Aflac for an agent position. I tell them I'm new to insurance and that I've never been a salesman, but they tell me no problem. The hiring process takes a month, and in that time I get my Accident and Health license for them. At the end of the process, I discover that it's 100% commission with no benefits. I have few friends at all, let alone those in high corporate places that I can talk into buying insurance. I quit before I start to salvage some time I would have otherwise spent uselessly trying to sell insurance.

Fast forward to late March this year and I still haven't found a job. My family member in the insurance field has a friend who's hiring, and I apply because at that point, I'm low on cash and options.

So we're all caught up, and now I'm working at a gas station with 8.50 /hr pay with no benefits and a 45 minute commute one way. It's not the worst job I've ever had, but it's just not sustainable. I'm still living at home, and at the end of next month I turn 26, thus losing access to my family's insurance. I apply and apply and apply, and follow up, send thank you emails, etc., but I haven't had any success.

I feel that if I could just get my foot in the door somewhere even remotely interesting or insurance/safety related, I could power through it and get a hold on life in general, but it just isn't happening. I've thought about suicide but I just don't have the courage to do it, and I've thought about just walking away with a bag of clothes/necessities. But that would hurt my family so I don't know what to do. 

I don't have the time and money required to get a bachelors, either in a new field or with transfer credits. My only lifeline at this point is the local steel mill, whom I have an open application with. I could hear from them tomorrow or next year. If I can get in there, I'd instantly be much more financially stable, though I fear my depression would skyrocket again. I'm also overweight, but if my life continues to suck and fail, why bother getting healthy to live longer? I'm basically at the end of my line here, and I just feel lost. 

Thanks if you read all that. I'm not expecting a miracle answer or anything, but I thought what could asking hurt?",09May2019,1

599,"I'm 16 cis-gendered female and straight. I have an overly supportive friend who is ALL about ""finding yourself"" and I really appreciate it but sometimes she makes wild assumptions. For some context I'm pretty athletic, have a RBF face (which my friend calls masculine), read manga, comics and am a big fan choice-based video games and other single player games. On the flip side I also love lacy dresses and heels and other ""feminine"" things. 

&amp;#x200B;

In class I was talking to a guy about Detroit: Become Human because he saw my wallpaper was Connor. We chatted about it and joked how we should hang out and play the game one day with a few mutual friends. (We both knew it wouldn't happen since my parents are very strict with boys).  Anyway, after that interaction, my friend was acting really weird for the rest of the day then texted me after school saying, ""You can tell me you know.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was really confused and all of a sudden we were in this argument where *I* was too scared to admit I wanted to be a boy? And that she's there for me and my hardships now matter what? She tried making call this hotline (i think it was called Trevor or Trevlyn project) because she claimed I had gender dysphoria. 

&amp;#x200B;

She goes off about how I always do ""guy things"" and ""look masculine"" (ouch)  because of my veiny hands, ""predator eyes"" (she even called it that wtf does that mean) and sharp jaw. I told her to stop being ridiculous and that I'm completely comfortable being a girl and the more people label things as ""masculine"" the harder it is for me to exists I guess. I'm not sure what to do, anytime I talk about something relatively ""masculine"" she'll try to become a therapist and say shit like ""and how does that make you feel?"".  *Bitch idk.* It makes me feel like not talking to you anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

She always says ""my secret"" is safe with her but I've had 3 people come up to me saying she told them and that they won't tell anyone else. What do I do to stop her? She's trying to help me with a problem I don't have!",09May2019,37
600,"Hi,

I’m currently a temporary hire at a extremely junior position. The contract is due to end shortly.

My boss recommended me to apply for a permanent role at a level up.

The interview is 3 stages. Each stage is with a different team member (all of whom I have a good relationship with). I booked the room for my own interview and even printed the CV’s for the other external candidates at one stage. 

My first interview is with my immediate boss, who I sit next to on a day to day basis.

During normal working hours, I hear information about other candidates etc. The whole process seems extremely stressful. I constantly think of the worst case scenarios - i.e how awkward it will be if I bum the interviews only to go back to my desk and meet my colleagues who just interviewed me.

Any advice is much appreciated.",09May2019,2

603,"I applied to many jobs. I also plan on going back to school. The insurance job is as an office rep. The agent was really interested in me and is willing to invest in me. I just have to get licensed by the state. After that, we set a schedule to work and train. He is willing to reimburse my studies and exam for this job. It sounds like a really good gig but I’m terrified of sales. It scares me to even talk to strangers. I know nothing about insurance and I’m scared of trying to convince people to buy property and casualty insurance. 

Then I have the pharmacy tech route where I can study the guide and take the exam. Then I’ll be certified and can work in retail and build my years of experience to get a hospital pharmacy tech job.

I am so conflicted. This makes me want to become certified/licensed in both. All I know is that I’m ready to get out of years of fast food service. Fast food has wasted my energy, made me miserable, and the stress, omg, the fucking stress that management gives me.

605,"My stepdad molested me as a kid and I don’t want him at my wedding. My mom just wants to be happy and I feel like she wants to ignore all that I told her he did to me. I’m going to get it all off my chest.  

My mom has bad taste in men. My biological father was abusive, drank a ton, did drugs. I had it pretty ok compared to my 2 older brothers. Imagine my surprise when my mom leaves him. Allows my oldest brother to be on his own 15, and runs away with her sweetheart from when she was 18. She whisks us away with a guy she new 16 years ago, and they’re free.
 I’m the youngest, 7 1/2 at this point.  Things were better for them, I’m not sure how long until it started. I remember a balloon. I was on their bed, just batting this balloon in the air. He got on the bed and started hitting the balloon in the air too. Things get very fuzzy after that. I have one leg pinned by him and then I’m scooted up the bed. Our privates touched and I got in trouble.

  He would go out of his way to ground me, say no to everything, loved humiliating me. To everyone else it would seem like good hearted fun. The inappropriate comments and nicknames never stopped. Everyone thought I as just being dramatic. I would often just burst into tears.  

 I remember being called into their bedroom. He told be to shut the door. I walked over and he said my mom wanted him to talk to me about sex. He brought porn up on his computer and I was so shocked. I tried to leave and he yelled at me, I had to stay. He kept telling me, “This is what girls like to do” “one day, you’ll like this too” he then asks if I want to see it. Not knowing what he was talking about, I said no. I thought I was already as stressed as I could get, things couldn’t get worse. He undid his pants and had an erection. I covered my eyes, scream /crying and tried to find the door. I screamed IM A GOOD GIRL, IM A VIRGIN LEAVE ME ALONE. I finally could the door and it was locked. He had locked the door. I was 8 maybe 9 at this point. He got up and started yelling again. I had to comeback. He was oozing at this point, so excited. Said “girls like to eat this stuff, wanna try?” I ran, he was mad. I unlocked the door and fear stumbled to my room. 

Where was my brother? A friends house. Where was my mom? Idk either working the graveyard shift, sleeping in the livingroom from the graveyard shift or... honestly I have no idea. I was so alone. I was so scared and thought this was how life was for everyone. 

 There were more incidents: I had my hair up Lin pigtails and he tickles my neck with them “girls like this”, I wore a dress to church “ do you want to know why girls wear dresses?” “Because it’s easy to” STOP “calm down, stop being a diva” LEAVE ME ALONE “what are you a lessy? That why you don’t like this?” He does tickle fights and pins me face down in the ground and it feels almost like while I’m trapped and can’t see anything, he’s placing himself on me? There was so much more. As a consequence I stopped wearing my hair up, only wore jeans (even when I went swimming you’ll see why soon) I dressed more like a boy, I wanted to disappear.  

It was a hot summer,I’m  10-11 and I couldn’t sleep one night. I was just staring at the ceiling. I take off my long pj pants for comfort. I hear someone walking down the hallway and close my eyes thinking my mom was checking on me. I hear the light flick on, some time passes, then someone gently sits on the bed next to me. More time passes  and I feel the blankets start to move near my bottom. I open my eyes, dazed by the bright light and say MOM? My eyes widen, I’m frozen. It’s Him. He looks so shocked and surprised. He gets up quickly and leaves saying “she was just having a nightmare!” As if he was saying it to my mom. That’s interesting because like I said, I wasn’t sleeping.  

Now I knew why I wasn’t allowed to have a lock on my door.  More bullshit happens. I’m always scared, humiliated.   

He does the “sex Ed” thing again, talking about positions. I’m getting upset and he’s starting to scare me. He tells me to put on a swim suit because my butt looks good in it. I’m so fucking defeated. “this is what your mom wants. If you say anything, do you really think anyone will believe you over me”shit like that. I know he’s going to hurt me. One way is going to be worse than the other. I leave his room, my mom is passed out cold on the couch from a long day of work. I go change in my room and come out in a robe because I’m afraid that I’m going to get the ever loving shit beat out of me. I’m afraid we’re going to get kicked out. My mom is gone, her bedroom door is shut.he tells me to go to the dining room. Demands I get on my back laptop crying” and says “this is missionary” “on your hands and knees now. He gets behind me and places himself on me over my bathing suit. I’m crying, I’m so fucking alone. He stops. “What’s wrong with you.” “ see what you did, what you’re making me do?! Go now.”  

I spent so much time with friends and very little time home. My life growing up turned into escaping my reality. I wanted to be rescued. I just didn’t know who I could trust. I also didn’t want to lose my family. I stopped talking and making eye contact. We argued. I would play video games and he’d walk in hanging out of his tighty whities . I’d never give him the satisfaction, even when he made a big deal and treated it as an oops. I never acknowledged what he was doing. My torment never stopped. He was always trying to control and punish me. I once asked him why “ you look like your mom when she was young”  I move away and a lot of life happens. 

I finally have the courage to tell a friend, I tell my brother (he had no idea) the other one still doesn’t know. I finally tell my mom, she wants to protect me. She’s so betrayed by her husband. She’s on her own journey with things rn, they’re still together. This pains me in so many ways. 

  It’s been 22 years and I’m in a pretty healthy place. I’m getting married to a very sweet, loving man. I’ve got amazing friends, a home of my own and I feel safe finally. I just want to say that I wish there was justice for what was done to me. I’ve made my peace with mostly everything. I don’t want him at my wedding but if he’s not invited then chances are I wouldn’t be able to visit my mom again. This is where it’s messing me up on the inside. I still have some work to do about the whole situation. Thank you for listening.",09May2019,28

Since I began working here in the summer of 2017, I received one raise at my one year review and that’s it. I know at the end of last year they gave every hourly employee a “cost of living” increase, which they did not gave me. I stayed silent. Now they are doing this whole “wage restructure” and yet my wage has stayed the same. I understand that my work is different from the guys who do the manual labour. But to get my job they required a post-secondary degree and experience working, while assistants can get hired with 0 skills and knowledge.

614,"So, okay, this isn't something I'd usually do. But I'm really at a loss here and figured some totally unbiased opinions will be extremely useful. 

The Backstory (real quick):

My best friend and I have been friends for around 7 years now. In the past 4 years, we've gotten incredibly close and even reached that point where people considered us a package deal.  We genuinely did *everything* together. 

Recently, she's been having some problems with herself. You know, with decisions she'd made and things she hasn't exactly been coping with all that well. When she told me that she needed to work on herself a bit, I agreed and knew that she was struggling. So, I was supportive of it all. 

Even when she said that I couldn't ask her how she was doing and dealing.

To me, this meant that I just couldn't ask about her recovery specifically. Other than that, I assumed we'd continue the friendship as per usual. Only, turns out not so much. She started ignoring my messages and being off with me when I tried to make plans (even it it's just to say hi in person). Out of respect for her, I didn't ask how she was doing with it all, but started to get agitated when she didn't even bother to ask how I was doing in over two months. Side note: I broke my arm and for the entire recovery, she didn't once ask how it was going.

So one night, I message her, telling her that I need an explanation since my head keeps jumping to conclusions (I don't deal very well with rejection of any kind when it comes to those I love). We had a very long phone call where we talked about a lot. Then, tonight (9 May, about 2 weeks later) I ask again if we can just chat, nothing serious, some catching up. In the previous call she had apologized profusely and said how much she wanted to make things right. However, when I (once again it having to be me) reach out again, she initially says yes, then delays with with 2 hours, then delays it with a day. 

So the advice I'm looking for:

Is it wrong for me to expect that she should be doing more from her side? Is it wrong of me to feel rejected when I once again try and patch things up further when I was the one who did nothing wrong? I'm just so confused and scared of losing the one person who knew me the best. Has anyone else lost a best friend and didn't know how to cope with it?",09May2019,1

I’m also taking meds and they hardly ever cover a full cost so I want to find a somewhat ethical insurance company.,09May2019,1
616,"Title says it all. I used to feel so confident in myself, not overly confident, but a great balance. 5 years ago my longtime gf broke up with me over the phone with no explanation or reasoning behind it. Since that day I’ve been a mess... 5 years later I’m still single , haven’t been on a single date, let alone feel confident enough to ask a girl out. I’m 26 now and I feel as if I’m wasting away...

I just want to feel like I used to feel, and not give a fuck what anyone else thinks, unfortunately it’s been a 5 year struggle with no success. 

Any suggestions or tips would be much appreciated. 

Thanks in advance, you guys/gals rock.",09May2019,1
618,"I've worked in the construction industry for years now. For a while now I've been wanting to move out of state, did it before and actually had some success. Moved back home and had some tough jobs here. 

Experience: I've been painting houses for a total of five years. One of those years I worked for this redneck old man who made it his personal mission to make my job miserable even though I never missed a day and worked more hours than everyone else in the company and still got a bunch of crap every day. One day he really pissed me off and I just walked off the job. I had no choice, I dealt with so much crap from the guy I actually have high blood pressure now and I'm only thirty. Now I just don't want to work for anyone around here because he is good buddies with all the other paint bosses around here, and he did tell me once that he would make sure I never got another job painting houses cause he would tell them I'm a worthless painter. I pick up random jobs to get some cash for food so my mom doesn't have to give me money so the time.


Family: I wish I wasn't complaining so much but my mom works alot. My brother lives here too and he's almost forty and I've been feeding him about 90 percent of the time the past about four years. We're always here together and he just hovers around alot and has chances to work but it just for some reason never happens. He's a smart guy just always in the mode of telling us, you should, we should, why, all this stuff. Like I said I have high blood pressure or something and I just shut down.


Job Opportunity: In the state I was planning on moving to I sent some resume type stuff to some companies who were looking for paint sub contractors. They saw my website and pictures of my work and one company wants me to sub for them. Keep in mind this is their first reply since responding to their Craigslist ad a month ago. It's pays really well. They even offered to help me out financially for the first few jobs. I have the opportunity to actually start making a decent living again after a long while. The only thing is it's a big risk to take. Plus I gotta leave my family behind and start all over again. I don't know what gonna happen with my family my brother hasn't had much success in his life and he gets extremely depressed over it, it could be worse if I leave. My mom is a great person and I want to help her but I won't be able to make a living here. I'll basically just be disappearing idk.",09May2019,1
619,"My boyfriend and I have been on and off for seven years. In between that time we had two children together. For the first year of our second child’s life, his behavior was... well let’s just call it different. He was a stay at home dad but was working in the cryptomarket (no money coming in). He was barely sleeping, eating and barely parenting. I’d come home from work at night and the house would be tore up and the kids awake at 2am while he was on the computer not paying attention. Our relationship was also tremendously suffering.

On the eve of our daughter’s first bday, he went missing. After searching through his computer I found out he was heavily into drugs. After calling the police because I was imagining him dead somewhere, I went out driving looking for his truck. Sure enough I found him parked at a nearby Taco Bell passed out in his truck (15 hours later. And yes, he had been doing drugs).

Fast-forward to him embarking on his sobriety journey, he left me and our kids and went to stay with family out of state. I reached out to his family for help because there was no way I could work, take care of two babies and help him get clean. We tried for 1.5 months and it was too difficult. Months of relapses but finally on 01/2019 things started to get better. By that time we barely were speaking to each other. I was upset and felt deceived especially since I unexpectedly became a single mom to two while he was out doing drugs. I understand now that addiction is a disease but for months I was angry at his decision to even have ever tried it, especially with his family history with addiction.

He was barely calling to speak to his kids anymore but I figured he was working hard at maintaining sobriety. Weeks later I (accidentally) found out he had met someone and had started a new relationship. I reached out to his family to find out what the heck is going on and they basically told me that all that matters is that he stays sober, even if that means him being with another woman (!!!!). Are you kidding me? I’m here in a different state taking care of our kids (struggling and barely making ends meet) and entrusted his family to help him get clean only to find all this out? 
Fast-forward a few more weeks and I find out his mom and stepdad spent a lot of time with the new girl and was convincing him to stay with her over coming back to me and his kids??! 

If anyone knows anything about recovery it’s that you shouldn’t make any huge life changing decisions or start/end relationships. Another fast-forward and now he’s back home with me and our kids. He knows he’s messed up and is putting in the effort to make it right. I guess where I’m going at with this is I feel like I just wanna say fuck you to his family and hope I never have to deal with them again but that’s probably not always going to be possible.

Background info, I’m 17 and study a Health and Social Care Diploma. Due to personal reasons I missed most of my first work experience placement (compulsory to pass the course) and on my return to college I was told I couldn’t do my second placement. I found out about a week ago I need to have three placements with a total of 150 hours to pass. I could probably manage the 150 hours across the next two placements but I don’t think my first placement even counts due to how little I was there. So I doubt I can even pass my course anymore.

I could just do another course and start from scratch in September but honestly, I don’t want to do another year of education. I don’t know what I want to do in the future and every option I have seems like it’ll pigeonhole me into one career path. I could do an apprenticeship which is a good balance of work/something practical and learning, but there’s very few sectors I’m interested in. There are a few, but if I start one and don’t like it I’ll be stuck training for a job I won’t enjoy. There’s also a good chance that my dad wouldn’t approve of me doing an apprenticeship since it’s not ‘real’ education like going to sixth form or college and then to university.

625,"I’ve been working as a youth worker at a government funded organization for almost a year now and i really enjoy it.  Recently i was talked to about my boss because someone complained that i was on my phone too much during overnight shifts and they felt they were doing more than me. i was annoyed, i admit during overnight shifts that are dead i do go on my phone but i still feel like i get stuff done .i felt embarrassed and down on myself, but my boss and i discussed it and we decided overnights are not for me and my strengths lie in working directly with the youth and handling a crises so i’m going to be given more day and evening shifts. She was super nice and caring and i felt reassured . Since then i have been going the extra mile and doing tasks not on my list when i have free time and it has been noticed. 

i talked to another co worker about it because she was around when i checked in with my boss via a phone call and she told me she’s had similar talks and to not worry . she also said that since the new girl started there has been a lot
of tension. I suspected it was her who talked to my boss, and now i’m almost 100% . she also told me that this new girl has been gossiping about co workers and been very difficult to work with. She supposedly told other co workers that she thinks i’m too privileged and therefor do not have the experience to work with vulnerable youth. I am not surprised at this comment from her , because she had made some indirect / snide comments to me when we first met. I admit it, i am privileged and i grew up in a nice area and went to a good school, but i never flaunted this in her face ! it simply came up because i was trying to get to know her and make small talk the day i met her by asking the usual “ where are you from ?” questions and when i realized we had mutual friends, i asked where she had studied. 


anyways , while her comment did not personally hurt me , it is very unprofessional and i know it made my co workers uncomfortable because they like me and know how i work and they have heard her talk about others and had their own negative  experiences with her.


i don’t really know how to handle this. I hav a check in with my boss next week and i feel i can’t really bring up what i heard was said about me by this person because it was through the grape vine and not a direct interaction. I also don’t know how to handle being around somone who has expressed dislike for me.

the reassuring part is i know i am not the only one who doesn’t like her.I felt a bad vibe right away , but i thought i was the only one. i also don’t like that my co worker who is a sweetheart told me she gets anxious when she has to see her because of her attitude towards others . this is becoming a toxic work environment. it’s my first time in a professional setting and i am not sure how to handle office politics and drama.
I don’t want to go running to mommy (boss) and i prefer to talk directly with the person and settle things properly and civically, but because they never have been direct with me, it’s hard. 


So far i have been being extra nice to her, not out of a desperate need to be liked , but because when you’re nice to people who don’t like you, it messes w them lol. I’m being petty .

any advice ?",09May2019,3

I don't know what to do and I need advice, please.**

Throwaway account because my friends use Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

2016 was the year where I pretty much lost control of my life. I was in my first very serious relationship with my partner, and it all began to crumble and we split during the end of that second half of that semester. I lost all drive to do anything, I stopped going to class, and I failed out almost all my classes that semester. So, instead of facing my adviser, parents, friends - I simply coiled myself in a ball and when registration came out for 2017 I simply said I went, and lied. I went to the Library as I skipped the semester, and I began to dwell in my saddness. Time went on, I used distractions \[Gaming, Life, wallowing in my self-pity\] to let the time go on as I worked part-time at my parents shop. I kept putting off this day - Graduation - in my mind and I never thought it would get here. I kept lying about failing some classes to keep me behind \[I already switched majors twice since I couldn't find a good enough major for me\] but of course I can't keep failing and continued to say I passed and passed.

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worse, the last year and a half my father and mother have been having serious martial issues with my father discovered cheating on my mom. I only found out like 2 months ago because she was trying to protect me from 'damage'. She's trying to bandage shit together but it isn't working and my father is on a hair-thin line. My mother keeps talking about how it's all going to be fine and I just need to finish my University, but I'm now absolutely terrified that me explaining everything is going to be the straw that 'breaks the camels back'.

&amp;#x200B;

I try and explain to my mother that I can work at her shop fulltime 'after I get my degree' and I'm very serious about helping her grow, and fulltime it; but she's obviously looking to have me finish my University because 'That's something people can't take away from you.' I already attempted to drop hints to her as means that I'm so stressed and may want to take a semester off, but even then she blew a socket saying how dumb it was that I would try and stop while I'm so close to the end \[Again, my fault for having it go this far.\]

&amp;#x200B;

Today is my 'final' day, where my final class is pretty much suppose to be done. I already told them I failed it twice, so I don't believe saying I failed it a third time is going to fly but at this point it's going to be my only damn option. I fear that if I fucking tell them the last 2 years I've been trying to discover myself with other options they're going to see me as playing them, and I'm afraid that this will essentially cause a shatter in my family that is going to be unfixable.

&amp;#x200B;

I know how bad I fucked this up - and I know I should have spoken to one of my parents; but I was idiotic and stupid and thought I had time, and now I'm turning 24 this year and I'm cornered now. I'm afraid I broke all trust between me and my family and that if I just sat them down and told them this it'll end up with everything falling apart. I feel like I've wasted so much time that I won't be able to have any other career path without a degree. I know this isn't true, but it's just how it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I've been dreading this day for the last year now, and I wish I just could go back to the semester where I failed and could fucking tell myself to talk to someone or speak out about what happened. Please, if anyone can just give me any advice on what I should do in this situation, I would love it, because I absolutely am terrified and stressed to a point where I feel like I'm going to faint and want to vomit.",09May2019,0
634,"I have a friend. Let’s call her x. Me and x use to date around 2 years ago but decided it’d be better if we were just friends so we broke up. Around a year ago she started getting back into drinking heavily and it really sent her down a horrible path in life. Such as getting blacked out and trying to sleep with just about anybody. Including my friends. And the worst part was she lied about it all to me and I only just found out about it 3 days ago when one of my other friends decided it was time to tell me. I don’t really know how to react to it. I’m immensely disappointed in her for lying to me for that long and not telling me about anything that was going on in her life.

635,"A bit of backstory so you can understand where I’m coming from. I’m 16 living in Canada, and have recently removed myself from very negative group of friends that used to hang around abuse drugs for a year or so. I started doing high school online, and I am getting higher marks then ever before. I even started reading again, and I really hated reading before. I have been going to a psychologist which has helped and have been put on anti depressant for anxiety. 

I am seriously looking and trying to find something, some type of activity to replace doing drugs with past friends. But nothing fills that, I wish I could smoke just a little on the side just to balance work and stress of life. Everyone else does. I already steal a bit of liquor from dad whenever given the opportunity. I tried video games but they bore me. I don’t know if I’m being naive, but I really do think I can keep these both in check. I have been able to do it so far. Ive been extremely productive, High 90s in school(which I do online) and I completely cut out all the negative friends, and started hanging around my family more. My parents have loved this and have told me that are so happy I turned things around. I just want a bit of an escape every now and then. While I am certain that the reason I have gotten productive is removing that negative element from my life, a portion of what drives me to become so unproductive some times now is that I don’t see what the point is. Usually I wait this out, watch tv veg out, until the guilt is unbearable and do productive things again. This is not a long term strategy though. As sometimes it’s takes days until this guilt builds. I think at one point I had video games that gave me relief it doesn’t anymore, I wish it did. But the year of abusing drugs ruined that for me I think. I steal liquor and I work and use that as my reward. I know it’s wrong. But how else can I motivate myself. I guess what I’m dancing around asking is it absolutely crazy to want to try and allow my parents me use cannabis or weed on the side every now and then?

Ps: weed is legal in Canada however not for minors.",09May2019,1
636,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I need advice in regards to handling this situation and how to feel about certain things regarding it. Since last week my world has been thrown upside down.

 Background info: I come from a small town up the north of Scotland, she down south near Sheffield, long story short, after being in a relationship for 3 months with love of my life, and despite our best efforts to use contraception, last week I found out she's 4-5 weeks pregnant. We both are not in the financial stability that is required to raise a child, nor do we have a place to live together at this current moment in time. I myself had always planned on going to university up in St. Andrews after receiving my offer to study economics and we were to move in together near to the uni at the same time starting it. I am currently undergoing my Alevel exams and this situation is deteriorating my performance in them.

We have both come to the decision that it is in both ourselves, our families, and the unborn child's best decision to terminate the pregnancy and carry on with our lives together, we are in a loving relationship and adore the bones off each other and I, nor anyone else is pressuring her into doing something that she doesn't agree with, and she knows i'll support her no matter her decision on keeping or terminating the pregnancy. Despite her saying that she wants to terminate the pregnancy, it seems like she is constantly finding ways to try and convince herself to keep it, one minute telling me that she wants it all to be over, the next saying that she wont know for certain if she wants to get rid off it until she receives a scan at the hospital. I understand how hard of a decision that is for her to make, yet it doesn't seem as if she is concerned for me or the way it will impact me, i'm an anxiety riddled individual and her constantly changing her point of view and feelings on keeping it is destroying me, my studies, my social life and my home life. Is this a normal thing to feel? Am I justified in feeling the way I do or am I just being insensitive? We both know that having a child now would be a very bad scenario in which we wouldn't be able to financially support or raise it successfully, due to the distance, lack of financial income and separation of our families and yet she believes that it'd be easy and everything would be hunky-dory if we had a child at this age - not realizing the huge consequences it will have on us both.

I love her to bits and not once would I even consider leaving her side if she chose to keep it, I would step up and devote my life to making sure that the child is raise in a happy, successful environment and make any compromises I had to in order to ensure that both my girlfriend and child are as happy as they can be, despite her knowing this, she gets frustrated and doesn't seem to understand the significant impact it will have on my career - or lack of it dare I say, if she were to make the choice to keep it, and doesn't understand how anxious and paralyzed the entire situation is making me, despite my best efforts to handle it as a man. Am I being selfish for expecting her to understand how it will effect my life or am I selfish for believing that its impact on my life bears and notion of significance in comparison to hers?

I can't talk to any of my friends or family, since keeping it between us at the minute would be better for both of us. 

I'm really not sure how or what to feel, but if someone would be so kind as to give any advice or input on how I should feel or handle this it would be greatly appreciated

637,"I want my son to make more friends in the sense that I want him to be able to hang out and play with other kids outside of school.

640,"This is a touchy subject for me. I wanted to do a quick summary but I might as well set the stage. I’m sorry for writing so much.

I lost my mom to an aggressive cancer at 18 right after high school graduation. My mom and I were best friends, she was a single mother and I am her only child. She was loved by a lot of people. Friends family coworkers, she worked two jobs and supported me the best she could. The funeral was huge, I didn’t know half the people who attended. I remember the line was out the door for people to pay their respects. 

It’s been a few years since her death, I’ve gotten stronger. After a string of bad and abusive relationships, moving several times to different towns and states: I’m finally back home in the town I grew up living with the person I truly plan on marrying. His family knew my mother very well. Thankfully they’re nothing but kind and supportive during times like this.  My mother remarried a marine who has taken the role of a part time father currently in my life. He has other kids and grandchildren, I try not to get in the way even though I know he loves me. He can’t make a lot of time to spend with me, he still works and still to this day loves my mother. But I know where his priorities lie. 

My dad is a different story, he doesn’t have emotion or empathy. They divorced when I was young he hated my mom until the day she died. He takes it out on me to this day. I think she shattered his ego when she left him 20+ years ago. It’s like he can’t get over it. Whenever he looks at me I know he sees her. I’ve tried to repair our relationship but he isn’t worth the stress. He hasn’t gotten to know me as a person despite my attempts to try to mend things.  *I’m only mentioning all this because I know the first thing people probably think after hearing someone lost their mom; what’s their relationship with their dad like? Well there you have it. Nonexistent.

Anyway, I currently work weekends as a hairdresser, and I love my job. I’ve only been in this industry for a couple years and I finally found the place where I can grow as a stylist and learn to perfect my talent. However being new, I only work part time. I make a decent living even though it’s part time, I work in a classy area and the tips I make and the services I do sustain me. I do eventually want more hours but it’s hard right now. I worked in other low end salons where I was needed. Here it’s competition, and I’m eager to prove myself to get full time. Since I only work a few days a week every day is crucial for rent.
My boyfriend works two jobs it’s not like we live paycheck to paycheck. 

After losing my mom I struggled with the calendar.
She died on a Friday 
So Friday’s were hard for a while.

Holidays are still very painful, there is always an empty chair (not intentional). I have a large family, and there always seems to be an empty chair that finds me in the room. My eyes always fall for it, thinking she could be sitting there. 

I always take off the day of her death and mother’s day. I used to be really upset on my birthday and hers too. I would drink myself into blacking out. I grew out of that, and since I’ve been with my boyfriend and his family things have become a little easier. They anticipate us to be married, jokingly call me their daughter in law already. I know they love me, and that really filled a void I didn’t know how to fill for a long time.

Unfortunately I have to work on Mother’s day. Mind you I’m a hairdresser, I work with women all day. It’s a big money day, a lot of women and girls will be coming for their hair to be done. I don’t want to call out because I know it would help financially,

Last year I worked and it was the hardest day in a long time. Of course you can imagine why; Everyone talks about their mothers. Or what they got her, or what they’re going to do later. Every client I had last year sat in my chair and the first thing they’d say is: “happy Mother’s Day!” “what did you do for your mother today?” “Do you have any plans with your mother later?” 

It’s so painful. I don’t want to tell them, I don’t want to upset anyone or make them think they need to pity me. My boss expects me to work and I don’t think he knows I even lost her. I don’t want to take off because I really need the money and I don’t want them to be shorthanded. Is there anything I can do to make this day easier? I thought about putting a post it note on my station with “my mother passed away today is very hard for me, please ask me about my dog instead” I know that’s comical, also unprofessional. 

I know I have to work and just getting through it, Last year at a different salon it was the same issue. I couldn’t take off and I cried in the bathroom in between clients because it was just too much.
I truly don’t know what to do.",09May2019,13
642,So I’m not being invited back to my high school next year because of 3 incidents that happened this year in which 2 of them should not have made me get into trouble. How do I convince my principal that I’ve changed and should be allowed back into the school next year?,09May2019,1
643,"My email was hacked and all recovery methods were changed. This email was linked to my KeepSafe account which I can now no longer access. I have tried everything I can think of the recover the email but, lucky for me, I also never used this email to send emails, just receive them, so Yahoo support couldn't help me since I don't have any emails from the account to verify I once had access.

I spoke with Keep Safe and they can't do anything without the email access. So I told them I'd like, if nothing else, for the account to be shut down so no one has access. Which, of course, they said they can't do because I could just be some random guy asking to shut down someone else's account.

So, not only can I not access my wife's intimate pictures while some guy in Russia can, but I can't even shut down his access to them. He's got them and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it.

646,"My cousin (22F) was brought up by conservative-right wing-overly protective-catholic parents and she was basically sheltered her whole life to the point that she seems like an old lady trapped in a young woman’s body. She studies biology and doesn’t believe in evolution (I’m speechless, too), doesn’t have any social media because she heard from her parents conspiracy theories about them, she’s racist, overly religious and much more. At first you could label her as a typical nerd, no interest in fashion, never wearing makeup, hair often greasy, she only shaved her legs for her prom (after much persuation). I’m pretty sure she never even kissed a boy, her mind is so occupied with studying that she’s thousands of miles away from that “achievement”. Her brothers managed to shake those sheltered upbringing off of their minds, but she seems like a lost cause, I think she doesn’t even have many friends because her college peers probably find her weird af (and I can’t blame them). I (25F) would like to help her get out of her shell and live her best life, because she really deserves that, we live in the same college town so I was thinking of inviting her to go out with my friends and I sometime, but I have no idea how to tactfully approach this “intervention” if I can call it like that.

651,"I apologise for what's going to be a monster of a post in advance, it's not as simple as you might think from the title.    

So through the power of hindsight, I can surmise my past self as an apathetic, insecure mess. I'm suffering through the effects of childhood emotional neglect, which means that I've been taught that my feelings don't matter, which leads to their repression and an inability to trust oneself. I also think you tend to prioritise the feelings of others, so you end up deeply reliant on    

I've lived most of my life in this insecure, confused state, and I thought that the only thing I was any good at was doing physics and maths exams. I shaped my life around this idea that I was a stoic problem solver who's purpose was to better humanity through scientific research. It made sense then for me to continue pursuing this field, in spite of my constant issues with maintaing any consistency with it.    

I went to university and in the face of all of the necessary skills I had to develop (social skills, time management, etc.), I felt that maybe it just wasn't right for me. My sense of self was vulnerable already, even considering this was enough to seriously call it into question my whole life so far and I eventually gave up in the course. I got kicked out and I remember not even feeling anything besides a general ""oh well"" feeling.



In the time after my dismissal from uni, I've had to reconsider what I should do with the rest of my life and I've felt it necessary to go back to the idea of me just doing physics, because it's the only thing I'm good at. I don't feel particularly passionate about it anymore -- but I also don't know if it's a good idea to rely on that feeling (I still don't know what to trust). If I can be disciplined, I know it's something I could excel at, but I don't know if my loss of interest is something to be trusted.

After some serious soul searching, and a year or so of researching psychology and self-analysis, I've just thought  that perhaps a career in clinical psychology would be a highly personal and rewarding career for me. I've lost my old preconception that the most important thing is understanding the physical world, and realised that for me the most important thing was overcoming my own psychological drawbacks.


I'll go through some positives and negatives. 
   
Positives:    
- It's a field which is in desperate need of more people (there's a lot of good to do in the world).   
- It's still in its early stages with a lot of room for research.   
- It's highly personal.   
- I know exactly what career I want to pursue afterwards.   
- I've been consistently obsessed with it for the past year+.   
Negatives:.   
- I'd be completely throwing my mathematical skills out the window.   
- I don't even know if I'd be good at it.   
- I don't even know if it's something I'll enjoy studying.   
- I don't know how I could fund it.    


Perhaps my time would be better spent fixing my own issues and then/simultaneously applying myself to a subject I know that I can excel at (physics). I think that's the crux of it tbh:

*Do I aim to fix my own issues and stick with a field which I know I can do well in, or do I jeopardise everything and blindly jump into a career which I know is much more personal to me and which I think will be much more rewarding?*

Thanks for any comments in advance guys, it's all appreciated.",09May2019,1
653,"A few days ago, my father had givin me a necklace. that I decided to use as a pendulum. 

to contact what ever spirit was in my house. 
just a quick recap, me and my mother have moved into a new house about 3 months ago. Ever since, I’ve been having very bad vibes from the house. specificity in my bedroom. and im not the one to be scared of these things, not really believe. it just started out small, with me getting a gut feeling that someone was watching me. and proceeded to get worse. then my lights started flickering, and TVs would mess up. and my phone would turn on, even with a passcode on). 

anyways, then about a month ago. I’ve started seeing this tall black shadow. everywhere I went in the house. and first I thought I was loosing my shit but, apparently not.
Then my cats started growling and hissing and looking at things, like in corners of the walls. and nothing would be there.
Again I put it passed me, and thought nothing of it.
then about 2 days ago, my father had givin me a necklace. with a crystal inside. which is great for a pendulum. I used it to see if they’re was actually anything in my house. now I never really believed in pendulums, nor wanted to. but I felt this was the only way to find out if there was something in my house.
Finally I tested the thing out, with some simple yes or no questions. like questions only I would know. And everything would be correct. I even asked questions I didn’t know. But only my mother knew. And it was correct. no I did not ever move my hand. maybe the slightest, but this wasn’t just any hand movement from my hand. so I’ve asked it, can you move the charm around in big circles, it did so. 
then yesterday morning I asked, are you a spirit moving this? It responded with a yes.
not the answer I was hoping for but, kinda expected.
then that morning my mother said, “enough of that stupid bullshit, it’s fake”. and the pendulum started going crazy. like back and fourth. I asked the pendulum if it liked the name Ella, so I could name it. It responded, yes.
Anyways. I asked are you a good spirit? It responded, “no”. I was a bit frightened, but I thought maybe it was just my hand. then I brushed it off. 
later my mother threatened to take it on me, and throw it in the road. as it was making her uneasy for some reason. she kept repeating, “this is foolish and fake”. I asked the pendulum to show my mother proof that it/ she was real. by giving my mother a intense headache. fair enough, about 2 minutes later. My mother’s head was pounding. and she almost called an ambulance). 
fast forward a bit,
the night came and I went to sleep. And I kept waking up and screaming at the slightest of noises I’ve heard. flash forward to today, my mother was joking around and started tickling the chair that the “spirit” said it was in. I asked if it made the spirit mad, and it responded yes. Flash forward a few days back, I asked if the spirit liked my family. It responded “no”. Anyways, my mother tickled the chair, and it didn’t like it. I asked if the spirit Ella was mad, it responded yes. about a minute later. My mother back was clawed up in 4 claw marks, bleeding. 
I asked if she had done that, it responded yes.
I demanded for her to not do it ever again. It said no. It will keep on doing it. 

now I’m not sure what the fuck to do.
i haven’t slept in about 60 hours, and ever since I’ve got this thing. My head has been killing me. 

and now I’m seeing it more. the black shadowy figure.

💢follow my page to see some evidence/ proof on this. and for updates.💢

I’d also highly appreciate if you could please help me out, with what to do. Thanks.",09May2019,0
654,"Yesterday, I received an inquiry from a stakeholder regarding applying for a program we run. The stakeholder asked about eligibility about the program. I referred the email to our general email box for our managers reference as well I had read a correspondence earlier stating that people should email this general inbox if they had questions. 

I replied in the email that I didn't know their specific questions, and the general inbox is a good place to start. Moving forward to today, I get an email from my manager stating I should have asked them, or referred the stakeholder to the website so on and so forth. Fair enough, I suppose if I dug deep enough I could answered the questions for them, or asked the manager, I could have received more info. 

As a response my manager stated in an email that now I have to respond to the stakeholder relaying all the information even after I already referred them. I feel humiliated having to respond given what I already stated, and I feel this would be demeaning for me. 

For a little context, my last day is next week, as I put my notice in. My manager has a history of being condescending or aggressive, and I just decided it wasn't healthy for me. And yes, since it's my last week, I am kind of checking out mentally. 

In essence, I can't tell if I am over-reacting, or if this is justifiable a humiliating situation. Any help is appreciated internet strangers.",09May2019,0
655,"So I'm a high school junior and I'm taking classes at community College with the program I'm in through my high school. I have 3 classes per semester, and my other 2 classes went well, I got an A in one and a B in the other.

However, I decided to procrastinate on my work for one class all semester, and never ended up doing it. I ended with a 20% in the class and I don't know what to do. I want to tell my parents before they find out through a call from school or on my report card, but it's really hard.

I know I'm an idiot for not doing work all semester, and I talked to my teacher about it last week and she was nice about it, saying that it isnt the end of the world, but there was nothing I could do to pass at that point.

The thing I'm scared of the most is how people will think about me, especially family members. I've always been a good student and my parents will freak when they find out. I really want to keep this away from my extended family if possible because I only see them a few times a year and it'll change their whole outlook on me.

Does anyone have any advice? What's the best way I can tell my mom?

Edit: I left out an important detail. The program I'm in is only available at the school I go to, which isn't my local school. I'm not sure if failing one class will get me kicked out of the program, but if it does, I'd have to go to my local school and I won't get my associates degree like I would have if I stayed at my current school.

656," 

I've said before that weed doesn't affect your physical health all that much, but it can ruin relationships like how it broke up my parents. They had such a great, happy marriage and home life with me, until this fucking drug came into our lives.

In August 2011, when I was starting 4th grade, my older cousin stayed with us one weekend to do a post-cutting job with my dad, and got my dad into smoking weed. Then he started growing pakalolo plants behind the tall grass in our backyard, so he could hide it from me and my mom. He started going to his friends houses to get stoned, sometimes even taking me with him to hang out (but still hiding it from me).

By October, the pakalolo plants in our backyard came big and my maternal grandparents came over and saw it. They told my mom and that's when the chaos started. My mom didn't want the cops to come if someone snitched on us for drugs, and CPS to take me away, so she started fighting and arguing with my dad to get rid of it. He refused to do so and started getting super mad and defensive with my mom, lots of yelling and door slamming was now going on at my house.

Also, when my mom found out about the kind of places my dad was taking me to hang out at she was so pissed at my dad it wasn't even funny. My dad also now had a big shotgun at the house laying around on the back porch (to guard his pakalolo plants) and my mom didn't approve because she didn't want me to end up messing with it.

In early December the yelling and door slamming got so bad my mom left our house and moved in with my grandparents. I was going back and forth between their houses and was finally educated on what my dad was up to, My dad still acted the same, and he was still a good man. But he had stopped working at his job as a freight truck driver by now, and when he was unable to pay his DirecTV bill, I finally realized how far down those drugs got him. Christmas that year was the worst one in my life, because it was right when my family was falling apart (not to mention the presents were a lot more low-budget than last year, on both sides).

My parents divorced on December 28, 2011, and my Dad decided to leave &amp; go to rehab in January 2012 to turn his life around. My dad is doing much better now. He hasn't been back home since, though I still keep in contact with him. If it weren't for this fucking drug my parents would still be happily together, and I'd still be able to go hunting and hang out at the beach all the time with my dad like we used to before he left.",09May2019,0
657,i’m a 17 year old boy from New York and i truly don’t know what to do. My parents are divorced and i go from my moms to my dads often. My grades in school are not good and this is primarily what they get mad at but instead of trying to help or ask if there’s anything they can do it turns into i’m not good enough / if you don’t do it you will be punished and i have been kicked out multiple times and i’ve been extremely embarrassed trying to find places to stay. my mom is extremely manipulative and gets my dad mad at me when he doesn’t entirely know the situation as i stay at her house more than his. in school i barely get by but i do pass every year and have never had summer school or anything like that. this year is just the same but they seem to be getting progressively more mad at me. it’s gotten to a point where my mom has put her hands on me and i’ve just been trying to stay calm. they’ve taken everything but my phone at this point and i just need some advice anything helps.,09May2019,1
659,"Hi, I'm really sorry i know this isn't anywhere near as big of an issue as the things other people go through but it's been giving me major anxiety the past day.

I'm having my school leavers assembly soon and there is one video of me that i think they might play, and i am genuinely terrified of it coming up, it's not even the video content itself, its the fact it was during the ""MLG"" period of memes and it's basically some crappy school group project but with MLG stuff over the top and it is the worst thing ever. I'm very able to use premiere and vegas now, but then I'd just discovered chroma keying and thought it was amazing... now it's coming back to haunt me. I really don't want them to show that video. They're showing lots of old and embarrassing clips of students and I'll literally die if it comes up, seriously. I'm not popular and the kids in my school are ruthless and i really don't know what to do. but i don't want to bring it up because then a teacher might remember and then use it in the assembly. The Video is genuinely awful and basically just makes me look like a fucking loser, plus I suffer from severe anxiety and this is really stressing me out, i know it sounds pathetic but i literally want to hack into the school system just to delete the file permanently.

What should i do?",09May2019,1
660,"Alright so I just want to say that I have severe anxiety issues and paranoia so I have a hard time telling if my logic is actually logic but I want to present my clues as it were and here an opinion and advice about anything I can do. As the title says I am concerned about my house being targeted by thieves. Just in case I didn't make it clear, I do suffer paranoia that I know is illogical but I need help differentiating it this time

So a few months back the garages connected to my garden (not mine) where broken into, we seen it happen and the suspect's where caught and it is now believed it was a personal dispute between the owner of the garage and the thieves but anyway that presents clue 1: Thieves operate in my area.

One time I forgot I was meant to let my brother in as I was the only one around to do it as he lost his key but I forgot, when he couldn't reach me and thought something was wrong he broke into the house to make sure I was alright. So clue 2: Even though it was my brother and he knows the house and is no threat, the house was able to be broken into successfully. It is absolutely fine what my brother did but it makes me wonder... Could potential thieves somehow see signs of this as well, would they be able to look at my home objectively and break in, as my brother did successfully. Obviously very likely as I myself have  come up with at  least 5 ways  I could break in too.

Okay so a few months back some, and I hate to say it ""thuggish men"" came round the house in day time and wanted to try and convince me that my roof needed repairing and I mean dangerous looking and not just the manual labour type, lots of elderly live in my area so I assumed it was just conmen looking to rip off old people. They even asked if I owned the house, I don't my elderly mother does but I lied to them as it all seemed suspicious. So clue 3: Other types of criminals have an interest in my home.

Okay so sometimes I see a car from my back bedroom window with someone in it all hours of the night. This could just be paranoia but maybe clue 4: Maybe house is being cased, scoped or whatever the term is.

A few months before the garage robbery my back gate somehow got damaged, the bolt is broken at the bottom and if you where agile enough you could force the wooden doors bottom half to bend and break and enter the property. Now knowing my house if I was to break in myself this is the way I would choose, break the gate and see if anyone repairs it, I don't know carpentry and can't afford to fix it, so again maybe paranoid as happened a while back but maybe clue 5: Potential criminal figuring out his route or response of the occupants.

Clue 6: we have cctv signs around but no actual cameras, I am wondering if thieves  in the area know. Reinforcing the idea of a local criminal still likely may case my home.

This one is a bit of a reach but it just puts a pit in my stomach, it sent me reality paranoid and made me start drawing maps of my home to assess a burglars routes. Anyway the clue 7 is a ladder has appeared on the roof of the  garages quite recently, which lead into my back garden, My mother told me that it belongs to the neighbour but it has me thinking, obviously  the neighbour  would know the camera warnings are fake. I expressed my concern that maybe someone is playing the long game in breaking in but  was met with bewildered looks.

I know I am paranoid as bell and lots of this stuff  happened months  apart but  what do you think? Any  advice?",09May2019,1
661," Hello I am a 16 year old in Ontario (GTA) Canada  and I want to ask for advice on A big situation that has been plaguing me for my entire point in my life but I want to finally have a solution. My issue is my father, I need to start of by saying that I love him but I think that there is something mentally wrong with him because one day he is the best dad ever but others I wish that I was not living in the same country as him. It also is not alcohol because he decided to quit heavily drinking beer but has begun to drink scotch a bit but I think that his actions are caused by the way that he is. The issue is both my parents constantly fighting and arguing and sometimes physically fighting both with everyone. My family constantly is toxic towards me and constantly nit-picking everything that I do and constantly evolving themselves in my business and trying to ruin it anyway that they can and then shut me down and then blame their actions on me. I have been trying to make something of myself but My family has been trying constantly to brick my life (I have to say that I have my faults and one is my performance in school and my social life but my family never helps and I am done with trying to cooperate.) This mostly happens with my dad where when I clearly want to be left to live my on my own he constantly evolves himself and then starts to fight with me to shut me down. I need help, I don’t want to live in my own house because it is such a toxic environment, my mom is constantly thinking about divorce or moving out but has never followed through with it and I do not want to pressure her to pursue something that big just because I don’t like my living conditions. The even worse thing is that It is emotional abuse and not physical abuse and there would be nothing that the cops can do for me or my mom. I don't know what to do because all my options are shit to be honest. (To start of I am not considering suicide now but I was but I don't want to give up because I would rather fake my own death and live on the streets than have to have my family find me dead) my first option is to fake my own death and move out but I am an teen so I am kind or screwed and I know that no one I know would alow me to live with them (I don't have any close friends that I am super comfortable with) also I don’t have the money for rent and food unless I can find an job and then pay for rent (This sucks because it was my best option to get out because I would be able to start over and leave my family but It would also break them so it sucks in that way). My second option is to try and talk to someone but I don’t know who to talk to because Ideally I would be able to live somewhere else and continue high school but I have no idea if that is even out there or who I would contact (my biggest fear is that my parents are contacted and I get sent back home and nothing comes out of it). My last and worst option is to tear up my documents and fake my own death and just live in a homeless shelter and get a job and drop out of high school (this sucks because I would have to live on the streets for a period of time if I cannot find an bed). Honestly I have no Idea what to do all my options are garbage but I hate it here but getting out of here means that I have to break my family’s heart and possibly even worse because I know that I would be restless because my dad constantly fights with my mom and sister with me in the house so it would probably get worse if I am out of the picture. It would also be unfair to my grandparents who love me so much and my sister and mother who have not done as much as my dad but It would be even messier if I was caught or they where aware. Also this sucks because If I leave then I would have to leave all my stuff behind and my cat would not know where I was. If anyone has any ideas because I am stuck between a rock and a hard place right now and I would like someone's take on what I should do. Please keep is serious (also If I am running away if anyone knows where I can stay in Toronto for a bit so I can get my bearing \~1 month). TLDR: I am living in a toxic environment that I tried everything to fix/withstand but I am getting nowhere with my parents and I need help ether running away or being taken away or just advice.",09May2019,1
662,"I [25F] just found out that one of my friends from high school got engaged on her birthday! So exciting!! 

However, it has made me surprisingly anxious. My bf and I have been together longer than them and I just got this sudden fear that because I don’t have a ring I’m missing something. 

This is silly because I’m anti marriage and I do not want children. My bf has asked me to marry him a few times in like a jokey way and less jokingly, said he wants to be with me forever. This is my first relationship ever and I am a highly sensitive person with a lot of anxieties. My bf talks about children with me even though I have told him that I seriously do not want children and if he does, he should find a different partner. 

I don’t know if he believes me. I don’t know if I believe me. What if I do want to be married and have a family? That’s what I always wanted when I was a child. 

A tragic family loss left me devastated in 2012 and I barely built myself back up while in college. Everything changed after that. I lost my faith in god and am now an atheist and I also became extremely cynical and even more anxious about life. I never thought I would find anyone who would love me.

677,"I don’t even know where to begin. 

Being with my spouse has been hard, we’ve been together 6 years and married for 5 years and we have a 4yo. We’ve had a lot of ups and downs, mostly downs until this past year. We were separated less than a year and it was so hard for me at that time. I was upset every single day, crying most days and was only happy on the 3 days I had with my child. At that time I went from working early mornings (5am-1pm) to working overnight (11pm-7am) or something like that. 

We got back together and spouse seemed changed after our separation and was trying to be a different/better person, that was 2 years ago. I left my job in early November 2018 and just started a new job last month, April.

It was my spouses idea to get a $25,000-$30,000 vehicle and we couldn’t afford another vehicle (for me) and couldn’t afford an apartment with just 1 paycheck, despite making $30-$40/year which my parents each make the same amount as my spouse and can afford to pay off all their bills with just 1 of their paycheck. 

Me? I’m a young adult, I’ve had 4 jobs since I got out of high school and spent 2 years not working because spouse thought it was better I spent it with our newborn. I can finally start a career with the job I have now and I want to go to college to get a degree for my job so I can get similar or better jobs in the future. My spouse is nearly 30 and has had several jobs (so obviously a good work background). I’m trying to build my work background as well as prove that I’m a good employee so I can get better jobs in the future. I plan on getting another job (so I can have 2 jobs) after I finish training at my current job which has great benefits and a $3-$4+ higher pay per hour then any of my previous jobs, actually compared to my first and second job in making $6 more per hour. I also forgot to mention that stupid teenage me made a mistake and have something on my background making it 10 times harder to get a job even if I did have a good work background. 

So I’m at the very bottom I’m trying to work my way up and give myself and my child a better life. I’ve been thinking of leaving my spouse which I think I’ve known all along, we can’t make it work out  and I’m tired of being with someone that constantly puts me down but makes me feel like I can’t do anything without them aside from being emotionally and mentally abusive. I’ve got this great job, with great benefits, with an opportunity at a career, that I LIKE, and someone that was willing to give me an opportunity despite my background. My previous job? I was working at McDonalds. I was great at it sure, I liked it, I was getting 40 hours/week with no benefits but I was tired of my spouse telling me I didn’t have a career, wasn’t thinking about the future, didn’t make good money, etc. More importantly I was upset at myself for not being able to do better then a fast food job, when I left there I started applying everywhere I could and got rejected everywhere because of my background, I almost started crying when I got offered this position despite being the youngest and least qualified person there. I didn’t want to stay in restaurants/retail, I wanted something better I honestly feel like I’ve finally been blessed with something good after the crappy life I’ve had. 

There were so many times I’ve been ready to give up, so many times when the only reason I got everyday was because of my child. 

Anyway, my spouse and I would be working the same hours and refuses to get a daycare for our child because they’re so over protective. Aside from that it would take my entire monthly paycheck to pay for an apartment they WANT instead of looking for something we can AFFORD. According to spouse, we should have about $200 of income leftover at the end of each month because of the apartment they want. The apartments I’m looking at (that I know I can afford and just as good) would leave us $500+ extra income which I’ve actually been looking for even cheaper because I’m looking at 1-2 bedroom if I’m leaving spouse. 

Why can’t we afford the better apartment and still have more extra money left over? Because spouse decided to get ONE expensive vehicle (instead of 2 affordable vehicles, 1 for each). My spouse makes about $3 more/hour than me at their current job, most of their paycheck goes towards the vehicle, gas (gas hog), and vehicle insurance, then they’ve got a few almost maxed credit cards they have to pay like $100+/month. At the end of the month, they don’t have a lot of money left over even for groceries. 

I’m not just upset about spouse asking me to leave my job. I’m upset at how spouse has always treated and thinking even after our separation 2 years ago, it seems they haven’t changed that much after all and still remains the same abusive person they always have been.",09May2019,2

681,I (16m) have for several years been having difficulty with reality perception. I am obsessed with and can't stop myself from firmly believing in the idea that I am reborn into this universe from a different universe. I believe that I am one of 7 magicians scattered into this universe with memories of our previous lives erased. I am the first of the 7 to regain memories through clues deliberately left for me throughout my life. At least three of us are somewhere on Earth. I believe that I will somehow die between now and the next 10 years. I often fantasize about dying but I preferably don't want to commit suicide and under no circumstances (except for self defense) could I ever kill someone else. I could only kill myself because I secretly despise and loath myself as I am now. But we all have to reunite and bring balance back to our universe. In addition my concious also talks to me like a father. It punishes me with bad luck if I don't do rituals like turn the lights on and off five or seven times. Spin the wheels of my scooter one or five times or scrub my hair with shampoo exactly 83 times. Recently these beliefs have grown firmer and more severe but I had a stressful time at school recently which caused me to have a rare mental breakdown of self awarenesses. Under no circumstances will I ever want to give up my beliefs but I want to control them and live as normal life as possible for the rest of my life. I know I will reeincarnate again when I die. What should I do to help control? I'm afraid to tell anybody because I don't want to be locked up in a mental institute for the rest of my like but I believe that I will never be able to fit in a world I don't belong to as long as I'm here. I even have trouble trusting pretty much everybody in my life right now.,09May2019,2
682,"Side note: I’m not someone who holds grudges against someone nor hates on a person because they have something against me. 

This guy is just- ok for fuck’s sake I get it, you don’t like me.

I don’t fucking know why but he has this thing against me, makes me feel annoying and dumb. He is the one who is annoying!
He eats breakfast IN CLASS WHEN THE LESSON HAD ALREADY STARTED making the class smell. He is the one making weird noises behind me. And yet, I’m the annoying one. 
He is rude to me, degrades me like hell. 

I know he is a good person though. He helps many classmates and is a smart fella ayyeee so I just let it pass. 

My mom calls me an idiot for not talking back but I can’t just stop myself from laughing at his face whenever he is trying to be serious. The situation is just so dumb and unnecessary, so I just say “suuure”, smile and do this OK hand sign and then go back to what I was doing and actually stand by my word; leaving him dumbfounded. 

I just want him to not be rude to me anymore. He sees me as this dumb attention whoring girl and keeps on degrading me. 

How do I approach him?

NOTED: we don’t even talk a bit except for the rude shit. For example, I was having an actual conversation with the art teacher when he came by with some paper (I hadn’t noticed him then) and stood there for a moment, and said “get out” (sounds like get the fuck out with the way he is saying it) so I just annoyedly said “don’t be rude” and waited for him to go so I could continue my conversation with the teacher.

For some reason i'm a person that in terms of friends/acquaintences and the seems i can express outmost joy, smiles. and humours jokes that we laugh at but it feels like it differs when i try to approact it with my family.

i had a great father that taught me well, and a loving mother and one big brother, my complex comes at.....i feel like i treat my mother badly, she's expressed many times, helped, treated, fed and been with me in things that only a real loving mother would be in and do, but talking, normal conversations, saying ''i love you'' back to her...it all feels empty, she's done ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong i am fully clear on that...but i don't feel like i can give her what she's giving me back...and i feel guilty and terrible INSIDE, but i can't show those things around her, i only do most of that in my own home...

my father lives about an hour's train ride away, and i don't visit him as much anymore because i got my first job, and i like working there, and have fun with my colleagues there, so he visits me every once a month or the seems, but my mother lives in the same city, about 15 minutes walk from me, and i see her much more often, i'm not sure if that's any help to this...

i'm a severely flawed person that has had a really bad childhood with Racism, Bullying, and the seems, what it's left me with to the CURRENT today, is a person with a severe inferiority complex, zero wantings of a partner due to lifetime of the gfs i've had cheated on me, and one that ultimately thinks about everyone than myself.

only one i feel i can be truly ME around is my big brother since we've grown up together, but i feel scared....my mothers getting older, and one day she might not be here anymore, so why do i act this way?? why am i like a cold person that can't treat her or tell her the words she wants to hear...it's very rare i've ever uttered that i ''love'' her and i feel ashamed for it, she's been so loving towards me my entire life and i feel like i'm acting towards her like i don't give a shit....even when we talk on the phone i've begun talking as if i have no emotions and i don't know what i feel...i feel empty, until i don't talk anymore and i feel horrible because she's the only mother i have...

One friend i've had due to my childhood things, and how i am suggested i took therapy, but i lashed out onto them and took that as an insult because i dislike and refuse to show ''weakness'' i admit all that is my fault because i felt it was an insult but....i'm not sure, i don't know how to describe myself further than i have, i just want to figure out how i can either convey how i am, and or getting rid of this ''cold'' me inside me....i've broken down in tears infront of my brother because i treated her badly long ago and i explained it to her, but AGAIN, i talk like it has no emotional impact on me, and it feels so wrong and horrible....

691,"Hi, this is going to be quite an unusual post I think, at least for me because this is the first time I post here.  
I want to get straight to the point and explain what I need advice in.  


I've met a girl in a video game around 7-8 months ago and since then we've been talking with each and playing games every day and lately we've been talking about meeting up when I go back to my home country (I live abroad) which will happen in around 2 months. I've been really stressed out and actually a lot of times I thought to myself that maybe it would be much better to avoid meeting with her, mainly because our ""relationship"" is a bit unusual.   


We are more than friends, but we never said stuff like ""I love you"" or anything like those but instead we send a lot of hearts to each other, cute pictures of us and stuff like that. She said that she is willing to meet up, but also said that previously she had problems when she had to ""love"" people (basically she has a hard time actually falling in love with someone) and she also said that she can't promise that she will be able to feel something when we actually meet and that if our meeting will be really awkward she wouldn't want to meet any more.   


I'm really scared of ruining the meeting by being really awkward or maybe too shy, so I kind of need advice in how I could avoid the whole ""being awkward or too shy"" thing (I do understand that at the beginning it will be a bit awkward, but that should go away after a bit of time, but I'm scared that it won't and it will ruin our chance to meet)?",09May2019,15

A couple years ago I had a mental breakdown during finals on one of my later semesters in college, I was stressed out of my mind and not enjoying the work at all anymore, seriously questioning if I wanted to do this. for the rest of my life. 
I pushed through anyways being so close to the finish, graduated and got my first job. I was bright and hopeful thinking working would bring a new light and reignite my interest in engineering. I chalked up my breakdown to high stress and difficult classes. I figured finishing my degree and then getting my first job would open doors of opportunity and interest.

I was wrong, my first job has instead been the nail in the coffin for my interest in engineering.

On paper it's a fabtastic job. I'm actually locked in to 40 hours a week, no more, no less. The pay is a bit less than average, but the work environment is friendly and my supervisor very helpful and my actual hours are very flexible. 

Problem is I loathe the subject matter. I'm sick of working with code and bits and boards and resistors... I can't have 0 interest in any of it anymore. Another part of the problem is I cant stand sitting at the same desk staring as the same screen for 8 hours a day.

So my question is: Where can I go from here? I have a degree in a subject that I basically want nothing to do with but I don't want it to go to waste...

Before we started dating I knew that she was without a doubt the most sought after girl at the job. So you may be able to guess that it was a surprise when she( a solid 10/10) agreed to dating me (maybe a 6-7 on a good day). I knew that I would be dealing with many guys looking at and flirting with her. I also know that I am a jealous and slightly possessive person by nature. Beginning the the relationship with those facts in mind, I knew there would be turbulence but figured I could push it off and diminish those bad qualities as time went on.

PROBLEM: Recently those qualities have become a large problem between her and I. I tend to realize every guy who talks to her and specifically those who tend to hang around more than I like. Last night was a low for me by telling her about one of her male friends looking at her butt multiple time within the shift. She was upset and felt that I was blaming her for looking good. I don’t blame her and only want to express my anger without confronting the friend and making an awkward situation for all of us.

706,"Let me start off by apologizing for the length of this. It’s probably novel length, but its 12 years of backstory and in order to grasp the FULL picture, I need to explain it all. Welcome to the shitshow right? Here it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

SO, to start off. I have a 12yr old daughter (newly 12!). Her father and I have not been together since she was about a year old. During our relationship, he wasn’t the best father, but he wasn’t the worst either. I honestly should have seen it coming a mile away because we were together for 3 years before I got pregnant and he was a shitty boyfriend (cheating, lying, etc.) after our daughter was born, he seemed to get a little better, until he didn’t. here are few of the things that happened after she was born that really made me realize he wasn’t cut out for the family life. He left her in the car once she was a couple months old, luckily, I was home to catch the mistake. He stole from the only job he had during our relationship (and he had only had it for about 4 months total) he told the judge that he stole to provide for his daughter, which was a huge lie. I went into court and was blindsided by that answer. he claims he used money for diapers and formula, he did not. (judge still fined him anyways) I had to pay him to watch her when I was working. The final straw after it all, was he came into MY job and stole from it. risking everything I worked for, for our daughter. I kicked him out and that was the end of our unhealthy relationship, and I am grateful my daughter was young enough to not remember a thing about it.

Anyways, after I left, he moved into his parents’ garage. He didn’t work, and I was not going to pay him any longer to watch HIS daughter (besides, he was asking for way more than I would pay through state subsidy), so I did have to get on state assistance for childcare. His parents were and are wonderful and did watch her whenever they were available which really helped. But it wasn’t enough, and I did need full time childcare. Back in the day, in my state, if you got any type of assistance from the state, they would automatically put the father on child support. If you denied letting them, you couldn’t get assistance. So, at age 1, child support was filed for a total of $194 a month. There was NO parenting plan established at this time because I felt it wasn’t needed, since I had no issues with him seeing his daughter whenever he wanted. Well he only saw her when he was home, at his parents. Basically, whenever grandma and grandpa wanted her or were helping with babysitting, then he would see her, other than that, he really didn’t ask for her and about 70% of the time when she was at her grandparents, he was out elsewhere with his friends or whomever. At one when grandma and grandpa were watching her, they had to go somewhere and left him in charge. He took her to the park, got high, and passed out in the field and my daughter couldn’t find him. Another mother at the park called the cops (thank you to whomever she was, we all know this could have turned out way worse), who then notified CPS. I did NOT know about this until a couple days later when CPS called me to set up an in-home visit. They came to my house, saw that we were not living together, asked some questions, checked my place and decided not to pursue any investigations involving me. at this point, for him to NOW be alone with her, his 12yr old brother had to take babysitting classes so he could be there in case grandma and grandpa wanted to leave at any time during the visits. When my daughter was 2, I did get into another relationship with my now boyfriend  (whom I had known for about 9 months by the time we started dating) and we did move about 1.5 hours away and at that point I was able to get off child care assistance because my boyfriend offered to help with watching her when I was working. I did not stop the child support order though. Her dad didn’t disagree with us moving farther away so it worked out for us. Her grandparents would make a trip to bring my daughter to their house for visits, and we would pick her up. it worked out to be about 50/50 effort between her grandparents and me. Still, her father was not working, and the most I received during those 2 years was a $3.00 check. And the only reason I got that, was because when he went to jail, and they found $3.00 on him. But other than that, he did NOT help with gas, food, clothes, nothing at all. (naturally this meant that he didn’t help or provide anything for holidays either) Every single visit was done by myself, my boyfriend or her grandparents. He never once picked her up or dropped her off nor did he come over for visits to my residence. Honestly had he been present in her life, I may not have cared much about him helping financially, but he wasn’t there at all really. He took it upon himself to ONLY ask for her when he finally got a new girlfriend who also had kids. Ill say it now, this didn’t change a thing besides his girlfriend now asking for visits too, and his girlfriend helped with a couple drives. Ill be honest and say that I believe his girlfriend is the only reason he ever sent messages about our daughter, because when he was single, there was no effort. And when they broke up months later, effort was gone again. Up until this next point, things were uneventful. My boyfriend I had a son, we both took care of my daughter, she saw her grandparents (who also loved my son as their own grandbaby too), her dad wasn’t around often and showed no emotional, physical or financial support.

So, lets fast-forward. His parents decided they were going to move out of state when my daughter was around 5. Her dad was single when this happened and was back at his mom and dads. When he found out they were moving, he realized hew would be homeless and started working under the table for a friend, so he could rent a room with said friend. I refused to let my daughter over there, because I knew the friend and I also knew they were heavily into drugs. This meant he didn’t really see her at all (I didn’t refuse HIM to see her, only refused her to go his new place of living) surprisingly, his parents asked my boyfriend and If we would like to move with them. We took some time to think about and decided we would move states. My boyfriend went first, and I stayed behind while he got settled over there. This took 3 months. During those 3 months, my daughters dad didn’t call once, or ask to see her. I did send him a message about moving, he said he had no issues with it. So, after the 3 month long wait, I brought my kids over state lines. We moved into our own place, things were looking good at first, but I will admit that we didn’t really investigate the state and we quickly realized wages were not what they were in the state we came from. So, we did struggle a bit. About a few months after moving, my daughter’s dad was homeless and his parents once again, took him in. He started again only seeing her when she would visit her grandparents, and again, he didn’t help with any of the transportation or even pick her up or drop her off himself. Well anyways, about a year later, we decided it wasn’t working out for us and we moved back to our home state where we felt we would be better off financially. My daughter was a little over 6 by this time. Old enough to fly on her own (with a paid fee to the airlines for someone to watch her on the flight) so we felt like it would be OK because she would still get to see her family. My daughter was upset she wasn’t so close to them so my boyfriend and I decided to get her on our cell plan so she could call and talk to her dad and grandparents as often as she would like. Now, as you can imagine by this time, he has racked up quite a bit in child support because I never took it off when I got off state assistance. When we moved BACK to our home state, I started getting a couple child support payments, I believe I got 3 or 4 total payments. Honestly, it really helped with her school supplies and clothes. Well a couple months later, he got a new girlfriend, and she got pregnant. Payments stopped coming, I guess she was working, and he was staying home and they both lived with her parents now. I started paying for half of my daughter’s flights over to see her family, and her grandparents paid for the other half (he did not) yet he still got to reap the benefits of us paying for her to fly there. but so did my daughter so I was initially ok with it. Well, when his son was about 2, he asked me I would “help him” get on his feet. I took off over $6,000 of back support because I thought he was finally trying to get his life right. That equaled to about 3 years of back support that I removed from the case. and then he got a job and asked me if I would pause his child support for a few months so they could get their own place. I did. After a few months I told him that since he was working and it seemed like they would be ok, I put it back on and he was livid. Started calling me names and flipping out. never even thanked me for the 6K I took off or that I paused it to begin with. His mom even told me I was being too generous especially because my daughter was almost 9 by this time and I still had only seen those 3 or 4 payments. Well of course he was working so I started getting payments faithfully for 6 months. Well, things didn’t last long with his gf and their child. She got into drugs and they separated. He quit his job. And had nothing and was asking if I could ONCE again help him with HIS child support to my daughter. He was looking for a new job and we came to an agreement that if he paid $80 a month (the cost of gas to get her to school and childcare) and helped with her flights 2x a year that I would take it off. So, I did. When the time came for his payments, he freaked out and asked for a DNA test. Keep in mind, she was now 10 and he’s just now asking? so he never made 1 payment on that plan we had agree upon. And flights were getting pricey, so I could no longer afford them. so his parents would drive 6 hours and i would drive 6 hours and meet halfway to drop the kids off for summer breaks. I asked for help once from him and he refused. For me, it was easier to not deal with him, so I left off the child support and didn’t ask for anything from him. He would still get to see her when he would show up to his parents and sometimes him and his new gf would take her for a couple nights but always asked his mom and dad to give him money to feed her while she was there. well, eventually mom and dad didn’t want to support him anymore and stopped helping him. (I mean he was in his 30’s, c’mon, they were still paying his phone bill too) so he cut all ties. And told me that he didn’t want my daughter to see his parents anymore, which I denied. They had been a constant in her life, and I wasn’t going to take that away. Her dad on the other hand, rarely called her even though she had her own phone. So anways moving along. New girlfriend was pregnant (With his 3rd), and him and I didn’t talk often. Only when he was texting me asking me for favors (3 years in a row asking me to let him claim her on taxes even though I explained he couldn’t since he didn’t care for her 6 months out of the year) that didn’t go over well and now I was an ungrateful selfish bitch according to him. Well, he got mad last year because I didn’t reach out to him and tell him that I was flying my daughter to see her grandparents for Christmas. Well he hadn’t spoke to me since summer of that year, which was when he was asking for a DNA test. He hadn’t spoke to his daughter during that time after her visit so for 6 months, NO contact to either of us, and still my daughter had her own cell phone. I tried to explain that it was not my responsibility to make him be a father. That for now 11/12 years I pushed and pushed and did everything FOR HIM to see her and he never showed an ounce of effort, yet he always reaped the benefits of everyone else’s hard work! His mom told me she was tired of paying half of her flights and drives when he wasn’t pitching in at all, and she was done. That if he wanted to see her, he needed to start doing It on his own and not during her time to see her grandbabies, and I agree. It wasn’t fair to anyone that he was not around unless we did something for him. He never asked about school, her braces, her doctor appointments, if she need anything, if her medicine cost money, literally nothing. And when I did reach out and send pictures, he wouldn’t respond. This went on for years.  Well him and his new gf claimed they REALLY wanted to see our daughter for Christmas. He agreed he would try harder and wanted to see his daughter and begged that I speak to his parents because he still had no contact with them. So, I did and guess what, he couldn’t even pick her up. he made up some excuse as to why they couldn’t get her from his parents (20 min away, if that) and his parents once again had to do all the driving and what not. So, end of the Christmas visit comes, and I don’t hear from him again, and neither does my daughter. Well here comes something new.

His girlfriend reached out to me for the first time (they had been together for a while now and had a baby) and asked why we broke up all those years ago. I explained It all.  The cheating, lying stealing etc.She started confiding in me that he told her he had my daughter half of her life, that I held his daughter from him and that I wouldn’t accept money he tried to give me. I ended up showing her texts that I had sent him and things he had sent me, and she was appalled. She admitted that she hated me from the time he told her about me because of everything he told her. I ended up showing her proof of everything, even from when he was in his previous relationship asking for child support help and asking for a DNA and refusing to help with traveling costs. Well,  She claimed they were breaking up because he was using drugs. He got CPS called on them and their kid and was spending $600 a month on weed, beer and various other “psychedelics” as he calls them. And gave up the opportunity to have custody of his 2nd child (son) well I mean she told me things I didn’t even want to know. Well last month I cut off contact because he sent my daughter a suicide text and I had to reach out to his gf and make sure he was in fact alive and didn’t do it. which he didn’t. so, I’m literally livid. I change my daughters’ number. and block him on all her accounts. 

Well-armed with the fact that he certainly had enough to spend $600 like his own girlfriend claims, on drugs, I reopen my child support case after OVER 2 years of having it closed. So, total, I have closed it 2x (a total of 2.5 years maybe more) of the state not collecting or going after him. on TOP of the over $6000 I took off. Which was about 3 years of back support. So, TOTAL it was 5.5 years of ME helping him while he couldn’t help us! Well, of course this month they get the child support papers and all the sudden his girlified is freaking out. Well they aren’t breaking up anymore, and he’s again calling me names, how I’m selfish, and how can I do this to him and how come I can’t understand that he wants to get on his feet and that I am being vindictive. And now says that because I make more money than he does that he should NOT have to pay support. In my mind, I’m like mind blown…in 2007/8 your child support was 194 a month. In ALL those years I have not asked them to raise it even though cost of living went up. I never asked for anything other than help with her, and even then, he didn’t have to send money. He could have bought shoes, clothes etc. but never once did he do ANYTHING for her?! And now I’m the bad guy who is selfish and needs to grow up? yet I’m asked EVERY year for you to claim her on taxes, but I can’t even ask for 80 bucks for childcare or gas? OKKKKKKKK. Why is it ok for him to get off scot free? Why should I worry if his life is together when he never gave a damn about our life and what was going on with us? Even when we were at one point, facing homelessness due to layoffs, he didn’t care. We made sure we got on our feet ON OUR OWN! Without his help! As a mother, it’s not like could up and stop caring for my babies financially, so why should he get the same freedom!? I am not complaining about taking care of her, I just want him to see where I am coming from, and he can’t. He blames me for everything wrong in his life, literally. Well not only me, but his other “baby mama” (his words) both of us are to blame and we are ruining his life he says. His gf is bombarding me with messages begging me to take off the support and says that she will literally write up a contract to go back to our previous agreement of $80 a month (that he didn’t hold up to) If I take it off. She isn’t working and they have a child, she’s crying that they will be homeless and I’m over here like…what about that $600 in drugs?  Now she backpedals, She says that he is now sober and has been for a couple weeks, that he is taking parenting classes but who knows? And now he is saying that I can’t legally hold our daughter from him (which is also true) but given his mental state and that fact he sent a child a suicide text, I believe I have a good reason!! Now he says that he is going to take me to court (be my guest I told him LOL) But now I’m second guessing myself. Should I leave the support on? should I go for FULL custody no visitation? Should I allow visitations and let him see her but he needs to pay for her way there and back? I just want to be the best mother I can and do what is best for HER. I don’t like him. he has given me nothing but trouble for 12 years. Name calling down to threatening to call cps on me because I didn’t do what he wants. I’m lost. I don’t want her to hate me but I also don’t want her messed up in the head because of him and I have NO Idea if he talks shit about me or not when she was there (I’ve never told her about the stuff her dad does/says) part of me feels like I shouldn’t care if they can’t afford the child support anymore, they need to figure it out, but then I feel like I’m heartless and I have been In their situation before! Please please give me some good honest advice. The only response I gave her was that I would see them in court as he stated. She’s saying they can’t afford court and he is blowing smoke out of his ass because he’s mad at me. She wants to write up a contract but I am against this! anyways… I’m lost and confused and hate hurting others, but at the same time neither of them care bout whats going on over here with my daughter. Help!!!   And again,I am sorry for the length.",09May2019,4

725,"Hey all, I recently got a surprise interview for a position starting in July, and everything went very well. This is in Computer Science for what it's worth. I just got a call from the hiring manager and they offered me the position, yay! However, she mentioned I have to pass a drug test, which includes marijuana. I'm in a legal state, which is irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

I smoked 2 days ago, and had some edibles over the month before that, and have had a THC/CBD mix pen for the last 2 months that I hit every now and then. My THC levels stored are probably fairly high. I'm pretty positive that even if I took a test in the next 2 weeks that I would fail.  


I have until Monday to get back to her, and see myself having a couple of options:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Try to delay the test as much as possible (can easily do a couple of weeks because I am in fact going away), exercise and drink lots of water and do all of the voodoo people talk about online to try and pass this test

&amp;#x200B;

or

&amp;#x200B;

2) Tell the hiring manager that I really want this position, that I had a pot brownie last month to celebrate exams finishing, that it's not a habitual thing for me and that I fear I will fail the test, and would love the opportunity to take it at a later date, as well as another one at the start of the job to show that I have not been taking it. I'm stopping entirely so that wouldn't be a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

My only worry is that if I delay and still fail the test, I make an ass of myself and will have wasted everyone's time. On the other hand, I could be shooting myself in the foot if there's a chance I can pass this and get the job, because it's exactly what I want.

He belittled me, called me ""too weak to cope with life"", called me a ""crazy psycho bitch"" and tried to break up with me. I was already low. All that sent me over the edge. 

Past few days, he was just messaging me saying, ""Can we sort this out."" I was in bed, already ill from a nasty chest infection and now the copious amount of paracetamol in my blood. I didn't go to A&amp;E the first time. (First one was on Sunday night, then I took more on Wednesday and again today.)

I am, however, in A&amp;E now and I told him what was going on. My mum told him I had been taken to hospital and well... I couldn't really weasel my out of it then. So I just told him straight. 

""I see it's clear you don't need me anymore."" He replied. 

So now I'm in agony and I'm fucking livid. He then went on to say things like, ""I wish things could've ended differently between us."" 

I'm so fucking astounded that he could say things like that when I reached out to him saying that I need him... and he just said the above.

731,"I'll just get right to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have an amazing job. I love it. I want to get paid more, but who doesn't. The problem is, I moved across the country and i'm thinking of moving back to take a job there even if I won't like it as much just because i'll be a bit more comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory. I have depression/anxiety and have been diagnosed. About 2 months ago I had a mental break, and attempted suicide and then went into this intensive therapy program for a month, where I didn't work to get back on track. My therapist suggested a move closer to home because where I live now, it's just me. I'm an only child and my friends and family are back on the other side of the country, so i'm pretty much dealing with everything alone. 

I live alone, so that's making me more of a shut-in and I feel like since moving here, while my work life has been great, my mental health has suffered. I want to stick it out though, because I feel like my break is coming at work! I feel like i'll be doing great things, but I also don't want to regress either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm back at work now, and the at first I was like, yeah, I can move home, but I just got an award for a great work performance and now i'm like maybe I can stick it out. It's such a tough decision that could potentially change my life, and i'm also worried I won't like my job as much if I move back. Any thoughts are helpful! Thank you!",09May2019,1
732,"My fiance and I just had our first baby a month ago. We were engaged before the baby came and we're supposed to be married but I wanted to wait until the pictures of us married weren't with me 6 months pregnant. We lived in kind of a crappy apartment, the area we live in is super expensive and we lived comfortably within our means, but the apartment was full of mold and needed a lot of work from the complex and so we decided to move in with my parents.

This is where the trouble is. My parents moved into a bigger house, one OUT of their means to accommodate a bigger household. We weren't planning on coming back home before they got this house. We were going to go to another apartment, we could afford it at the time. We did not know we we're pregnant yet, but it was a possiblity that we could be. My dad got this house with the hope that we would come home. When they first moved here they lived here for a month on their own, and they were struggling. We knew if we we're pregnant we needed their help with the baby, not with finances. We needed the moral support. So we decided to come back. Up to this point, my parents were the best parents I could have asked for, and they always we're full of love and moral support, even if they weren't always great with money.

My mom has been pretty sick the last few years, she's been out of work for that time. She had surgery to fix that issue, but still hasn't gone back to work and never received disability. She has severe depression and it makes her horribly irrational on top of being in the house 24/7 making her more irrational and she rots her brain watching daytime drama television, which all of these things together just makes her insane. But she's so helpful with the baby that we just try to ignore it and make light of everything.

My dad has never been great with money, but they have always sacrificed everything for my brother and I to have the best life that we could, but a lot of the time got us into financially unstable situations. I have never doubted my dad's love for his family.

I am not currently working, my fiance and I both want me to be home with the baby at least his first year, for ethical and financial reasons. It doesn't make sense for me to go to work if all my money is just going to go to a daycare. My fiance works 45-55 hours a week, and he needs to get sleep when he's home.

My mom and I argue a lot, it regularly gets out of hand. Today it got out of hand, my brother is just starting his credit and I was helping him figure it out, I warned him not to let my dad have any of his credit cards. My mom heard this, and as always blew it out of proportion, claiming I told him my dad will fuck up his credit, and take all of his money, etc. All I said was to not let my dad have his credit cards. Because he took mine and now I have a huge mess to clean up. These are facts, not opinions. I was trying to help my brother in the best way that I can. To learn from my mistakes with my parents.

My dad took this pretty personally when he asked my mom what happened and she obviously told him the exaggerated story. He came down and accused my brother and I of turning our backs on him, of being ungrateful and they both told us we have three months to figure out where to go because they're getting rid of the house. My dad calmed down and apologized for what happened. My mom will never admit her faults. She never apologizes for what she says to me. Shes called me a cunt, threatened me, told me I'm an ungrateful bitch, among other things. She hates my fiance, she won't admit it, she hates him and every chance she gets berates him. He is the most amazing partner and father, I am the luckiest woman on earth to have him. He hates the way my mom treats me and the financial instability of my father, no one talks. They all just hold in their resentment to each other.

We have always expressed my gratitude to my parents. We've always pitched in when we could, even when I had a baby hanging on me. We have always paid our rent to them. We have never asked for anything in return besides a stable house and some help with a very colicky baby. I feel like the stability in this house is non existent between the arguing, the belittlement, the money and fear of being kicked out.

What the hell do I do? There's no other family we can stay with. I don't want my son to grow up in this unhappy environment, to watch his mom be called names, to watch her cry. I don't want him to be in an unsafe house if we move into low income housing. I just want to do the best I can for my baby. I want him to grow up in love. I want to be somewhere safe and happy. I don't know if the problems we're having here are something that I can fix, I think this problem is bigger than me. Do I take my chances and try to live on our own and not be able to afford a great place to be, if we can even afford it. Or do I stay here and live in it and try to remedy it the best way I can. I need more options. Someone please help me.",09May2019,3
733,"I (18f) got ""laid off"" from my job a few weeks ago, they said they cant afford to pay 2 people so they dropped me and kept the other girl (owners grand daughter) and said they'd call me when buisness picks up in the summer (i live in a small mountain tourist town, gets really busy for summer activities and winter sports) now i dont live close to anything else and i dont have my license or a car, how do I make money?

734,"So I recently interviewed for a position with a major aerospace company and apparently they really liked how I presented myself. The thing is, that company is currently a 1-2 hour drive (or a $50 Uber) from where I live depending on traffic, and it requires 60 hour work weeks so being so far is pretty impractical. 

My lease ended a couple months ago and I've been month to month since with the intention of renewing it in June. I don't have a car as it was recently hit on the side of the street causing $4k in damage and since I only have liability, I have to pay out of pocket to fix it, which I can't afford. 

It would be insane to pass up this opportunity, but it's just horrible timing. Do I renew my lease like I told my landlord I will or do I back out once they make an offer and scramble to move all of my shit to a new place closer to the new job? Moving would be difficult as I don't even have a car and my savings are depleted from an emergency that happened recently.

He went home eventually and we were all convinced that progress was being made. Then, his dad started drinking again. It was around 5 weeks after his return home when he had to come back to escape his dad’s emotional abuse. Today, his dad called the cops and basically demanded that his son comes back home.

738,"Since I was in about 2nd grade, I knew I wanted to be a lawyer and I've been trying to work my way up to that for a long time. When I was 15 or 16, I started really paying attention to the comedy scene. I was introduced to it through Brian Regan and then became acquainted with some of my favorites such as John Mulaney and Kyle Kinane. I went through a brief phase where I was convinced I wanted to be a comedian. I never actually wrote a set or anything but I started thinking about a stage persona/stage presence especially and did a lot of studying of other comedy styles to determine my own. I moved on from this phase and continued my journey to becoming a lawyer, but it always kind of lingered in the back of my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the last couple months. My dreams of being a lawyer have all but been crushed due to some pretty unfortunate circumstances. My life has taken a turn that I couldn't possibly have predicted and can't go to school for law anymore. I'm considering more practical routes but I think I would really like to try my hand at being a comedian. I have a lot of respect and knowledge of the art form and think I would have a really good, dry delivery that would lend itself well to a sarcastic, millenial/gen z audience. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here's where you guys come in. I would love some advice about what \*not\* to do. What pisses you guys off when you go to a comedy show? What type of jokes don't really hit home for you at all? I want to be a good comedian, not just another Amy Schumer wannabe, like some girl comedians end up doing. What do you like about other comedians? Their tone of voice? Their delivery? Their actual jokes? Thanks for any advice you guys give... It means a lot.

But I'm 31 years old, and I've never done ANYTHING in my life. Never really travelled, never been in a relationship, never really even had any interests.

Ironically, despite being overweight (technically maybe even obese), I honestly wish I'd pursued some kind of education in fitness and/or nutrition.

Some background : While I was in college my mom signed me up for some kind of health care bill share program after I got kicked off my dad’s health insurance. Because of this, she views herself as in charge of my medical information. 

I’ve run into problems with in the past with my mom trying to access my medical information. 

Last year when I went for my physical my doctor ordered bloodwork to be done. Well, I put this off for a good month probably because he told me I could go whenever but my mom didn’t know that. 

About a week after my doctor’s visit, she calls me yelling about how I didn’t get my bloodwork done. I asked her how she knew this and she went real quiet, real quick. Turns out, she called the lab requesting my results and impersonated me. When they couldn’t find them, they noticed I hadn’t taken the tests yet and asked “me” (my mom) why I was calling if I hadn’t even gone. 

After that, we had a very long conversation about privacy and how I’m pretty sure what she did was illegal. She didn’t like that. From her perspective, she was doing me a favor (even though I’ve told her in the past I didn’t want her involved) and I should be more grateful.  Strike one. But okay, fine, I should have been more independent and proactive with my heath coverage now that I’ve graduated college... so I let it go. 

Fast forward a few months, I’ve gotten a full-time job and now I’ve got real health insurance! Yay! Now that I can afford it with my all grown up insurance, I can finally get an official ADHD diagnosis. I went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me and gave me two options. Go to a psychiatrist and work with them or see my primary care doctor. Well, I’ve known my doctor since I was a kid and have a good relationship with his office staff. This means I know I can get in to see him much quicker than a new psychiatrist. So I go to my doctor, get him to write a prescription, boom, Adderall! Except not “boom, Adderall”, because the doctor’s office called my old home phone number and that connected them to my mom who CANCELED my prescription before I could even get it filled.  Alright, strike two, but yes, you’re right, I should have updated my doctor’s information so it was current. 

Today I get a message from my mom asking to go to their house and send her some stuff from her computer. She and my dad are on vacation and she left some travel information here. I go into her files and see a folder of just “my name”. I will say, I’m VERY respectful of people’s privacy. However, a lone file with “my name” on my extremely private and controlling mother’s computer is too tempting to pass up... 

So I looked. It was like a freaking dossier on me. No cute photos or videos of me growing up, oh no. Instead there are folders of my whole life via paper trail. My past credit card statements (before I opened my own account in a separate bank... to be safe) dating back to 2013. A photocopy of my drivers license. My 1 traffic citation from 2 years ago that I didn’t give her. And, low and behold, the missing lab results! My doctor’s office didn’t have them when I asked a few months ago, meaning she went to the lab to get them and impersonated me, AGAIN. Strike. Freaking. Three. 

I’m mad about the file, yeah. However, what angers me most is that she knows I’ve been on a wild goose chase trying to find these infamous test results and lol and behold she has been hiding them since October 2018! Also!! After reading the results, I saw some very important red flags that my doctor and I should have know, uh, known last year?

I don’t want to take any legal action with the lab or my doctor’s office. I’ve already told both offices in the past that they cannot share my medical information with her or allow her to make any changes, but how do I ensure that don’t give her my access again?

And what should I do with this very loaded file? Do I confront her right now? Or wait until she gets back? Am I blowing this whole thing up and overreacting? Petty me wants to wipe the whole thing and say nothing. But adult me would rather find a way for her to understand this can’t keep happening. 

I know what she’s doing isn’t from a place of malice (and this is probably her version of caring), but she knows how I feel about my privacy. I’ve set very clear boundaries and thought our relationship was improving because of it. Turns out, she was just lying to me this whole time and I don’t know how to make her see that she’s gone too far.",09May2019,1

However, my aunts have been giving me so much shit saying I better be there today or else they will be disappointed in me. They don’t realize being an engineering major stressful AF and nothing like working remedial jobs like they do. So i’m at odds of what I should do.

764,"I've worked at my job - cashiering at a clothing store - for 2 1/2 years now. I hate it! I did try moving to a better position, but I never received full training (management was always being interrupted), didn't catch on quickly enough, and was the only person in my department (departments are supposed to have at least two people). Eventually, I faced with the choice of stepping down or being fired for incompetence. Even part-time, I was awful at the position, though they didn't intend to tell me that. They just reversed my position and hoped I wouldn't ask questions.

I went back to school (trade/vocational), and graduated just two months ago. Took a lot of applications and help from Career Services, but I eventually landed two good offers. One is a full-time position at an IT company as a technician and the other is part-time as an alarm responder for a security systems company. Both jobs individually pay more than my cashier job, and I do need a second job, hence why I want the part-time one.

So, why am I asking for advice? Because for some reason, my nerves are sparking like wildfire. This is what I *wanted* (more, actually), yet I'm suddenly having second thoughts about leaving my retail job and feeling anxious about it all, despite there's really no benefit to me staying. It pays too little and I've ultimately hit the ceiling there. Of course, the other jobs may not work out, but I haven't tried, so I don't know. All of a sudden, I have this idea I'll regret leaving. But I know I'll regret staying too.

Why am I suddenly so unsure when I'm finally getting what I wanted and worked hard for?",09May2019,2
765,"Welp it's that time of year... Yayyyyy :( I feel this urge to go but I always respond with this gut feeling that I'll just be spending 60 bucks for a ticket and more money for clothes just to be alone in a crowd instead of actually by myself. I struggle with self loathing and the fact that I've never landed a relationship doesn't really help in this situation... I just feel like I'm not wanted there. I'm always like... The funny friend. They either don't like me. Or like me but someone better comes along. :( I feel so defeated. 

I'm trying to stay positive and work on myself like I always have been but this issue has been gnawing at my brain. I feel like, honestly... I'll regret not going. I'll be sitting at my house alone while my friends and potential friends are having a fun night. But I just feel so unwanted guys... The whole deal is making me depressed because i know that going would mean growth in my character. Doing something outside of my comfort zone and shit.

For further context I'm not exactly a homebody play games all the time kinda guy. I generally really like to get out there... But this year has me feeling so defeated in terms of finding someone and all that bullshit. Wish I didn't care. Wish I could be happy at home but I know I won't be.",09May2019,1
766,"Hey all, 
Not too long ago I went through a very hectic break up. I had a phenomenal relationship with my ex, and only a few weeks prior to her heading off to a new state we were deeply in love. 

About a month after her leaving she left me for someone else. 

Long story short I went through an 11 month period chasing this girl around trying to get her back, and I would often end up *begging* her to just give me a shot. 

She was off and on with her SO and would call me on a daily basis telling me how she misses me, how she still feels for me, etc. 

She sees me after a long time and we end up kissing. We had established we would try and move forward as friends, but that was not the case in person. 

She told me the following : 

- if she kissed me she would get over me 
- just cause you miss someone doesnt mean you should go back to them
- that I should move on 
- that she didnt love me
- she loved her SO 

So, after hearing all of that and being lead on and emotionally messed with time and time again, I finally had enough.

I blocked her number, told her not to contact me and went to therapy. 

Some of the key things I left out: 

At one point, she sent me a picture of my house (pre block) at a late hour of the night and what was listening to on spotify at the time. I woke up to that and simply responded ""go to bed"". 

She also would get really close to me over the holidays only to bust out snap chat and had one time snapped a picture of me to her new SO, who I had clearly no interest in even acknowledging existed at the time and it killed me. 

I made it very clear to her that all of these things had hurt me so bad. I was 10 pounds underweight at the time, depressed and looked like sh*t. 

She even saw it herself. 

I would consistently get apology after apology. 

She called me on my birthday before I graduated (graduated the night after my bday) and told me I was using her for comfort and that she had found a NEW interest on top of her so. 

At that time I would not initiate contact but would reply. After receiving that message I told her to take time for herself and figure things out. 

She said she'd leave me alone for sometime but eventually came back. 

Now, it's two months with a block and she has called *almost* every single week and has gone as far as reaching out to an old coworker. This coworker has literally no filter and I feel like that's why she talked to her and not the others (we met at work). 

The coworker told me she reached out today and I left before i could hear anything because i just dont trust the intentions nor do I want to involve myself in this stuff any longer. 

I *finally* started seeing someone new and I enjoy their company a lot. We get along well and respect eachother. Our relationship is extremely healthy and there is never a dull moment between us. 

I'm working hard on forgiveness as well and I've gotten back into my passion of design. I have a great job with great friends and I've put some weight back on too. 

She comes home very soon and I pass through her town on a daily basis to get to work and to see some friends. 

I dont want to change my entire route or living situation for something so crazy. 

I struggle with reaching out and just saying dont contact me again, because it seems everytime I've said anything at all nothing changes. 

I dont know what the heck to do and I had a full on panic attack today after seeing her phone number and then finding out she contacted the coworker. 

I just want things to be normal, and i dont really like the fact that shes still someone I have to worry about or care for because I dont feel like she ever cared for me at all. 

I sometimes get freaked out too that she is watching my reddit account (even though it's probably totally irrational) and I've deleted and avoided social media. 

I already struggle with the guilt of blocking someone, and I also struggle with the fact that i miss who they used to be. 

She told me to move on, so I left and am trying my damndest to do so, but it doesnt help when she keeps trying to contact me. 

I hate it, and it doesnt make sense. It's been really confusing and heartbreaking and I'm ready to just have this stuff over and done with! 

I also mentioned at some point that my best friend was close to me and she proceeded to yell that she hates him in the middle of the night when we last spoke. 

It's a waste of my time and energy to worry and I'm already stressed out enough about so many other things, so it's just freaking difficult. 

My biggest fear is that she will show up at my work, because I work at a religious institution and it was a same sex relationship. 

Its taken a super long time for me to get to where I am emotionally, and I dont want to ruin my progress in anyway shape or form.",09May2019,1
767,"\*tl;dr\* I can't relax and play games at the end of the day because the shame I took as a kid is effecting me as an adult. I'm seeking any advice on how to correct it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, recently I've \[28M\] been struggling with something I can't seem to figure out. I love a ""reset"" period where I can relax and do my thing and mostly game for a couple of hours at the end of the day. I used to do it when I lived alone in an apartment, no problem.  I never over did it and held a job, graduated college with my BA, got enough sleep, etc. and it was a well enjoyed hobby of mine. Now, I am currently living with my girlfriend and we have been dating for 2 years and some months. Ever since I moved in, I couldn't seem to enjoy gaming anymore and my ""reset"" periods seemed to stress me out rather than de-stress me; and I couldn't seem to figure out why. She never has an issue with me playing games or my me time. She's never shamed me, punished me, or ignored me from these me-times as well. In fact, we sometimes play games together like Minecraft. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I think I've figured out why and I can't seem to find any help on how to combat this. My parents HATED when I played video games. I absolutely loved them as a kid since I didn't have too many friends and it kept me busy. For years, they would make small comments like most parents do like tell people all I do is play video games, that I need to find other hobbies, that everything I'm doing is unhealthy, blah blah blah. Even my mother told me one day that she wished she never shown me my first game as a kid (bugs bunny on the NES) because I could of been doing better things with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I was ashamed of playing video games. So for years, until I moved out, I would subconsciously find ways to play when no one was around. I couldn't relax and play my favorite hobby when my parents were in the house and I hated it. Playing at night when everyone was asleep was the norm or when everyone was out of the house. And when they come back home I would quickly turn it all off and pretend I wasn't playing. The kicker part is, I was allowed to play but it was just the feeling of them seeing me play really worked me up the point where I convinced myself I shouldn't show them I play as much anymore so they wouldn't seem so annoyed by it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this week. I am on my computer at my sisters house playing something to wind down for the day. My mother suddenly walks through the door and for some reason my very first instinct is to close down what I'm playing and shut my laptop lid. I am a 28 years old man who just shut his laptop lid of a game he was playing because I didn't want my mother to see me playing a game... what? why did I do that? Then it hit me. I think I have a hard time playing or relaxing when someone else is in the house because of the shame I took as a kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's embarrassing to have this issue but I really miss being able to reset with a hobby of mine. Maybe I'm really over thinking it and this isn't the issue at all. Sorry for the long story but maybe someone here could help me find a solution to this or point me in the right direction. Searching online didn't really bring up much.",09May2019,3
768,"For some context, I have always been a really shy guy in school but I have been able to create some friends. They would all play on their ps4’s when they were younger so I also asked for a ps4 and started to play with them. However I wasn’t good at video games but I had a really fun time playing with them. When we all started playing fortnite is when I would say it was the most evident. They would make fun of my terrible video game skills, stop inviting me to play with them and just being terrible to me. For example, today we were playing this game called rainbow six siege and in this game you could choose different operators and you would play against an enemy team. However there is also this thing called team killing were you can shoot your fellow teammates. Anyways, me and my friends joined together and we were all playing and then all of a sudden one of my friends stole one of the operators I played the most. This doesn’t seem like a big deal but when I steal one of my friends operators they would kill me. So at first, I confronted him about it and then he calls me a bitch and said their was nothing I was going to do because he was my “daddy”. I then proceeded to team kill him and he got mad at me but all my other friends all immediately were on his side and they kicked me out of the party.

Hey!!
So here's a quick low down on where I'm at in life...
I have a good job as a hair stylist and currently at the top of the ladder, and earning a good wage.  Iv been living with my parents for the past 4 years (mum makes countless cups of teas👍but omgolly it isnt ideal) but iv been saving my pennys to hopefully buy a place of my own at some point.
I have been single for quite a few years, just can't find that special one ... do they exist :P 
Ultimately I would love to be in a relationship, to share travelling experiences, living and sharing a life with family and friends together (pretty standard human desires right?!) 
But as this is out of my control being that all my dating and relationship experiences have resulted in still being single I figure I'm not getting any younger and there's a whole world out there which I crave to venture and experience if it be alone.
I have travelled a fair bit in my early twenties already so I definatly love exploring and seeing the world, but I just figured I would of met someone by now to enable more fun adventuring to happen.

So I'm now thinking I'm at teeny bit of a crossroads as in what to do next, I can either ... 

A. Get a flat (just about have enough now) and get into the morgage world, which I'm grateful to even be close to doing as it's such a difficult ladder to climb.

This would be adulthood for sure! And what many people my age are doing, I want that... it's just do I want it right now? 
But being settled enables me to still hunt for a mate (ha) and my family and friends are here who I love very much. 


B. Quit my job and work abroad for a bit again... scaryy but could be a good kinda scary! So this will enable me to save my money still, being a hairdresser does open up alot of job opportunities and Iv had my eye on a job in Switzerland for the next ski season where they need hairdressers .... in the mountains 6 months, earn some dolla and ski on the weekends, sounds inviting right?

Downside is where ever or what ever I do, I come back home to be looking for a job here, probaly wouldnt be as good of a wage im on atm and then trying to get back to my original morgage plan idea (unless a blonde swiss snow boarder man has whisked me off to a chalet to live!) 
Also downside.. I may not like it, am I getting to old for this kind of random adventuring, am I delaying finding the one? I do want kids is it delaying that!? Or am I thinking wahey too muchhh into this🙈

I suppose I'm surrounded by friends who have partners and are settling down, painting their garages, weeding their gardens and walking their dogs and I just feel panicky that I need to be doing that!! Rather than rash ideas about leaving and working abroad?! 
 But I also keep looking at future 70 year old me thinking what would she say to 32 year old me 🤔😁😄

Any advice would be lovely thankyou! 
Also thankyou if you read this far, I blabbed alot there haha!

Hi Reddit! 

My friend, let me call her Amy, has quite the situation.

Amy is 16 and needa some guidance or advice for hher dilemma. 

About a year ago, she used to live in Texas with her mother; however, after a physical altercation, that was never reported, her mother told her she needed to leave or she'll call the police. Amy's mom ended up giving guardianship to her sister  for a year and Amy now lives in Florida with her aunt.

Eventually, Amy and her mother made up and had plans for her to come back to Texas in late May/early June of this year. During the time they are apart, Amy's mom got a boyfriend. I'll name him Chris.

Now that it is May, Amy is preparing to move back to Texas and her mother. Her mother doesn't have her own place and lives with her boyfriend's parents. 

This wasn't a problem for Amy until her mother called and said that she couldn't move in and live with them. Amy freaks out and now has to find a place to live. All of her close relatives won't let her move in and her aunt said that she wouldn't keep her for another year.

Amy isn't really close to her Texas friends anymore and has exhausted all her living options. The flight to Texas is booked and she knows that if she doesn't find a place to live she will be homeless in less than a month.

So, now I'm turning to reddit about her options. She cannot stay in Florida because her aunt did  not renew guardianship and if she goes back go Texas, there is a possibility of her being homeless. 

I want to know what I can do to help her and what she can do to prevent being homeless. She's honestly lost and scared. 

Also, I know this was the bare bones of the story but I didn't went to dig too much into her personal life on here.

All advice appreciated! (:",09May2019,1
773,So my last day of college before going back home is tommorrow. Hanged out with a friend today but she had to leave early cause family. before we met that day she mentioned which times she was free Thursday afternoon(today) and Friday before noon. Mainly want to know would it be weird to ask if she want hang out in morning before I need to go home. Asking bc personally wanted to spend more time. or would you just go home (I know her decently wouldn't say close hanged out 7 or 8 times prior also kinda want redo felt little awkward as lot things going through my head) would you ask hangout in morning or go home.
