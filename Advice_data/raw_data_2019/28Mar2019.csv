0,"So I opened my reddit messages because I received one from r/dankmemes... saying I was banned without appeal. This was because I’m European. Fun fact of the day, I live in New Jersey. Specifically, the ban states that I cannot post nor comment, and that I cannot make another account or I will be banned from reddit entirely. I don’t know why this happened, but it’s completely ridiculous. I am really angry because this happened for no reason, and I’m thinking maybe it was because I posted with a VPN, which is still ridiculous. I don’t know how the dankmemes page detects these, but it’s absolutely nonsensical. It could also possibly have to do with being in Italy for a week, but even still, I’ve spent way more time in America and that shouldn’t be enough to get me permanently banned, without appeal, forever. I’d at least like to get a reason, which is why I’m here. 1. Was there anything I could’ve done to stop it? At the very least I want to prevent others from being banned for absolutely no reason. 2. Is there legitimately nothing I can possibly do to circumvent this? I don’t think this is in any way fair, and I would appreciate any help I can get. Thank you.",28Mar2019,1
1,"I [19F] have dealt with serious mental health issues for the past 6 years. I was diagnosed with anorexia (I am now mostly recovered), depression and social anxiety. I have spent around 2 years on medical wards and psychiatric hospitals and was discharged at the age of 18. After reflecting, I tend to see a pattern of ups and downs in my mood which leads me to believe that I might be suffering from manic depression and not major depression. A strong indicator for me has been that my depression is periodic and sudden/without trigger. I won’t go in to lots of detail but I definitely feel as though I at least need to get a second opinion. My GP has already tried to refer me to mental health services but I refused and just took the pills which I stopped almost 2 weeks later because « I felt better » both times. I’m embarrassed to come back after a couple of months to admit

2,"I’m a 37 yr old man, and I can’t date. Anyone out there have some advice for me?  I’m fairly handsome, not fat, good job, but I have a psychological hangup. My now ex wife filed for divorce over two years ago.  We have been divorced for a while, about 8 months now. 

I’ve gone on two dates since we divorced, first one I was so nervous I seriously twitched. 

Second date went better, the lady was amazing. We talked, we joked, she invited me back to her place. As soon as it got to the point were we should kiss... I had to leave. 

See I have this thing about vows. I’ve only been married once. Really thought the first would be the only.  I might forget a promise to pickup milk or something due to my ADHD, but vows are totally different. They makeup who I am.  

Any advice on how to get over this mental block?",28Mar2019,1

I got an email from the petrol station company saying I pretty much have the job less than two hours after the interview, but I’d really rather the traineeship as it’s something that will help me in the long run. I interviewed with them two days ago and they said they would get back to me by the end of this week or next Monday if I got the job, and they finished their interviews for the position just yesterday.

I feel as though *my name* doesn’t want to get better. As though my brain is addicted to the feeling of being sad and alone. I think that if I “kill” *my name* and create a new identity with a new name, maybe I can start bringing forth the change necessary to be greater and healthier.",28Mar2019,1

6,"In one of my classes I have a teacher. Lets call him Mr. Q. Background: This is a freshman class. Now Mr. Q is a beloved teacher by many of my peers and imo he's not all that bad, though he does come off as creepy a lot of times.

There are a couple of tables in the classroom and every table is filled up except for one girls table that has one empty seat in it. Mr. Q goes to that table quite often and talks to the girls whether it be about schoolwork or a casual conversation. 

A little weird, but nothing unusual. He then decides to plop down on the chair and talk to them a bit more. Even more creepier, but not enough to report him. Then theres this one girl that he talks to the most and sometimes he will touch her. This man pats her on the head and sometimes playfully shoves her. 

It gets to an uncomfortable point and freaks us all out. Ive talked about it with other classmates and they agree with me. Its not 100% sexual predator material, but it is not good. Im just wondering how far does it have to go for me or someone else to report it.",28Mar2019,2

11,"I am 16 and identify as aromantic (meaning I do not feel romantic attraction). I’m fairly confident of this  as I’ve even ended past relationships because I did not reciprocate the feelings they had towards me despite how perfect/similar to me they were.  I also never get crushes. 

However, recently I’ve become intrigued with this one person in my school. I always catch myself looking at them and they are constantly on my mind. We are currently friends and they are an extremely nice person. 

Despite this, whenever I imagine us being together I hate the idea, and always get stressed out if I feel they have feelings towards me (they probably don’t but I like to overthink). In my mind I don’t want to be romantically involved with them but my brain always overcomplicates things and makes me think I do. 

So, do I just find them interesting or is it an infatuation?

12,"FTP. Sorry for any grammar mistakes. And if this is the wrong sub, please let me know. I'm kinda new to this whole thing.

So I am a teenager currently in my sophomore year. I am taking Chemistry AP and I thought I was pretty good at it for the first semester. However, this semester, things aren't adding up. It started when I took a test, and somehow got a 70. It made no sense; I studied very hard, and was a natural at the subject. So I brought it up with my teacher. I asked to see my test, and I found that there were no red marks, nothing! I asked them what I did wrong, and after 10 minutes, they couldn't find any mistake!? Because of this, my grade was boosted significantly. I dismissed this as them mixing up papers or something.

&amp;#x200B;

But now, a few weeks ago, we took another test. Our teacher has an option that after a test, we can collaborate together in groups and take the test again as a correction, and then he will take the average of the tests. So me and my group collaborated. We got the same exact answers, and thought we made an easy hundred. Now it is important to note that before this happened, on the test my entire group got the exact same answers to the questions. On the group review, we had access to our old scantrons as well. We ended up just crunching the numbers and ending up with exactly the same answers that we all had before this test correction. A few days later, our teacher says that he graded our initial independent tests. I look into the online grade system, and BAM. A 70. Welp. I thought I must have screwed up my test. So I talk with the other people in my group. As expected, they also got a 70 as we had the same answers. So I thought that we were stuck with a 70 as on the corrections we bubbled in the exact same thing. 5 minutes later my teacher says that he has now put in the average of our old grade + group test corrections in the grade system. Somehow, I have an 85?! And the other kids in my group who bubbled in the ***EXACT SAME THINGS*** on the test and on the test corrections have a 75?! What the heck? First off, how is my grade even higher when I kept my answers the same on my test and on the group test corrections? Secondly, how come my peers in my group didn't get the same boost? **How do I go about telling my teacher that my peers deserve a better grade?** They already went to him once, and he just **brushed them off.**",28Mar2019,1

I don't have feelings for my best friend just so you know. I'm sick of hiding shit from people. I don't want to hide anymore. It makes me feel sick. When the only thing I can think of is ""did they find my drugs?"" Or ""do they know im bi?""

I got pretty wasted I did six shots then my friend and two of his friends said to come back to their house. They said it was going to be fun. When I got there they told me to get undressed, I did.




I was bewildered they tried to take photos of me, but I told them to stop. They gave me a beer then told me to suck their dicks I did no one else was there. I didn’t know what to do. Then they penetrated me I bleed. They finished. It feels blurry to remember the next day. The next day they tell all their friends, and their friends say I’m disgusting, ugly, stupid, a bitch and gross. They made posts about me online
This was six years ago, and I still think it’s my fault. 




I said yes to having sex with them right away they said. I had never really gotten that drunk before. They said no one will ever want to date me. One of the guys would continue to hook up with me for years. I did it because I felt lonely, became an outcast, and thought I was ugly. He would say I’m annoying, that he wants me for sex and nothing more. I don’t think anyone will like me





Am I a slut? Will no guy want me? Am I gross? Why did this happen?

17,"This has probably been asked before, but I haven't been able to find anything, so I'm asking here.

Long story short, I'm a high school senior that's top of my class, 4.8 GPA, really good reputation, everyone likes, everyone thinks is an awesome, innocent person. Unfortunately, my actual life doesn't really match that image, BUT I'm able to keep it under wraps.

Until a couple days ago. I'd just been at a party and got very messed up. Early the next morning, while still somewhat high, I hooked up with a girl who I've never met and who I've only talked to a little bit. (She was completely sober, as she hadn't been at the party).

She said she was on birth control, so we didn't use protection. Stupid mistake, I know. I finished inside her, and two days later she texted me, telling me that she is nauseous and has been throwing up. Besides that, we haven't talked at all, and neither of us are happy about the hookup. Also, she is anti-abortion, so....

I guess I'm asking for advice: is she pregnant? Can you see the signs this early? And if she is, what do I do? The only person I blame is myself, but if my family finds out, there is a very, very good chance that I'll be kicked out and forced to pay for college, and my whole life, by myself. Can anyone give me any advice on what to do? I'm just a tad panicked.",28Mar2019,2

My mom caught my father cheating on her with a third party a few months ago and gave him a second chance to stop. A week ago, my mom caught my father with the same women. Their ~30 year marriage has ended because of this. 

Today, I saw my mom crying saying how, everytime she thinks about it, it hurts too much. She also told me she can't sleep at night (she gets like 2 hours of sleep a day and goes to work a 9-5) because that's all she can thinks about. She kept telling me about how she trusted my father for so long, and he just went around her back. Lastly, she told me that the only reason she keeps living/able to move is because of me and my brother (we're both young adults, i'm 21 and my brother being 27). Also noting that if my brother or I wasn't born she would have off'ed herself by now.

I'm worried about my mother's feelings overpowering her.

My parents, myself, the third party and myself are the only ones that know about this. They specifically told me not to tell my brother, as he lives away from us, and last time bad news occured (our grandmother passing), he started to have seizures. We did a bunch of brain scans for my brother, but nothing came from it, it was just a one off thing.

I was wondering if there is anything in specific that I could do to possibly help my mother out in this situation.

23,"    Firstly, the relationship with my father has been spotty at best. He’s been constantly in and out of my life, due to his drug abuse issues, for as long as I can possibly remember. He took up with his current Wife when I was very young, all the while she has been nothing but cold and aggressive towards me. Despite the fact I’ve never done her any wrong and tried my hardest to be cordial and polite.
    Recently, my mother pulled me aside in a very concerned manner and revealed an extremely disturbing pic. It was of my dad, looking down at a camera, fully exposed(D and all!). Nothing was said in the message, and you could see it was sent sometime late at night.

40,"Anyone that knows me, knows I'm trouble. I've got sass written over my face, and depending on your point of view, you will notice some entitlement and know-it-all attitude, too. For that reason, along with my very cynical worldview and my very controversial opinions, I am hated by nearly all of my classmates. Due to my comments in school, I've been proclaimed a sociopath and now none of my feelings are justified or at times even existent in their eyes.

How does that affect me, you ask? Well, I do feel excluded every now and then, and I do feel attacked. When I shared with some of my classmates that I had been sexually assaulted by one of the girls in our class, they sided with the perpetrator and villanised me for publicising the event. When I was picked on, put on the spot and disrespected by a teacher, I was criticised for choosing to leave the classroom. Whenever I speak or complain, I get shut off, regardless of being justified in my actions. A girl in particular, two weeks after a school shooting in my country, did not bother to say out loud to my boyfriend that she feared for her life that one day I'd become a school shooter, too (4 months before graduating?).

All of those things hurt me, and my boyfriend told me I should manipulate the class into allowing me to say some words during graduation and prepare a speech to beautifully clarify to each and every single one of them all of their wrong deeds. I do think that idea is distant and complicated to achieve, but I am dying to speak up and be heard. How can I do such a thing?

Basically I have known this guy (Sam) for quite a long time and over the past few months we have gone (with groups of friends) to see a few concerts together. Didn't get any romantic vibes those times. A few weeks ago I saw Sam out at a bar and he seemed really interested in talking to me and hanging out with me one on one. We had some pretty personal chats - in which we both talked about how we didnt really like one night stands and other kinda sexual topics. All of my friends told me that Sam seemed keen but we had known each other for so long I though nothing of it. Then a few weeks later he started texting me and we had some very casual conversations for a week or so. During these conversations I told him about band that was playing in the next few weeks and he said he would buy a ticket to come with me and my friends. He also offered to pick me up from work one day and asked if I wanted to get coffee another day. He then asked if I wanted to come to another concert with him and his friends over the weekend. I agreed and we went and got some drinks together before the concert. During this time he was giving me signals that he was interested saying things like if I liked camping and saying that he wanted to get a group together for camping, saying I should help him pick out some new plants for his room and just other general nice stuff about me. The night progresses and we get a bit drunk and I end up going home with him. Afterwards he said things to me like ""i dont have work during the week we could do this again"" and offered to bring me to a party he was going to that night. So (obviously? or is it not obvious i dont know) I left feeling like this guy genuinely wanted to get to know me and see me again and spend time with me. 

The next night I knew he was out (for that party) and I was also out so I messaged him asking if he was out. I know that is pretty forward and could be seen as a bit much after a ""one night stand"" but due to the stuff he was saying the night before and the fact we had been talking for over a week I thought he would be keen for that as well. He didnt seem super keen to meet up but in the end i went back to his again. Probably not my best decision, as i know it was me pushing for it, but I was drunk and all the other cues I had been getting during the past were positive. We slept together in the night and then again in the morning. Then he dropped me home and its now been 4 days and I havent heard from him since. 

I decided today that since he was so forward in his messages last week it would not be unreasonable for me to send him a message. So I sent a casual message asking him about the concert that we were planning to go to in a weeks time. He didnt reply for 7 hours and then when he did he said he couldn't go anymore (with a shitty excuse about a sports game). even though he told me the week before he had bought a ticket to the concert!! 

So obviously those are not good signals from him now and I have been left feeling SO confused. Did I do something to put him off or was he planning for it to be a ""one"" night stand the whole time. I just dont understand why he would've said all those things and put in all that effort before if all he wanted was a hook up. I feel like I have been majorly played. All the other one night stands I have had - I understood when I went into them that they would most likely just be a hook up but this one I thought maybe he really wanted to get to know me. Or am I just being unreasonable and expecting something from what clearly was nothing. 

I am just really upset about it all to be honest. Mainly just because ive known him for so long and I feel like he portrayed it as wanting to get to know me - not just sex. Do you think I should say something to him about it? Like maybe just ask what the deal was. ",28Mar2019,1

44,"hello, all. this is my first post on this board and it's going to be a long one just to warn. i don't know what's happening to me and idk where to turn. 

i (20F) moved to a different state after high school to be closer to family. i had a great job and a nice, affordable apartment in a major midwestern city but still wasn't feeling fulfilled. i decided i missed the ocean and got nostalgic and decided to save back and return to the east. before you make assumptions, its not like i have money or even much of a support group. im fully aware im kind of a dumbass for not having much of a plan but oh well.

anyway, in a bit of a crunch i moved in with an old high school friend and soon remembered why i cut ties in the first place. she's a toxic person and terrible roommate, which could be an entire other post if i went into why. she's a selfish sociopath hellbent on controlling. and belittling others. i got a part time job at, you guessed it, the same cafe she works at. speaking professionally it's a few notches down from my previous gig, customer service at a luxury department store. rent is literally twice as much here. naturally i want to do more and do better since im bored, broke, depressed and want a full life.

its been 3 months. i am applying anywhere and everywhere, from department stores to grocery stores and other coffee shops and restaurants. im proactive, follow the standard process and never get a call back. the one time i did get invited to interview for a position i believe i was qualified for, i was rejected. im a shy and polite person with years of culinary and customer service experience.

i never used to have any trouble finding work when i was younger and yes, i did graduate high school. i have a pretty good resume for 20, no face tattoos or criminal record, i've never been fired and my social media is completely clean. even googled my name and it all checks out. i can pass a drug test with flying colors, haven't touched a thing in months. 

so, why tf will no one hire me? im willing to work basically anywhere. but all i hear is ""we'll let you know if we're interested"". it's discouraging and confusing. is something falsely coming up in my background check? is someone sabotaging me? possible identity theft? do they think im not who i say i am or that im lying on my resume? i know i sound paranoid and psychotic, but seriously, this should not be happening. im trying so hard, why can't i just get started in the city i was born and raised in?

tl;dr: i moved somewhere after hs, moved back to hometown, my life is jack shit and i have nothing.",28Mar2019,2
45,"I'm a freshman in high school and I have just now realized how my sleep schedule has wrecked my brain. I recently had spring break and scheduled myself to sleep for 8-9 hours for that week. I found myself feeling lifted, in a way, and more restful. I want to be able to sleep for that long, but it seems impossible with my schedule. No, I don't have a job as many with this problem might have. Instead, I have transportation issues. My schedule runs as follows:

My bus drops me at my home at 5 PM even though classes end at 2. When I get home, I eat which takes about 15 to 30 minutes. Homework, even though I've become more productive, still crowds my day to the point where I continue to do it until 10 or 11 PM. It takes me 30 minutes to an hour to fall asleep. That might not be too much of a stretch, actually, considering some of my friends sleep at 12 AM to 2 AM. But, for me, it's terrible because I wake up at 4:30 AM to catch my bus which arrives at 5:30.

46,"This is my first post and first time on reddit so I'm not quite sure how this works. I have a question for everyone:
I ate my co-workers last 5 Gardetto chips because I had already purchased him a family size bag and taped it to his locker. He had an open face bowl with his chips downstairs (we are not supposed to have food downstairs) available for any of our dogs to reach. (Some of our dogs have allergies.) I went across the street to buy him a family size bag to tape to his locker because I knew I was either going to toss them or munch on the last 5. He was doing ""outs"" with the dog rooms and wasn't available for conversation. But with dogs passing they could have easily stopped and ate the chips. When he got back and before I had the chance to explain to him that there was a family size bag taped to his locker, he went LIVID. Dropping f-bombs and cursing. When he was over I said something alone the lines of ""I'm sorry it won't happen again. It was rude and inconsiderate for me to assume I could eat them. I should have asked you."" Then explained there's a bag taped to his locker. He responded after my apology with, ""Damn F*CKING right you should be sorry."" When he got his chips he actually threw them across the room in front of me. After this situation he hasn't talked to me in a week. We work together and even work related conversations he ignores me. What should I do? 
*Side note* Last time I ever had to apologize to him was for running into him while he was cleaning. I said that I was sorry and it will not happen again. That was a year ago, I still have kept my word about not running into him.
What should I do to improve our work-related relationship??",28Mar2019,0
47,"When I was younger, I've always neglected trying to show empathy or my opinion on things once I realized people criticize you and judge their opinions of you depending on who you are. I was never sure which type of person my self conscious self strived to be like, usually I was split between deciding how I should judge my actions based on who I wanted to be versus my own personal convictions and interests, which was hard because I constantly paired the social structure that happy people are assertive, confident and a certain kind of character, otherwise you don't earn up to the privilege of prioritizing yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I chose trying to morph into being the person I wanted to be, I was disappointed at how hard and impossible it is to try to change myself and started to feel that my actions are hopeless and that it is impossible to try to change. Initially I tried being more outgoing, cheery, bright, of which I tried being more loud and tried to push as many bubbly comments as I possibly could, until I realized that regardless of my actions they treated my character as the same person I was before and seemed to make me forgettable than how I was before, which really got to me. It made me feel like there was a pointlessness to my actions, that no matter what I can't change who I am, so I started being more isolated and began to lose faith in myself. As timed moved on, I've watched my peers around me grow and evolve into more mature yet immature teenagers that have convictions and morph into people who have \*character\*, meanwhile I've been in a awkward state of deciding who I want to be because I never tried to prioritize my own thoughts and my own self integrity; I constantly distance myself and force myself to believe that I do not own up to such privileges. It's gotten to a point where I tried to shun my own emotions, to prove my independence and maturity when I was so lonely. I used to cry alot everyday because I was constantly reminded of how obsolete I was, and because of that I thought I was weak, so I started to be hard on myself. Nowadays its hard to cry and laugh. I find socializing difficult and acting normally in public challenging. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am almost a senior and see those around me happy with friends, with ambitions, with preferences, with jobs, with relationships, with priorities. I honestly get confused when I see people act a certain way, wondering why acting this way would benefit you, why its so natural, why being this way isn't used to give yourself an advantage you, but actually is who you are and that you don't require the moral decision to be this way, you just are. I honestly wonder how people can innately be like this. I wonder when I let myself go. I wonder how I can make decisions based on my own preferences, how I can attract those who love me for what kind of person I am. Honestly, to find a SO I find it impossible that I could actually find me attractive and funny. I refuse to believe that I can show a personality quirky enough to satisfy each other. I personally have difficulty in making personal replies/comments about my views on things, as I don't choose to have preferences. I feel so distant compared to those around me. I've always been awkward with others and I found my input invalid every time. I try to apply myself and act a certain way and in those times, it's always feels like I'm betraying who I am and feel out of place, thus at times I feel discouraged.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of this was me venting, but the possible understanding that this may be a irrational self diagnosed depression issue that may seem childish/carefree (which could possibly be true honestly), the problem still stands and I take this problem seriously and I am trying to improve, but which steps do I take? Every time I apply myself, I feel like I'm in a position that disadvantages me. I am extremely self conscious and I can't make a decisive decision on what I should do. Please Help.

A book.. but since he uses iPad I’m not sure of his opinion of paperback.

49,"I work at a very small retail company consisting of only three people. One being the longtime owner, another sales rep and myself. We work pretty standard retail hours Tuesday-Saturday. Most days are extremely busy and we are understaffed. Our warehouse manager quit in a fit of rage and we (myself and other rep) have to pick up the slack including tasks like tracking packages, returns, organizing heavy palettes, calling customers and scheduling pickups, etc. The owner usually strolls in around noon and begins to micromanaging the day ineffectively. The owner is mostly concerned about the window display or vacuuming rather than posting a warehouse job on indeed (been over three months and still no job posting. Today she said she was ‘too tired to type up something when she gets home at night’).

By the time I get around to helping my customers on the showroom floor, placing complicated orders, typing up quotes, rendering designs, taking phone calls and walk-ins it is past closing time. If we go over 30 minutes to an hour the owner usually gives me the extra pay. But anything beneath that I find my paycheck does not change (same amount every week). I find this extremely frustrating and awkward. I am not sure if I should rock the boat at work with the owner but I’ve done the math, I missing out on well over $1000 a year with these minutes adding up (been at this job 1.5 years).

It's with regards to my personality, specifically my assertiveness or lack thereof. I struggled with social anxiety in my freshman year, and found it very difficult to make friends then. My solution was to try to conform as close to the popular kids as possible by listening to music that I did't want to and dressing not how I normally would. Now in my junior year, I have overcome many of my initial anxieties and am much more outgoing now than before. However, one thing that still remains is my timidness, and this is where I am experiencing struggles. It started with my friends making fun remarks and my going along with it, and I thought nothing of it. However, it has since developed into them scrutinizing me for everything that I do. I feel pressured not to make mistakes as they will berate me for them, and I rarely have a comeback to their insults due to my timidness. I usually just look away, but it's pretty clear that their insults get to me. Despite their remarks, I am courteous to them by helping them with almost whatever they need. I even bring them pizza from a club I attend that they aren't even a part of. Sometimes they are kind people who I enjoy hanging out with, but other times they make fun of me on a whim.

About a year ago my grandma died, I was her main caregiver and very close to her so this was very hard. All I wanted to do was see my friend and hang out. We made plans to get lunch, but he stood me up. Wouldn’t respond to my texts, calls, I was genuinely worried and thought something happened because when I arrive at the place and said “here” in a text, he responded with “on my way” and then didn’t respond again for basically a whole year.
I left the cafe and got worried and Called his sister, she said he was fine and would tell him to call me. Never did. So out of the blue my best friend just all together stopped talking to me. But later that night I saw in his snap story that he was out with other friends of ours. Friends that also won’t talk to me. 
This was very out of character too. For 15 years we did everything together, we grew up together. And during a very hard time in my life he leads me to a cafe just to stand me up. 
He had blocked me on everything, removed me from all his friends lists. Many of my other friends also just left me out of the blue yet still spend time with him. 
I tried so many times to get ahold of him thinking I did something or to find out what ever happened. But nothing. 
Last month my mom said she saw him at a restaurant and he was so excited to see her and how he missed her. Saw my mom and him talking in some Facebook comments and I messaged his new Facebook just asking how he was and if everything was ok. After a week he responded with “leave me alone, I’ve moved on” after just being friendly with my mom?
I have absolutely no idea what I ever did. This is all so weirdly out of character for him. Any problem we ever had we talked it out. We talked about everything and supported each other for years. I don’t even know what to ask advice on since I’m so confused. 
I want clarification and have no idea how to get it. Because of this mysterious problem that caused him to never talk to me again, I’ve lost almost all my friends and it’s getting to such a lonely point. 
I don’t even know if I want to mend the friendship after this. 
Should I try to demand an explanation? Or just move past? How do you even make friends as an adult.

I could technically appeal again, but for that level of appeal, they will not continue to pay me even during the process (as theyv'e done thusfar) and it could take years, so there's basically no point. 
 
They've told me that I'll get a final check for April, but after that, I'm cut off. 
 
I'm also on Section 8 housing (government assisted housing) and live with my mother (who is also disabled, which is not being contested) so the rent is determined by our combined incomes. However... unless I can very quickly find a job, my income will be $0. 
 
Problem is, I have absolutely no clue what I can do for work, else I probably would have been doing something all these years. I have a variety of issues, but these are the ones I think are most likely to affect my ability to perform a job. 
 
1. Severe anxiety, especially social anxiety - This is the big one. I simply cannot deal with people. Period. I cannot work in any capacity with any sort of customers, whether it be in person or on the phone. Co-Workers are probably not an issue since I generally warm up to people after being around them long enough, but being around new people every few minutes is absolutely impossible for me. I cannot mentally handle it. 
 
2. I have a variety of gastrointestinal issues, but the largest issue is that I very frequently have to rush to the bathroom, both for #1 and #2, and I have great difficulty holding them. I can't think of any job that would allow me to take such frequent bathroom breaks though... 
 
3. Cooking and cleaning jobs are impossible for me as I have severe fears (which are made worse by my constant panic attack inducing anxiety) involving high heat/fire and germs. 
 
4. I have very little strength or stamina. And no, it isn't from being obese or anything. I mean, I'm a bit overweight yeah, but even when I was young and thin I've always been weak and frail. Anything involving moderate lifting or moderate physical activity are impossible since I'll never be able to keep up. 
 
...But according to Social Security, none of that qualifies as a disability, I guess.... 
 
I also never graduated high school and don't have a GED or any kind of degree. I have no work experience and very few overall life skills. 
 
Thusfar, I've called Social Security, but all they've really been able to tell me is that I'm good till the end of April. I'll also lose all of my medicaid coverage and food stamps then as well. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do with SS, or what I'm supposed to tell Section 8 either. 
 
Is there anyone I can contact to give me professional assistance/advice? How do I find a job that can accommodate my specific needs? Is there anything that can help or protect me in this situation? What about my home? I'm sorry that this whole post is kinda all over the place, but my mind is spinning in circles right now. I'm completely overwhelmed with depression and panic right now. I need help and I truly have no idea where to turn. What do I do?",28Mar2019,3

Sunday I weighed in at 122.1. Awesome! My goal weight is 120lbs. Then, the next day after treating myself up until maintenance I was up to 123.2. Cool. No biggie. Water weight right? But the past week this number has only gone down to 123.0. I’m used to losing a lb a week so this is very frustrating and new to my schedule. I even drink 90 oz of water a day. My period is next week so jay may contribute to this sticking-on-the-weight.

72,"I'm a senior in undergrad for Biology. I've never really had issues in school before and I've passed every class I've taken except one, this one. I'm retaking organic chemistry 2 and I've failed the first two exams. I've been struggling in the exams only, the labs and homework is going totally fine. I've reached out to my professor, who realizes the difficulty of the class and they have allowed me to take an exam at home (not for a grade) to compare the scores. I scored 43% better on the take-home than on the other, and my professor believes it's test anxiety. 

My university's academic assistance program requires a psychiatrist's diagnosis and a few weeks notice to begin the process of getting special testing arrangements. The issue I'm having is I don't have any diagnosis, just the two scores from the in-class versus take-home exam. On top of that, I'm currently taking 19 credit hours, and this class is the only one I have any discernible test anxiety in. 

I have an exam on Friday. If I score well, I can likely make it to the end of the semester with a passing grade; if I don't do well, I won't be able to pass and I'd have to find somewhere to take the class over the summer.

My roommate (female) was generous enough to let me use her laptop. When I downloaded some images for editing I couldn't locate the original download folder and used the windows search option. But then came up a whole slew of nasty images, which led me to a folder hidden in a bunch of other folders. They contained images with really disturbing stuff involving underage boys with older women. 

My roommate is pretty tech savvy, being a compsci major, so I assumed she found these images somewhere herself. 

I've wiped all history of me having accessed the images. Thing is I don't know what to do now. I've been messaging the only person I trust enough to discuss these things for the past week, discussing options. I don't want to get her arrested, but at the same time I'd prefer she didn't continue this behavior. Also I'm highly reliant on her for rent since the place we're sharing is quite expensive and she is well funded by her parents. 

To complicate things she volunteers at a daycare center. I doubt she'd actually try something in real life with those children, but I can't assume anything...

Isn’t working so she doesn’t have much for anything. Can’t drive because she has a warrant so I have to drive her around in her car. She always wants/needs my cellphone so I cannot even use it like usual (she will take it while I’m sleeping so no morning alarm for example). I make little to NO money. Yet, she pressures me to give everything I have every time for her personal urgencies. For example she’s looking at possibly losing her home due to late payments. So it’s all falling on me. Mind you I just moved back recently because I needed to save money. Meanwhile my older brother is sitting on big lawsuit money. But she REFUSES to ask him for anything because he gave her 2k last year. Which honestly is nothing since he’s been living rent free there all his life. (He’s over 30)

I feel like I’m going insane. I have no privacy because she follows me around the house. To pressure me about money I can’t afford to give. Or constantly talk about the same things. Even when I need to have a private phone call. She legit follows me room to room. And She argues with me constantly at home &amp; when I’m forced to drive her. Literally, NEVER stops talking, and talks to herself in the house very loud. Even when things are done. Do you guys know how maddening this is??

All while my brother quietly sneaks around the house. And doesn’t say a word to either of us because of past arguments. (Also he’s even more negative and poisonous)

I’m sinking into real depression. I feel my flame dying out. I have such big goals that require time and at least a little bit of money. But I am in such a toxic environment.

81,"So this is a bit of a long one and i’m only mobile so sorry for bad formatting. 

This all started first day of freshman year— Or maybe before that? When i was a kid i had a crush on Zack Binspin from moshi monsters so always really liked the name Zack — Okay so first day of freshman year and my locker is next to someone named Zach so i’m like “oh that’s cool” Then he started to date this old friend of mine from like three year prior who happened to sit beside me in art class. She constantly when on and on about how amazing he was and how funny and dorky he was and stuff. They broke up about a week later and that was the last i heard of him till second semester. 

Second semester started and low and behold Zach was in my math class. He say a few desks over and one row in front of me along with his then girlfriend   Everyday i saw them together in class all cute and stuff and i was half like “i miss having a relationship” but also “i want a relationship with that one” and had like a quarter crush if you get what i mean. 

Then shit happens and i wind up in a relationship with this other guy. Wary in the relationship he starts talking about his bestest of friends and basically brother Zach. Yes. The same Zach. And of course they’re best friend so my bf tells me all these great things about what an amazing guy Zach is

Now my boyfriend isn’t my usual type. I like scrawny messy punk looking boys. My boyfriend is 6’O and 240lbs. Zach in the other hand is pretty skinny to the point you can see a lot of bones, and he has a very punk style. But that’s only look wise. I like funny guys who are dorky and/or nerdy and just fun to be around and hang out with. Both kinda fit that description

Of course i love my boyfriend with all of my fucking heart and would never leave him or cheat on him but i have these confused feelings towards his v attractive best friend. But now here’s the kicker

Zach told be yesterday that he likes my best friend. Like he likes her A LOT. full butterflies in the tummy i don’t know what to say blushing mess crushing. Now my best friend might like him back. Both me and my bf are aware of this and ship it. Just with all this shit it’s rattled me up again with my feelings and i’m like ??? why are these my feelings i don’t understand help. ",28Mar2019,1
82,"Hi - first time poster here. Apologies for the long winded question but details are important here:

I am caught between a rock and a hard place with my best friend and business partner. The two of them (both F) came to a retreat with me (F) - me being their only mutual friend. I left the yoga retreat early due to a family emergency and they got to spend 4 days getting to know each other. I thought, “How perfect, they can bond”. The optimist in me was soon crushed to discover that my BFF was date-raped by one of the other retreat attendees (M). It was a situation that she wanted to keep private but eventually told me because she felt my other friend / business partner helped instigate the whole situation by befriending him and still remaining friends with the guy AFTER the incident. (Granted, she didn’t know my BFF well but how in the world does someone not have sensitivity towards something like that? On the other hand I can’t say I’m surprised as my business partner is very opportunistic and I think she wanted to work with this guy in some capacity.)

Anyway, I am just torn. I have no choice but to continue making contact with her regardless of the fact that it crushes my BFF every time she sees me interact with her in any capacity (mainly, social media). We run a business just the two of us and I promised my BFF that I would cease my relationship with the other “friend” but couldn’t overnight due to me depending on her for my career / financials. My BFF has obviously gone through trauma and I am obviously on her side, but ...
Question 1) How do I communicate to her that I am trying to cut ties with this other person but that it is a slow work in progress to unwind years of a business relationship / friendship without shooting my self in the foot? (She has the ability to completely ruin my career if she wishes) 
Question 2) Am I a terrible friend for not completely deserting this person the second I found out about what happened to my BFF?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. I normally have a very high social radar in these situations but have never encountered something of this caliber before. ",28Mar2019,2

87,"2 years ago my dad was feeling unwell and drove himself to the hospital. Turns out his heart was beating so bad the doctors told him they didn't know how he was conscious. They had to shock him twice and we found out that he probably has sarcoidosis in his heart and lungs. Since then he's been taking steroids and has a pace maker and the condition has pretty much cleared up in his lungs. However some of it is still in his heart and there is scar tissue there.

&amp;#x200B;

He is going in to have a procedure done where they basically stick a tube through a vein in his leg to get up to the heart and clear out some scar tissue. If everything goes well he could get off a steroid and have his pace maker removed when the battery dies.

&amp;#x200B;

The procedure is about as safe as it can be. He knows his doctor and the man has done the procedure over 2000 times and he was told there is less than a 1 percent chance of him even getting an infection.

However, surgery is still surgery and sticking a tube through an artery is still scary. I'm in college which means I won't be home the day of his surgery and I'm worried. I don't know how to  clear away the thought that he could die or something goes horribly wrong.

89,"I realized that my father had serious mental health problems early on in my childhood as he was constantly anxious, often alternated between being calm and happy and episodes of rage, and had severe insomnia. He has been verbally manipulative and although he is often a very kind individual, he is also incredibly unpredictable. When I was a child, he was often able to distract himself by constant sprees of online shopping and spontaneous family trips (often lasting a month). He slept an average of 4-6 hours a night for nearly a decade and always complained about trouble falling and staying asleep. Some days he just has complete breakdowns where he yells and picks at every little thing we do, often finding small reasons to pick fights and argue. Our relationship has always been very rocky and that is part of the reason why I moved away for college. For the last couple of months he has been having a very peaceful period and has been getting along surprisingly well with my mother and sibling (18M). However, my brother just recently got a girlfriend and we have both grown tired of his constant nagging and need to control our time and schedules. A few days ago, I went on a trip with some classmates for spring break and I received a call from his saying that he was two states over, on a road trip by himself, and that he wouldn’t be home for a week. My mother informed me that he just lost it one morning, got in the car, and left. He told me he is driving an average of nine hours a day alone (with severe back problems), called me in a panic to ask if I could book him hostels, and sent my younger brother pictures of himself driving down the highway dangerously fast. I’m not concerned about him harming himself physically, but I really think that he is having a manic episode and that he has serious mental health issues that need to be addressed. Although he has framed this trip as a road tip to visit a few national parks in the US, I think there is so much more to it than that. My brother, who has been sick for the last few days, refused to come and before my father left, he told my brother (in what appeared to be a joking tone) that if he dies on this trip, it would be my brother’a fault for not coming.

91,"As the situation stands, I moved in with my grandmother to help with the bills and play a part time caretaker role to her after my grandpa died early last year. I've been paying rent and half of the utilities since I've been here. 

Grandma is dealing with bladder cancer and will most likely not make it to the end of the year. In the event of her death, it was agreed upon by all parties that my mother would then move back in to the family home and I would continue to pay rent, albeit at a reduced price.

Now the home has fallen into disrepair and has needed renovating for years now. When grandpa was alive, he had plans to replace the roof, tear out the floors in the bathroom and kitchen due to rot and mold issues, etc. Sadly, these things never came to pass and now that my grandmother is basically at the end of her life, she has no interest or money for making these projects happen. 

The general consensus is once my mom moves back in after granny passes away, she will move forward with making the necessary upgrades in the home. But of course she's going to need help and since I live there, she wants me to foot the bill for half of the cost.

My question is, am I legally obligated to pay rent AND help with renovations and/or repairs? My mother is MildlyNO and we haven't had the best relationship in the past, and most of our clashes have happened because she tried to manipulate me to play backup ATM when she overspent her own money.

I know that dealing business with faaaamily can potentially bite you in the butt and destroy relationships, so what can I do to protect myself? Do I have to pay both rent and renovation fees or would it be the responsibility of the landlord (mom) to pay for them out of her pocket? I want to be helpful, but I also don't want to get taken advantage of.

If it helps, I live in CA and am not in a position to rent a place of my own at this time. Any and all advice is most appreciated, thanks!

I met one older girl because she eavesdropped into my conversations and then laughed loudly at a joke she clearly heard me make then asked me to repeat it to her, then after I talked to her, her and her friend wait after class for me so she can pop out and say boo and smile at me and she got in my face to do so. Then she began laughing at dumb stuff I say to other people, butting into my conversations, responding to me or asking me to repeat stuff to her. She couldn't look me in the eyes and say hi first. At first, her friend girl 2 didn't talk to me and she just pushed me to the first one. While talking to me 1 would get red and make no eye contact, hide her face and didn't stand still. She blushed and smiled when I say hi first. Then her friend asked me to be around them and she was embarrassed and had an attitude but 1 wanted me as close as possible to her and talked to me as much as possible.

93,"I’ll try to keep this short and sweet.

I’ve become very close with one of my best friends throughout the 2 years I’ve known them, and I’ve really gotten to see how they operate in the world, and to put it bluntly, it really concerns me.

This person in my life isn’t on drugs or anything like that, but their general outlook on life is very healthy, and without giving a specific example, I’ll just say that they are stuck in what seems to be a victimhood mentality, and they truly believe in their heart that the world has something against them, and wants to fuck them over at every corner.

They use their words seemingly in a way to manipulate people in order to garner sympathy, but then reject any sympathy or positivity they receive in order to garner even more sympathy.

This is a person who, in my opinion, seems to wake up every day and make the conscious decision to be miserable. They’ve had a lot of struggles in their life, and they do have it rough, but the unhealthy aspect of it all is that they appear to be using that negativity as a crutch, or an excuse as to why they aren’t where they want to be in life.

It’s a very touchy situation, and it’s a conversation I’m very scared to have with this person knowing what I know about how they deal with these types of things. I do care for this person very much, but their negative outlook on life and manipulative tendencies really concern me, and being that I’m in very close proximity to this person on a daily basis through no choice of my own, it affects me directly.

What should I do, if anything? Should I have a conversation with this person even if I’m scared the outcome will be negative and further complicate things? Should I leave it alone and do nothing? It really bugs me and honestly hurts me a lot of the time, the way this person says what they say and does what they do.",28Mar2019,1

Before my boyfriend moved, he couldn’t see my ribs unless I sucked my stomach in, now you can see my ribs. (Losing all the weight was about 1-2 months after he moved I think. Not long at all). I have an allergy against gluten products, and they don’t buy my food and won’t let me get a job either. 

I am at a point where I can’t take it anymore. Is there anything I can or should do? CPS will make this whole situation worse because it’s my word against my parents and they’ll end up winning that argument and then continue to make my life a living hell. I just really need help. Badly.

95,"i work at a pizza restaurant making 8$ an hour and i absolutely hate my life. im just living in a huge 1bd apartment by myself that costs 1000$ a month at least after utilities and my parents cover all of it,

i might be kind of mentally slow or something. i did too many drugs over the years and i still drink too often and take kratom too much because i suck at quitting. im not going to kill myself but yeah i need to pretty much be sober so i dont end up attempting it after a bad night

im really lonely and madly in love with my first girlfriend from six years ago. she lives really far away.

ive dropped out of college three times and i just dont see myself doing anything with my life. im scared. i have no friends. im broke. cant do anything unless my parents give me money or if i spend my 150-250$ paycheck every two weeks. 

my part time 8$/hour job also completely wears me out. i got it to prove to family i could do something. i fuck everything up. i cant sleep. 

just got in a bad car accident and i probably wont have a car again. my apartment is a mess until my mom flies out to where i am to help me clean it. 

yes im also banned from canada but thats irrelevant.

nobody seems to like me and i have no hope. how can i ever expect to make enough money to do anything ever if i cant even cover my own existence?",28Mar2019,1
96,"I (17m) was at a stop side today, waiting for cars to pass so I could turn, when a car going 45-50 in a 30 mph zone hit the front left part of my car. I spun out pretty badly into the grass and gladly no one wash hurt. My car is messed up pretty badly and the other car is mostly fine. A cop was there immediately and he acknowledged that the other driver didn’t even have a license plate on their car. He decided to not file a report and told us to handle it on our own. The other party has been texting and calling me asking how I plan to pay for they damages and my parents feel we’re not responsible for any damages and that the cop should’ve filed a report. They are now threatening to claim it as a hit and run which is stupid because we have each other’s numbers. I couldn’t write down their plate or anything because they didn’t have them and I’m also leaving for New Orleans tomorrow. My dad is pretty hot headed and his English isn’t the best so I have to talk to them and he gets frustrated at me very easily for not acting as angrily as he does. I have no clue what to do.

i (f) haven’t had a girlfriend before her. she was pretty much my first everything. 

our relationship is pretty complicated so i’ll just try to make sense out of it with a timeline. some of the details could be wrong but this happened pretty recently. 

october 2: she asks me out. i say yes. 
october - november: things go well. she kisses me. 
november - february: she ghosts me completely. she only acts like i exist when it was convenient for her. 
march: we start talking again. a few days after her birthday, march 14, we’re back together. 
and as of a few days ago, about march 24, she ghosted me again. she isn’t talking to me anymore. 

you see, i realized something around last week. i’m the only one putting effort into our relationship. i always text her first, and our conversations are short if they happen at all. she always leaves me on seen, no matter what i say. 

so i just,,, stopped. i stopped texting her, because of the way she reacted. i thought i was annoying her. i would send her a few memes every now and then, not enough to be obnoxious. 

it took her four days to send me anything. when she did, she was making fun of my height, which i’m very self conscious about (i’m taller than her). 

i texted her my reaction and she left me on read. it’s been three days since then and i haven’t talked to her since. i’m not going out of my way to avoid her, and i’ve never done that. she’s the one avoiding me. 

here’s where things get complicated. during the winter, she ghosted me, i’ve already said that. somehow, me and my stupid fucking brain decided “oh, it’s a good idea to fall in love with someone who probably hates you.” 

so here i am now. just stuck. i don’t know what to do. ",28Mar2019,1

108,"My boyfriend and I went apartment hunting for him recently, and the landlords of the place he chose (Asian, a bit of broken English) invited us to their church this coming Sunday. Because of their English and accents, I couldn't understand entirely what the church event was about, but what I understood was that it's some sort of gospel (the word the wife used), where we would go and listen for a bit and have food with everyone afterwards. 

The two of us aren't religious. I used to go with my dad when I was little, but was always sent away to the child center early on so I never knew what the adults did. My boyfriend used to go when he was younger and seems to remember a bit more, but still not very much.

I want to be as respectful as possible, but I really know nothing about going to church. Will I have to say anything? Should I bring money (I remember there being a basket to put cash into)?

I told him that it was a no brainer and he should choose the free one as this is a charitable event so being able to save an extra $200 to go towards charity would be great. Cam then proceeded to have an hour long conversation about how invalid everything i said was and ended up holding his event at the $200 dollar venue which set him back for the money he was supposed to be raising.

112,"For the last couple months, I have been getting this strange smell filling my apartment at night. It smells a bit smokey and kind of like those fruity flavored rolling papers (I had an ex who would roll blunts with them so I'm kind of familiar with the smell). I would assume this is cigarette smoke?

Now I tried to put up with it because I didn't want to cause any problems, but it has become more and more frequent. I am fairly certain I know which neighbors it comes from since I hear their window open  and then that's typically when I can smell that smelly smell.

I think part of the reason I can smell it so much is because the walls are so thin. I can also hear everything that happens next door and above me. Unfortunately, I know more than enough about my neighbor's personal lives. In particular,  the woman has a very distinct, projecting voice so I can always hear what she is saying. I am fairly certain I heard her say to the man she lives with ""Oh what are you smoking?"", one day when I heard the window open.

Now I have had a lot of health problems the last few months. I was diagnosed with a heart condition and I am only recently getting over a bad upper respiratory infection. It has taken me a lot longer to recover than normal I think in part because I've been having coughing fits whenever the smoke comes in. I also can't use my inhaler to help catch my breath since that raises my heart rate and I have this new heart condition. There have been many times where I've gotten no sleep since I can't catch my breath. I've physically had to leave my apartment sometimes.

So I did look at my lease, and there is a non smoking clause. It states that there will be a $50 fine for each offense and then the tenants will be subject to eviction. I contacted my landlord through email saying I think my neighbors might be smoking. I would have tried talking to the neighbors first, but any attempt to smile or make contact with them in the hall has been met with scowls and silence. Also their doormat literally says ""GO TO HELL"" (I was hoping it was a joke, but I'm not so sure...).

My landlord was very kind and said she would email my neighbors to ask if they had been smoking. She also said to contact her again if I can smell smoke again. I didn't hear from her for a while and the smoke stopped for a bit.

But of course, the smoke has come back and even more potent and frequent (it smells like a different flavor now though?). I was beginning to become frustrated as I emailed the landlord as soon as it happened again and never got a response. So I went to talk to her in person.

She was again incredibly nice, but said that everyone has denied smoking and went to pull up the email. They apparently insisted both tenants have asthma, and never smoke. They also said none of their friends ever smoke (I do think it's odd that they were so specific in their answer but idk). I told my landlord about what I can hear and the timing of everything (I hear them open and close their windows about 10 times a night and matched the smoke smell). 

The landlord seemed to believe me and think every was odd as well. She said she would send the tenants another email asking them to stop or they will get the fine. She also told me to call if I can smell it during the day, so then management can come down and catch them in the act
 Unfortunately I am usually working during the day so I dont experience this. There is an after hours number, but that is for emergencies. I mentioned this and the landlord said this could be an option if need be.

Of course when I got back to my apartment,  I smelled the smoke again. I was tempted to call but I am second guessing. They seemed to deny everything and I am the only person in my apartment so I'm the only one to smell it. It has been going on all night and I've been trying to listen to see if they say anything about it.

I want to be able to breathe and live comfortably in my apartment, but I don't want to evict anyone especially if I am mistaken. It would be nice to have some perspective on this before I do something that could significantly someone's life.

Do this sound like my neighbors are smoking? Or could I be imagining this/mistaken maybe? What would you do in this situation?",28Mar2019,1

So, I have a best friend and we have known each other since kindergarten, We have hung out for years, eventually (years ago now) my parents got divorced, i have moved around 7-10 times and I have switched schools 2 times (might do it again) but me and my friend have managed to keep in contact all these years, we play games together all the time and talk through discord but whenever one of us has to go or he does not respond to my texts after like a day or 2 i feel a sense of emptiness and i get a little upset, now, He is a very busy person so the whole him not responding to texts isn't that big of a deal to me but whenever we end a call/game I feel like I lost something , im not sure if it is because he is one of few constants (besides my family of course) since I move all the time and switch schools etc. One thing i should mention is that I went to his house this weekend and we hung out with his brother and his friends, watched some TV and played games but after I left, went home and woke up the next day it felt like forever ago, it feels like that with a lot of things really, like school, even things that i know only happened 5 hours ago feel like a long time, im not sure if i am losing my sense of time or what and i also don't really know where to post it which is why i chose here. 

Also, I am way to tired to read back through and edit the mess above, but, School is also stressful and it is a possibility that i have slight memory loss, i forget things a lot like what i was about to do and occasionally where i am, today i thought i lived in my old house which we just moved out of 2 weeks ago. which that could be causing me to perceive things that happened recently to have happened a while ago

122,"**TL;DR** My roommate is my landlord. I'm moving out of my condo I'm renting, and my landlord is moving out too. Lease agreement says he owes me the security deposit (up to 45 days after moving out). I have reason to believe he is going to skip town and not give my deposit back. How do I hold him accountable, if I can't find him after he moves?



So this is the full situation. My roommate rents this condo from an individual. I sublease from him for a room. He pays the utilities, I pay him for half. He is supposed to give me a summary of the utility bills every month so I can pay half. The last FOUR months, out of laziness, he's not done the utility bills, despite my constant pestering to get them done so they dont build up. Once I told him I was moving out, he waited till 15 days before I move out to give me the massive utility bill I owe. The security deposit is $1,000, and none of it will be used on damages or cleaning, the place is spotless. So I told him to deduct the utilities from the security deposit when he returns it to me. He says absolutely not. I said ok, when you give me the security deposit back, I can pay you for this massive last minute utility bill, at the same time. Again, he absolutly refuses. He demands I pay the utility bill before I leave at the end of the month.

Knowing him, I don't think he has the money to pay me back, and he plans on taking the $400 I give him, and skipping town, never to be seen from again. Can I hold my ground on my options to him, or is there a way I can hold him accountable, or take him to small claims court if he doesn't pay me back? How do I find him if he won't tell me where he's moving? I live in CA.",28Mar2019,3
123,"So I started my first banking job back in November, the first month was primarily training, so I won't be considering it as a part of time spent actually working. I got hired on as a part time teller, I've worked in the food industry for years but wanted something a little more stable, and a more related to my major in business admin. So let's cut forward to today. Today the regional manager came in and sat me down with my overseeing assistant manager. To sum up the conversation he was shocked by how many mistakes I was making and that I had too many incident reports (4 total; 3 for posting to the wrong accounts, 1 for leaving a drawer out overnight). I explained that it has been a difficult transition, and it can get overwhelming during peak hours. He said he's hopeful for me to improve, he see's a lot of potential ect (fluff talk)... But if I get one more report like that within 90 days then I will be fired, and the only reason I wasn't fired today was because we are understaffed. 

But there are some things that are really bothering me. My overseeing manager, who covered 3/4 of the reports said each time ""this is no big deal"" ""don't worry about this""... The other one (the drawer being left out) was brought to my attention via a higher ranking manager, and she explained to me the severity and risks of when that happens. So now, he's sitting next to me while I am being told that these very things that I was told were no big deal, are about to get me fired. Also this meeting was supposed to happen back in the beginning of February, but only happened today close to start of April because of a ton of reasons I can't even begin to explain with upper management and I was never given a solid answer to why my review took so long. 

I worked really hard for this job and to break away from the food industry and I don't want to go out like this. I struggle with depression and anxiety, and trying to get stability in my life has been a long term goal for me and it feels like its coming undone from underneath my feet.

129,"My ex and I have been on and off for years and I’m assuming this time isn’t any different but I feel like a whirlwind just took place. I’ve been researching narcissism/ bipolar/ sociopaths and he seems to fit a lot of these characteristics so I’m not really sure where to go from here. 

We broke up the first time after 8 months because we were at different places in our lives. A year later he tried to come back when I was dating someone else and has continued to try and win me back for 4 years. 

Recently we gave it another try after my relationship ended and now he’s acting like a total weirdo. Acting so sweet one minute then telling me he can’t do It and work is too much the next. I just don’t understand how someone can wait around all that time, hire me to work for his company, get a dog together, house etc...

Also now looking back there were a lot of red flags but I guess what I’m asking is do I just move on? All his actions and words tell me yes but then I wonder if maybe he does have a mental illness or something deeper is going on. 


TLDR: my ex and I have been on and off for years and this past time he freaked out and basically said he’s done because he’s too busy with work. After thinking about everything I’m wondering if he has a mental illness because it’s very strange all the time he spent pursuing me. Not only that he hired me to work for me, we got a dog, etc. Is he really just gonna walk away?",28Mar2019,4
130,"Sorry if this is long. TL;DR at the end. Throwaway obviously. 

Backstory:  I don’t do feelings well. I have been hurt (emotionally and physically) by past boyfriends. One in particular. We dated for a bit under 5 years. I’ve dated one person since, but knew it wasn’t forever so I ended it. 

I do not want children. Also, don’t need a relationship or even really want one. If I find my person, cool, I’ll be with him. But it’s not at the forefront of my mind. 

 Him (HM): a married man, one child, one on the way. 

Us:  Work together, but not in the same company. Basically, any time he has success at work, I get something from it. Though he gets nothing from mine, I can help him with his successes more than his company even can.  (I know it’s confusing, but please, bear with me)


Actual story: 


Over the past few years, I would say that I had a little innocent crush on HM. We only ever talked about work, but spent multiple days together working, and obviously that turned into a friendship. 

Without a ton of information that seems relevant to me, but not to most, we spend less time together now, but we kinda reminisce about when we did. Still work together, still have the same work dynamic. 


Here’s the deal. In the last week or so, we’ve been texting more and more. Usually about work stuff, but sometimes not. Then we randomly starting talking on the weekend. Sent each other videos and pictures (NOTHING graphic. Just cutesy videos.). Honestly, the worst line we crossed was my calling him “babe”. Though that’s not totally weird, it was weird with him. 

I have now developed FULL ON FEELINGS for this man. Like, butterflies in the stomach, heart strings pulled, Dream about him at night (seriously. That’s a whole other thing. I even had a dream that he was a terrible kisser to maybe make me stop liking him?) actual feelings. 

I wasn’t sure if he reciprocated said feelings. Again, he’s married!  His wife is way hotter than I am. 

Today, we spent a lot of time together. Like, 5 hours (on and off) in front of about 500 people. He glued himself to my side, and let’s just say, I’m not unsure anymore. He has feelings. 

I don’t want this to happen (except for the part of me that does). What I need from y’all is:


How do I get over these feelings?  I can’t have them. This isn’t a long term thing; I know it!  But we are going to drinks tomorrow (not avoidable) and next week too. Most will be around people, but there will be times we’re alone. I just don’t want to fuck up our working relationship/friendship with a dumbass kiss or even more. But right now, if he was sitting next to me, I know I wouldn’t be able to resist. I can’t stop thinking about him. Everything that happens I want to text him and tell him! But that’s so inappropriate. 

Please, r/advice. Help. I need a game plan for tomorrow, and beyond. ",28Mar2019,1
131,"I go to a very liberal uni so I thought that it would be ok to write about gay marriage. In my country, gay marriage is illegal and the government has said that religious groups who voice their discontent towards the LGBT community is a major reason as to why gay marriage is illegal. It's also important to note that the government in my country is supposedly secular.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my tutor gave me a very low B or a C for my essay because apparently, denying someone of the INTERNATIONALLY (UN) recognised right to marriage and protesting against them isn't demeaning. And that we should care more about religious feelings than human rights...The essay in and of itself was written pretty well, other than the tone being a little sarcastic and 1 grammatical error because of a typo. I even used a similar essay to apply for a scholarship and got it, so I know that my points are valid. If a government agency could accept my essay, surely it isn't too provocative? This tutor is actually really nice but she seems to be triggered that I suggested that religious people against gay marriage are still entitled to their opinions, but they shouldn't like actively rail against the LGBT community. This essay is worth 35% of my grade and I'm stressed out. Any advice?

I was homeschooled since kindergarten, which I am grateful for since my parents are smart and gave me a great education (will be going to college on scholarships), and I do have a social life but it is within a homeschool group. I don't really know people from public schools interact. I know texting is a big deal but I honestly hate it, talking face to face is easy but texting is unnatural for me and I always forget to reply and when I do it feels awkward and forced. The advice I am always given is ""be patient, you will find the right person when it is time."" The problem is, that is what my parents did, and they were already pretty old when I was born. I don't want that for my kids. I want to have them while I am still young. So basically, I only have a few years and I have no experience whatsoever. I don't even know how to talk to a girl, let alone find one who would want to have children with me within a few years. Plus, I do have a standard that I don't want to marry someone who has a huge student debt, since I will be debt free I don't want to have that burden on me. So that really narrows options a lot.

133,"All the support groups I find are aimed at people who can't have children for medical reasons, but I can't have children for personal/social reasons - homelessness and long-term unemployment due to disablity means I've been too busy trying to survive, also simply I've never met anyone I felt I wanted to try to have children with. 

At 36 I really don't see things changing in time for me to have a child, at least not biologically which is important to me - I'd be okay with step-kids, I'd be okay with adoption but doubt I'd ever be allowed, and I'd be okay for fostering in the future should the opportunity come up...but I wanted to experience pregnancy, pass on my genes, etc. 

If I'm depressed about this now I hate to think how I may feel in the coming decades. 

When I try to talk about how I feel I don't get any sort of validation form others, those who are child-free by choice or support those child-free by choice are quick to tell me that I can enjoy being independent etc. but that doesn't magically make me okay with not getting to have a child. 

I know women's value isn't based purely on their being mother's but I'm not sure what my value is...what purpose my life has...what the point of my life is. Part of wanting a kid is also to do with the belief of living on after death through them, so as well as struggling to see the point of my life I'm struggling with what it means for me after I'm gone and there's no one to remember me.

Another challenge I face when trying to talk about this is a weird mommy-shaming. I'm of course talking about this form my perspective because I'm talking about me...people will tell me by talking like this I'm too selfish to deserve a child, or because I'm depressed about not having a child that my mental health rules me out as a mom too, which is adding salt to the wound. 

It feels like there's just no support for someone in my position - people who can't have children due to medical reasons get support, child-free by choice face ignorance but have communities for support and feminists of course support their choice - I'm struggling and need help too.",28Mar2019,1

TLDR; My boyfriends parents accused me of being the cause of his financial trouble. Refused to apologize even though they were wrong. But now they want to fix things over a year later. What should I do?

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years and we’ve lived together for about 2 years. Due to sewage problems, we had to move into his parents house temporarily before finding a new place. After ~2 weeks living there, they had a “talk” with him about his finances. Basically, they thought I was living off of him and that’s why he couldn’t afford to pay off his debt (that he had accumulated YEARS before we had even met). They asked him “Are you sure you want to be with someone you’ll have to support for the rest of your life?” He told me he explained to them the reality of the situation. That I had been supporting HIM this whole time. They apparently thought this because he’s told them I was quitting different jobs and while we were living at his parents I quit my side-job because we didn’t have to pay rent. They didn’t know that I had kept my MAIN job as a bartender, but I had to keep picking up part time jobs on the side to be able to support him. If I didn’t like the work environment, I would leave. His Dad even commented “Not everyone can work at a job they enjoy”. I moved out the day he told me about their talk. I lived in my car for a couple weeks before I found a place while also attending college. I had been supporting myself long before I met him... he moved out of his parents house for the FIRST time with me.

Before all that, I really thought his parents liked me. I spent the past couple Christmas’s with them, would attend many family gatherings... used to have dinner with them almost every weekend. I was really hurt because I didn’t have the best relationship with my own parents and I felt like with them I finally had a family.

Anyways, I was really angry about the whole situation. That I had worked so hard to support my boyfriend, while he spent thousands of dollars on a PHONE APP, his parents thinking I was responsible for their sons financial trouble... I wanted to talk to them to clear things up but I thought I should let myself cool down or else risk making things worse. I encouraged him to talk to them, but he told me they didn’t think they needed to apologize for what they said because they were just concerned.

I don’t know... I felt really hurt and felt like they should apologize. It’s been over a year since that happened and I didn’t see or speak to them at all. My boyfriend said they always ask about me and they’re confused about why I never come around anymore. A couple weeks ago I reached out to them, and sent his mom and dad a lengthy text about how I felt on the whole situation, mostly to clear the air and so I could get just over it already. They acted like they had no idea at all, even though my boyfriend supposedly talked to them about it. They want to apologize now, but honestly it’s been so long that I don’t even care for an apology. It feels like the damage had been done and I don’t think we can go back to the way things were before. 

I don’t know what I should do. If it was my choice, I would never see them again lol. But my boyfriend and I have been talking about marriage a lot and he’s expressed that he really wants me to make up with his family. So yeah, sorry this is so long, I really don’t know what to do.

My nephew's elementary School teacher is fine AF. From looks she's about early to mid 30's, this pale brunette, around 5'9"" or 5'10"". Legs for days. Thick in all the right places; definitely not fit but not big at all. Like has anyone looked at a female and thought ""She looks ""juicy""? Like that, juicy thicc, all over with thighs I'm craving to be suffocated with. 

I'm honestly salivating from the thought haha
(I'm 22, Black, 6', with a more fit dad bod to athletic build, and dark aesthetic)

Interaction one: A couple of days ago I finally worked up the nerve to confess attraction to her by simply saying that I found her beautiful then asking for her number (maintaining contact with these milk chocolate eyes the entire time. I had came with a plan of what to say, not a lot, but enough to make her smile while building up to asking for her digits. Nephew was out of her sight and there was no one around us. I was late picking him up). After slight hesitation, she said no. Followed by pause and glancing away. Then stammering while trying to meet my gaze again, saying ""That wouldn't be appropriate"". Now thinking that there might be a chance and this is a form of hard to get because I understand she's a teacher, I retorted ""Aww, okay"" in a tone that said ""oh, I've gotcha. Let's play"" (normally that would have been the end of that but I don't have the best experience with girls my age and at least get better play from more mature women). Complete with a raised eyebrow and a friendly smile (probably the classic A-hole smirk though. I don't think I'm an asshole but it's a thing I naturally do). I wished her a good afternoon and my Nephew and I walked away.

Interaction two: Today, 2 days later, while picking up the kid; as I approached her classroom, I fixed my hair, and notice that this is the ONLY moment she looked at me. To call my  Nephew to the door. Part 2 (I dressed in the classic outfit of a plain white T, black jeans, and some Chuck's. Fresh out of the shower, cologne, the whole nine haha). I took the clipboard from her to sign him out and she wouldn't (couldn't? Idk) say hello or eye contact with me, just continues to look inside of the room. She says something about my Nephew forgetting something (I barely hear it, trying to see her eyes, then snap back to reality) and ask ""Wait, what happened?"". She doesn't say anything still looks inside the room. I notice it and say ""...Alright"" and sign. She only looks down at the clipboard to take it, I greet Nephew with a hug then the kid and I leave.

I don’t know who is right and I don’t know what I should do. It doesn’t feel worth it to continue on. I quit easily, I know that. But that’s usually because I’m scared of failing.

But I'm not in their age group or at all acquainted with them to feel competitive. I have never seen them before, or even so much as glanced even once to indicate that I've ever taken notice of them? My really commonplace attire of unassuming colors are ""unsuitable"" for me, and better to be worn on others so I should stop being fancy (it's just a coat of simple design to keep warm). The classes I have in college are regarded as basic/ridiculous just because they don't have them in hs. They try to have loud scripted conversations of the school life they find cool, or use vague lines they want me to somehow know to attribute to me. Their heavy stares physically unnerve my sister.
It's the same for my university, for every class and new semester. People who aren't in my class and have never been aren't exempted. If I sneeze, if I lower a chair to my height, or trip, I'm accused of feigning cuteness for them. Girls and boys alike would suspect that I have an interest in them (even if they're already dating someone) if I turn, like only once, to meet the gaze of someone that I've been insistently feeling pressing at my back. This they use to laugh at my expense. They would watch me in my seat during lecture, then as they walk out of class with expectation that there would be some stalker reaction from me, or that I'm following them (we're in same class being led by the professor to the library for the same lecture and I was even in front of them, not behind...)
I'm told off for being mean by random hallway eavesdroppers who misinterpret to their whim conversations they have absolutely no context to, and have no involvement in. And I am eavesdropped everywhere I go. When they obviously can't parse an understanding of what I'm talking about with someone  because I'm being quiet and speaking of what only we know, they get angry and curse at me to each other about being stupid, weird and incomprehensible. I thought that if I whispered at a volume quieter than I already used, they would stop making comments as if they were a part of my conversations but when I do, they strain harder to listen, then take it upon themselves to be offended under their assured assumption that everything said is about them, or intended for them. My jokes are theirs to laugh at, and my (non-frequent) complaints of bad writing are interpreted to be directed passive aggressively at them. As if it makes sense that a Mary Sue with the most exaggerated, clearly fictitious characteristics applies to them. They must think I speak in code? Even walking faster than them in the hallway becomes perceived as a defiant statement against them? Some of them are encouraging each other to try to start a conflict with me.
How do I escape them? Should I not speak at all? But they still watch me and comment even when I do nothing. Is it wrong to have an unattractive appearance that makes every stranger think they have permission to do this in front of me? Is it me that makes them turn so nonsensical?",28Mar2019,1

I'm quite young and have depression, I'm currently on medication but it isnt helping, at all. I'm not gonna go into detail with my age and stuff, the most I can say is that I'm young enough that I hardly understand why I'm constantly so upset and crap, I dont really understand what's happening.

So, a year or two ago is when this all started, I was just constantly upset or much more sensitive then usual, and felt very.. useless, and like my friends hated me and all that jazz. Everything has just been going downhill so far, I've had to leave school for the day multiple times because I couldnt handle my emotions. I know its serious and extremely bad but at this point i has resorted to self harm. In an odd way, it makes me feel better, but also makes me feel a lot worse. So I know I cant keep dealing with stuff like this.

My life is good, I have everything I could possibly want... Yet I'm constantly upset and struggling to function properly as a normal human being. I feel selfish, I have a good life and yet I'm still like this. There are people who have suffered a lot who are doing better than me, and that makes me feel even worse.

I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but less than a year ago one of my friends was sexually assaulted twice by her stepdad. She told all of her friends about it and began cutting herself.. But she wasnt trying to hide it or anything, she was purposely looking for attention and shoving all these cuts in peoples faces like they needed to see them. One person I talked to about this said that my friend may have passed on some of the trauma by sharing all that with me, which I find kind of hard to believe.. Another person said she was seeking all that attention for a reason other than being an attention thirsty gurl. They said that she probably felt like she needed the attention so she wouldnt be left behind, hurt, and abandoned again. Which is kind of reasonable, I guess?

I really dont know, I just needed to get all of this out somewhere.. I still feel really bad, because some people are going through so much here and then just.. Me. Some depressed kid who has no reason to be sad all.",28Mar2019,1

Ill put a TLDR @ the bottom.

I know that this isn't that serious compared to things on here but I just need a little help. I'm currently a junior in high school and I met this girl back in freshman year in my algebra class. I never talked to her and she never talked to me until sophomore year she and I had the same English and Geometry class.

I personally am not very out going, nor do I like physical contact, and after only talking to this girl for a few months, she would constantly run at me in the halls in between classes and essentially started pummeling my bag. (I don't know if she thinks this is funny or anything but it gets real annoying, and is still happening.)

Around this time she started to hit puberty, and it soon became apparent (and still is) that she doesn't understand the social norm of using deoderant. She also seemed to try and get more and more physically close to me, and eventually asked if I would interested in becoming her bf. I declined as I personally was not interested in her physically or mentally. All I told her though was I simply wasn't interested in dating anyone as I just wanted to get through school.

She seemed to back off a bit, and the school year ended. At the start of junior year (this year) I had to join a new friend group as most of my friends from last year had graduated. This led me to group whom I consider to be some of my closest friends. The girl unfortunately was a friend of on of the group members girlfriend, and has now latched back on to me just as she did last year, and also seems to be trying to get close to me again.

If I actually had any self confidence I would normally tell her she isn't very likable in the way she treats me, and that as a friend I don't enjoy her company. The problem is she is really sensitive, to the point that today she had an anxiety attack due to being insulted by someone who she started drama with. Many of the people in my friend group also feel similar to me in that the girl is not someone we want to be around.

What I'm getting at is does anyone know a way I can tell her I am not interested in her as a friend or as anything closer, without possibly causing problems?

TLDR; Sensitive girl follows me around for about 3 years despite me rejecting her advances and has made school just a bit more difficult than needed.

167,"Hello all! 
This is much longer than I meant it to be, sorry about that! TLDR at the bottom. 


So, my fiancé has been friends with this girl since we were in high school. (We went to the same HS, but had different classes, so we didn’t know each other then) 

They’ve remained friends throughout our 7 year relationship and I’ve always been fine with it! 
He has gone to her house without me and he helps her with her car and all that stuff. 

Anyways, I’ve tried to be her friend a couple of times. I’ve reached out and invited her over and all that, but she just doesn’t seem interested. Again, fine. If she doesn’t want to be my friend, that’s okay, even if it does sting a bit. 

This past year she got pregnant and had a baby with a real piece of crap person. Emotionally, mentally, physically abusive. Never cared about the baby, never helps. 

I gave her all of my sons old baby stuff. I offered to go with her to or drive her to her appointments or whatever she needs. (She has an disabled and unsupportive family and a crappy baby’s father) 

She seemed like she had no interest but then would text my fiancé and be completely different to him. Like she was trying to be my friend and she’s lonely and I was the one who was being disinterested. 

I chalked it up to us just being different people. Just not compatible. I’m still fine with my fiancé being friends with her. 

Then she starts asking for a lot of favors that required my fiancé to go to her house. Or she would just ask him to come over. And okay, she’s kind of on her own and she’s going through a hard time but my fiancé works A LOT and I don’t get to see him a lot as it is. So I do get jealous when he goes over there. 

Kind of out of the blue one day she asked to come over to my house and when she’s gets there she asks me to help her with her baby shower. Which I did. 
I did some painting and all the decorating for her and she did invite me to the shower. 
But right after the baby shower, she’s back to her usual. 

I felt kind of used. 

We didn’t talk again until she had her baby (prematurely) and my fiancé and I went to see her in the hospital. (Which we came to in separate cars because she needed my fiancé to drive her car to the hospital since she was taken there by ambulance) 

We brought her some supplies since she would be there for a while.

She took us to the NICU to see the baby and we stayed and talked for a while. She seemed really nice and happy to see both of us. 

The next time we talk, a few weeks later, she needs help finding a place to stay near the hospital. I help her then again she just disappears. 

I don’t hear anything for about three months and she calls me crying. Saying she needs help with the baby and that she hasn’t slept and all that. So I went and took care of the baby. 

I feel like she’s just going to disappear again. 

My sister in law thinks I should just stop all contact and make my fiancé stop contact too. (Which I would never do, he can be friends with whoever he wants) 

So, anyways, am I being used? Should I keep trying to be friends with her since she and my fiancé are so close? Should I just keep being her friend when it’s convenient for her? 


TLDR My fiancés friend only seems to talk to me when she needs things. And seems only interested in my fiancé. ",28Mar2019,3
168,"Warning for pedophilia and suicide mentions

For background when I was 13 I was on this fanfiction website and ended up meeting this older guy who said he was 18, but was really 25-ish, who convinced me to be his “internet girlfriend.” This was right after I had one friend kill themself and soon after, while I was “with” him, I had another friend commit suicide. This put me in a very vulnerable state and he took advantage of this to emotionally manipulate me into this horrible “relationship” for about 2 years where he’d emotionally manipulate me by threatening to kill himself so I’d stay with him. He had me send him pictures of myself and he’d send me extremely sexual and inappropriate things to say to a child and he’d insist I sext him back. Overall a horrible situation and I’m glad I was able to break out of there with the help of some other internet friends, just in time too because he was planning on trying to visit me irl. 

For the longest time I kind of blocked out most of the memories of this happening, you know how your brain sometimes blocks it trauma. Only recently have I really been able remember and look back on that whole mess and start to process it all and it sucks so much. I hate having random memories of what he said to me and what he had me say back just pop up out of nowhere, it makes me almost wish I could’ve stayed not remembering it at all. But I guess it is better that I’m finally in a safe place to process it all and be able to move forward.

Now at present day I’m 18 and I’ve made a great group of friends that I mostly play dnd and go dancing with, however they do sometimes make jokes having to do with pedophilia and I want to find a way to tell them to stop. For a while I’ve just kinda laughed along because it’s been easier to just act like it’s all funny rather than “getting into all that,” but now that I’m really processing all this I want to have that conversation and ask them to stop. The jokes they make/tone they use insinuate that they clearly know that pedophilia is bad and that they don’t condone it but it doesn’t stop them from making the jokes. I really only see them when we have dnd or go dancing or occasionally go see a movie or something like that, and I’m worried about us being out and having fun and then I ruin the mood by bringing up my trauma. 

There’s one guy that I hang out with a bit more often than the others since he gives me rides sometimes and we sometimes just chill by ourselves, and I plan on approaching him first. He tends to instigate the joking a lot but I trust him and I know have enough respect for him to have this conversation with him, but I have no idea where to start. I’m more worried about approaching the rest of the group because there would be fewer opportunities to talk to them all about it and this really isn’t something I want to explain through text.

Now these are all overall really good friends I feel I can trust them to really be mature and respectful enough to take my trauma seriously, and I can see these jokes simply come from a place of pure ignorance. I definitely want to continue being friends with them but I feel this is a conversation that needs to happen, I just don’t know how to approach it.

Would definitely appreciate some insight!! I’m relatively new to reddit so I don’t anticipate a lot of responses but I would be indescribably grateful to anyone who does respond!! Thank you",28Mar2019,1

He also mentions “if you are not fully on board, missing in action, or any other excuse, you fail the project AND course.

I am a freshmen in college, finishing my spring semester and I have never felt depressed before. I have not had the easiest life, I was often bullied in school, my mom had breast cancer, lost an uncle early due to alcoholism, etc. However somehow I have always gotten past that. Now for some reason when my life is at my ""best"" it feels like it is at its worst. I have plenty of friends in college and haven't experienced any homesickness and am in a fraternity with a lot of cool, nice guys. That said after christmas break I found out my parents were getting divorced and we had to move from my childhood home. This wasn't that difficult for me except I came to realize I have no ""home"" anymore.  I have only lived in one house for my entire life and it has always been a safe zone for me. My family was the only thing that got me through the tough times I had growing up. Me and my siblings lived in that house for 20 years, created memories and honestly it just was my childhood. Now it is gone, and I can't get it back. On top of that I have no where to go anymore, and I feel like I won't have a place to create new memories. My sister is older and living in chicago now and my brother is graduating from college and moving to atlanta soon. Which means now the family I used to have, is completely broken, with 4 different homes and no ""central location"".

Again I apologize this is going all over the place but loosing my home isn't even the worst pain I'm feeling. I suddenly feel like all my friends in college hate me and I don't know why, I just am a fuck up and I feel like I did something or said something while I was drunk and I'm too nervous to ask.

Over time my guy friends and her girl friends became really great friends and made our own friend group. And this girl is really beautiful, like really really fucking hot. Which causes a lot of attention to be put on her at parties and what not, but I really like her for who she is and how kind and perfect she is. I literally have never had feelings so hard for someone before in my life, and I can't even imagine liking someone more than I like her. But i'm ugly and just a fuck up so of course I will never get a chance to date her. For some dumb ass reason I actually thought I had a chance recently because of how much attention she put on me, but I clearly was wrong. I never said anything to her about my feelings but now something feels off. She doesn't seem to pay as much attention to me and doesn't seem to want to talk to me at all. She isn't mean to me but its almost like she feels uncomfortable around me which is just crushing my soul and heart right now. Honestly the only thing I really want is to be friends but I don't even think thats an option now because of my luck. 

I just want to do good in this world and this most important thing for me is to make people happy, but it seems like all I do is fuck up and piss people off. Growing up I was so kind, and looking back I am proud of who I was, treating all fairly, not caring about myself but others, just trying to do good.

&amp;#x200B;

My current situation is that my parent's want to see my grades. However, obviously, I don't want that to happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my very first year at a state college. I got my associates degree at a community college. I was expecting the difficulty of the classes to increase, I was still caught off guard by the shift of a new town, a new college, living on my own, and of course, the difficulty of my classes. 

I had always struggled in school, ever since back in high-school. I didn't know it then, but I had undiagnosed depression and AD/HD, and am now medicated. Unfortunately, I found this out midway through my first semester in college, after I had failed the majority of my classes. I was foolish to think that I was fine, but it was a paradigm I had to break to move forward.  

No argument, I fucked up. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I fucked up again, and even though I actually tried. I felt fired up, medicated for my depression and AD/HD, went to tutoring, and studied for hours on end. I'm not saying that like, ""i studied i swear"", I actually took the time out of my day to slave over the material I needed to learn. But I couldn't make the C I needed to continue with the program, meaning I had to retake it if I wanted to continue with my chemistry degree.

""If you fail this test, you'll fail the class, then you'll have to tell your parents, ""hey yall, look at your dumbass kid failing the class again, yeepee, give me more money!!!!""

&amp;#x200B;

So this is the situation, I convinced my parents that I ""wanted to catch up to make up for my mistakes last semester"". But in reality, it was a lie I told them to let me stay the summer in school, and I could dedicate my time to that class, so I can just knock it out of the way. But they said, ""under the condition that we can see your grades in school, starting tomorrow, if not, we won't do it."" They caught my bluff, I'm screwed, and I don't know what to tell them or how to get out of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to explain to them how depression and AD/HD affects my schoolwork, but they don't seem to understand. What can I do? I have to drop the class by tomorrow or I'll be stuck with a failing grade on my record, it seems like a check mate on my end.

&amp;#x200B;

(TL;DR)

Failed class last semester, tried again, failed again, I don't know how to tell parents, I want to stay for the summer and knock it out of the way. But I feel terrible, because I feel like a drainage on their generosity, what can I do?

I'm never allowed happiness, she was amazing, funny, sweet, caring, sexy af, and full of life. I met her around mid November of 17 off ok cupid all because she had a picture of her with stan lee. Which I did too she was beautiful. And we had a high match rate so I messaged her we talked alot. We finally met about a week later. I fell in love with her on day one. I even told her I wanted to marry her.  She said she wouldnt be romantically interested in me. Which stung but something told me i couldnt let her go. We went on a lot of ""dates"" she for some reason I could never understand got stood up alot. She wasnt easy and she had big boobs so guys would flock to her. Fast forward a bit we hung out 3 to 4 times a week over the course of the next few months till around September she needed a job so I got her one with me. I worked at a pawnshop and it's easy work and good pay. I started to see her every day. It got a little annoying after a bit but then I got used to it. I would tell her every day I loved her. Well she insisted on keeping her other job as a delivery driver. And well in December coming back from her last delivery she got hit died at the scene. I got the call the next day. My heart has been broken ever since. Some of my friends told me to get over it cause she wouldnt have been this upset if I was the one who died. I have since cut them out of my life.

I left the deposit for her under her name and she turned in her application but she never showed up to sign the lease or move into the apartment.

188,"I volunteer for an organization similar to the Boys and Girls club. Basically, a mentor is matched with a troubled child to try to be a role model, and attempt to guide them through their situation so that they can be a responsible adult.

I was matched with a 14 year (we'll call him D) last December. Backstory I was given before we were matched was that he had a mentor but they were separated for some reason. I think there was an argument with his mother or something. Since then, he'd been waiting 3 years for a mentor because people simply refused to take him in.

We set up a first meeting and I drove to his house with my volunteer supervisor. The place was disgusting. Roaches ran freely throughout the walls, it stank of cat and dog piss, dishes and clothes were visibly piled up, ect. His mother was supposed to show up for this meeting but did not. D himself was overweight and I deduced that he had some mental issues after talking to him. However, I wanted to help this kid get out of this house and become a success.

I didn't realize what an undertaking that would be. The kid is a compulsive liar. Often times making outlandish stories about his teachers and parents, claiming they all beat and harass him for no reason. I did some digging at the school and asked about prior history, and discovered this was not true. On top of it all the boys hygiene is awful, he wears the same clothes everyday and I'm convinced doesn't bathe. But I was still wanted to help.

This all comes to a head when one day he messages me that his mom is beating him. Being familiar with his lies, I drive over there and find that once again he is lying. I discover this isn't the first time he's told a mentor this, and that the last one was separated due to coming and automatically going into papa bear fight mode.

D tried to stay in contact with his former mentor, but the Adult was angry D would lie about something so serious and cut him out. Afterwards D began spinning tales that mentor had abused him. I'm scared for my future and the future of others. This kid is too far gone and too much of a liability for society at large. I want to see him locked up, forever if possible. Idk if that makes me a bad person, but it's true. Maybe I'm over reacting idk. 

TL;DR: Compulsive lying and mentally unstable 14 year old made serious accusations about one of my peers, his mother, his teachers, and could now lie about me. What should I do?

192,"I'm 14F and I posted on r/MakeNewFriendsHere and this 22M messaged me introducing himself asking why I deleted my post and what not. Then he started asking inappropriate questions such as ""Do you have a boyfriend?"" ""Are you smart?"" ""Do you have a big ass or tits?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

My dumbass let is slide and he started telling me how he's down to be in a relationship with me regardless of how young I am, his fantasy with BDSM and DDLG, his ""relationship"" with a 15YO girl from a year ago and how they were sexual online but not in real life, things like that but you get the idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, he tried getting me to send nudes and at most I sent selfies, a picture of my stomach lying down NOT displaying my face, mirror selfie with clothes on and my shirt was a little lifted so you could see my ass but I blocked out my face. 

&amp;#x200B;

He tried getting information out of me such as my number, school, city and etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't give him my number or school but the city that I live in and we should call it AX. AX is a really big city filled with lots of schools and people. 

&amp;#x200B;

**He asked for a selfie and I had sent him a selfie of me in the car smiling because I sent it to my friend (H) and I never mentioned that I sent it to someone else besides him and he asked who else I sent it to. He just somehow knew I sent it to someone else.** 

&amp;#x200B;

After 2 days, I realized how messed up it was and left. Deleted Reddit. Deleted Discord. 

Over the course of months, I made new accounts and he constantly found them and messaged me introducing himself but I randomized everything but I NEVER EVER told him it was me. We'd talk for a bit and he always asked for a picture of ""me"" for ""verification"" but I couldn't send him a picture because I couldn't reveal how it was me. I never said , ""Oh, it's (inserts my name)"" and he never said ""I know it's you (inserts my name)"" so I don't know for sure if he knew it was me or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I posted something on r/selfie and he for sure knew it was me because it was my face. Anyways, he messaged me asking how many accounts I made and I was suspicious because I never told him I had several accounts over the course of us not associating with each other. He wanted to be ""flirty friends"" and no nudes but teasing. He also stated how he had a girlfriend whose 24F. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, we exchanged snapchats and he kept asking for nudes but at the start he said no nudes. He said we couldn't be anything more than friends but wanted to meet up and conduct sexual activity. I kept bluffing and making excuses. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Before I mention this, yes, I know it's fucked up but live in learn so that's that.  Don't bring on negative comments because I already know it myself.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**I sent one nude of my chest area NOT SHOWING MY FACE, mirror selfie with a towel wrapped around me and he took a screenshot, and selfies. That's it. Nothing more.** 

&amp;#x200B;

He kept wanting more nudes and I told him he could leave if he wanted so he removed me and I reported it to the local police. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a strange call and didn't answer and they left a voice mail for 2 seconds not saying anything so my mother called that number and an automated voice said ""sorry, but the number you have dialed is incorrect, please try again."" 

I'm just really spooked because I know he's out there.

Then for the rest of the day I am on my phone and I barely interact with my parents and brother, even when im out with family im on my phone the majority of the time. I only take breaks when im making something to eat (even then im still on my phone, im even on it while eating watching netflix) or if im sleeping. If I’m not on my phone im on my ipad and if im not on my ipad im on the computer, i literally cant go a day without my phone even if I go 30 min without it i go through withdrawals. I try stay off my phone but I cant its just so hard this has been a problem probably since I was probably 12. Even if I cant find anything to do on my phone i just scroll back and forth on the homescreen until i think of something to do. I usually watch youtube videos all day, browse memes on instagram, browse reddit, play games on my phone, anything to pass the time. Im starting to think this might be the reason to alot of my problems ive had in the past like social anxiety/awkwardness, meeting new people, getting friends, etc. My life is literally my phone and im sure if anyone gives me advice im just gonna read it agree and forget about whatever advice was given to me and stay addicted to my phone until i die...

196,"So, a little bit of background. All of my previous work experience has been in daycare/teaching. I’ve never been responsible for handling money before. I just started a new job about two weeks ago. When I originally applied, it was for a position working with kids. After they hired me, they asked if I would work as a cashier in the cafe (since I’m over 21, I can serve alcohol). I said sure, I’d try it. And, for the most part, I’d been doing well. Then, last Tuesday, my register came up short $1.03. I was shocked, as I’d always been dead on or a few cents over due to customers not wanting change. I got written up for that and told myself I’d be super careful from then on. My next shift, my register was $4.91 short! I have no idea how it happened and I was devastated. I even offered to pay the difference myself, but they said I couldn’t and I got written up for the second day in a row. I’m now terrified to go back and mess up again. I feel awful and so guilty, even though I know I’ve been trying my best. Before this even happened, I’d been asking them to move me to a different position, but they’ve been insisting on giving me these shifts so I can serve alcohol. I like the company and my coworkers a lot. I don’t want to lose this job, but my confidence has been destroyed over the past two days. I know I’m a competent person and that I have a lot of other strengths to bring to the table. I’m just not cut out to be a cashier, apparently. I feel like a failure and now I’m at a loss.

202,"I received a death threat on Instagram earlier this evening. I don’t want to let something like this slide Incase something really does happen. 
Details: 
-This person used a fake account with zero followers/followings. They had a red and black profile picture and actually gained one follower by the time our conversation was over. I messaged their follower to see if they knew who exactly this person was. (No answer) 
-the person immediately deleted their account after making these threats. 
-this person mentioned the state I lived in, that my father served in the military, and they also talked about my siblings, and my mother. The only thing they didn’t mention was the fact that I haven’t seen my mother since I was little. 
-I also should mention, this person spoke German and English. The majority of the messages were in German though. They also said that I might remember them when they come to where I live. They said, “I’ll be there soon.” The first thing they said to me was, “Ich werde dich schlagen, bis Du stirbst.” Which translates to, “ I will beat you until you die.” They talked about how they’ve hated me and my family for years. 
-I have direct screenshots of our chats, before and after they deleted their account. 

My question is: what do I do? They did not mention the exact location I live in. when I asked they said, “It does not matter where. I’ll find you no matter where you want to hide.” They said my dad was in the military, but I dunno if that was just a lucky guess or a coincidence. I’m unsure whether to go to the police or not. What will they be able to do? 
Here are are the exact words from our conversation: (translated to English, I’ve abbreviated their username to 666. Their username had that in it.)

666: I will beat you until you die. (Said in German-I had to use a translator.) 

Me: you will beat me until I die? (I was trying to make sure I translated correctly.) 

666: yes, yes

Me: why? 

666: Because I do not like you

Me: what did I do to you? 

666: there are many reasons. You will pay for your crimes. 

Me: Do I even know you? 

666: you may remember me when I am there.

Me: okay then, where am I? 

666: [my state] 

Me: where exactly? 

666: It does not matter where. I’ll find you no matter where you want to hide. Your father too. He will suffer much more than you will I promise you that. 

Me: what did my father do to you? What did I do? 

666: he is the enemy. You are 

Me: how am I specifically the enemy? 

666: You’ll be wrong. This has been a growing hate over years.

Me: I don’t even know you

666: your people killed my family 

Me: you have the wrong person 

666: your father is a soldier, is he not? [my father WAS, he is not currently serving.]

Me: I don’t know you 

666: to get an enemy, you have to take what you love. That’s you and your siblings. Your mother. 

Me: I didn’t do anything to you 

666: I suggest you give her [my mother] one last call. I’ll be there soon. Tell your father I say hello. And goodbye.

i don’t know too much about red pill, but i’ve heard a lot of different sides, i see some sides of the media calling it a cult of sexism where men think woman control all, and i’ve seen the experience my fathers had with it and how it’s fixed his marriage.

about a year ago my life was in shambles, my mother had just moved out and my father was a complete mess , let me say by the way, that my days a great person and is really clean, he’s never laid a hand on any of us and is never abusive, he’s really clean.

in september my dad started reading a bunch of books like the rational male and reading r/thereddpill on reddit and it seemed like an awakening to him, he’s a ton more masculine and happier now and my mom likes him a ton more and moved back in.

He and I completely stopped the entire charade back in December and have had barely any contact since. I try to contact him, but I don't have much luck with it. I do love him despite all things considered. I have realized *so much* since we fell out in December, and I feel guilty about a lot of things because of this. Due to all of the realizations, I have been having a hard time ""moving on.""

He and I have always struggled with making things clear when we take ""space"" and this is why I have been trying to reach out to him. I get no substance-filled response, though. I understand that he and I still need space but the fact that our last real conversation was a ""okay, this is it- we have to leave each other alone"" type of deal is extremely frustrating and full of the grey area for me. I reach out in an effort to get things off of my chest that will be freeing for me and to establish the status of his emotions and any plans that are set. Does he want to completely leave it alone? Is he completely over me? He is the type of person that will keep his emotions to himself for the sake of having them to himself, so that is partly why I am still trying to reach out to him. Last time we broke up, he broke up with me and told me all these negative things about me (which made me feel like it was over, for good), but then he came back a few months later saying that he really just wanted space and he missed me and thought about me everyday. I mean, I understand that I don't necessarily **need** to know his emotions but how am I supposed to *force* myself to move on 100% when I am unsure of how he feels? If I am going to force myself to do something I don't want to do, I  will a**bsolutely refuse** to back track that when/if he returns just because he ""didn't want to show \[his\] emotions"" at the time. I am beginning to approach my breaking point, though. I have grown a lot and realized the mistakes I made in the young-minded relationship we had, and if he doesn't want to hear me out, I can't force him... but at the same exact time, I just think the ""but what if....."" scenarios. It's a confusing time, haha, but I am learning to live my life and ignore it for the most part.

Anyway, some of my coworkers at my job have been trying to hook me up with some guys and I usually just jokingly talk about it and then tell them I can't. I have talked about my ex before (not in detail- just that it's hard to move on fully) and they understand my predicament with him and respect it for the most part, but they keep telling me that meeting someone new will ""help with the healing."" I am hesitant with looking into other guys because I do think about my ex a lot, but I teeter-totter a lot between ""just move on and try a date and see how it goes"" and ""hm, I don't know, maybe not."" Today they mentioned to me that someone in my job is ""interested"" in me and they were wondering if I would go out with him and a bunch of other people in two weeks. It's a real casual ""get to know each other thing"" I guess and they even told me to bring other friends if I want to. They didn't place any pressure on me about it and said that if I feel uncomfortable then that's okay. They seemed really excited about it and were really adamant that this new guy and I would hit it off, so I told them I would see if I could go. I like my coworkers, too, so I figured it would also be fun to hang with them outside of work for the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to add that I have spent the time apart from my ex growing and coming to realizations about myself and others and just how I move through life. A lot has changed and despite some struggles, I am happy that he and I finally put our feet down and let go of each other for the time being (or for good???? who knows). 

&amp;#x200B;

To sum all of this up, I am wondering what you all think about the entire situation and me trying to move on. Good/bad idea to go out in 2 weeks with people and ""interested"" guy? Ways to contact my ex and lay my thoughts out completely? Will I ever move on (ughhhhhhh)???? Help meeeeeeeee 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Been having a hard time getting over an ex that I absolutely love to pieces despite all of our hardships. He is really confusing, so I am mainly against moving on. I really want to work things out and what not but he doesn't entertain any of my questions/requests (not sure if this is because he straight up doesn't want to talk or he is trying to give ""space,"" though). Coworkers are slightly aware of situation but want me to try and ""get out there."" Some guy is ""interested"" in me and they were all wondering if I would be free to hang out casually with new guy and all of coworkers in about 2 weeks. What should I do? Go out or no? Will ex ever hear me out? Should I ""wait"" for him? What's the dealio. ",28Mar2019,1

209,"I interviewed for a Global Director position this mid-month, where I was sure I would get the job since I had exactly all the experiences they were seeking. This Monday a former coworker (same title level as me) who was fired from our department at the beginning of March due to poor performances texted me that she got a job offer for a Global Director position. I immediately contacted the HR department at the hiring company to see if they had extended an offer.  Instead of confirming to my email, HR wanted to set up time to catch up today. I thought this was super different since other HR has never done this before. On the call HR was shocked I guess the name of the girl who got the job.  HR then told me that I was a very close second but lost out to ex-coworker since she had slightly more technical skill. Since we used to work together and I used to advise ex-coworker on her projects I know for certain she never had any experience in at least 50-75% of the list requirements. Additionally at my current job, both of my managers like me because I am able to lead teams and deliver on projects. I have a pending Director promotion at work but it’s taken some time thus why I started to job search.  I don’t tell HR all of this but I let her know I’m friendly with ex-coworker and I wish them luck. HR ends the call by telling me that I’ve been super easy to work with and that she wishes to stay in contact for other opportunities and for me to take a look at their website and reach out to her about them as well. Needless to say I’m extremely confused, frustrated, and disappointed that I lost out on this opportunity to someone way less qualified than me. I am also awarded that saying this out-loud May make me sound like a dick. However to put it in perspective:

Ex-worker: had 1 direct report and one client. Had two person who asked to transfer off her team. Comes in late and leaves early. Nice girl but definitely not ambitious.

Me: multiple direct report w multiple clients. Work 50-60 hour weeks. Have other department mates ask to transfer to my team. Well liked by managers and team and super ambitious.

Advice: knowingly fully well that ex-coworker is unqualified for the job and there is a chance she will fail and get fired again and that this company might be holding me as their backup, do you think I should reconsider the offer when it happens?  Additionally I still don’t understand why HR spent so much time locking me down for a phone call to tell me that they hired someone else and I would like to hear your feedback on similar experience and results. What is the best way to deal?

TLDR: Lost a job opportunity against ex-coworker who is way less experienced ",28Mar2019,1

220,"Hi all, 


I got angry with my friend a few weeks ago and we haven't spoken since. I'm wondering if it's time to  ""break up"" with her. 


I won't go too much into why I got mad. Over the last two weeks of self reflection, I've realized it's not really her actions at that time I am mad at. It's more a pattern of behavior. She can be attention seeking, insecure, and naive. She loves male attention and validation and fishes for complements. I've noticed that we have a weird competition thing going on where we subtly try to see who's smarter or funnier or better. She can also be draining, as she obsesses about things and wants to talk a lot about them. 


On the other side, we have had a lot of fun together and she's been there for me when I needed it. I enjoy her company. I also don't have many frienda as I've recently moved to this town. 


So - how do you know when it's time to friend break up, and how do you do it? Should I give her another chance? Any advice appreciated. ",28Mar2019,1
221,"Hello, everyone! I am having a situation that consistently causes me anxiety. Am I just making a mountain out of a molehill here? 

So, I am super close with my in-laws. They’re family to me. I am close with my own parents as well. My in-laws and parents aren’t super close, in fact, I get the vibe that my in-laws aren’t crazy about my parents. My parents can be a little odd, but they’re good people. Of course, my in-laws are always very kind to them, but as someone who knows both parties very personally, it seems a little forced. 

Anyway, I just had a baby boy. He is the first grandbaby. My mother in law is incredible and spoils him in the best of ways. She buys us diapers, wipes, formula, is taking us on a vacation with her, etc. She is truly amazing. 

My parents buy less but are still involved emotionally and spend plenty of time with him, which is what truly matters. 

I find this odd need to validate my parents’ ability to be good grandparents around my in laws. They’ve never once said anything to insinuate otherwise, so it’s not like they’re being snooty about being able to buy him stuff. But, in my head, I see all they do and it makes me scared they think my parents are...I don’t know, inferior? 

I also worry that my son will have a closer attachment with them and that it will show. Not just because of the “gifts”, but rather the interest in his life. My parents are interested, too, but when he goes to their house, there won’t be the toys for him, Disney movies, etc. What if he notices? 

I would never bring this up to my parents and I personally think they do a great job. My husband’s side of the family is just so over the top with wanting to help provide for him (which we are thankful for). Love and presents are not synonymous. I am just scared that he won’t have as fond of memories with my side of the family, and that kind of hurts me. 

I’ve basically fabricated this whole situation in my head. How can I stop worrying about this dumb, imaginary competition? ",28Mar2019,1
222,"23 F met 25 M organically while out. he works at the location. ended up adding each other on Instagram. didn't think he liked me or was interested at all because of his sarcastic personality (I'm very sarcastic myself but not usually attracted to it) he dm'd me multiple times and I would reply but it was always delayed because I have a busy schedule and a lot of people that wanna dm (old friends and new people) plus juggling a bunch of dating apps is difficult in itself. rocky start. and it's been going on for 1.5 months

also recently found out that his ex died last year, he never talked to me about this so I had no idea until this week.

after him asking to make plans and myself being hungover and forgetting or falling asleep when he was texting me about hanging out, he still was willing to go out.

we grab drinks and I really didn't want him to drive plus I didn't wanna stop hanging out. he bought us a hotel room. amazing night, never had better sex and cuddled/hungout all night. next morning he wants to get food but the weather was bad and I needed to get home. he cleans off my car which was really sweet. I ended up paying for half of the room later that week because I wanted an excuse to reach out and I felt bad.

we end up hanging out 3-4 more times (mostly to smoke and hookup) never asked me to go on a date, would barely text me&amp; our basic form of communication was snap. one of the times we fucked I told him I really liked him after sex and he said he thought I was ""mad cool"" but he doesn't want a relationship rn. I told him I didn't want one either but I didn't wanna fuck around with someone who fucks around especially when he never wanted to use a condom. I even said I would leave and go home but I wasn't good to drive so I was staying. I ended up almost falling asleep and he's CRYING. I reach out to you and touch him and asked if he was ok and he pushes me away gets up and says he doesn't want to talk about it as he leaves the room. left first thing in the morning.

his communication ways were always really confusing to me. and it got more confusing. sometimes he would open my snap and not respond but then snap me hours later or be posting regardless of leaving me on red. started to think he wasn't into me.

ended up hand delivering his cleaned and folded clothes I had borrowed to his work to cut things off. he asked what I was doing with my friends and I was honest that I didnt wanna drive far in rainy weather but it's my friends bday and I was going to get drinks with him and his friends. (my girl ditched) he says I shouldn't go and I ask ""what else am I supposed to do"" end up leaving and even warned him his clothes would get wet if he left them under his car in the bag they were in. no thank you text.

honestly I was pissed by this whole situation but ready to get over it because I'm single and will eventually find someone who gets me. not so easy. went for a drink with my male friend of many years that i have never had feelings for and the only place that was close and fun was where the guy worked. I was so nervous to even go! didn't wanna talk to my friend about it so went anyways. walk in, found a table, had my friend order the drinks. did not make eye contact with the former hookup guy or say hi, did not order one drink myself. I know I sound like a baby but these crazy emotions I have for him make me so nervous. my anxiety has been through the roof because of it lately.

later that night, guess who snaps me? selfie with big text blocking face saying ""LMAO go out on a date and don't even say hi or order a drink hahaha"" I snap chat him and say ""lol you could have said hi"" because at that point I really felt like he should have. I was still annoyed and thinking about he hurt me not how shitty it was of me to not approach him at his work.

next morning, I want to apologise. BLOCKED on all apps. sent a LONG apology message on literally ever network we are connected on (snap, IG, text) no response. hours later I remember we matched on tinder after meeting and decide to make sure he got the message. he had forgotten to block me there! bingo sent the message, checked an hour later and he unmatched me so at least I know he got it.

a couple days ago he texts me and asked if I sent something to his house, I told him no and we kept texting. ended up going over his house, having sex and going to bed. I tried to ask why he blocked me on everything prior to the sex and he wouldn't answer. I really didn't wanna push it anyway because it was late. slept over and left in the morning.

the next night I'm going to a mutual friends for a party and invite him. he doesn't wanna come. I ask him later on if he wants to chill because I was DTF and a little tipsy. he said no it's late and I proceed to text him he ends up saying goodbye and never answer my response.

found out today that he blocked our mutual friend on everything too. 

what do you guys think, is he psycho? I know I am a bit lol but after my ex of 5+ years this is the first person I truly fell for and I want him in my life. I don't know if I come off too strong or random but I need some opinions please!",28Mar2019,1
223,"
This is a throwaway account because some of my family knows my real account, and I don't really want them to know how I really feel about myself. I am sorry if some of this is poorly worded or doesn't make since. It is late where I am at and I am quite emotional at the moment so the grammar and structure of this rant may not be that good. I also posted this same thing three months ago and it still applies.
To give some background, I am a 17 year old male in high school and I live in the United States. People in school consider me to be a funny and weird guy. I am always cracking jokes and trying to make people laugh. Everyone seems to enjoy it and they definitely like it. I also know that they all like me.
This is where my problem lies; I feel like I am just a clown. All I ever do is crack jokes and be weird. I am on a constant quest to make people laugh or smile or whatever and I am growing tired of it. I feel like I am unable to be anything more than a stupid clown. It seems like that 90% of the conversations I have with people are just meant to be weird or funny. I honestly don't feel like a real person half the time. I just feel like I am a prop and that I am just a shell of a person. Sometimes, I find myself being this way and just hating myself every time I open up my stupid mouth.
My humor in no way has affected how I work. I am generally serious when it comes to things like that. I usually focus on the task I need to get done and I am not so much a clown when I do those things.
A couple months back one of my few friends said this after I was a clown again. ""Sometimes I don't know why I hang out with you, then you do stuff like this."" Now, I know this was a compliment. I am grateful for that and I am not saying that it is a bad thing that he said it. However, it got me thinking about who I am. ""Am I just a clown?"" Suddenly, I began to realize that I was almost nothing more that a joke. I had turned myself into a living shitpost.
I do have friends, but I won't say I'm super close to them. I talk to them in school during school related events, but outside of that I rarely have any interaction. I hardly get invited to anything and I don't receive too many texts or snapchats. I feel like I have trouble getting really close to people. I start working my way there, but for some reason I always find myself behind. I go home, do homework, read books, browse the internet, then go to bed. I am always home and never do anything.
I have thought long and hard about why this may be. I think I have an answer; I haven't show them any reason to get closer. First, I hardly initiate texting or snapchatting. The reason why is I am simply very anxious about doing so, and this is probably worth a whole other rant. I think by being a clown all the time, I haven't showed them who I truly am. They don't know who the real 51817 is because I haven't showed them. I've allowed my humor to overshadow every other portion of my personality. A clown is nice but, would one really want to be around him too much?
Hell, I don't even know what I am without my humor. Another one of my friends  said this just two days ago; ""Sometimes I think I know you well, but then you just act like this all the time."" She said this in a kind of humorous way, but it still stun because she's right. I am just a joke; I hardly have a fucking personality outside of being funny and I fucking hate it.
I think one of the main reasons why I am a clown all the time is because I have no self-confidence. I don't trust myself to do anything else than a clown. Over time, I found myself to be a really funny person and I found that was what people really liked about me. So, I made sure I was I always being funny and trying to make people laugh. In a way, I think I was too scared to do anything else than that. This holds true today; I am too afraid to go beyond being a clown. I'm scared that if I try to not be so funny all the time, then people will start to dislike me. They won't find me likable and they just ignore me or hate me. I'm afraid that my funny side is the only good part of my personality. This terrifies me and I don't know what to do.
In the end, I just feel so alone. Here I am just playing a part. I pretend everyday that I am a happy-go-lucky guy when in reality, I fucking hate myself and am lonely as shit. I have felt like this long enough and I really want to work to change myself. Do you guys have any advice? I really don't think I can do this alone.

225,"First I want to say i missed out on most of my youthful years being forced to work. 

When I was around 13 my dad started a lawn business that escalated to tree work, sprinkler system repair, hedge trimming and lawn spraying. It got to the point that, if its in your yard and grew from the ground we'll do it. Around my second year of working towards my associates I had to drop out of full time to working on 2 classes at a time online doing the business and working weekend shifts at a new job I took to pay for classes myself. My mum who had been working full time in any job she could find out of the Navy was trying to help keep bills down. At around this time, my dad pulled a disk starting a chainsaw and was out for a while leaving my brother and I to do all the work. (There were good periods where we had actual employees and money to pay them, but this was early in college)  Then the hospital trips started, dad would have to ride a ambulance every 3 weeks or so for cardiac issues, this lasted for a year and a half. This left my brother and I to take over completely. We would work 7 am to 6-8 pm every day with only around a 30 min lunch.  Last year we got every bill paid down close enough that just selling equipment would cover whats left. We finally closed it. But in all that time, I never got the chance to look for what I  wanted to be. I though since I liked building desktops I would do IT. But coding classes in one semester showed me that I do not have the aptitude or interest to get through that education plan and I would end up having to do a general education course anyway because the community college I went to before this made me take too many classes and I would lose financial aid before I was done. 

This semester I tried to do pre-nursing courses. I'm 2 and a half months in and I cannot see myself in the nursing field. I figured out I was attracted to a fantasy of me being one. Now I'm just concerned that anything I try next is just going to be another instance of this trial and error loop I've found myself in. 

Have any of you found yourself in this position or know of resources i can look to that can help me steer in the direction of a field I may find rewarding?  Like aptitude tests or people that I can talk to that know what to look for in people like me?

231,"I’m 14 years old and not obviously not old enough to occupy my time by driving anywhere so I stick to MTBs mostly. I usually ride down to a trail that’s about a mile from my house with my friends and that trail runs along a canal and by a lake into an abandoned Air Force fuel depot. Everything has been fine down there, we just ride our bikes down the trail and hang out, but never go into the fuel depot at the end since I’ve already gotten in trouble with the police. Lately though, we have been noticing an older guy down their and my friends have seen that he is a homeless guy and lives down in the abandoned fuel depot after Hurricane Michael hit. The homeless guy hasn’t been giving us much grief but a few weeks ago I was riding down their and got into a bad argument with a friend and decided to just turn around and go ride somewhere else before we ruined our friendship. Well, when I was heading back out of the trail, the homeless guy jumped out of the woods and attempted to grab me off of my bike but only grabbed ahold of the bandana around my neck and not my actual neck, allowing me to speed off and escape. After that I called my friend to tell him to get the hell out of dodge but wouldn’t pick up so I called his sister and told her to call him and tell him to get out of the trail. When they came out, my friend called me a liar and saying that I wasn’t chased out. Earlier today though, we were riding down the trail and we stopped for a breather when we heard crunching out in the woods. It wasn’t just crunching of leaves from a squirrel, it was from something much bigger and heavier. We were staying still and quiet when we saw this hooded figure, the same guy who almost grabbed me, charge at us through the woods. Being teenagers we naturally got the hell out of there as fast as we could. Last time, the guy grabbed at me a ran for a second but didn’t continue to chase me. This time however, he kept chasing us until we got to the trail head. I don’t know what to do about this guy, he has tried to chase us many times and left threats written in the sand many times.

233,"Back in 2009, my grandfather bought a dog that he absolutely adored. Unfortunately, in 2016,  my grandfather passed away. With that, he left my mom and her sister (my aunt) his house/everything in it. Of course, this included the dog. This dog has had medical issues including skin infections, being blind in both eyes, and a permanent limp in one of her back legs. Due to this she’s been expensive to take care of and it takes a lot of responsibility to make sure she gets her medicine, baths, etc. The house was split between my mom and aunt 50-50. If my aunt ever sells it, my mom would get half of the proceeds. However, my mom is pretty well off and decided to forfeit her share of the house because she felt like it was the right thing to do. With that being said, it was brought to my attention that my mom was paying for the dogs bills every month (1500 or so Usd). This just blew me away. I don’t believe it’s fair that my mom is stuffing the bills while also standing to gain nothing from the house. I have no issue with my aunt taking 100% of the house but she should definitely pay for the remaining few years of the dogs life. Whenever I mention the unfairness of the situation, my mom degrades me and tells me I should be ashamed of myself because it was my grandfathers dog.

235,"so I'm a 2nd university student and for the last month I've been stuck between two places to live for my 3rd year, I'ts worth noting that because It's fairly late there aren't other options

\- A studio flat on my own

\- A 4 person flat with en-suite rooms and 1 kitchen , also huge building like 20 floors in the city centre

There's 2 of us ( me and my friend )  so If I live in the 4 person flat we'll be with 2 new people no telling who they are other than they'll be students. We also know that all other apartments so 5 bed - 10 bed will be mostly first year students but 4 bed aren't being advertised to first years so chances are they'll be 2nd or 3rd year.

the other thing is that this place isn't built yet but after talking to the people there and it's a large company we are pretty certain it's going to be built.

Anyway so I book this place with my friend knowing I have about 14 days to back out, I'm pretty certain at this point I'll live in the 4 person flat and I tell my friend that. So this is where it goes wrong I tell my gf that I'm going there and she completely disagrees she 100% thinks I should live in a studio. After many talks I'm basically stuck in between these two options. 

skip 14 days 

&amp;#x200B;

now I'm here, I've told my friend I'll do the 4 bed apartment we've both signed everything booking is done. So after putting it off forever I call my gf today ( she's at home atm couple hours away )  and tell her this, she say's she'll leave me if I don't cancel tomorrow the final day the back out of the agreement. So this isn't out of no where I made a list of her reasons for not wanting to live there ...

  1. waiting for people in kitchen to finish so I can cook 

2. If my friend isn’t there it’s just me and 2 random people 

3. What if it’s 2 girls?

4. What if it’s 2 first year students 

5. 3rd year is most crucial year to focus, too much Noise 

6. most people want to go out drinking , I don't drink too much

7. what are the odds of them being nice especially this late in getting accommodation 

8. Doesn’t like friend I’m living with

9. might not be built on time 

10. if studio no one will rob , it’s  easier 

&amp;#x200B;

so she says she's been crying for days thinking that I would say this too her every-time I say it she cries and begs me to get a studio 

So I can either wake up tomorrow out of no where tell my friend I'm backing out or I don't bak out and my gf leaves maybe idk but I know if I don;t back out by 5pm I legally have to pay and live there so what do I do ? , maybe this should be relationship advice geez",28Mar2019,1

So putting the situation out there, he tried to turn our friend group (of about 7 years) against each other, and when we found out we started hanging out with him less. Without going too in-depth about these situations, he basically kept telling lies about people in our friend group either bailing out on us or doing scumbag things to him (like leaving him stranded on the side of a highway at 3 in the morning). It would take a while to explain, but I can always elaborate if requested. 

Basically in that time we tried to take a break from what we felt was toxicity, we learned that he didn't have anyone else. He's very ""quirky"" to say the least, and so he's usually perceived as weird or awkward to a lot of the people he meets or is introduced to. Because of this he has trouble making friends, and is typically ""himself"" when he's with us and no one else. Fast forward a month or so, and he starts posting these tweets and Snapchat stories insinuating suicidal thoughts. At this point we confronted him in an attempt to explain why we were cutting him off. We told him how we knew he was lying and that we were shitty people for avoiding him. We wanted to make things right. We also apologized for ignoring some of his calls and texts, and tried to make up. Right after that he goes to a cliff and posts a Snapchat along the lines of ""I'm tired of this"" looking out at the cliff.

At this point I was kind of urked by this (since he was hiding things even though we were constantly asking about how he felt), but at the same time he needed help so I was gonna be there for him. Following this meeting, my friends were kind of tired of him since they tried to squash the beef and he was posting these things, but I felt it was still very soon for him to go back to his 'normal' self so I gave him time. Fast forward a month of checking up on him and his tweets get increasingly worse. ""I wanna end it all, I can't live anymore, If nothing changes then goodbye"". 

I finally take him out to eat one day for a one on one talk, and he breaks down. He talks about how he's lonely, how he just wants to hang out with the guys, and how he's so tired of being alone. This really made me sad, and lately I've been trying my best to help him out and talk to him online, play video games with him, hangout with him more often, and I'm being as patient as possible because I feel very empathetic/sympathetic toward his situation.

Today we hung out (as a friend group) and encouraged all my friends to try to break the ice because he was still very distant. The whole day though, he was silent. One word responses, always leaving the restaurant to go outside, always teary eyed, and never making eye contact. He sat away from our group, and we constantly invited him over to sit with us. After we all returned home, he posts on twitter that he wants to kill himself. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. My friends are just about ready to give up, but I feel like the guilt of letting a friend alone is such a dark time would never stick right with me if something does happen. If anyone has thought or advice I would love to hear it. Thanks so much if you made it this far.

tl;dr - Friend is suicidal. Friend group is trying our best to make up with him. Friend posts suicidal tweets and Snapchats. Rejects our advances at trying to talk (including about how he's feeling).

I was straight forward and told one girl (I have gone on one prior date with this girl) that I would be available later around 10/11pm. She was totally cool with it. I went on a date with the other one and told her I had to cut it early. She was cool with that also.

My parents have always had a little thing against him for some reason even though all he has done is treat me the way I deserve to be treated. 

So... why am I asking for advice. basically, my mum and I were walking to school this morning and I was carrying my boyfriends jacket, so I could give it back to him during the day. As we were walking I moved the jacket and a lighter fell out. I was as confused as my mum was and she asked me “does (boyfriends name) smoke?” and i said “not to my knowledge but i certainly hope not.” i have nothing against drugs but my family is heavily against them which I will respect as I still live under the same roof as them. The idea of a future partner of mine smoking would so deeply upset my parents as they’d fear for my wellbeing, rightfully so. however, my boyfriend does NOT smoke and he reassures me that he is not tempted to while we are dating. my parents both know this but for some reason now, i feel like mum and dad won’t believe me when i say “the lighter isn’t his.” 

is there anything i can say to them, if they bring this up with me, so they understand where i am coming from and that my boyfriend will not betray my trust and their trust. I don’t want to break up with him because a lighter fell out his pocket, it really isn’t a big deal. thank you ♥️",28Mar2019,0
244,"I’m [20F] a college student, so naturally a great majority of the people around me drink or smoke. I don’t know why but sometimes even at the mention of drugs I get uncomfortable. If I’m around people drinking or doing some sort of drug I feel super awkward and almost kind of...scared? Maybe even anxious? Maybe it’s because in school the “drugs are bad” mentality got pounded into my head and I never really witnessed much drug use growing up, so as a result I’ve become afraid of them and can’t really understand why some people would want to do them when they can be so dangerous. Perhaps my weird anxiety comes from never having done drugs before myself so I don’t know what it’s like, but I also believe that I probably shouldn’t try any drugs if I’m not comfortable with them. 

I want to get rid of this weird fear/anxiety thing. It causes my friends to not invite me to things or not drink around me because they don’t want me to be uncomfortable. I want to be comfortable around drugs and with people who do drugs. I have no idea really what to do, but I just want to be normal, I guess. I want people to treat me like anyone else even if I’m sober and I want to feel okay about drugs. Any advice on how to get rid of this drug anxiety/fear would be greatly appreciated. ",28Mar2019,1

254,"Hello &amp; thank you for your help. I am changing names &amp; some details to protect my identity.

TL;DR mentally ill relative is over and monologuing about his problems for literal hours on end. I want to be supportive, but also have to get to work/school. How do I deal with this?

I (23F) live with my mom (58F) and a relative with whom we have a long history is currently visiting due to losing their housing situation. This person, whom I will call Greg, is dear to us but is very difficult to be around. Greg is diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, and ADD and has some narc tendencies. Before I was an adult Greg lived with us and was very verbally abusive and after I left my mother called the police on him for hitting her. There are lots of holes in our walls, still. (for clarification, Greg eventually moved out and I moved back home).

So now that Greg is visiting its really hard to do the things I need to do, due to his anger and need for support. For example, yesterday I listened to him talk for 5 hours and today I listened to him talk for 2.5 hours. Both times early in the conversation he said something mean/rude/otherwise abrasive or disagreeable and started yelling when I protested. For example, this morning he suddenly began speaking of a high school friend of mine and said ""So and so is a fucking cancer"" and I immediately protested, saying a couple of things like ""please don't insult my friend"" and ""I don't want to have a conversation about my friend like this"" and then Greg yelled at me for 20 minutes about various things like I misinterpreted him, defending himself, saying that he was not trying to be insulting, and then saying things about my friend like ""Tell him to brush his fucking teeth"" and ""he always smelled awful"" and making judgements on his character. Idk even know where this came from because neither of us have seen this friend in over a year. anyway, as soon as he started yelling I repeated that I did not want to participate in this conversation and retreated, but Greg followed me. I repeated myself several times, saying ""I don't want to have this conversation"" and ""Please stop talking about my friend."" Greg simply yelled over me every time and accused me of not participating in the conversation, which was exactly what I was trying to do and kept telling him so. Greg was mad that I didn't respect his opinion.

After about 20 minutes (I was watching the clock and doing things on my computer because, as I explained to Greg, I did not wish to participate in the conversation), Greg lowered his voice and started talking about other things, although every once in a while he would circle back to saying unnecessary things about my friend. This whole thing started at 9:30 and lasted until noon. I know he needs a listening ear, however, there are precious few moments I can say anything that won't make him yell again. He's struggling, as he has been for years, and continues talking about the person who ruined his life (tbh I was there for a lot of these events and he doesn't remember them the way they happened - although I understand that the emotions he has regarding these events are real and very damaging) and his ex, and how he can't handle his anxiety and he should be a millionaire by now but we ruined his life by not helping him through college and by calling the police on him when he hit my mom. He is saying his life won't get better if we don't do something to help him. I'm personally of the opinion that his anxiety/ptsd is from our father hitting him when he was a toddler and then leaving us. Because of the nature of the mental illness, he blames our mother even though she wasn't really manipulative or abusive growing up. I say this because when I was in middle school, Greg said everything was my fault and if I just hadn't been born his life would be okay (also he is very angry that we keep telling him to stop blaming us for his problems because that is not what he is doing). He says he can't get closure if she doesn't admit her part in causing him harm. I'll admit we aren't perfect, but I know from experience that if my mother ever said something less than kind it was after being reamed by Greg verbally for hours. He only has the capacity to see what others have done to him and not his own role (at times he does have the clarity to apologize, but like I said earlier he goes back and forth between accepting responsibility for hitting our mom and accusing her of baiting him). I don't blame him for that, since mental illness isn't a choice, but this is really difficult to navigate.

Anyone have some advice to keep the conversations short and deal with this situation? He's probably going to be around several days and will feel absolutely abandoned if we don't help him out.",28Mar2019,3
255,"Not entirely sure if this is even the correct sub to post this on, but 
TL;DR I recently changed majors from science to arts and I feel like my dad is talking to me less now than before because of it. 

Recently I switched majors from science to arts. Long story short, I wasn’t doing well in science, nor was I passionate about it, resulting in a extreme drop in my mental health. 

Both of my parents studied science in university, my dad even did further education and currently works in a well established pharmaceutical company. So it was inevitable for them to want me to study science as well. My parents, like many others, don’t think that highly of an arts degree. But a few months ago, I broke down on the phone while telling them about my grades (when I was in science) and they seemed to be very supportive and said that if arts was the right choice for me then I should transfer into it. 

Now, a few months later, my mental health has improved so much. I’m very passionate about what I’m learning and I love it so so much. 
My parents and I have a policy of calling everyday, because we’ve always been quite close in that sense. I’ve also been extremely dependent on my parents growing up, so this is very important for me, especially because I go to college in a different country. Ever since I transferred to arts, I almost always tell my  parents what I’m learning in school and sharing my ideas and thoughts of it with them. They listen, but don’t say much other than to keep studying hard. 

But I’ve noticed recently, after I transferred, that my dad seems to talk less to me than before when I was in science. Before we would talk on the phone every single day. Now a days, he only ever talks to me maybe every other day, and sometimes we’ll go two days without talking. My mom and I still talk everyday and I feel like my mom has been more loving when she talks to me. Like she said “I love you” to me a while ago, which I think she’s never said to me before. FYI, my parents are Asian, so this isn’t surprising. Before, when I was in science, my dad would always talk to me everyday. He’s kinda overprotective, so he would tell me to text him &amp; my mom when I got back to my dorm on the days that I had labs until 10 pm. Sometimes, I would forget so he would stay up and call me to make sure that I got home safe. But recently, I went to an event off-campus and I had told them that it would last until 2am, but I would leave around midnight, because I didn’t want to stay too late. I thought that my dad would call me to see if I got home or when I was leaving, but he didn’t. When I got home a little past midnight, I decided to just text him that I got home. He didn’t see my text and I only know this because he has his read receipts on. I was kinda disappointed, but I thought that maybe he was tired and just needed to sleep early. I think I was just thinking too much into this. But when my mom called me the next day to ask how the event was, he didn’t talk to me then either. 
When he does talk to me, he sounds normal. The same as before, not angry, or upset, or anything. And I can’t tell if he’s hiding these emotions when he talks to me or if I’m just looking too deep into this. 
My biggest fear has always been disappointing my parents, and I know for a fact that I did this when I transferred to arts, but I was really hoping that our relationship wouldn’t change because of it. I may sound like I need attention from my parents all the time, but like I said, I’m in a different country with no one that I know. Moving away from my parents was hell for me. I lived with these people for all my life until now and it scares me so much that I probably won’t live with them long-term again. Which is why this daily communication thing is so important to me. 
Sometimes I feel like I’m just overreacting and letting all of my fears get the worse of me, but I’m really unsure. I don’t know what to do. I’m so confused. ",28Mar2019,1

258,"I (24M) recently moved into a new apartment near my workplace, on the lease until December. I have my own room but I share my bathroom with another female roommate, and share the apartment with a couple that has their own bathroom. My girlfriend (23F) lives an hour away from me with her parents, but comes to stay with me on the weekends. While it's nice having the privacy of my own room, the problem with my place is that the walls are super thin- I can easily hear my flatmate cough in her room (which shares a wall with mine), and can clearly hear regular-volume conversations in the living room through my door.

Lately I've been feeling kind of paranoid anytime we get intimate. I am not worried that my flatmates know we have sex, since it is kind of a given whenever my girlfriend comes over. However, I don't like the feeling that my flatmate can likely listen to us going at it fairly easily through our adjacent wall. It makes me self conscious to do things I would normally do while alone with my girlfriend, such as dirty talk or go really hard/fast, which creates a lot of noise. Because of that I feel like I tend to take it slower, and always have that thought of my roommates listening in in the back of my mind. It really kills the mood.

Right now i'm worried about the upcoming interview as they might not want to hire someone who only started a new job and already plan to quit after less than a month.",28Mar2019,2
261,"I’ve had a rough couple of years and today is my 17th birthday. I didn’t expect to make it here. I have PTSD from a sexual assault at 15 and became really depressed after it happened. It’s time for me to take my SAT and start prepping for college. I just hadn’t considered having to worry about these things because I thought I’d be dead. Now I’m completely overwhelmed. While I’m coming out of my depressive episode and am feeling more stable, I feel like I’ve wasted so much time and isolated myself. I just don’t know how to get my life back, and I also feel like I don’t know who i am. It’s hard to adjust the old mindset of “nothing matters because I won’t be around” because I can honestly say that I don’t want to die anymore. Any advice on getting back on my feet again is appreciated.",28Mar2019,2
263,"The fact that I’m going on here to seek advice speaks for itself, I think. I have no fucking clue what I want to do. In fact i just dropped out of art school, seemed like a waste of time and money so I dropped. I’m very very unhappy, my brother is leeching off of the little money I have left, I have practically no friends, no job, my family is miles away.
Literally all I want is to just travel around the world and chill with friends. I thought about becoming a flight attendant but I don’t have enough customer service experience. I’m thinking maybe going on a trip somewhere, party hard and then kill myself. I’m just so lost, the therapist I saw was useless and I don’t seem to have any motivation anymore.

265,"During my stressful first-year of university one of my coping mechanisms is to play one of the sports I loved my whole life - soccer (football as my family would call it). I'm a pretty solid player and was respected by my peers at home and have always had a passion for the game. I decided to take up recreational drop-in soccer to de-stress and do what I love as a break from school.

However, the people that attend this activity are a large clique of overly competitive people that are audacious and at times impolite. I'm very introverted and don't have many friends coming from a small city and don't really relate to them (I'm often silent and don't really have anything to say to them) so I think it makes me an easy target.

I've been experiencing bullying as I've been treated differently than typical clique members.  I am scolded or yelled at if I make a mistake, while if it's thier friends they laugh it off or forgive each other. I am also purposely fouled (kicked, elbowed, hurt intentionally without trying to play the ball) and no one sees anything wrong with it unless they are a part of thier friend group. I also overheard them talking badly about me saying I was horrible and wondering why I even play the sport.

This also has actually made me play worse as I am playing in an environment where I'm scared and nervous, making it unenjoyable in its entirety. I have issues with depression and self-image so It's pretty upsetting one of the things I loved and used as a coping method has become destructive. After this dissapointment I've decided to take up running as nobody can harass me there; however I do want to play soccer but just not in a negative environment where I'm not respected and worsen my performance and mental health.

267,"VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW

I experienced terrible bullying all my life and abuse by my parents.

Fast forward, I decided to never be like those who hurt me or make others feel the way that I was made to feel. 

I took an official IQ test at 13 and scored in the 99.99% percentile, skipped a few grades, graduated high school after just turning 16, valedictorian, and many other academic and extracurricular achievements. I felt indestructible. 

Parents refused to allow me to apply to university and would not allow me to take the SATs. I was forced to go to community college. I had no resources. 

Dropped out of community college at 17.  Failed all my classes because I didn't do the work or show-up. I was depressed and demotivated. All my hard work in high school seemed to not have meant anything. The pain got to me.

Moved.

Earned my own brand new car with parent's help.

Felt better about myself. Was ready to move on and be successful. 

Started college up again right before turning 18. Was in a better place mentally. I was healing. 

Halfway through my first semester a 21 year old boy in one of my classes started giving me attention. I never did anything before. Never held hands, kissed, anything.

I thought for the first time someone wanted to be friends with me. 

Fast forward through this long painful story. I regret everything that happened. I was pressured to do things I did not want to do. 

After six months I relented and lost my virginity. After this everything in the relationship slowly and then quickly became worse. I started failing classes and not doing well in school. I cannot focus. It's unlike anything I have ever experienced.

He shoves me and pushes me. Yells. Violent when angry. Tells me that his behavior and what he did is my fault because I made him do it. Blames me for everything. Constantly lies. Violates all my boundaries. Tells me he was never like this before and I made him like this. 

I see a receipt with a paid subscription for tinder on his email account. He said he didn't cheat on me and his friend made that account for him and that he had nothing to do with it. I think he cheated. He says he would never cheat.

Fast forward again.

I beg him and he meets up with me after making me wait 5 hours. He agreed to talk nicely so we could workout the issues and make everything how it used to be, nice and loving. Instead, he spends almost 2 hours saying horrible things; including that he cant stand to see my face. He refuses to even look at me. Tells me I disgust him, he has no desire for me, etc. 

I am used to this by now. I take a deep breath and I tried to relax. He walked out. I was in the room alone. I was trying to calm my heart-rate and control the anxiety. After maybe 5 minutes I got up and decided to leave and drive away. I wanted to go to the gym and work off the sinking feeling.

I got in my car. It was raining heavily. And I think I am paying attention. In the back of my mind I keep hearing everything he said and I feel sick. 

After maybe 5.5 minutes of driving I got into a major multiple car accident. My new car is totaled. I almost died. I called my parents. They dont answer. I called him against my better judgement. He doesnt answer. I text him begging him to answer. Finally he does and then starts telling me its karma and it's good that it happened. That he doesn't care. He has no love for me. He tells me god is smiting me. He says I deserve it. He tells me so many horrible things. I am standing on the sidewalk. I suffered a concussion. I couldn't think well. I was lucky to be alive. 

After the accident I begged and he meets me that night. I begged him to stay with me and apologized for a time last week when I didnt answer his call because my phone died and my parents shut off the internet. I begged him to not leave. I begged him to love me. I asked why he didnt care. 

Now. 

I feel terrible. I gave away all my power. He still doesn't talk to me unless I beg him to. 

I feel like I lost and that there is no justice. I want to win somehow. 

I have no car. I don't have money. I cannot focus on school so I am failing. 

He stole my personality. I see parts of my old self in him so I keep trying to somehow will it back from him. My parents told me he is a sociopath. He ""loved"" me. Turned on me. Then discarded me. He stole ideas from me. I feel addicted to him. 

I want to know what to do.

It seems that whenever I try hard everything fails. I have no motivation. I feel so empty and used and manipulated.

I feel like sandpaper. I am on the edge and I do not know which way is up. I do not see a purpose. I have never felt so empty and betrayed. I am suffering physically, mentally, and emotionally. I am very disassociated. My mind constantly feels foggy. 

I don't understand why. I am in pain. I am anxious. I don't recognize myself. I cannot describe the way I feel. I am on the edge. I am really on the edge. I feel like I have nothing left.

I need:

1. school mindset
2. money and a job
3. a car
4. How to get these things? They all seem connected and I do not know how to start. I need help formulating a plan to move on. I want to want to get myself back. 
5. real friends, good people

I want to know:

1. Who wins? A bad person or a good person when trying to be successful?
2. Why?
3. What is the point of everything?
4. Why is the world like this? Why is everything so cold?
5. Why are people so cruel to me? 
6. How can I make it so that I never have this happen again to me? 
7. How do I win?
8. How can I create my own boundaries?",28Mar2019,1
268,"Hello! I tried shrooms yesterday and had realizations that leave me lost as ever! Looking for advice on what to do from here.

Backstory: I'm a college freshman at a good university, throughout high school I did well without much effort as school came naturally. Ive never been able to find a passion though. I was so focused on getting into college I didnt ask why. I have so many interests, but none stand out as something I want to do.

I am currently on spring break and tried psilocybin yesterday. I realized that subconsciously I am not okay with who I am. I always try to better myself because I dont love myself, I feel that I am not enough. My parents are divorced and because of them not being a strong pair I feel that I wasnt meant to be. I'm a mistake.

I dont want to feel like this and have been spiritual in the past. I feel like I shouldn't go back to school (my university lets you take quarters off) until I learn to love myself and find direction so that I can have a meaningful life. Is this irrational? 

What do you think I should do/resources I should look to for guidanxd",28Mar2019,2
269,"I have always been the person in my friend group to advice against high school romance and relationships. This was because I believed that high school relationship mostly do not work out and that it’s a waste of time. Let me clarify that I am an expat in a country full of expats, which leads to having most of my classmates leaving to different parts of the world. Therefore, another reason that hurts any chance of me or anyone else staying in a relationship is the fact that we will leave to go to different countries. 

I fell in love with this incredibly smart and amazing guy who’s extremely loving and understanding. He is very serious about us and he doesn’t mind us being in a long distance relationship. He is fine with anything I decide on and he told his mom about us. He’s being very considerate of my feelings and I really appreciate that. We come from two different countries but I mean we’re both Arab, so the difference in culture is not very significant. Our relationship so far has been complicated as in we’re not together officially but we act like it. I mean he has asked to be his girlfriend, but I said no. I said no because of religious reasons as well as me not wanting to be in a relationship I’m scared won’t last. So, we are just exploring our feeling until we go to university. My friends keep making me doubt my love for him and it’s starting to work. Also, hearing that teenage relationships never work has affected my perception of how this relationship might end up. I feel like my feelings have been tainted with all these misconceptions about love. 

Just some more information about us: we have been the only students in the advanced math class for the past year and it has made us closer. I never believed anyone would love me the way he does. But I mean to talk about the people in my school and not to say that I believed that I won’t ever find anyone. He is not who I thought I would be attracted to physically. But, I’ve found myself attached and attracted to him.

I proposed that we should continue exploring out feelings until we leave (we’ve both been accepted to universities in different countries). Then, we will stay as friends and in touch. After 3 years, if we still want to be together regardless of how we fell, then we shall be together. This should give us time to understand whether or not we believe that we want to make a life long commitment. We already talked about marriage and we’ve only have been talking like a couple for 2 months (we were friends before that). 

Can someone please advice me and share their opinion about the situation?",28Mar2019,1

He decided to come stay with my mom for 5 days and wants to ""party."" So my mom keeps asking around where she can get cocaine for her boyfriend.

Six to seven days later my mom gets a call from my teacher asking to send a scanned copy of my birth certificate urgently. I thought it was for my solo, but a few minutes later, I realised it was for the group dance. 

I asked my teacher if I could use my usual costume for the dances, because getting a costume made is filthy expensive, and she said I could.

Then the next day I go for practice and she tells me that I have to get a brand new costume made. And then when I get home, my mom is irritated and texts my teacher saying that I should only stick to the solo performance because of my Exams and academic pressures. 

Next day my teacher calls my mom and yells at her. My mom gets annoyed but tries not to show it. My teacher says it’s her responsibility and right as a Guru to decide what I do, and I or my mom can’t undermine her decisions. She gets angry that my exams are seemingly more important to me and cuts the call on my mom after yelling at her for a bit.

285,"Let’s just start with saying that me and this friend have been close ever since first grade. Never in my life would I think she’d do something like this. We’re now both fifteen and she has a boyfriend. Let’s call him Jake and her Lacie. 

Lacie’s a gorgeous girl. Always has been and she knows it too. Even though she has a boyfriend she does flirt a lot, but that’s not really a crime. Around guys that are clearly flirting with her, she’ll say she needs a new boyfriend and she’s planning on breaking up with Jake. I reprimand her whenever I’m with her but she always just says it’s a joke and I’m being too uptight. 

Lacie and Jake have been dating for over a year now, their anniversary just passed actually. Lacie goes through these periods where she hates Jake and wants nothing to do with him, but a few days later she’s totally infatuated with him again. It’s very confusing, especially when she’s constantly asking advice. Anyways, back at the beginning of the school year, Lacie and Jake were on a short break (maybe for a week or so) and Lacie decided to get with a guy. Technically, this wasn’t cheating, but I suppose I should’ve seen it as a red flag for later. 

Short after they broke up, Lacie and Jake got back together and this guy was forgotten. Moving on to around January or so (I can’t remember the exact month), a mutual friend that Lacie has hung out with for a while, let’s call him Elijah, starts getting close to her. I think nothing of it because she said back at the beginning of the year she didn’t like him. Lacie will tease him and they flirt a lot. I don’t do much, I’m not very confrontational, especially to my friends. It moves on to Lacie kissing his cheek and hugging him multiple times throughout the day. Elijah will put his hands on her thighs. Jake doesn’t know much about this because he has a different lunch then us. 

It even became a kind of joke in our friend group. Everybody was Team Elijah (nobody really liked Jake, even though I think he’s pretty nice) and I was the only Team Jake. I brought this up to Jake one day when he was teasing me because I thought he knew about it. I basically just said that I was Team Jake when nobody else was so he should be nice to me as a joke. He said thanks and we parted ways. I thought nothing of it. Later on, I brought this up to Lacie thinking it was funny. Her eyes got huge and all of our friends got super angry at me asking why would I mention that to Jake. This was when I realized that Jake didn’t even know about the cheating at all. I felt bad for the guy. He’s completely infatuated with Lacie, head over heels. I’ve never heard him talk bad about her and his friends even go on about how he never shuts up about her. 

Anyways, I still do nothing about the cheating. Lacie tells me that they’ve only kissed and that’s all. I think it’s not my problem. 

Lacie and Elijah have a falling out and she goes running back to Jake, claiming Elijah is trash. All my other friends are sad they’re not together but I was actually happy. Moving on to a few months later and they’ve slowly progressed to not talking, to friends, and to cheating once more. This time, it’s a lot more than just kissing though. Lacie legitimately starts playing these guys. She’s still with Jake, never broken up with him and she’s telling Elijah that she loves him and when he says she’s his future girlfriend she just agrees. 

And then one night my friend throws a small party. I wasn’t invited because I’m pretty lame, but Lacie, Elijah and a few other people got invited. Jake is not there. I got the details out of Lacie a few days later. Basically, they got totally smashed and decided to play some sexual truth or dare. When it came to Lacie’s turn, she was dared to get in her underwear and she did. Elijah started feeling all up on her. And then Lacie was dared to give Elijah a handjob and she did that too. To be fair, they were hammered, but still, it’s wrong. Lacie and Elijah ended up having sex. After that party, they were a lot closer and it seems like Lacie has two boyfriends now. She’s always asking me for my advice and sometimes I just want to shout out how wrong it is for her to do this. But I don’t because I don’t want to be a bad friend. I just tell her to stay with Jake or to at least break up with him. But she never seems to listen to me. 

There’s been other incidents too of Lacie kind of cheating. She likes to lead guys on. One time, I was over at her house and she had a guy on the phone. Her and Jake had gotten into an argument over the phone just a few moments ago and she mentions to this guy that they’ve broken up. Basically, he sends her a dick pic. I tried to not really be in on it and just kept playing some video games while she did what she wanted. I guess more went down then that, because later on when her and Jake once again got back together again, this guy goes around the school telling everyone that Lacie is a hoe and I suppose it kind of gets out? She starts crying at lunch and Jake comforts her for the rest of the day. 

I just want to know if I should tell Jake about the night at the party and how Lacie tells Elijah she loves him or just wait it out and let her deal with it? ",28Mar2019,2
286,"Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I (20m) met her (21f) as part of my studies (\~2.5y ago), we were in the same class for most of it. Since day 1 I thought she was cute and just gorgeous but I was also attracted by how she was more reserved/introverted and so different from many other girls; just very mature for her age, took great care of herself etc.

I was extremely inexperienced, and still am today, with girls. Never had a girlfriend, sex, a kiss, or a girl directly expressing romantic interest. But I figured I just had to approach her and give it a try.

&amp;#x200B;

I will spare you most of the details, but the bottom line kinda goes like this; I got overly excited over some basic early social interactions with her and wanted to move things further, going to her place etc., but she only showed disinterest. Texting her over WhatsApp and how it felt like talking to a brick wall I figured was just normal, at least that's what I read and heard about how guys have to make the first steps. I kept reading into the tiniest things as if they were signs of interest but was never sure enough as her disheartening reply to one of my more direct/obvious approaches, or so you would think, kept lingering in the back of my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, after about 2 years of seeing alleged ""signs"" and working hard on my looks - style, facial care, hardcore bodybuilding and so on - I gathered enough self-esteem to give it another go. And so I asked her whether she wanted to spend a night in town with a friend of ours. Albeit a bit slow in the beginning, it was a great time. I drank a bit of alcohol for the first time just for her, we had great conversations, good laughs and everything. Especially a few drinks in, she gave me ""the looks"" a lot and many of the things she said can easily be interpreted as interest in me, finding me attractive and so on. We were already discussing some plans about what we could do in the future. Since we had a very early class the next day, we had to cut things off eventually and so I brought them to the train station. We were short on time and when I saw the train standing there despite us being late I just flew off and ran as fast as I could in the hopes of holding the door before it departs. And damn, I am impressed to this day by how fast I went, since I am already a fast runner and know how fast I usually go, this just felt like me on steroids; pretty funny. Anyhow, I managed to get there just in time and what followed was my first hug ever with a girl. It wasn't very long, maybe a couple of seconds, but it felt amazing and warm, apart from me freezing my ass off in the cold. I wanted it to never stop, to just hold her and never let go. And so they departed.

&amp;#x200B;

We texted a bit while she was on her way back and we both agreed on how fun and amazing it was. And that we definitely need to repeat this. I was on top of the world. I took the wrong subway \*twice\* that night and could barely fall asleep, that's how excited I was. I think I never felt this good in my life. So I figured it was just natural to approach her a few days after that and ask for more. I wanted to make it feel more meaningful, and so I manned up and called her to ask her out. I asked whether she wants to eat dinner with me at a (pretty high-end) restaurant right in the center of downtown. She said she'd have to check her calender first and would tell me tomorrow during class, but she'd definitely be down. Though the next day was just a huge disappointment. Not a Yes, not a No, no just nothing. She didn't even talk to me, greet me or even just look at me once. It felt like almost any other day with her for the past 2 years. I was in shock and texted her later, asking her what's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

What followed was the most heartbreaking conversation I ever had. Bottom line being that she has no interest, she completely forgot me asking her out and while she did enjoy the night we had ""it just takes more/longer until I really wanna make new \*friends\*"". It wasn't until the end that I found out that she, apparently, did not even know I had romantic interest all these years; despite me being a guy, her being a gorgeous girl, and me asking her several times to do things together, even me asking her out towards the end. I still cannot believe that part to this day, but what shall I do.

&amp;#x200B;

I was devastated and still am. I have lost complete trust in my judgement since apparently it was so far off all the time. She made me feel amazing just from those few interactions and still I have no urge to ever experience it again since I have always feared rejection and this one just hit me like a truck. I was living alone, not keen on making new friends in the area I moved to, university was too easy and uninteresting, the company I cooperated with that guided my studies and that I worked 35h weeks for didn't offer any meaningful and fun work either. I hated everything about my life and the rejection was the cherry on top. I fell into deep depression and lost interest in everything in life. I neglected uni and work, I neglected personal hygiene, I never hit the gym ever since, I ordered food almost every day. I turned into a degenerate pile of filth and lost control over my life. I decided I'd have to make a cut and quit my studies 6 months before finishing it. Everything went downhill and I just moved back to my mother a few days ago to get a hold of my life and get my shit together.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about a year since her rejection and it still haunts me. I dream about her multiple times a week and it always involves some romantic or sexual component. I've always been a case of severe Oneitis but this is a whole nother level. I get flashbacks of her randomly, e.g. while taking a walk, that just make me feel empty and dead inside. I have lost complete interest and confidence in ever approaching girls anymore. I'v always been shy about it, but at least had a sliver of hope left before that. I've been meeting a therapist for about 6 months now and it definitely helps in some regards. But the complete absence of any romance in my life really gets to me. And the feeling of not wanting to try again makes it ever so hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been quite the wall of text, but thank you if you made it so far and thank you for any advice you might have. I am planning on taking a step back from the ""full speed ahead"" approach and reevaluated my life. I am moving away from my materialistic, elitist value propositions since that view is a big reason for how I am this unhappy at the moment. I am planning on studying Mathematics starting in October this year, something I had planned initially but discarded in favor of the field of studies that could more easily make me ""rich and happy"" and quit a few weeks ago. I hope I get my ass back into the gym since my body might have been the only thing I had going for me the few times I tried finding a relationship.",28Mar2019,1

So I have a roommate and this person and I got into a falling out and I realized just how manipulative and harassing and borderline abusive they are so I want out asap. But this will likely mean leaving my job without a 2 week notice because I won't be able to drive from my parents home to that location as it would become a big financial burden to drive that far. I don't necessarily like the job but I don't want to leave everyone hating me. It's a box store so I could transfer locations but even then, that won't be right away either.

288,"Okay so bear with me because I’m a super socially anxious person. I know this is a stupid thing to get worked up about!

I recently went to a couple of complementary taster sessions at a local sports club. The instructor didn’t want to discuss cost outright but said it worked out at roughly £6 a session which I thought reasonable. I really liked the class and after my trial period the instructor took me to one side to discuss joining. It’s a lot more expensive that he led me to believe - there is a joining fee of &gt;£100 and whilst I can technically afford this, it is a big financial commitment and I try to be careful with money. He asked me how that sounded and I kind of panicked and said “uh sounds reasonable” and he gave me the club bank details and I went home. I obviously haven’t sent any money but I feel that if I don’t, i should at least tell the instructor and thank them for their time - I just don’t know what to say!!

Honestly the time commitment is as intimidating as the financial commitment. Training is twice a week and they like you to commit to a year. So that’s another £600. But I have a long history of quitting stuff (thanks depression) and I just get the feeling this isn’t for me. It’s sad because I enjoyed it a lot but realistically I think I’d struggle to keep going with it.

What’s the most polite way to thank the instructor for their time but say I’ve reconsidered and I feel that the time and financial commitment is a bit beyond me right now?

So recently my ex boyfriend broke up with me after two years. I keep seeing resources for emotionally abusive relationships, but I am not sure if it was abuse or not. Please help.

He would yell at me for being sad.

I have depression, big time, and sometimes, once every two or three months, I would feel in crisis. It was rarely actual feelings of suicide, but he would talk me down occasionally. He told me that I was insane and not to hurt him by asking for help during these times, because he has his own problems and I wasn't helping.

He would say things just to make me uncomfortable.

Whether it was an extreme political view or making fun of me, he would always try to get me to argue with him. He said he thought it was funny even though he was hurting me and to lighten up

Everything was an ultimatum.

He once would not come to see me because there was a movie he wanted to watch that I didn't. He would come see me every Saturday - since our relationship was semi-long distance - and it would always stress me whether he was going to be on time, late, or stand me up do to an arbitrary reason.

In the interest of fairness I had some flaws in the relationship as well. I slapped him in the face for being a bit of a bully to my little sister and had a hard time giving him space when he was angry. So, give a verdict I guess. I just need support. I made a throwaway for this purpose",28Mar2019,2

Hey I’m new here but I just wanted some advice on my situation. For my entire life my parents have believed strongly in homeopathy and all of the practices of it such as special remedies for colds that literally say no scientific proof on them. I have no issue with that at all! It’s when my parents impose them on me(I’m 16) and try to make me believe in everything they preach without informing me on anything. For instance about 4 months ago my parents tried pushing me to go for a painful acupuncture session to “cure” my cat dandruff allergy. It would cost 400 dollars and they said well nothing else works so we could try that. I asked for proof and my dad used the same excuse of “there’s no proof that it doesn’t work.” (Another note, my mom truly believes vaccines cause autism but would rather have an autistic child than a dead one in her words) and their sources are Russian people on Facebook and other sketchy sites. I’ve tried reasoning with them and it never works out because they always use the “it might help.” excuse. I have no issue with homeopathy I have an issue when it’s imposed on me. Now recently about a month ago my parents while I was at my girlfriends house moved my entire room layout because of a Chinese belief that feet facing the door causes death. I admit I overreacted and started asking why they moved my stuff without my permission about a month later after my complaints to move my bed back to its original spot(so I could have my bed light and books closer) they said no because of the old Chinese tradition and that they knew better than me. I asked for what proof and they brought up my suicide attempt and how when they moved my bed that it obviously contributed to it. This cut deep and pissed me off, I don’t think it’s right to mention that to further your argument. My father then mentioned that he believed in yoga and “chakras?” And that he “sensed” the bad energy. I just don’t think it’s right for someone to impose their beliefs on someone else. 

Maybe I’m wrong but that’s why I’m here, for advice or something to help me cope with everything.

So I had a very rough night with a texting conversation with my girlfriend that started with me bringing up how I did not feel so good mentally. This progressed into the reveal that while she is dating me and we have it good, she is at the saddest point in her life. The reason for this is because the last person she dated was extremely priveledged and had a lot more freedoms than I have due to financial circumstances and living situations. 

I have a lot of issues with insecurities about myself because she isn't completely over her ex and I had no idea things were this bad until today which makes me think what else isn't being said? I feel like I am second guessing everything between us and that I am not good enough for her, and can't give her the better lifestyle she had before dating me.

If it helps with context, her ex cheated on her which pretty much ended their relationship, and my girlfriend began talking to me soon after but I don't think it's a rebound as we have kind of had a thing for each other for a while.

I'm sorry if I'm not very direct with what I am asking but I feel very unsure of what to do and very inadequate. Any insight helps

298,"So I had an abusive relationship 10 years ago that lasted for few months but it felt much longer also due to the fact that I was 15 years old (the SO was 21), and it was my first relationship. After the end of this relationship I struggled for about 1 year with threats, isolation, people turned against me by this person, internet bullying and whatnot. 

I sort of got over it or learn to live with the memories and never really cared that much although I was left with a very low self-esteem.

I had a few other long term relationships in my life that were very normal and non confrontational, no drama, and I preferred it that way. I never really had too intense feelings in these relationships and even when I got dumped I didn't suffer that much. 

I never really felt in love and I was just choosing my partners by judging how ""normal"" they are, and at the smallest sign of confrontation or fight I would just bail without any remorse.

Recently I met somebody and I really fell in love this time, and all my judging about what's ""normal"" went out the window. Now we are in a relationship and I couldn't be happier but sometimes we fight, and instead of being rational and resolving the issues, every time an issue is addressed I just can't help but reminding myself how worthless I am, all the memories from 10 years ago come back to me and the abusive words of that person ring in my head and i just sink into this pit of self pity and self harm, which doesn't solve anything. It just dismisses the reason of the fight (which usually is not even a big deal) and everything becomes about me being a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to live. And it is a vicious circle because as my partner tries to reassure me that everything is okay I become guilty about acting like this and feel even more shitty.

I am aware that this is not healthy on my part, and I keep beating myself over it and I am afraid that I will ruin my relationship with this person that I love so much for the first time in my life. I have never felt or acted like this before, it feels like love brings the worst out of me.

I didn't even realize that that short abusive relationship in my teens would affect me this much now.

Has anybody felt this way? Did you have partners who acted like this? How do you cope?",28Mar2019,2
299,"So I’m 16, and I’ve been playing guitar for about 4 years, at first (2 years) I played for about 10 hours every day, woke up, school, play til 1 am, this was almost daily, within a month I was able to play stupid crazy stuff like Eruption by Van Halen, Metallica solos, and within about 3 years there was literally nothing I couldn’t play (literally nothing, could play dragonforce solos sped up) would play with my teeth, behind the head, blah blah you get the point, well I gained a lot of popularity because of this and it was cool, and people wanted me to play stuff, I would have a dozen people requesting me to learn some riff or solo at a time, cool right? Well around this time I really started to not play as much and started to lose a little interest, no biggie as I still could play, but people kept asking to hear this and that and I couldn’t properly hang out with people without them asking me to drag a guitar and amp around with me (most of my friends at this point were musicians) and I really got bored of this and started losing all interest in guitar, and it didn’t help that I had a few arrogant friends that were always talking about guitar (one of my friends was super obsessed like I used to be but could never get on the same skill level) and so I started ignoring any guitar convos, and then after a while music convos as well, and it started to ruin the whole genre of like classic rock and older metal (70s-90s) for me because I couldn’t escape it, like going to family events was even “hows the guitar” over and over, and I just felt like a dead deer being beaten because of how much people asked when I had lost all interest, at this point I told no one that I really didn’t like it anymore because people seemed so happy of my “gift” so my parents see this summer camp (California) for musicians to form small bands and have fun playing covers or whatever, I say sure because if I said no it would seem so out of character, so I go and have some fun (it’s 4 days) first day we talking about music and all, and at this point I haven’t touched my guitar in months, but since I was so good before, me being super rusty is virtually the same level as most of the other skilled guitarists, so the bands each got like a decent guitarist and a few meh ones, well our group picked songs I never heard of (never stuff I was into yet) and I spent a few hours practicing that night, I came back the next day and my playing was less rusty and my skill was back a bit, I actually got a comment that day because one of the lesser skilled guitarists said to me “dude how did you get so good overnight?” And me not realizing it was just like “wha” and day goes by, next day I’m even less rusty and I start playing through the fire and flames solo (a solo that is joked by guitarists to be almost impossible) our of habit and my group kind of looks at me like “what” and I’m like oh yeah it’s nothing and at that point they realized I was pretty good, and at this point things were going well, my group was nice and guitar didn’t seem like a total chore because I had stopped talking to people about it a few months before, and pretty much when performance day came I was given a small section to write a solo, wrote something crazy and a good handful of the people there were blown away, which started the whole mess up again (not as big but a few people) fast forward a month or two and I haven’t touched my guitar since then, back to being rusty, and about 6 months go by and people are asking like always and I pretty much just don’t care anymore and say “yeah I really don’t play anymore, gotta study for *inserts made up test*” and slowly shifted it over to the point of saying I don’t play at all anymore, am now in a band (have no idea how that happened tbh) and a church band where I play, don’t practice at all but am able to play the simple 4 chord stuff) and really don’t want to do this anymore, completely burned out playing and have no inspiration or desire to play, but raised such an expectation and a lot of people know me for it, I feel like I’m letting people down by not playing out or doing anything with it and have had over a dozen people tell me “that’s sad man” or “come on” when I’ve told them I don’t play anymore, it’s just pretty stressful at this point

300,"Hey, I’m a high school senior from West Virginia. I’m nearing my graduation date (May 25th) and I have no idea what I’m going to do. 
Let me start by saying: it’s not that I didn’t plan anything in high school. I got accepted into my two first choice schools, but upon visitation found out that they were just incredibly out of my price range. Somehow my family “makes too much” for financial aid despite both my parents being my grandparents and I supposedly don’t get adoption benefits because I was privately adopted (by my grandparents) and was never a ward of the state. 
I also applied for multiple outside scholarships through different websites and my school. I’ve received 0 of them. 
I also want to say I’m not dumb; and I’ve done incredibly well in high school. I’ve taken majority honors, dual credit, and AP courses and currently have a 4.2 GPA.  I scored a 31 on my ACT.  So it sounds like I should be in good shape right? I mean that’s what I thought, but for some reason I’m not, despite being accepted to every school I’ve applied to. 
My major interest is anything wildlife related. My first choice school was Ohio University (I live right on the Ohio boarder). I fell absolutely in love upon visitation, and I visited twice. It definitely felt like hOUme and I felt like I’d fit right in, and I even met professors who shared my niche interest: birds. But if you’re familiar with OU, they’re a private university, and the 11,000 dollars they offered in scholarships did nothing to dent my tuition and room and board costs, and like I said, no federal financial aid in sight. 
So then I defaulted to my second choice, West Liberty University, which admittedly had a major more tailored to me and my goals anyway (Zoo Sci). The problem is upon visitation yesterday, the financial aid office informed us about a bunch of fees specifically for the Zoo Sci program that doubled my tuition and put it on par with OU. Their offer? 1,000 plus PROMISE (4,750). We left without even beginning the tour because I didn’t want to tour and fall in love with another school that was out of the question. 
Not to mention my mother only has one university in mind for me: Marshall University, which I absolutely hated when I visited. She’s gone as far to even say that she will refuse to help me UNLESS I attend MU, and while I know she’s allowed to do that, it’s just really a punch in the gut. 
I’m now at my wits end. Every college I applied to I applied in Environmental Sci but I want something more specifically focused with wildlife so I can one day work in an aviary or zoo, but I don’t know where to find that. My next opportunity seems to be an Advertising/Graphic Design major at Concord, and despite really enjoying designing and already having a Graphic Design certification from my vocational school, I’m not sure if that’s what I want to study and do for the rest of my life. I also honestly am just unsure about Concord. 
Anything really helps, because right now I feel hopeless and my mom even suggested not going to college at all (we got in a screaming match over WLU yesterday and she said a lot of things not so nicely). If I don’t go to college I’d mostly be interested in dog grooming, I guess. 

Basically the advice I’m seeking is: Was anyone else in this situation and it ended up working out? Did anyone else have to go into a second choice major and have it work out? Genuinely, what should I do?",28Mar2019,3

I’ve dreamt about this school since sophomore year of high school, worked super hard to get a good scholarship, and loved the idea of knowing nobody. I honestly had a really good first semester. I rushed a sorority, made a solid friend group, and came out as gay to most of the close people in my life, started a relationship, and just started feeling a lot more confident. Towards the end of first semester and beginning of this semester things started catching up to me. My anxiety has gotten off the charts bad. I have a panic attack at least once a week. I’m pretty sure I’m depressed. I realized that I’ve never actually had a deep conversation with any of my friends and that I don’t actually like them that much. I now don’t really enjoy my sorority because frat parties and shallow conversations can only be entertaining for so long. I’m in the process of dropping because I can’t really afford it especially when I don’t enjoy being in it. My girlfriend broke up with me and she was the one person I genuinely liked here. I know that there has to be SO many people here that I’d like being friends with, but I just can’t find them. I’m not socially awkward at all, I’m a bit shy at first, but I’m totally comfortable talking to people. I don’t know how to make new friends and it’s so hard since it’s the end of the year. I also may lose my scholarship anyway since I haven’t worked as hard as I should’ve this semester. I don’t want to go back home necessarily, I don’t think I’ll love the environment better, but I’m not happy here even though I should be. I know a lot of it is probably depression, so that’d of course follow me, but I’m also just so fucking lonely. I’ll go days feeling so terrible and then realize that I haven’t had a full conversation with anyone all day. I’d say about 4-5 days a week the only conversations I have are with my mom or two best friends from home over facetime.

I'm a  happily married man currently living in Italy. A female friend of mine who I used to work with back in the US has asked me if I could pick some stuff up for her while I'm here that she doesnt have access to back in the states.

I didnt think it was a big deal, until she told me it was lingerie, and gave me her sizes. Now it's just weird. There is no way I can explain something like this to my wife, I wouldn't want to hear about her shopping for Male drawers for a Male friend of hers either.

I tried to politely decline but she seems set on it. I searched the specific store and she can totally buy this online.

318,"So, I’m (19m) emotionally damaged, and I would much rather push all my emotions down real deep and keep them locked away, I’ve been doing it a while. Why she (20f) has lots of emotion and always knows how to express the way she feels, while I on the other hand almost can never express how I feel, which makes my depression worse. We talked today about how she needs someone who will be able to be there for her emotionally, because I’m not, and she just doesn’t know if she can be with me if I can fix my emotions. 

The incident that I think caused my depression, was my dad leaving, and then being manipulative to my mom, and my mom being more focused on trying to get my dad back rather than how it affected the kids. My girlfriend thinks that when he left, I was trying to show her I was fine and be her rock while at the same time she did that for us, but it really affected all of us drastically and we didn’t need rocks we need pillows to cry on. 

I honestly don’t know what to do or think because for so long I’ve just pushed everything down and tried to forget everything bad and I’ve always been fine just trying to forget the bad and move on. But I’m always still depressed. “Brief commercial like glimpses of happiness” is what wade wilson says and I honestly don’t know if anything could be more true. I’ve been depressed for so long it’s hard to remember when I wasn’t always depressed. I don’t know if ever can come to term with my emotions and idek what they are. I don’t know what if feeling because so many different emotions run through my head all the time. Smoking weed used to help me forget but now I just be smoking and still sad. 

I always feel bored and like I’m not doing enough, but I have a full time job and Im a full time college student. I never feel good enough. I always just feel so lost, anxious, and confused. I feel like I’ll never not be depressed and that nothing I ever could would fix the problems I have.  I don’t want to lose my girlfriend, but I don’t know if I can fix or handle my emotions.

322,"I am not sure if I overreacted about my boyfriend's weed usage. It really makes me feel disgusted and anxious, which I told him already. He even agreed not to smoke when I'm around. Recently I found out he's been high multiple times when I've been to his place, which means he did the one thing that makes me uncomfortable in front of me, lying about it. Not sure why weed makes me so anxious, what should I do? I feel like he is less present and more inconsiderate when high. I love him but I constantly feel worried when he is with his friends, I always suspected that he is smoking. Yesterday I asked him to tell me when he smokes so that I am aware what state of mind he is in - is this too much of me to ask? I feel like our relationship works well, but the only problem that has come up multiple times again and again is my issue with his smoking habits. He said he wasn't thinking when he did it and even a part of him thought that he could 'show' me that weed doesnt affect him so much. Im really upset and i never thought he could do something like this, he is the most considerate person i know, but since he told me this i am having doubts.

328,"I have had, for the most part, a very happy marriage with my husband. However, we fight all the time. About one specific thing: His father. We'll call him Mark.

Mark lives close by us, about 10 mins away. He is a lifelong alcoholic, but has binges that work like 2-3 weeks no drinking, then 2-3 weeks doing nothing but drinking. Ad nauseam.

Despite ruining my husband's entire life, he is the only family he has left and is very important to him. I totally understand this and even I love the guy when he's not on the drink.

But Mark relies on us for everything. He calls as soon as the grocery opens for us to bring him his bottle, he calls in the middle of the night or while at work when he needs something, and demands we get it for him immediately. There is no thanks involved at any point here. Even when he's not drinking, our days are filled with activities to keep him busy, which leaves no room and privacy for our own relationship. (He literally strolls into our house any time he pleases)

Mark has a dog and a cat. They are poor souls and I honestly believe they'd be better off in the ground. Saying that breaks my heart because I love animals more than anything, but they aren't taken care of at all. Mark will sit there drunkenly eating a pizza while I walk in, feed and water his animals and give his dog a walk. No thank you, just telling me to leave. We live in a very very rural area where there's no animal shelter. I've tried taking his pets off him and bringing them back with me, but they had never left his house/yard before and were absolutely terrified and the dog tried to eat my cat. So that didn't last long. Luckily someone is coming to try to re-home them but I don't know how it will go.

I managed to get my husband to stop getting him his every bottle and making him call a taxi for himself. Unfortunately, Mark still uses guilt tactics on my husband when he wants to save $ on his taxi fare, saying that he's ""coming off it"" and needs help. Then my husband will drop whatever we are doing, like having dinner or our plans today to go hiking, to go get him his bottle. His reasoning is that if Mark goes to the store himself in a taxi, he might just stock up on alcohol instead of coming off it. I understand, but I realize it's still enabling Mark, and ruining our relationship.

I will add that I have tried for so long to help Mark in every way possible. I've taken him to the hospital countless times and sat with him for hours until he could be admitted for detox. He refuses point blank to go to AA, see a counselor or anything like that. He hasn't been able to show any commitment to not drinking long enough to be admitted at no out of pocket expense to a rehab facility, and neither one of us come close to being able to fund it. One of our hospital's senior doctors told us he's at the final stage of alcohol dependence and he sees no chance of it changing.

I know that Mark is going to kill himself eventually with his drinking. He already has a multitude of heart issues, ulcers and liver issues. But of the pain and suffering in my husband's heart and in our relationship, I see no end in sight. My husband gets very angry and upset when I suggest we continue with our plans instead of getting him a bottle. He says ""I just can't do anything right, can I?"". He feels like Mark and I are tearing him in two different directions and he can never make us both happy.

Everyone tells him that he needs to focus on his own life instead of Mark. We have talked about how we would love to start a family but we can't as our lives revolve around this adult baby. I hate to seem so cold hearted towards him but we have tried everything to help and all he has done is shred our relationship.

She also said things to make me think she might be flirting like ‘age is just a number’, she asked if I thought she was ugly and I found myself getting flustered and resisting the urge to say she’s cute, and I just said she definitely wasn’t ugly. She also said she’s fundamentally the same person as when she was about my age, which I found surprising.

Just the other day we had a chat on the phone and she’s so upbeat and vibrant, for a second I legitimately forgot I was talking to a 50-year old woman. I saw a picture of her when she was about my age and I was awed at how cute she was. She looks pretty similar still, just older. I got legitimately sad I couldn’t have met her when she was my age because she’s so vibrant and full of life, empathetic, and beautiful. 

I’m terrified of rejection though so I feel like my feelings for her should dissipate. I considered telling her I thought the picture of her was really cute and: “I would have definitely asked you out!” Flattering huh?

2) as your future roomate am i going to have to worry about your bills being payed because you called off
3) as your direct supervisor am i going to have to worry about you calling off everytime your girlfriend is off or you two hangout

342,"(I'm male) So i met this guy (X) at a sport group thing a couple of years ago, which happens weekly, and i was already friends with the organiser of the group and so when X came along and started coming frequently he decided to become friends with me and the organiser. Which was all cool, as a tight 3 friends. Me and X became really close, and we would go out weekly for quite a long time.

Then this night happened where X was being a dick on text messages and long story short i thought I'm not going to pick up his calls tonight if he calls and so he did and i didnt pick up. He called like 10 times back to back wtf. That pissed him off a lot i think. However i did send a message the day after saying i was busy with so and so and we can catch up soon. He never responded to that.

Now here is where the problem comes in, quite a lot of people go to this sport group thing which is still running. And it's really clear that X has made a mental decision to never text me or call me again. I can sense this and i dont call him or text him since that bad night. We have mutual friends from the group and he tries really hard to hang out with them and oftentimes we are both in the same social gathering with these other mutual friends and X does talk to me but not a lot and it just fucks up the feel of the gatherings because i dont like the awkwardness/tension of it because he's there.

Take this for example, the other night me and these mutual friends were having a group phone call, but when X got on the line he made a effort to mention all the other guys' names and ask them questions (but not me ofcourse, its just really obvious) , and acted like i dont exist.

Sure i could make and effort to repair things but hes so set on this ""you dont exist shit"" that i just think fuck this X guy hes a fuckwit.

What should i do?

How should i handle things?

Admittedly, i feel like he's pissing me off much more than vice versa.

Like even at some of these mutual friends gatherings that ive gone to where i knew he would be there, ive thought if he makes any cheap shot remarks im just gonna abuse him and if it comes to a fight then so be it. But he he doesnt really do that.

“I wonder why people can’t simply research the university’s name for only a minute to find out immediately that the website is sketchy and the address leads to an apartment near a gas station”

i had a huge fight with someone very important to me that i panicked, couldn't think and said i'm probaly better off dead as i could do nothing right with her (we often get into fights and i'm repeatedly always the one who did something wrong and usually everytime i defend myself she still retorts and i'm really confused wether i'm the actual wrong one or if she cant admit she can be wrong or hotheaded sometimes) but in result i usually take it seriously as everytime it happens it is me, i always do something wrong, so i snapped and said indeed i'm better off dead to her so even if she has feelings for me she can move on easier once i'm completely gone, and i left but i was too scared to do it as i still thought about my family and her that i did not want to hurt  anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

(short note; she was already stressed at the time so she was already sensitive but she often directs that stress into anger towards me and i cannot handle people getting so mad at me)

&amp;#x200B;

she had spammed me after and we ended up in a discord call the entire night sobbing to eachother and she said she almost killed herself to come after me too and she didnt want me to die.

&amp;#x200B;

however the following morning while i was still feeling lost and guilty i tried to repeatedly apologize and ask her if she was alright, im sorry i scared her, i couldn't do it anyway, i still felt like shit too, etc. etc. but even so all she wanted to talk was i traumatized her, she feels like shit, i have no idea how much this effected her, told me not to speak with her untill she's over it, told me to shut up about it. while i kind of get her anger since it is a big shock and i would be very upset too, i felt still terrible that i still couldn't talk, she didn't ask if i was okay, why, she didn't want to check up on me or seemed to act like i didnt do anything and i just angered her, i don't know if its selfish, but i hoped she would have at least asked me how i was feeling or if i was okay, especally since she got mad at me earlier for it.

&amp;#x200B;

(short context to that getting mad; her classmate had an illness so she gets seizures, goes crazy, sees hallucinations, and it's effecting her and her classmates mental health, when she told me the classmate had a seizure, almost died i asked if she was alright, is she in the hospital, i hope she's okay, and then when she told me how upset she was and also that no one cares about her and the classmates mental health (just like me) i ofcourse spoke to her about it, but she accused me of caring more about others than her, and she got mad that i did not directly ask how she was feeling or if she was okay, it'sa  bit of a seperate story but worth mentioning because i dont know if i was the asshole in this too or not.)

&amp;#x200B;

do you have any advice on how to handle this? am i wrong? is she wrong? should i talk to her about it? should i leave it?",28Mar2019,1
350,"So I seem to have chronic problems with self-sabotaging behaviours that I think stem from an inferiority complex. I've been to therapy off and on but never had this formally 'diagnosed' by a therapist - just if I'm honest with myself, I'm pretty sure that's what's going on. I've tried CBT but I still find myself in the same situation over and over at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the last five years I've held four jobs, all in the same field at similar companies (small, higher growth), and in each I've come to distrust and resent my superiors on the management team. The resentment has always stemmed from an uncomfortable situation, usually where I'm embarrassed by someone in front of others or come away from an interaction feeling stupid. I then stew over it, and become hypersensitive to anything else negative that happens and try to run away from the problems. In a couple of these cases the managers have been genuinely abusive (sending harshly critical text messages on my day off; commenting on my appearance) but most of the time I feel I'm overreacting.

&amp;#x200B;

These feelings aren't entirely random as I've had a few traumatic life changes in the past five years. I've always struggled with self-esteem, and married young to someone who I felt was out of my league. While we were married he gradually became distant, which I tolerated because I put his happiness before my own (I was 100% a doormat). When I finally tried to confront him about our problems, he denied anything was wrong. The relationship finally deteriorated into divorce, and in the end he told me he had been lonely for the entire marriage because I wasn't smart or cultured enough to be good company for him. I rarely talk about this with anyone as I'm so ashamed about the whole thing - few of my friends know this, let alone anyone I work with.

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately after that, I was on my own for the first time in my adult life, and got a new job at an exciting start up. I felt a bit out of my depth from the get go, but I really liked my manager and felt I was learning quickly. Emotionally I was a wreck from the breakup but I did my best. During the first three months in my new role, the company went through a financial downturn and my manager was fired. The weeks leading up to this were horrible: the CEO of the company was a drug addict who routinely screamed at staff, and it became clear he wasn't impressed with me once I no longer had an intermediary between us. I was laid off the day before my probation was due to end, via email.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, with each new job, I've become increasingly sensitive to people I work with thinking I'm stupid or disrespecting me, to the point where I can no longer stand to be around those I feel have slighted me. Most of the time I do a reasonably good job in my work - my field is high pressure and I've steadily increased my pay and seniority. I've even been promoted in one of these situations. But it's now at the point where I feel I'm intentionally sabotaging my career in trying to avoid or being aggressive towards people I distrust, or who might embarrass me. This thinking leads me to do things I later regret, and treat others badly. Which causes more shame and embarrassment.  

&amp;#x200B;

I really like my current job but find myself having the same thoughts about my new boss, as he's a poor communicator and sometimes says vaguely insulting things in meetings. I tell myself he's probably not doing this on purpose, and that I'm almost certainly overreacting, but I find myself repeating the same pattern of coming to dislike him and am increasingly avoiding him.

&amp;#x200B;

IDK if anyone will read this, but I could really use some advice from anyone who has been through something similar. I feel like an alien sometimes, or like I'm just crazy. Maybe I should go back to therapy but I feel like there must be ways I can teach myself to diffuse these feelings. Then again, I sometimes just think I'm in the wrong field/company type for me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I resent everyone who makes me feel stupid at work and don't know how to get over it.",28Mar2019,1

352,"Back story: in 2008-9 my dad got diagnosed with brain cancer. He got a few surgeries, lots of treatment but ended up passing away from this in 2012. I was around 16yo at the time so I was not made fully aware of any underlying situations, instead was always told things were ‘ok’ and learnt not to ask questions

As I am a student and still live at home, growing up I have noticed over the years the financial and emotional toll this event has taken on my mother.. even to this day
She does not deserve this life and I have become pretty self sufficient in an attempt to help the strain on her/her finances. However she still struggles with money and I don’t make anywhere near enough to give her any to help out. 

More importantly, although she doesn’t show it a lot.. I know she is lonely. Only recently has she expressed to me that it has been so hard to lose the person you did everything with. She has very little friends and gets upset when my brother and I aren’t home, though never guilts is about it. 

I love doing things with her and we do go out for meals or out hiking when we have time but I want to do more for her!! 
I’ve offered to help her create an online dating profile which she is 50/50 about and feels as though she lacks the social skills to connect with anyone.

I hate seeing her like this and want to help make her life happier/easier. Any advise on what to do about any of these issues will be greatly appreciated. Thank you! ",28Mar2019,1
353,"Well, for context; im 15 years old, my Mother died half a year ago and im left with my little brother and my very little undersanding dad.

The situation is the next: i currently go to a technical school, wich i hate because i have 0 interés in becoming a technician, so i have to stay 10 hours a Day in here instead of the usual 5.

My dad wanted me to come here anyway because supposedly i would get out of here working, thing that i soon realised wasnt true.

Thing is, im fucking tires already, im in 11th year and i have to get up at five in the morning, eat, exercise for 20m because i dont have more time, and then go to school. I get home at 6pm, i pick up my brother from school, go to the gym and i arrive at 7:45. Then i cook dinner, and then the food for the following Day so i end all that at 9pm aprox. And that's not even counting studying, that is almost doble of a regular school. So i end up at 11pm, exahuated and i do not have even time for working on myself, i would love to learn programming, economy and a lot more but i simply do not have the time, and im constantly exhausted because im going to a high school that drains me all for nothing in return.

tl;dr: im very tired of beign 10 hours in school, im constantly exahuated and i want to go to another one but i cant decide. ",28Mar2019,0
354,"I got home at 2:00 in the afternoon yesterday and my roommate came in shortly after. He's my best friend but he's a bit kept to himself. He's also very intellig, he thinks for himself and often disregards rules and laws at age 18. He and I smoke weed and drink occasionally (I much less than him). He also has tried acid, xanax, drink and drive, driven illegally, etc. Along those lines where I can't tell him to stop because he won't, but he's oddly resposible with it nontheless.

Anyways, we got home and he had bought beer the day before. I had one and over the course of the afternoon (more like 2 hours) he had 3. We went on a trip outside because he wanted to walk around.

Over the course of 30 minutes I kind of babysat him through the streets as he took people's mail and threw it everywhere, pushed over trashcans, went to the leasing office asking why the pool isn't open, going to a community pantry and destroying the food, and then to finish it off jumping the fence to swim anyways. 

This is when I was worried about him because usually it's him telling me to be wary of what I say and do in public. I wanted to be there for him though to make sure he got home so I stood by his side and followed him. As we got back home we called a friend asking him to come over and then played video games. He seemed happy as he usually does while drinking.

A couple minutes later he said he didn't want to play the game, he just wanted to, ""wallow in self hatred"" in his room. I told him to go ahead and go do that. I assumed he was going to fall asleep of watch YouTube or something. About 3 minutes later I hear the door open, so I stumbled into the living room to make sure he isn't going to go on another ""adventure"". Instead he had opened the back porch door, so I went back there amd said, ""Hey, you good? What are you doing"" he started with the ""I hate my life"" crap that I rarely ever get from him so I just told him he should go to his room.

A couple seconds later he had his leg over the back porch fence and I pulled him back holding him telling him to go to his room. He told me that it's his choice and then he pushed me off  anf tried again. He got all but his leg over so I grabbed him by the neck and pulled him onto the porch. I started telling him he was scaring me and that he needs to go to his room. At this point I was more hugging him tightly. He just threw me on the couch we have on our porch obviously trying not to hurt me and tried again. This time I did my best choke hold and choked him to the ground. He again lifted me up, threw me down and tried one last time. This time after I pulled him down I punched him when he stood back up. I am like half his size so I knew it didn't hurt him, it just shocked him enough to stumble back down. I told him I care about him and that he's scaring me. He told me to shut the fuck up, flipped me over, and elbowed me. He tried to get back up so from under him I just punched him as hard as I could in the nose. At this point he was angry but it was almost over. I flipped him back over onto his chest and sat on him. He told me he hated me and I was only hurting him for ego and I don't care about him. As he bled he kept trying to get bwck up but I started holding onto his hair so it wouldn't hurt him unless he moved. He just kind of dragged himself across the floor trying to get up. His phone fell out of his pocket so I told his mom and dad to come and they both left work. He felt bad and smore pissed at me because he thinks his parents will lose their jobs.

After his dad came I got off of him and he took one more run for it and his dad oinned him down. His dad and I were crying at this point while he cointinued to scream how much he hates his life and basically finally open up to all of his problems. He went and stayed with his mom and dad and I with my step-mom. Now it's the next day and the last thing he told me is that he hates me and he hopes I die. 

I hope he forgets what he told me and just understands what I did. His parents thanked me and now my life is just really confusing. I hope that he doesn't ditch me as a friend, not only because I need a roommate, but because I'm the only friend he has still in town after highschool and I think he needs a friend no matter how much he denies it.

357,"I have no idea what to do here. The uncle is on my mom's side, and is honestly the worst person involved in my life. He's the type of dealer who gives whatever for free to hook kids in. He's been arrested but let go so many times because there's no room in the prison (Amazing prison laws here). Never mind the fact that he still lives in his 80 year old mother's house and has overdosed like 6 times and made it back due to my aunt who also lives there reviving him. He never learns, he just does it over and over, and ruins so many lives. He's wanted in several states outside the border, but he can't be arrested in this state apparently. Nobody wants him around. But he can't be taken care of. The solution to this would just be to stop communicating with him, but my dad won't stop. He contacts him on his phone very often, takes my mom's car, and has adventures for hours before coming home. He lies about the whole thing even when my grandma sees him show up and pick him up. He lies about it every time. His whole attitude changes when he knows he did something wrong. I believe they trade medication and heroin and whatever else. My dad is handicapped and needs medication or else he's in pain. But then he goes, when he's already taken his meds to visit. He even does things like deleting all his phone messages where they plan to meet so my mom doesn't see them. He's also entirely depended on her, as she spends all of her time working, and he does nothing but sit on his phone all day, or going to see ""you know who."" He's almost always high on something, because he can barely keep his eyes open falling asleep. It's been like this several years now. I really don't know what to do. Never mind the fact my dad's crashed 3 cars due to it. Both sides of my extended family are all extremely trashy and involved with drugs. I'm just lost on how to deal with my ""uncle"" and get him out of my dad's life. I know it's his choice, but he never changes. He takes his life for granted. I don't think he could survive living alone for a single day. I just want him to stop. He's lied to my face about never going to see him again just yesterday. I'm assuming he did again today, but of course, he lies about everything, so I know he'll see him again. If anyone could help me in this I would appreciate it. Thanks.",28Mar2019,2
358,"I'm currently a 21-year-old stay at home wife/mother. That said, I'm planning on continuing my bachelor's degree this October. My husband is 24, he's sweet and understanding about my situation and state of mind, but I can feel it sometimes hurting our relationship. So here is everything that happened, in a nutshell, more or less... Please keep in mind it's very, very hard for me to write this down. It's the first time I've shared this with anyone but my therapist and my husband. I'm scared, but I want to let it out.  
My parents divorced when I was very little. I grew up with my dad picking me up for visits maybe once a year, if not less. He didn't show much interest in me (despite saying differently) and established a new family. My mother treated me okay, maybe it was a bit overwhelming for her at times to be a single mother. Anyways, I was always a very good and rather timid kid. Never acted out, mostly listened to my mother &amp; relatives... although I was always rather stubborn and bossy. When I got into high school, I changed a lot. I wanted to be popular and strayed further away from my usual hobbies. Maybe it was the hormones, or maybe the divorce got to me? I don't know. My mother found a boyfriend which I didn't like, he called me out whenever I tried to get my way with her and thus prevented me from doing things I otherwise would've done no problem. I started hanging out with more and more toxic people because of a love interest. He rejected me after a month or so and from occasionally taking drugs with him I started doing them quite often. Pills, amphetamines, alcohol, anything (without heroin, etc.) that I could get my hands on. This went undetected by my mother for a while, then they caught me, but it didn't matter. I gradually lost interest in school, my grades dropped, I plunged into depression for seemingly no reason at all. I overdosed twice, both time hospitalised. I only realise I had tried to take my own life now, after years have passed. Back then I thought I had just 'made a mistake' with my dosage. Around 17 years old I lost my virginity. After that I had sexual interactions with 20-30 people. Some of them were boyfriends, others 'friends', etc. I felt I was inadequate for not having sex before I had it. My 'friend' group reinforced that notion into my head. Looking back that is the time I started loosing most of my real friends, the people that were around me for years couldn't stand what I had become.  
When I was 18, I met a person who introduced me to an awful, awful crowd of about 2-3 guys. This is the part I hate the most... I believe I was groomed by all three of them and had had sexual interactions with all three of them as well. One of them was a self-recognised paedophile. He actively pursued girls 13-16 when he was 30+ of age. He also threatened to kill me and manipulated me into letting him into my home so he could have sex with me when I was severely feverish. The other one spiked my drink on another occasion and raped me with two of his friends. I don't remember anything of that night, only the morning after. Just the thought of it makes me want to kill myself sometimes. My mother knows of the fact that three people 'visited me' at once, but she doesn't know they raped me. To this day she thinks I invited them, but I fear I can never tell her.   


To top it off, I was behaving disgustingly with all people around me. I even hit one of my friends in a drunken rage that I do not recall and on another occasion stole money from my mother. My father found me and beat me in front of my mother for this. She didn't do anything to stop him, but I understand them. I was just a piece of shit back then...

To wrap this up, all these 'incidents' that transpired in my teenage years started haunting me after my 20th birthday. I changed drastically, sobered up, etc. I couldn't believe what I had done. How I had been. It still haunts me, every single day I think about it and I feel crippling anxiety to go out in the city because of fear I might meet one of them or that I might get called out for being a 'whore' or a 'terrible person'. I feel almost unbearable shame when I recall one of my previous 'episodes'. I feel unworthy for my husband, I feel like damaged goods, I feel resentful and hateful towards myself for my past. I almost feel like all that I've managed to fix and become now - a good student, a fairly good mother, a good friend - is meaningless when compared to my past deeds. I wish I could have kept myself for my husband. Despite him saying he's come to terms with my past, I sometimes don't believe him. I believe he would've been better with someone purer than I am.

At the same time I do try to be strong and stand up for myself when I've been taken advantage of and screwed over.   


Without getting into the nitty gritty of my situation basically I was honest about myself and the other person took advantage of me. I would not have realized the enormity of lies and deception but he decided to pursue a public role and had he not been chosen for one of the roles I would have never learned about the entirety of the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

He did not do anything illegal but at the same time it is extremely immoral. If I stand up for myself I am worried that I will be hit back with defamation. Not sure the legalities of things but nothing I am saying is a lie other than my truth and that has since been validated by another person who was in a similar position and someone who was involved with managing the program of that public role and they were also trying to figure out how to address him because his actions were egregious and not the actions of a genuine person who should not be in that position. 

&amp;#x200B;

This story could go viral due to the nature of the role he decided to pursue. He chose to be in a public spotlight (national television) regardless of us coming forth or not. it was because he chose to be on national television and his role was announced that we started discovering the truth about him.

I am not super religious but I do believe things work themselves out and if not God, then Karma will get him. However I do want to be strong and stand up for myself and make it clear that I will not just sit back and let him think what he did was ok.

I don’t know if there is any connections but every time I get into a relationship or attempt to, my mental health seems to spiral.

I had been single for 3 years and I worked extremely hard on my mental health and got the help I needed and was in a great place. 

Then I started a relationship and all of that seems to have just flown out of the window. I feel mentally drained constantly, everything makes me anxious or scared and I just feel like the worse I’ve felt in years.

This has nothing to do with the person I am with, they’re amazing and have helped and allowed me to talk my emotions freely and are extremely supportive and understanding. 

It may be linked to how my previous relationship they constantly downsized my problems and told me that I didn’t have anxiety because it’s not as bad as theirs (I do have anxiety and only received help for it last year due to my denial and this comment).

369,"I went to a rigorous high school and enjoyed my first 3 years. But this year my life has been ruined by one class. It was giving me so much trouble that I started developing panic attacks and had to quit my sport. I am so so worried that because of this class I just won’t have any motivation come freshman year in college, because I will of course be locked into miserable courses I don’t want to take. Lots of them. More than now, even.


I don’t know why but this class actually makes me so miserable. No other class has done this before. It has made me completely rethink my decisions in life. I had no absenses for two years straight sophomore and junior year because even though I was in rigorous college level chemistry and bio courses and doing a sport I never had to miss tests because I understood all the material if I put in the time. With this class, no. No matter what I do I can’t seem to do well on the exams nor can I absorb the material. I don’t get why. The only thing I can think of is I only took AB Calc so I don’t know enough math for this class, and I can’t ask this teacher questions because he doesn’t answer them. 


The teacher also consistently puts exams on major college decision dates. I have a test tomorrow even though regular decisions come out tonight for most colleges. And the tests cover incomprehensibly large amounts of material. It’s so difficult for me because I have literally tried EVERYTHING but there is no way to do well in this course other than to drop every single thing and study all day every day for at least 2 days, even while I do all the homeworks (which take me about 4-5 hr/week to do) and rewrite my notes after each class. That’s why I miss school. A test from his class means I literally cannot do any other assignment or anything enjoyable.


I am so worried that this is what college is gonna be like for me but without a safety net of my family. I feel so disillusioned. It feels like everything I once valued about myself - hardworker, good student, good attendance, athlete - is just breaking down. I feel like I’ve become a nothing. ",28Mar2019,1

371,"So I’ve never asked out a woman before and I’ve been trying to socialize more. I have social anxiety and never approach, let alone talk with a stranger. I’ve told myself I want to change that though, so I’ve tried to make the effort to talk to more men and women in my daily life.

Recently I went to visit a city and asked a waitress for her insta, feeling our conversations were decent. I just said I’d give return the favor and give her travel tips if she ever visits where I live. I particularly thought this was different because she seemed to go out of her way to tell me places to visit without me asking, asking a little about me and having a fun conversation about regional slang. I felt it was a big move for me to actually go that far but in hindsight I should’ve just realized *she’s paid to be nice*. I feel terrible for putting her in an uncomfortable situation in which she may not have been at all interested, merely talking to me because she represents the restaurant. I know I messed up and won’t do it again. Should I just not reach out to her now?

And if this is important: I would only be interested in friendship/giving her travel recommendations anyways, not anything romantic. ",28Mar2019,1

He just walked off and I got onto the next bus and cried.

So we texted but I realized that I was the one always messaging her and there was nothing coming from her I had hard times keeping up conversations so we texted less and less. One day she didn't even read the message i send her and she didn't even get it. So i had to realise that she had a new number months passed and one day I decided to search for her on social media. Well I have found her on IG. But what could i say there was nothing left from her old personality I had a crush on. She appears to be the most superficial person I have ever seen begging people to follow her on Snapchat. It saddened me to death seeing her old self fade away. But i decided to write her anyway maybe hoping to change something. I also want to tell how I feel about her but i don't know how. I want her to show what she was and what she became.

375,"I feel like there's the contradictory pull within me to both play it relaxed and also to guide or determine where a connection is going.  

There's also the contradiction in modern dating rules that you should be upfront and communicate what you want.  But how is that being fluid or a complex person?  And isn't dating kind of a time to *discover more of who you are and what you're looking for*? 

If you play it too relaxed and fluid, perhaps nothing will develop.  For certain people, that might come off as ""commitment issues.""  Or it might be perceived as fickle.  Maybe they are right.  It might make you question what your intentions are, but are we really required to have intentions?

377,"My mom had a really really rough childhood, lots of deaths in the family. It feels likes she's struggled in all the major categories of life: several major deaths, ptsd &amp;amp;amp; major depression, illness without cure, being very poor, abuse, etc. also it's like she has this supernatural ability to absorb the emotions/energy of others. the strong emotional association has given her an incredibly memory (and so of many negative things), and she has a hard time going out if there's too much negative energy around her. important to understand here is this makes it difficult to keep her spirits up, and ultimately affects her immune system.
My grandma died years back, she was our entire world. My mom isnt barely functioning like she once was, but still really struggles, more than she shows I think.
Her whole department was let off last fall and the only person that's gotten a job works at a gas station, despite all having college degrees. she's scared. we've been living off unemployment benefits, and getting her job applications rejected every week is really killing her. She has no support from family. All of our family that was there for us died. for various reasons she does not feel finding comfort in friends is an option right now.
So she has a good break down occasionally already, and she's really lost it this year. But in the last week or so she's completely fallen. I'm not exaggerating when I say she's constantly on the edge of tears. half the time I cry just looking at her, but I can't offer her the support she needs, I feel terrible and don't want to leave her alone.
she feels like a terrible mom for rarely being physically healthy enough to do much with me and now also has extreme guilt, saying she promised she'd give her child a better life than she had. I don't want her to feel like that at all. she doesn't want to cry in front me, saying I don't need to see this. she is the one that needs to be here for me. my development. etc.
but this means she talks to no one. she's the strongest person I know to be able to keep so much in but she just looks so broken now. it's a very new uncomfortable feeling to see your parents feel so helpless you know? my mom always figured it out.

So what should I do?
She's not comfortable with counselors. She doesn't have family/friends to confide in. 2 nights ago actually she had really lost it and wanted me to ask a family friend who is a counselor to talk to her, but didn't want him to know she had me ask for her. she didn't want to be a bother and she's embarrassed, but the fact that she actually asked shows how desperate she is for help. she'd never ask. but he didn't reach out the way she expected, and she wants to go back to closing herself off.
She's not suicidal, or won't go while I'm here. I don't want to make her uncomfortable and get other people in her business without her permission, I'm not fully comfortable explaining all of our problems out loud to get her help, but of course I'll do whatever for her.",28Mar2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

I am somewhat torn about whether I should take this internship or not. I am 22F and got an offer to be an intern for a company to learn and develop for amazing gear. It would certainly help to better my coding skills, and they even offered to do my final thesis with them. However, this is in the summer vacation and 40 hours a week, meaning that after this semester ends (I am a master student) I would immediately begin working there.

&amp;#x200B;

The internship offers a nice opportunity to learn what I am interested in, and the people I will be working with are really kind. The only thing I am worried about is that I may overwork myself or work myself to the point of burnout if I accept the offer. It may sound selfish or spoiled, but I am thinking out of a perspective of self care, I am still very grateful I got such an offer in the first place. I do get a paid week off to go on vacation with my family.

396,"Okay, so this is gonna be a long one.

Have a roommate I’ve known for 15 years. She’s been my roomie for a year and sometime by the end of last year she got back with an ex. Before that, only issues I had with her was her cleanliness and keeping up with our end of the chores, using my dishes and leaving them dirty (by now I actually got new dishes and gave her my old ones, cause they were pretty worn out). She also tried getting my food in the beginning but I set my foot down and said get your own groceries.

So, with the ex thing, first things first: I had come home one evening and she saw me. Said hi, yada yada. Then right after she went to her room. Minutes later I start hearing her moaning and realize she had someone over and she’s having sex. It was SO uncomfortable. Then it happened again and I sat down with her and told her hey, that’s damn uncomfortable for me and disrespectful. You do your business privately. So she started to. Then, sometime after, the manager called me IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT (they live below us) they were being noisy against the floor (bed shaking etc) and they weren’t letting them sleep. After that he mentioned it in person and I was soooo embarrassed. Note: she’s not on the lease. I didn’t put her on the lease cause I didn’t trust her to be on it. And I was right. But regardless I told her about it and to calm tf down. She was making my life hell and threatening my livelihood for the fact that the place I’m renting isn’t at the price it should be, but the manager did me the favor of not telling the office anything.

Another note; I sacrificed a lot to get this place. Was in an abusive relationship with a sociopath for so many years. Was naive af but things ended three years ago, moved from our old apt to this one (originally I was gonna move back wit my mom). The apt manager was a coworker of the *thing*. So he got the place at a huge discount. And he told me I’d have my own room and we both could save money. It was both a curse and a blessing at once. The six months he was here, he nearly broke me mentally, emotionally and spiritual with his psychological and emotional manipulations and literally tortured me. But that’s when I taught myself about his type, absorbed a lot of knowledge and learned to stand up for myself (I couldn’t live on my own, and going back to my mom meant more abuse again). 

He ended up leaving for the military. And finally, I had my independence and didn’t have to go back to my mom. From there I’ve had a few roommates in the past two years (the sociopath is still on the lease, cause I basically got added so he wouldn’t have to break it). 

Regardless, I sacrificed so much for this place, after all that I had been through for so long. It’s where I’ve been able to heal so much, become my own person and discover who I am after never really been able to since I was a kid. 

And I’m grateful to the manager and I told him such when he said he didn’t tell the office of the price for the apt (it should be about 300 dollars more than the current price). 

So, after that incident, I talked with her and she blamed her zodiac impulsiveness blah blah blah. But she admitted shame and regret. 

Now the other issue: he’s practically living here. He was staying over a lot. I told her hey, is he gonna be living here or what? You’re my roommate. Not him. So we’ve talked about it, settled what i thought was gonna be a compromise (this dude has his own apt).

Then the manager calls me super early with the same issue again and he was PISSED. I was PISSED. Told her, hey, I told you and you know what, he can’t stay over anymore. He can see you during the day but he can’t stay over anymore. 

She was pissed but whatever. Well she started sneaking him in. I’m a super early riser because of work and I’d see him leave the apt through my window. I brought it up to her and she responds with “that’s messed up. What do I pay rent for?” I replied with, you pay rent to live here. For YOU. 

She never replied. I brought it up to her again but In questions and she kept lying to me. And I told her recently, I know he’s been sleeping over a lot. And she’s told me it’s none of my business what she does with her life and she’s tired of explaining herself etc.

I told her I don’t like to be lied to. I’ve brought up another time of hearing him snoring and I asked her if he’s sleeping over. She basically told me it was her. Cause she “works so hard at minimum wage”. 

He’s still here sleeping over,  walking in here taking showers like he lives here etc. he even got mail here once and I’m watching to see if he gets more to put doesn’t live here.

Now my question is, am I crazy and overreacting? I know she thinks I’m stupid but I’m about to get a second job to support myself and pay rent on my own. I’m about ready to kick her out but I feel guilty and that maybe I’m in the wrong and being a roommate from hell. Or am I just being too nice and the usual stupid me that let’s myself be taken advantage of etc. Standing up for myself is still a learning process.

If I do a gap year, it would be to go in a foreign country to learn the language (I'm learning Chinese so I would probably go there). 

As you noticed, I'm *really* young (skipped a grade and was born at the end of the year) and I'm not sure if this is a good idea to start my Master's degree right now. That would mean I would complete my studies at 21 and I don't really see myself starting to work at 21. Problem is, in my country, Masters students usually get hired right after their degree (or even during!), so doing a gap year right after my Master's degree would lower my chances of finding a job. That means that if I want to do a gap year, it's kind of now or in 5 years. 

What would you do if you were me? Would you finish your studies asap, start to work and then earn money so I could do a gap year in like 5 years or do a gap year now? And if you have similar experiences, I'd love to hear about it! Thanks in advance! ",28Mar2019,1
400,"Okay, so this is gonna be a long one.

Have a roommate I’ve known for 15 years. She’s been my roomie for a year and sometime by the end of last year she got back with an ex. Before that, only issues I had with her was her cleanliness and keeping up with our end of the chores, using my dishes and leaving them dirty (by now I actually got new dishes and gave her my old ones, cause they were pretty worn out). She also tried getting my food in the beginning but I set my foot down and said get your own groceries.

So, with the ex thing, first things first: I had come home one evening and she saw me. Said hi, yada yada. Then right after she went to her room. Minutes later I start hearing her moaning and realize she had someone over and she’s having sex. It was SO uncomfortable. Then it happened again and I sat down with her and told her hey, that’s damn uncomfortable for me and disrespectful. You do your business privately. So she started to. Then, sometime after, the manager called me IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT (they live below us) they were being noisy against the floor (bed shaking etc) and they weren’t letting them sleep. After that he mentioned it in person and I was soooo embarrassed. Note: she’s not on the lease. I didn’t put her on the lease cause I didn’t trust her to be on it. And I was right. But regardless I told her about it and to calm tf down. She was making my life hell and threatening my livelihood for the fact that the place I’m renting isn’t at the price it should be, but the manager did me the favor of not telling the office anything.

Another note; I sacrificed a lot to get this place. Was in an abusive relationship with a sociopath for so many years. Was naive af but things ended three years ago, moved from our old apt to this one (originally I was gonna move back wit my mom). The apt manager was a coworker of the *thing*. So he got the place at a huge discount. And he told me I’d have my own room and we both could save money. It was both a curse and a blessing at once. The six months he was here, he nearly broke me mentally, emotionally and spiritual with his psychological and emotional manipulations and literally tortured me. But that’s when I taught myself about his type, absorbed a lot of knowledge and learned to stand up for myself (I couldn’t live on my own, and going back to my mom meant more abuse again). 

He ended up leaving for the military. And finally, I had my independence and didn’t have to go back to my mom. From there I’ve had a few roommates in the past two years (the sociopath is still on the lease, cause I basically got added so he wouldn’t have to break it). 

Regardless, I sacrificed so much for this place, after all that I had been through for so long. It’s where I’ve been able to heal so much, become my own person and discover who I am after never really been able to since I was a kid. 

And I’m grateful to the manager and I told him such when he said he didn’t tell the office of the price for the apt (it should be about 300 dollars more than the current price). 

So, after that incident, I talked with her and she blamed her zodiac impulsiveness blah blah blah. But she admitted shame and regret. 

Now the other issue: he’s practically living here. He was staying over a lot. I told her hey, is he gonna be living here or what? You’re my roommate. Not him. So we’ve talked about it, settled what i thought was gonna be a compromise (this dude has his own apt).

Then the manager calls me super early with the same issue again and he was PISSED. I was PISSED. Told her, hey, I told you and you know what, he can’t stay over anymore. He can see you during the day but he can’t stay over anymore. 

She was pissed but whatever. Well she started sneaking him in. I’m a super early riser because of work and I’d see him leave the apt through my window. I brought it up to her and she responds with “that’s messed up. What do I pay rent for?” I replied with, you pay rent to live here. For YOU. 

She never replied. I brought it up to her again but In questions and she kept lying to me. And I told her recently, I know he’s been sleeping over a lot. And she’s told me it’s none of my business what she does with her life and she’s tired of explaining herself etc.

I told her I don’t like to be lied to. I’ve brought up another time of hearing him snoring and I asked her if he’s sleeping over. She basically told me it was her. Cause she “works so hard at minimum wage”. 

He’s still here sleeping over,  walking in here taking showers like he lives here etc. he even got mail here once and I’m watching to see if he gets more to put doesn’t live here.

Now my question is, am I crazy and overreacting? I know she thinks I’m stupid but I’m about to get a second job to support myself and pay rent on my own. I’m about ready to kick her out but I feel guilty and that maybe I’m in the wrong and being a roommate from hell. Or am I just being too nice and the usual stupid me that let’s myself be taken advantage of etc. Standing up for myself is still a learning process. Thank you for reading this and thank you for taking the time to reply your thoughts. 

TL;DR I have a roommate who’s boyfriend has been staying over a lot despite him having his own place. He caused me issues with the manager and she sneaks him in and tells me she’s tired of explaining herself, it’s not my business what she does with her life, etc. Can’t tell if I am the one that’s wrong or not.

410,"Hey Reddit, posting this on mobile blah blah blah anyway 

I work in a restaurant, I've been here for almost a year and I have good standing there, (never late to work, I've called out once because of an allergic reaction but that's it.) the thing is, I have bad scoliosis and I can't be on my feet for long periods of time. The managers all know about this, and I have expressed this multiple times to my manager who does the schedule. I can work as long as my shifts aren't back to back (working a double or was a night shift and then a morning shift) because it's too painful for me. 

I work five days a week already and I spend my time doing physical therapy on one of my days off. I just can't do shifts back to back. 

When my schedule came out I saw I was working tonight and opening tomorrow morning. This schedule came out last weekend. I told my scheduling manager and she said to release the shift and she would take care of it. It didn't get taken care of. a few days after, my schedule for the next few weeks came out and I was working doubles (10am-???, 10 pm at the latest) I reminded her I can't work doubles or back to back shifts and she told me again to release the shifts.

 I decided to change my availability to make sure it doesn't allow for double shifts and she denied it, I asked her why and she said we need more people to work those shifts, I explained again that my only restraint is back to back shifts and that I submitted the change so I can make sure I'm not scheduled them again because I physically can't do them. she told me to make changes and open my availability and request it again. 

So yesterday I checked to see if any changes had been made to my schedule. None. All the conflicting shifts were still there. I sent a message to my GM, AGM, and scheduling manager about the shifts and they fixed the situation with the doubles, but not the close to open shift I'm working tonight. 

I texted my GM and said I appreciate the help, but that tonight's shift is still an issue. I asked him to let me know when he needs me to show up more, (tonight or tomorrow morning) because I'll be there for that shift, but i can't do both. 

Tonight they have a lot more servers on than usual, so i think it would be best to call out tonight because it won't affect them much. 

Do you think I should call out of work? I've only done it once before and the pain I'd be in wouldn't be worth the time and money. Thanks. 

TL;DR: I have scoliosis and can't work two consecutive shifts at work. Keep getting scheduled back to back shifts. I let all of management know about this issue. I work a close/open tonight/tomorrow morning, should I just call out of my shift tonight? ",28Mar2019,1

412,"I’m sorry in advance if this is disjointed or confusing. I’m typing this between classes. 
About two weeks ago I was home from university for spring break. 
This specific night was on my Moms birthday and the night we celebrate my late uncles birthday. my Mom and Dad were drinking wine and reminiscing about how they met/what they’ve been through. 
I sat down with them because I wanted to hear, I always like hearing their stories. They have the kind of relationship I think everyone dreams about. Met when they were 15/16, would sneak out of their houses to meet at a certain pizza shop, etc etc. Always ended up back together when they were apart and realized how much they loved each other and missed each other. When they tell their stories it’s so obvious they were meant to be together and I love hearing it. 
But, something was different this night. My dad drank too much and started ranting. He eventually told me I was “like him”, that I was broken and didn’t have the ability to care about anyone. That if he died, he didn’t think I would care at all. That I didn’t have a single person in my life that I was really attached to. 
And that made me cry because I obviously care about my family and my boyfriend. But hearing that from my dad hurt. 
My brother also recently told my mom he didn’t think I liked him. Which also hurt. 
I understand where this was coming from I think. I don’t text/call anyone very often. I don’t visit very often. I’ve ghosted all my high school friends and I’ve been distancing myself from my current group of college friends. 
But I do love my family and I care about them very much. 
He followed me to my bedroom and kept going. I told him I would care if he died and apologized for making it seem that way. I eventually tried to confide in him that I thought I had depression and that I was miserable in college and was failing and completely lost. He said “you always think you’re special. You’re not. You’re just like all the other boring idiots out here and I expected you to be able to succeed in college but I guess I was wrong” and that made me feel even worse. The one thing I never wanted to do was disappoint my dad. 
He eventually admitted that he said those things as a “test” to see how I would react. He recently found out that his mother might have had schizophrenia and he was worried he might have it/passed it on to me. 
But if he said those things after drinking, those are his honest, unfiltered opinions of me, right? 
My mom has to come get him and make him leave me alone because I was probably crying loudly and he was yelling. 

Here’s some background info on me, (20F),
I had my very first therapy appointment this week because as i mentioned, I thought I had depression and it took three years to realize how bad I was getting. 
When I was a freshman, I had just moved onto campus, my then-boyfriend ghosted me and cheated on me. I was alone and scared and sad. I guess i was vulnerable and I met a cute guy who eventually kidnapped, manipulated, berated and sexually assaulted me. I bottled that up and tried to forget about it completely. I never said a word to anyone until I got to therapy and I cried about it so hard that even my therapist started tearing up. This still affects me today because this guy still tries to contact me and I haven’t been able to get comfortably intimate in my current relationship. I also find myself trying to “run” from my relationship, because I get scared. 

I guess I need advice on how to not be “broken.” I inherited a lot of my physical traits from my Dads side, I look exactly like my dads great grandmother, I even developed an autoimmune disease that only she had. and everyone says we’re exactly the same in terms of thinking/humor/mentality, etc.. Is it possible I could have developed a mental illness from that side that could be making me “broken” or distant? Or is it all ptsd/depression? I hate the idea that my family thinks I don’t care about them and I want to fix it. I’ve just built up some kind of emotional barrier and especially now I feel like I can’t tell my parents about my issues because i’ll get berated again. 
My therapist only has availability for me once every couple of weeks so i’m worried it won’t be very helpful. I’ll keep going but if anyone has any advice at all i’ll be grateful. If left out any important information, just let me know ",28Mar2019,1

I was gonna use the 1 year apartment lease to see how our relationship can handle being on a tight budget for 1 year compared to jumping into a 30yr deal.

418,"Tl;Dr at the bottom.
I'm simple with my friends: if I feel like someone in the group is being a dick or treating me or others unfairly I'll call them out and just say ""don't be doing that"" (assuming, of course, others in the group recognise it's a problem that isn't just affecting me). 

The thing is whenever people ask me for advice with drama with their other friends I always say ""tell them they're being a dick"", or ""bring it up with them soemtime"", or ""tell them how you feel."" But they always tell me I'm too upfront. 

I'll give a more specific example for clarity, so you can judge it a bit better. Recently a couple of my friends have been having girls-nights and this guy keeps inviting himself along, being awkwardly pushy about it too. So my advice was ""next time he asks to come just say no."" When I was asked for advice in what they should do when he starts being pushy I said ""just tell him he's not invited, reitterate that it's a girls night"". 

They always give me strange, funny looks whenever I give advice like this as if I am somehow encouraging them to overstep a boundry. Of course I'm not saying my advice is the best advice ever or that they even have to take my advice, but they all know how I give advice and still ask my opinion on it knowing the type of stuff I'll tell them to do. It is confrontational, I admit, but it's honest. I don't like this bitchy, behind people's back stuff so I prefer being upfront and that's why I give that type of advice.

The example I gave is perfectly reasonable in my eyes; You don't want someone there, tell them they can't come. But they can't fathom the idea of being so direct and choose instead to have a lacluster time with him there, bitching about how annoying he is behind his back, when the solution to it all seems simple.

Sure everyone's different and doesn't share my perspective but that isn't the problem; it's how they seem to view my perspective as way too ""out there"", which is a step above just disagreeing with it. 

What do you guys think of it? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say if people keep asking me for advice like this, knowing what my thought process is.

Tl;Dr: ""If you have a problem with someone, tell them about it"" is the baseline advice I give to friends who want my advice when they have drama. But I feel like they don't value that opinion, which is odd because I'm always being asked for my opinion, despite them knowing what I'll say, essentially. ",28Mar2019,1

430,"My ex was physically and emotionally abusive, we were together for four years and we've been split up for over six years. I've been married to the most amazing man on earth for almost four years. But the dreams just won't stop. Most of them are content if not calm, we're either friends or friendly to each other, the dreams are never sad or violent but when I wake up it feels like moving on has been set back yet another several paces.

We have zero contact with each other and likely never will again, though we have a few people in common that I see rarely only on social media (Twitter, but I've unfollowed most of those people). I've been in therapy for a while now but haven't really worked on the PTSD he caused, which has gotten much better over the last three years or so.

433,"Okay so I spent the night at a friends house and there was this girl who stayed over too. She seemed literally perfect for me and I eventually fell. Apparently she had a thing for me too. So it was kinda a nice night just watching movies and the office while cuddling and whatnot. However, the next day I asked if she wanted to hang out but she said a practice of her started at 8 instead of noon like she said before. This seemed sketch. I asked a friend if it was legit and then turned out she lied to avoid getting breakfast or something with me. This was also backed up by her Snapchat location being at home in the morning. She also was very confusing and gave mixed signals a lot. So what should I do? But the more important question to me is why would she mislead me and do all that from the night before only to lie to me and not care? Basically why would she act like she feels one way, then later act the complete opposite? Thanks y’all. ",28Mar2019,1

436,"Ok, so first of all, I don't know if this is something many people feel, and if this is a very common thing, I am sorry for wasting your time.
So, essentially, everytime I(17M) hang out with a particular person I want to end my friendship with her, and with everyone else I know.
Let me start from the begining. I am not a very social person. When I am at school I Always talk and communicate fine, but I never really hang out with anyone outside of school, if anyone offers, I pretty much Always decline. But about half a year ago I met this person who I started hanging out with in my freetime. It was a blast to hang out with her!
But, about two weeks ago things changed. We were at her house watching a movie. Everything was fine, but after we split up and I started walking home, I began to feel horrible. It wasn't something very specific, it was just a bad feeling, which almost screamed to me that I should never hang out with her anymore. Actually, that I shouldn't hang out with anyone ever. I was pretty messed up for a couple of days, didn't even really talk with anyone, until it kind of went away, after, pretty much, a cry in the shower.
Now, today, we met up again and watched another movie, again at her place. Again, the same thing happened when I began walking home. But because it happened about an hour ago, I can say a bit more specifically, what this gut feeling was telling me. It says to me that I am not good enought to hang out with her. Afterwards, it grows to ""I shouldn't hang out with anyone, because everyone I am friends with would probably feel a lot happier if they weren't friends with me.""
So, because I love reddit I decided to write here and maybe seek some advice, because this feeling is horrible and I really want some help with how to deal with it. Thank you, everyone, in advance.

And then, he was laying on the ground and he asked to get me to help him get up, but there was a problem, because he was under bet, not completely under the bet, only little half of his body.

Then, she said that I had to put my tongue between my teeth, but this is too vague for me. Then, the people in the comment said how much it was well explain and that they fully understand, but I didn't understood a single thing.

It's the same for jokes, I often at my own jokes, but other people's humor seem to bore me.

My girlfriend and I are currently on a trip to London. We suddenly needed to stay an extra night. Wanting to be near her family and an area we are familiar with, we found a hotel with mediocre reviews that was very cheap because it had shared bathrooms.
During check-in, the guy at the front desk took a picture of her passport, without explanation, and never had us sign any paperwork or provide further information.
We walk into our room to find a device in the corner of the room that looks like a motion detector/camera.

My issue is that we have a neighbor next door who’s dogs constantly bark. We’ve talked to them, reported them. Everything but called the police on them. We usually mind our business and aren’t the type to report neighbors. Recently, we’ve had some improvements with them and it’s been tolerable. We were finally finding a solution that works for all of us. 

Until a new neighbor upstairs moved in! Last week a single guy moved in. He has a really sweet doggo that has some serious separation anxiety. This dog is some kind of hound, so she howls all day while he’s at work. Of course because she howls, the other dogs bark and respond back. So now I’m surrounded by dogs that make noise from 7am-5pm.

I work from home most days and this is driving me crazy. What can I do to solve this problem? What kind of action can I take? I love animals and I don’t blame the dogs at all. I get that people have to leave their pups at home alone. I have empathy for my neighbors, but I pay nearly 2k for this great apartment. I want some peace and quiet. ",28Mar2019,1
451,"Hey. I've never been so confused in my life and wanted to let it out and also get an opinion or two maybe. This may end up being a long post, I apologise in advance.

January 2019, I completed six months of volunteering in a village in North India, working on farms, teaching kids who aren't able to afford education or aren't allowed to study. This helped me greatly as I started appreciating things which I usually took for granted, needless to say I was feeling content again and was looking forward to start getting back on the track again. 
In the meantime I'm joined by my girlfriend of 4 years who recently quit her job as a recruiter and wanted to move on to something better. 
Starting mid January, she was consistently pushing on the fact that we both should start working together somewhere, but as I've my graduation exams and also Japanese language certification in April I made it clear that I would start working as I'm done with both of these things, which we mutually agreed to. Some days later all off a sudden, she started the topic again and we got into an argument which ended up, her barging out of the apartment and taking a flight to Delhi; yes you read that right! Delhi!

I call her the next day to check if she reached safely and where she is put up, only to know that she is staying at her Ex-boyfriend's apartment who booked the ticket for her. This was the first blow.

Next week; her birthday. 
I promised to never let her be alone on her birthday since her Mum passed away and that's why I flew down to Delhi. Also I was feeling guilty that I couldn't make her stay in the first place. When I call her to wish her and reveal the surprise, she says she doesn't want to meet me, no matter whatever I was feeling, no matter if I only came down for one night. Also I was told that her Ex-boyfriend is in town (2nd blow) and it will be awkward for her if I go at his place. I had no plan of going at that place to meet her and that's why I had made arrangements in a party hostel already.
Anyway she calls me the next day and asks me to come down where she is staying, so I reach and meet her, we have dinner together and end up partying with some of our mutual friends.
Next day out of blue, she asks me to leave. Without less than $10 in my pocket and my nearest friend being 50 miles North, I asked her rather I requested her to let me stay there for the night and I'd leave as soon as metro service starts in morning. I had my first panic attack that night.

March 2019 
She calls me the other day, we talk the usual way, how was the day, had food etc etc. While on the call, I was already suspicious as she was sounding different. I ask her what's on her mind and she said that it's over between us, and this was the reason she left for Delhi. She also says that last time she had sex with me (on her birthday) was because she felt bad for me, had pity on me that I traveled so far. 

IDK what to actually do RN, not that I feel like dying and all that jazz, but for now I can't make sense of what went wrong, what was the mistake in being with your girlfriend on her birthday, why do we have to end? It's more than a week that we talked, but this evening I was drunk and finally thought of letting it out as it has been messing with my head. 

If you have come down till here, I'm pretty sure you'd understand what it is that am exactly going through and would honestly be grateful if you guys can share something or the other on the same.

P.S I never had a panic attack before that night, but since then there has been more one instance. Does that mean I'd need to consult a psychiatrist now, or is it just my rogue imagination?

462,"A little background, I'm 27 from a Middle Eastern country and a normal middle class family, our country is still holding on to some old school traditions so this bit is important.

I started working at a Bank a little less than a year ago and has bern progressing well in my role, last October a new female coworker was introduced and I swear to God I felt like my heart skipped at least 2 beats when I first saw her. 

She's from a very prominent family in my country, her father is a former Minister and a globally famous lawyer as he served as a defense attorney in one of the most famous trials of the 21st century.


Anyhow, months went by and I tried chalking it up as just a normal crush that would just go away eventually, we'd pass each other by from time to time and exchange simple pleasantries nothing more. I'd notice her cheerful demeanor from afar and just keep to myself. 

Starting this month we started talking more a little bit, she's 29, she loves animals, she works out a lot, we have similar interests and life goals and just about compatible in every possible and imaginable way, we started exchanging emails to just pass time in a totally platonic and respectful manner. 

Every day passes by I find myself falling deeper and deeper and deeper in love with her, I'd be minding my own business watching TV and my thoughts would wander to her, I'd be working out with only her on my mind, I go to sleep thinking of her and as soon as I wake up she's the first thing on my mind and I can't wait to get to work so I could see her. 

I'm not in a country where premarital relations are accepted and frankly what I want is to marry her.

I'd want nothing more in life than to be hers and have her be mine, I want to see her face everyday for the rest of my life, I want to go to sleep looking at her and wake up looking at her. I want to grow old with her see the world with her do everything with her.


The problem is as anyone could deduce by now is our families social standing. Yes first I have to see if she's in anyway interested in me before I think of the next step but I can't help but feel like it's a hurdle I'll fall in, the traditions is that I'd have to get her family to accept me and bless the marriage and without their acceptance and blessings nothing would happen, I'm afraid they won't accept me. Even her being older than me can be seen as problematic in our society which is stupid as fuck but what can I do?

Honestly even her rejecting me would be better for my mental health at this point, I've been in emotional hell with no one to confide in. I know I have been borderline obsessive and that's not healthy and I think it's because of the massive uncertainty.

What should I do? I need your advice, should I just lay it all on the line and let her know how I feel and whatever happens happnes? Should I wait and take it slow and see if there is interest from her side before I tell her and face her family's gauntlet if she accepts?

463,"So here's the deal, I'm an Air Cadet. Cadets are divided into four groups: Level One, Level Two, Level Three, and Level Four. These are a representation of a cadet's years with the program, so first years are level ones and so on. Level ones are just kind of there, their role is to be taught and to be ordered tasks around the squadron, Level twos are pretty much the same, Level Three is where responsibilities enter the picture, they learn about how to lead and how to instruct, and Level fours  don't have classes rather they teach them, they are the main leaders of squadrons that are cadets and not officers. I'm a level three at the end of my training year, a Flight Corporal about to become Sergeant, I'm the top of my level, I'm fit, I'm intelligent, I'm a great and effective leader, in a leadership position, my cadets obey and respect me in the highest regards, not only that, I'm close with my cadets, they're like family to me, improving my leadership, when I lead, I'm loud and clear, quickwitted, light on my feet, confident, and proud, my problem? I'm moving into the bigger leadership role in September, which may not sound that bad but there are only three level fours, all of which are leaving after this year, including the best leader our squadron has ever seen, leaving it up to me and the other two cadets in my level to run an entire squadron, with the exception of the odd class taught by an officer, so pretty much three guys to be in charge, and me being at the top of my level, I'm going to have to be the man in charge with the help of only two guys with half a clue what to do, I'll likely be teaching the level threes, and one or the other take twos and the last with the ones, one of them also only show up a third of the time, from my previous evaluations, I have everything it takes to be a leader and my officers have even told me that my leadership even rivals that of our best, the thing is, I'm doubting that, I'm very stressed about this, I'm losing faith in myself, in my brain I know I can do it, but my gut has me terrified, in summary, I've gotta be the best, but I'm worried I won't be good enough to keep our squadron alive, I don't have faith in myself, and I don't know how to fix that",28Mar2019,1
464,"So a few days ago I went out with friends and we ended up drinking moonshine and beer (I by far had the least of all my friends like barely a cup I never even got drunk) we had a good time and all the people I was with are people that my parents know and trust. However my parents are very strict and if they knew we were drinking my mom would KILL me. 

Apparently, the person who’s house we were at, his mom found out what we were doing. She was VERY angry and threatened to call the parents of everyone involved, including me. 

If this happens I have no idea what to do. My mom would probably not let me play hockey, (I am a starting varsity player with scholarships lined up) and she would be VERYYYY mad. Do I deny it? Do I tell her before she gets the call so she might not get as mad? Please help ASAP 😓😓",28Mar2019,3
465,"Some background information:

I met this girl at the beginning of my college year we hit it off so well I got her number and we talked all day long! Literally we would never droped our phones we were always messaging each other.
So I waited pretty long to ask her out because I was pretty shy so I was very firm in the friendzone, after 2 months she wanted to meet up because college finished early and we couldn't meet outside of college because we live quiet far apart, so we met in college and I kissed her then etc and we was in a relationship.

Ok so you know the background I kept it as short as possible :)

So three months later we broke up, after three days of the break up I messaged her saying I'm sorry and she told me shes with her ex! She went further and said I always had feelings for him i never stopped having them. 😳 there goes my feeling of love, we actually did say I luv u to each other when she said that ik she never really cared about me or loved me.

So then a month later I met her friend suprisingly we hit it off well and we talked for ages mainly about her best friend my ex but 🤷‍♂️. So I haven't turned up to college and her best friend messaged me saying where are you etc and then later on that day we was talking and I said just got to let go of the past (I wasn't talking about my ex it was some other thing about my secondary school) she said yeah you should so don't resent my ex!

I said I'm over her and she said your not because I always talk to her, I said its because theres nothing else to talk about with you (ik I was pretyy harsh but she got be pretty worked up enraged) so she then she said ok we shouldn't talk I said ok and the  she  blocked me.

I still haven't went to college it's been a month and a half
 a couple days ago I looked back and her friend unblocked me I didn't say anything.

Well I did go in once and when I did she was sitting perpendicular to the door so her back was turned towards it and all the girls started laughing and turned around she didn't even turn around! Though she hasn't seen me in a month and a half. It was a grab and go situation 😂 because the teacher didn't let me into the class so I got the work and left.

But it hurt I dont know if I'll find love again and it only took her three days to get over me.
I still think about her occasionally but have aimed to reduce this.

466,"Hello I'm 17 .Today 7 am after I got off the bus this guy that was in it went out at the sam time. He approached me and asked if he could make a phone call with my phone. And since i saw about a 100 times, we live in the same town, and I'm pretty sure he saw me atleast a 100 times I thought he was a normal guy and I gave him the phone. He is about 16/17 a bit shorter but seems much stronger. He took my phone, put it in his pocjet and told me to give him all my money. Now I was stunned it was a scary wtf moment. I asked him politely to give my phone back, ofc he threatend to beat me up, he told me he was armed with a bat. I'm staring at him shocked, I was never in a situation like this and since he has my phone I was scared. Now he told me he was sent by some guy whom I owe money. I don't owe any money to anyone, I know that for a fact. I want to grab the phone and he pulls away. I'm afraid he will run off with the phone so I look at my wallet. Many will most likely say to fight him but: A) I can't fight. B) If he gets scared he can run off with my phone (my knee is injured I can't run as much anymore). I pull out the only money bill I have. Bastard comes for it and I quickly grab the phone. There was some pushing to get the phone and I somehow got it but he took the money. He got a solid ammount of money (50kn) it's all I had. He then tries to grab the phone again. I stop him. Then he gave up and went off (not really running but fast enough for me not to catch him). I forgot about the money I was most glad I didn't lose my phone. Now I don't know what to do. My best friend told me I should tell my parents. He is probably right but my parents would involve police into it. I also fell like a weakling. Perhaps I should't if let him have the money. So I need advice.

470,"So I'll open this with saying I have anxiety and have been gaslighted in the past. I just want to know if any of my concerns are merited and how to rebuild trust. Tldr; at the bottom (sorry this is long, the post got away from me) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've (23F) been dating my current SO (23M) for about six months and things have been wonderful! From the get go we just clicked. We shared so many interests and our communication was great! We were open about our thoughts and feelings and there were never hard feelings or argument when we disagreed. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple months after we started dating we went to see Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (fantastic movie by the way) with my best friend. We were goofing off and a weird topic of discussion about my bff's exes and a weird coincidental similarity between them came up. I noticed he sort of bowed out of the conversation. Later we were walking back to his apartment and, with a nervous tone, he mentioned that he had ""hooked up before"" with one of his friends (FF for female friend from here onward) that he's still close with and I had met before. I was a bit surprised he hadn't told me until then since we had a very open narrative about past dating experiences, but okay. I definitely get it and sort of laughed it off and told him it was okay, stuff happens and I'm definitely also guilty of getting physical with a friend or two. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward until yesterday and I'm baking some sick apple pie with FF at SO's apartment and we're talking about SO and I moving into an apartment together next month (our leases lined up and I offered for him to join me and my friend after getting her blessing). FF start talking about her boyfriend and their living situations. Mentions how SO and I were moving fast (definitely fair) and how she had started dating her boyfriend just before I had started dating SO. My stomach sort of sank. This isn't my first time at the rodeo and alarm bells were ringing. I decided I would talk to SO about it later and put it to the back of my mind. and FF, SO, another one of SO's friends were over and I wanted everyone to have an awesome evening of enjoying pie and chilling. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we were getting ready for bed I think I said something along the lines of: ""potentially awkward question, but when exactly did you and FF stop hooking up?"" Aaaaaaand that's when everything sort of came to light. Their physical involvement is something that had been apart of their relationship from its beginnings and hadn't stopped until she got into a relationship. So they had been close friends with benefits for close to a year and a half (where they were seeing each other at least once a week). The amount he had downplayed it that night several months ago was jaw dropping for me (we hadn't talked about it since because I figured there wasn't much more to it). I am still 100% comfortable with SO and FF's friendship. I was super clear to him that I support their friendship and have no problem with it. I like FF and we get along great! What I can't help is the feeling of distrust I now have for SO. Though he didn't lie to me, he downplayed things a lot. I explained to him I was hurt because I lost some trust in him, but I wasn't angry. I'm now super tired because I couldn't sleep and sad because I feel somewhat made the fool of. I don't know how to build trust from this or what to do. My anxiety is also telling me this is my fault and I shouldn't be bothered by it in the first place. Thanks for reading if you made it down here.

471,"I (24F) was really close with my old boss (34M). We were hired around the same time, and we are both hard workers with a super compatible work ethic. We became very close over the year I worked there.

I was in a longterm, live-in, polyamorous relationship while working there. I would tell him about my crushes and dates etc. It never really crossed the line, and was never physical (we never even hugged), but I developed a harmless crush and would subtly hint at it.

When I quit, he asked me to not ghost him, that he wanted to stay friends, etc etc. But since me and my primary partner split, he has basically stopped talking to me all together.

I'm moving soon, and wanted to grab lunch and meet his newborn before I left town. But he hasnt replied. 

I'm devastated. I think it may be about his wife -- either she's uncomfortable or insecure. How do I address this and assure that NOTHING will happen between him and I? I truly miss my friend, and it makes me sad thinking our friendship has to end.

Other points:
- I slept with a married man who had recently had a baby. I fell for him pretty hard (I didn't know he was married). My boss really helped me navigate those feelings
- We've only hung out alone outside of work once (dinner and beer on a late night of work). Other than that, our outside hangouts have all been work gatherings. 
- I gave him my ""support sheet"" (something i made in therapy to help the people close to me navigate my meltdowns). It was meant for my boyfriends at the time, and there was a sexual note on there. I realized too late, and he read it, but we talked about it and cleared the air.

473,"My sister and I bought a couch off of Craigslist and while it's a nice couch it came with roaches, to my disgust. So I notify my leasing office of the problem they promise to get some one out to my apt asap. Long story short it's been 4 months and no one came to exterminate my apartment. After 4 months someone finally shows up and treats. Great I'm happy. My expectations are low for my shitty apartment. I'm in nursing school and I had to go with the most budget friendly option for now. All of this I was willing to over look because while my apartment is small no one bothers me we have a great location and we don't need much from them.  Plus we're moving out in May also when I graduate from RN school so I'll be able to live some place much nicer! 

The problem is my leasing office never notified us of a specific date of the next appointment. Over the phone they discussed someone coming in around 2 weeks but we never received written notice which they stated they would send via email and they gave me instructions that only the kitchen needed to be prepared for treatment. My sister and I prepared the kitchen anyway. The exterminator shows up and does the treatment. Then we get a fee of 75$ for not being prepared. I explain the above to the leasing manager and he says I should have emailed them to find out if I would get a fee for only preparing the kitchen and that the fee will not be waved.

476,"My friend caused a serious injury that I just had surgery on and am now starting the rehab. I know he feels really bad about it, and initially offered to help with the bills using his HSA which had about $1500 in it. 

I'm waiting on the surgeon bill to use his HSA on, but 2 days after surgery he said he needed to use that HSA money on some dental work he needed. He thinks it will be about $500, so that means I'm now only going to get $1000 from him. I'm already out of pocket $2000, and that doesn't take into account the surgeon bill or remaining physical therapy (about 4 months worth).

First he scratched a student's neck with a broken piece of glass and sent him to hospital, then broke another student's head with a brick and then nearly blinded another one. Every time we had to pay for him to get him out of trouble. But it was just the start of it. He started to torture and kill animals he brought from outside with different tools. He once choked a cat to death, killed a dog with his gun and he burned a chicken alive in a campfire right when we were outside for a picnic. He says that he has learnt this from the Nazis and Imperial Japan. He says they tortured humans and animals for research too. He says that he is going to do all of these on humans too one day. He constantly harasses girls too. He touches their bodies, catcalls them, follows them to their houses and takes videos of his whole job doing it and harasses them online as well. He also has obssesion over some celebrity women too. He even named some of them for us: Emma Watson, Miley Cyrus, Kristen Stewart, Dua Lipa, etc i've searched their names on internet after hundreds of times he kept talking about them and now i know them the same way he does. He says that if he could date these girl, lots of his problems would be solved. He says that first of all he has to try it on Miley. He says that he knows her house address and soon he is going to pay a visit to her and ask her out. He said that Miley Cyrus has to be nice to him and respect him otherwise he may use force. He says that if anyone ever tries to prevent him from reaching his celebrity crushes, he would shoot them. He says that he is extremely serious about this and he would kill millions of people if he could to get Miley. He says the after he finishes with her he would start it on other girls he mentioned. By the way i've never heard about him stealing something. I don't know wether he has ever done a robbery or not.

He says that he prefers a brutal military dictatorship that slaughters millions of people to make the country a safe place and he likes to be a part of it. Seriously why is he like this?

489,"Apologies, this is gonna be a long one as I believe a lot of context is needed here. I've talked with some friends about this already but I feel like a true outside perspective might be helpful. **TLDR for the long-term context a few paragraphs down, before the actual argument explanation.**

To start, it's worth knowing that my fiance became a part of my life just before a time when I was generally not in the best place mentally. I met him in freshman year of college and by the end of sophomore year I was headed into a pretty deep depression. This was largely (I believe) based around the fact I wasn't confident that the degree I was going for was for me and, at the time, I saw nothing else to do that wouldn't set me back by at least a year or two. I did NOT want to be set back and it was partly due to my mom frequently asking if I ""could still finish in 4 years"" if I did x or y class in a different order. 

I failed out my junior year of college. I attempted a year at my community college with only slightly better results and didn't continue further. This has set a lot of the tone of my relationship with my mom - who believes that I NEED to get a degree at some point in my life, and frequently implies that it should happen ASAP. 

My fiance and I started dating the year I was at CC after having been friends for 3 years before that. He helped me through a lot of my mom's criticisms of my performance and her generally fairly controlling attitude. 

It's worth noting that during this time my fiance lived an hour away from me so I would frequently spend the weekends with him and sometimes for a night during the week as well. Multiple times she tried to stop me from going to see him. And sometimes I did stay home to avoid the argument. I eventually moved out of her place and moved in with my dad because her criticisms were so constant and harsh, not to mention my dad loves my fiance and had no problem at all with me visiting him when I wanted to. (I have since moved in with my fiance)

One last bit of long-term context - my mom frequently turns to commenting on my appearance (which is not 'dirty' but I don't wear makeup and I hardly do anything with my hair beyond brushing it out each day) as a way of asking me to ""improve"" myself (or, in her words, ""take pride in myself""). Haircuts while I was living with her were never when I wanted them but when she decided it had been long enough and scheduled them for me. Probably unsurprisingly, I have had much fewer haircuts since I moved out.

**TLDR: I was majorly depressed and failed out of college. My mom believes I need a degree. She has frequently been over-controlling. My mom also has a tendency to criticize my appearance and scheduled my haircuts for me against my will when I lived with her.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the day the argument happened. We (me, my fiance, my mom, and my sister) had taken an early flight that morning to visit family for the weekend as some of our extended family was holding a combined engagement party for myself and my fiance as well as my brother and his fiancee. We were all tired. Unfortunately, this also means we were all a bit grumpy. My mom (and my grandma, to a lesser extent) were bugging me that I should get a haircut. I had said no, a couple times, and my sister made some snide comment along the lines of ""why wouldn't I get one"". I snipped at her that it was because it was my choice. Cue my sister mini-ranting about me always being mean to her and saying that I ""stole her cat"" when I moved out (I took \*my\* cat but the point here is that it's a whiny thing she has said multiple times and always falls back on if she feels like it might get her sympathy). My fiance snapped at her that we'd gone over this already and to shut up about it. Admittedly, he was a bit harsh in the way he said it and yelled more than he should have but again, tiredness and short tempers were a factor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not too long after, my mom pulled me into a room to talk privately about the fact that she didn't appreciate the way my fiance snapped at my sister and that it wasn't appropriate. She also took this time to, yet again, bring up both the fact that I should get a haircut and that I should be going back to school. I'm terrible at responding to this shit so I started tearing up. I leave the room and my fiance is standing not too far away. He sees that I'm teary eyed and at this point he believed that my mom and I had only been talking about my hair. He goes to have words with her about how getting a haircut shouldn't be a big enough deal to make me cry over. 

Admittedly, I don't know exactly what the argument beyond there devolved into as I had walked a bit away to talk to my grandma. But I do know that it ended with my mom saying she thought my Fiance was an asshole and that she didn't want to talk to him again and me begging them to stop arguing with each other. Neither my fiance nor myself have talked with my mom since. 

From talking with my fiance about it post-argument he has told me that while he admits he got foggy and over-emotional his side focused entirely on not wanting her to micro-manage me the way she has tried to. He also said he made a point of not insulting her personally.

I've talked with my grandma a little bit. She, I believe, sees where my fiance is coming from but she also believes he is angry at her (them) and that everything my mom has said has been out of love. Which, it might very well be, but I do believe my mom needs to at least change the way she goes about trying to ""help"" me improve my life. Because having almost every conversation with my mom turn into a criticism of my life is, well, very tiresome. 

It's been nearly 3 weeks now. I want to open up some sort of communication with my mom so that we can work on this, but I have no idea how to. And, I'll admit, I'm scared. I don't want to lose my relationship with her entirely but I can't put up with her trying to control me. I have no idea what she'll act like when I try to talk to her and I don't know if she's willing to re-build a positive relationship with my fiance.  

A friend of mine suggested writing her a letter rather than trying to talk to her directly because I have always been much better at writing out my thoughts rather than saying them (I get very emotional trying to have hard conversations). I plan on doing that but even then I don't know what to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts appreciated. It's gonna be a long road from here no matter what.

I tried picking up more mature content that include sex life and smut after I finished high-school, and to be honest I really love them.  I've never fall in love with anyone before and I think that's the reason why I'm into these kind of genres. 

I really love them, these are like my drugs. I'm really happy if it's just a straight up *vanilla* but if there's a slight drama in them such as *breaking-up, quarrel* or *cheating* I would feel really depressed and most of time I even ended up crying. It's only been three years but I've picked up hundreds of series, and to be honest I just realized how unhealthy that was. I would think about those bad development of the story that I read over and over again as if the main character was me and I was cheated/dumped. I didn't even get enough sleep and these problems have been with me for almost four years. 

I tried talking to my best friend but usually ended up changing the topic. I just don't want to get laughed at or humiliated. I also tried some of method that I found on *Quora,* like eating chocolate (?), watch/read something different, go outside, etc. but this method only works temporary. It seems it can't get out of my mind—but like I said, I love really them. I don't want to stop reading them. I might lost interest one day but not anytime soon. 

I would love to hear what methods you guys use if you ever felt the way I feel. I know some of you find this cringey but I hope you can share your opinion too.

&amp;#x200B;

So today (literally about 10 minutes ago) I stepped out of the office to take a call, it turned out to be a woman from a very prestigious newspaper calling me about a role that I had applied to the day before. I was completely unprepared for this as she called me totally out of the blue, no emails no nothing. When she asked if I could talk I panicked and said I could spare a few minutes which was BIG MISTAKE #1 as I didn't want to miss out on a conversation with such a desirable company. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was very nice and the conversation was good to start with, although when she started asking about my current job I was so paranoid that my current company could hear me in the corridor I climbed three flights of stairs (their very echoey corridors and everything connected as the building is so small) while also trying to talk to her and then I was so awkward I could barely answer her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then BIG MISTAKE #2 happened when she asked me what my understanding of the role i applied to was and I was so stressed I totally blanked, so i panicked (yes this is a running theme) and told her my boss was calling me and asked if we could rearrange. She didn't seem too happy but was very nice about rearranging the call for tomorrow at 1.

My question is a) how badly have I screwed up, and b) what can I do to rectify the situation when she calls me tomorrow?

Even though she might have said the small dick joke lightheartedly/jokingly, I took it kind of personally and began to think that she wasn't joking especially since her previous and only sexual experiences were with 2 separate black guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this, a couple weeks ago my gf and I were talking about sex and I sent her a meme related to boobs, this is what she replies with and the following convo:

&gt;Her: \*gif of a dog biting/sucking a woman's boobs\* (from mean girls I think),  
&gt;  
&gt;Her: ""you""  \[as if to state that I'm like that; I took it kinda personally as it's joking about something intimate that I'm doing to try and make her feel good\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Do you not like them being licked/sucked?  
&gt;  
&gt;Her: I don't dislike it but doesn't feel like anything lool  
&gt;  
&gt;Her: Like it's not a turn on

Obviously everyone's different and has their preferences but it felt more like she was making fun of what I was doing rather than just straight telling me that it's not pleasurable for her

&amp;#x200B;

We talked through it and she said that she was sorry that she said it, but I'm 5.5""  and I had never had a problem with my size or felt insecure until she made the joke and didn't straight away take it back or feel bad. Given that I'm only ever less than 4"" on a flop, every time I now look down I feel that I might not be enough, even if she says she ""honestly wouldn't want it any different"".

519,"I started a new job about a month ago. I absolutely love the work, and I've been doing well so far. The only thing ive been adapting to is waking up at 4 AM, which is a first for me. 2 weeks ago I woke up about an hour after my scheduled time to be in. I panicked as I've never been the type of person to be late or slack off for work. I felt terrible, called in and apologized said it would never happen again and everything was all good with my boss. However, this morning the same thing happened. I woke up late again. I checked my phone as I started to panick again and my phone was plugged in but completely powered off. I called in again and told him the truth as soon as I woke up, I even left and started driving there because he didn't answer so I left him a voicemail. I let him know once he called back how bad I felt and that I'm going to get an actual alarm clock because I cant trust this phone. I know this doesn't look well for me and I feel like total sh*t about it. He told me to not come in since the drivers at my company leave at 6 and it was too late and he will call me back later to let me know whats going on. Its now 1:30 and my mind has been racing since 8 this morning. I'm making myself worried sick over this and I'm so pissed off about the situation. Anyone have any advice?",28Mar2019,1
520,"Hi! I am 20,  I've worked for restaurants my whole life. Right now I work for a very bougie restaurant, and make really good money. It's a tip pool but it averages out to $18/hr pretax. I take care of the multitude of plants here. My area GM approached me yesterday and offered me a contracting position to take care of the plants at another restaurant. They have ~20 plants, I expect to spend 1-2 hours a week on this activity, probably less once the plants get in a better place. Today I was offered an internship working at a local greenhouse which is relevant because it means I will be gaining professional experience this summer. The number my boss threw out there was $25 a week, and I would invoice him rather than being paid for it hourly. I currently make $400/week, and honestly I think $25 a week is a little low, but I would love love love to take care of the plants. Should I ask for more? Should I ask for a budget for plant expenditures instead? There are things my plants need and its hard to convince the middle managers that its important. I have never done this kind of thing before so HELP PLEASE!",28Mar2019,1

I get flakes, they’re not terrible, but if someone is a foot or two from me, they could definitely see some.

522,"I never ever thought, about posting my problems on reddit ,but i literally have nowhere else to go.

It's all about my mother in law.  You know how sometimes you hear these crazy stories about in laws.  Yeah they are true. 
Let's begin by saying i love my husband to death and i respect his decisions but...
For the last couple of year's his mother had made our lifes miserable by doing everything she can to split us up (he doesn't see it this way) . From trying to get all attention on here when it was our wedding day ( she decided to split up with here man 1 day before our wedding and my husband had to help here move) constantly nagging on our parenting (we have 2 girls). I forgot to mention that we live in different countries so there is not much of physical contact. Still it Doesn't make our lives easier as she had a nervous breakdown and now she is blaming everyone( here brother,sister, Me) for that ( it's always like that, its never here own fault). For 3years she has been asking if she can live with us, our answer  was always NO! because she is young (50) , healthy, smart woman who can take care of herself! (Good career, big house etc) . But now she THINKS that she's got cancer and it's my husband's responsibility to take care of her, and if he won't that means he doesn't love here. She wants to come to our living country to get 'checked ',but the thing is cancer treatment is much much better in our home country where she lives now. But it doesn't matter as she whants to come here because she FEELS and WANTS to do only that. 
Me and here, we don't speak anymore after she called me every name possible, she visited my parents and only talked about how bad Im and how i have ruined here life in every possible way how i manipulate here precious don etc...
And now she only speaks to my husband. She tries to guilt trap him into getting here way. 
Im so scared because i don't trust here and i never will. Im not ready to forget ar forgive for things she have done or sad. 

I'm scared just scared about what's gonna happen and if there is any way in solving this situation without me being the BAD GUY. 

And im sorry if there are any mistakes, English is my 3rd language and I'm still learning. ",28Mar2019,2
523,"Moved to an inside sales role from warehouse around 2 years ago. I was overpaid as the warehouse person and got a small raise when I moved to inside sales. 2 years later(now) I'm am presenting my case for a hefty raise ~15k.

What pisses me off is my coworkers. They don't do shit. I do all the work. The are late every day. They literally drink on the job. Take 2 hr lunches. Boss and management don't say shit. I work my ass off but does that really mean anything?? I want to move forward, learn new things, take new responsibilities (which I am) but what is the incentive? There seems to be no consequences or rewards. I've been with the company for 7 years.

Should I bring these up when I talk to the bosses about the raise? I've always read not to bring your co-workers into it but sum bitch. I get paid the same as these people yet I busty ass when they don't give a damn. I'm not looking to out them or anything.

524,There is this girl and we have had something for a while. She wants me to wait for her (she’s not ready for a relationship at the moment apparently) but I have been waiting for 2 years. She tells me to wait but Idk how long it could be. She could find someone before she dates me. She would probably be flirting with other guys while I’m waiting. I told her I don’t want to wait and that I have given up on her. And idk anymore. I love her and I really don’t want to give up I just want to know I will be the only one. But I gave up because I am tired of waiting on her and have so many different girls that are trying to be with me but I only want her and waiting is just so unhealthy. Was this the right move?

526,"I'm in my third year of college, I'm majoring in criminal law and one of my required classes is juvenile delinquency. Please, before you read this just know that I've really tried to just put up with him. I've had shitty professors before and put in extra effort to pass the class but this is by far the worst and I'm at my wits end. I've had him for another class last semester and it was hell, and this is unbearable but he's the only professor that teaches this class. 

He's not mean or strict, I can deal with that. He's too laid back. He told us last semester that he owns an insurance agency and is teaching on the side for whatever reason. I checked his rating on ratemyprofessor and he has a 43% so I know it's not just me. He has absolutely no idea what he's teaching. Please help. We can turn in surveys at the end of the semester and I absolutely obliterated him on it. 

I try to participate in class but I'm just not engaged, I love the subject but I can't get into it because he never stays on topic. He talks about other things, such as cars or insurance fraud stories he has. Just nothing to do with the class. And the other students feed into it because he's not strict, but we aren't learning anything at all. He reads off the PowerPoint slides the department sends to him and doesn't talk about them, just reads off them. I've asked questions before and he's literally said ""can someone find it in the book or google it?"" I want you to hear it from a classmate. I've heard this before, teachers asking classmates to explain it so it's not odd, the first two times. But it's every single time. I've never gotten a direct answer so no one asks questions anymore. 

I just can't take it, I've tried to teach myself but there are obviously some concepts I don't understand and he can't help. Should I go to the department head? I don't want to put him out of a job but I also want to learn things important to my major. I just don't respect him, I've never had a professor I don't respect. He's like the Michael Scott of professors. He's cool and nice but just oblivious. I've stopped showing up to class a lot because I find it a waste of time and instead of focus on my other classes.

527,"Please read this. I desperately need help, or someone to just acknowledge I'm writing this. I am 16, and I've only driven a car about 7 times, including today. I've only had one driving lesson, which was my first ever time behind the wheel. Today my 5 month pregnant mother asked me if I wanted to drive home from therapy, and I said sure. So, here I am driving in an unknown place to me, because I don't go to therapy very often, and it's far away from my house. I also live in Central Massachusetts, where the roads can barely fir two cars going opposite ways, and trees stick out, and the roads are very bumpy and windy and narrow. So, I'm going about 28 MPH down a backroad around a tight corner, where I started to slow down. All of a sudden a big truck whipped around the corner and his front tire was over the line. I've never been in a situation like this before so I got nervous and my Mom started screaming to turn the wheel. I turned  the wheel away from the yellow line in response and took my foot off the gas. She then started screaming to go the other way and grabbed the wheel to push it towards the truck. I froze and then, side swiped a huge tree that was sticking out. The mirror was dangling by the wires in it and the passenger door was having trouble opening. My Mom absolutely lost it. She started screaming and told me to get out of the car, I'm irresponsible, a bitch, selfish, and that she hates me and that all I do is mess things up and I can't do anything right. She ripped open my door and grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and whipped me out into the road. I ran and got in the car where she continued to ball her eyes out and scream mean things to me. I sat there and silently cried while she called my stepdad on speaker where he continued to freak out, My Mom drove away from the scene of the accident without calling police like you are supposed to, and eventually we got home. She called for my stepdad to get outside and ""check the damage"" I caused, and told me I was costing her all her life savings and she was never going to be able to pay for the ""dying twins"" inside of her, and that me breaking the mirror and scratching the car was going to be ""over $10,000"". She then told me to get out and i got scared and went to the end of the street onto the grass and sat down and cried. (I could still see my driveway and my parents from here since we practically live on the end of the street already) I stayed there for almost a half hour and cried, and then I came home and my Mom wasn't here. I ran upstairs into my room and my stepdad ran up after me and scolded me for ""running away"" and I said I got nervous and scared. Now my parents are gone. This was the situation today. Last night I heard them talking about me and I cried myself to sleep because they were saying things such as: ""Shes a bitch"" ""Whats wrong with her"" ""Shes messed up in the head"" ""She can't do anything right"" ""I hate her"" ""I don't know why we even put up with her"" ""She's the worst daughter I could've got"" ""My new twins are going to be so much better"" ""She causes every problem and fight in this house"" ""Shes delusional and insane"". You can imagine these hurt. I'm sorry this is so long, but I need to get it off my chest...Almost 3 weeks ago, I got shoved into an overnight facility for 2 weeks. Want to know why? Because my mom ""needed a break"" from me. She started a fight with me for not letting her use my fine point markers to color about 3 months ago. Yup. And it came out of absolutely nowhere, I had just woke up that morning and was waiting for her in the car, and she got in and started screaming at me for things I did when I was 9 and 10. I let her scream at me for about 32 minutes and I just sat there in the car doing nothing, and then she said she hated me and that being around me is worse than getting raped. (She was raped and thats how I came to be) I cried and she got in my face and mocked me crying and then told me she wasn't picking me up from school, which is 40 minutes away from my house. She then told me to giver her my phone and I got mad and said no, because I needed to find a way home. She then drove into the police station parking lot, and I gave up and gave her my phone. She then proceeded to call dispatch and said that they needed to come out and ""teach me a lesson"" because I can't behave myself. I then lost it and screamed and punched the dashboard and my leg and stomach and stuff. She then called dispatch again and told them that because they hadn't been outside to reprimand me, I had assaulted her, said I wanted to kill her, kill her babies, and murder everyone. WHICH I DID NONE OF! Of course the police now come out and believe her no matter what I say, and escort me to the nearest hospital. My Mom then told every doctor the same lie and called my stepdad and lied to him too, and of course, nobody is going to believe the kid. So then, I had to live at an overnight facility for 2 weeks to get treatment for my ""homicidal ways"". I finally just got released and did partial for 4 days, but yesterday my Mom pulled me out because I'm apparently going to fail 10th grade because I'm missing a lot of work from being out. I AM SO FRUSTRATED AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW!!!! Everything just seems like it's going downhill and falling apart, and I don't know if I can take it anymore.

528,"So I just got a talking to at work for constantly being ""late,"" which is clocking in at exactly on-time here. So, for example, if I'm supposed to be here at 8, I need to be clocking in about 5 minutes early every single time. I clock in exactly at 8 every single day, even if I do show up early on occasion. 

My problem is that I have Central Sleep Apnea. What in the world can I do to get up easier in the morning without requiring an act of God himself to drag me out of bed? Every morning is miserable, I'm a constantly stressed out human being, I stay up a little late (10-11pm) sometimes just to squeeze the most I can out of my day, I have severe breathing problems every morning because my airways don't want to expand quickly (this tempts me to stay in bed and stay as relaxed as possible until I can breathe normally which can take anywhere from 5-10 minutes, I fall back asleep every time) and it hurts enough to throw me in a coughing fit, and sometimes the bed is just too comfy. 

Can't afford to meet with a doctor on my medical issues because, well, my job doesn't pay me enough. I know it's affecting my work beyond just being occasionally late, and idk what to do about it. A good way to start, I would think, is figuring out how to wake up in the morning without wanting to die.

537,"So I’m 15F and just a few days ago, a group of my friends (similarly aged/slightly older) decided to make plans to hang out next week, to which I’m invited. 

Then they started making plans to bring bowls/joints and stuff, and smoke in a secluded-ish area. I’m completely fine with them doing it, it’s not a problem with me. Personally I’m not into all that stuff and don’t really want to be, but they can do whatever they want. 

The trouble is, my parents are kind of protective and I’m a first child, so I know for a fact that if I came back smelling like weed, they’d absolutely murder me. I generally have a pretty close relationship with them, so I’m thinking about explaining to them exactly what’s going on, and asking if they’d still be comfortable with me going to hang out with a bunch of kids smoking weed, knowing that I wouldn’t be touching it in the slightest. (And that’s the truth. I’m just not really interested.) That way, if they say yes, I get to go hang out with a bunch of close friends, and if they say no, they at least know I chose to come to them about something like this that I know they’ll be really wary about.

I should add that I brought the protective parents up to my friends and they assured me that they’re not gonna pressure me into doing anything I don’t want to. There are a few other kids going that won’t be doing anything. (They also say if I don’t smoke any but still am in the same proximity as them- nobody will be able to smell any on me- is this true?)

Another option may be us all hanging out like normal, and then the kids who want to smoke busting out the bowls later on in the hangout- and I conveniently have an out where I may have to leave a bit early because of a family event. So hypothetically I could dip out just before they start smoking.

What should I do? I really want to hang out with my friends but I don’t want to break my parents’ trust and have them never let me outside again, but I know it’s very likely that they’ll say no.",28Mar2019,1
538,"Hey reddit. I need some help. While I made a throwaway, I'm not sure how much I can ""change"" to make this anonymous while at the same time getting correct advice - wish me luck.

&amp;#x200B;

My family does well and we heard about a woman and her two kids that were living out of a car. After doing some internet sleuthing (her fb was not locked down) it seemed her post history verified she wasn't an  obvious nut job. She loved her kids, etc... A basic court records search showed no history of crime. We reached out and told her if she passed a drug test we would give her a warm place to stay with her kids while she searched for a job and place to live.

&amp;#x200B;

To make this as short as possible, the first year went great. She was wonderful, we grew attached to her kids, and our kids adored her. What was supposed to be a couple weeks turned into ""you can live here as long as you are working and in college.""

She helped around the house, with our kids, ran errands, got a full time job, and started at the community college. Her health got better and we truly enjoyed being around her.

Her trajectory was going up and we were like one big happy family. I'm not at all saying there were no arguments or issues - but they were not red flag issues. She had no one else. Her family kicked her out for being pregnant as a teen, her dad doesn't deserve the hair he breaths. The kids father is deceased, so no child support.

For that beautiful year she was an example of what happens when someone who got the short end of many sticks gets a hand up and a chance. We trusted her so much that even when we went out of town to visit family we left her in charge of our little homestead. She did a great job and we had no complaints about her care of the home and animals upon our return from Arizona.

Then she starts dating a guy. Guy breaks up with her after 3 months. The downward spiral began. This is a woman who was taught her worth is what a man says it is. It didn't matter how much we loved her, how much we tried to help. She started becoming unreasonable. She didn't want to be alone, unloved, and rejected. I would be trying to leave for work and she would be sound asleep and her kids running around unattended. She couldn't sleep she said, she was so depressed she got insomnia and many anxiety attacks. She wouldn't go to counseling.

I'm sure there are many many underlying issues, but we didn't know how to help anymore. She didn't listen to anything. She started missing classes, and while she was never neat, she became a total slob. Stopped helping out around the house that she lived in, and lost her shit when we asked for help. I don't even know how to explain how much she hurt us in the following months.

We both have full time jobs, our kids, and we have goats on the property and that takes up a lot of my time. Time she stopped respecting. Always asking me to babysit so she could go run errands. My husband and I were running out of time in our day. We made the mistake of thinking if she was given a little bit of space to get ahold of herself, things would be okay. We tried to give her unconditional love. But more and more we just had to say NO. We can't do this.

Over a six month period she sank down into a total lethargy of minimalist effort. She would go to work, and then claim she had no time for anything else. Everything we asked of her, she had some reason or excuse not to be able to do it - whether it was to help her self or us. So then she met another guy, and started getting better. We actually like this one. But her paranoia was at an all time high and she was convinced he was cheating on her. This dude is a trucker, so he has opportunity, but we could see how he looked at her and those kids. He really seemed to care, but he finally got sick of her constant jealousy and told her to stop or he would be out. We took the brunt of her anger. She even got mad when he and I started chatting without her, even though it was nothing but how much we cared about her.

The day came where my husband and I had to tell her to leave. We couldn't do it anymore. She was to the point of screaming at me for every perceived insult. No matter what we did for her, it was no longer good enough. Any request for gratitude or effort on her part was met with ""There you go guilt tripping me again."" I tried to explain that guilt tripping would be ""since you live here rent free, go clean my gutters and wash all my cars"" NOT ""can you please clean the bathroom you share and keep food off your floor and wake up with your children in the morning"".  


So when I finally cracked, which in my husband's opinion took far too long and required her to call me a bitch and say horrible things to me, we told her ""30 days to find a place and get out, we love you, but you are destroying us and effecting our children."" That's basically the jist.

Insert the most awkward month of our lives. She found a roommate and left. Our aim wasn't to completely leave her life, she has a good heart and we felt no one ever ""stayed"" in her life. So I kept in contact and tried to encourage her. We wanted her to learn that people can be mad at each other, and part ways, but still have love there. She wasn't forgotten.

To our surprise she stayed in school and kept her job. The months went by and while things were hard, she was making do. She entered therapy and apologized for her behavior. I agreed to baby sit when she went to therapy but I now charged her a whole 5 dollars an hour. A huge part of our issues had been that she didn't value our time and took advantage of it. So I felt by charging a small fee, she would take me more seriously. It worked. She was always on time to pick them up, thanked me every time, and became very polite. We started having fun chatting again and it seemed therapy was really helping her.

Then her roommate decided to move out of state. I bet you know where this is going.

We really have no defense. We had grown to love her and her children as part of our family and she had no where else to go again except for one offer - an ex boyfriend. The same one who had started her downward spiral. All we could think about was how hard that would be on her kids, and how much we loved them.

So we offered to let her live in our RV until she found somewhere to live. Hooked up electric and propane, and actually wrote out a contract of what she had to pay to live there. We made it clear she no longer lived in OUR house and we were not going to help her with the kids except when we had time and were paid to do so.

It went well for two months. She went to school, work, took care of her kids. Then the ex boyfriend still came back into her life and it all went to hell again. But worse.

Now he's gone, her job is gone, she failed her classes, and she's sitting in the RV day after day doing nothing.

We can evict her, sure. We should.

But here we are, not knowing what to do. Not wanting her to lose her kids and be under a bridge somewhere. Especially since she's burned almost every bridge of the people willing to help her - and I don't just mean us.

In all of this, I'm not perfect. There were times I over reacted, or we got mad over things that we shouldn't have. But I feel I'm being honest when I say that it was no more than any parental stuff. And maybe that was part of it, she hated being mothered. I don't know. We just wanted to help her build a life.

539,"So for my Economics IA I have to find an article about market failure and comment on it but I just can't find the right article. The draft was due last 2 weeks and I haven't submitted it. I don't think the teacher has checked it since my friend told me he hasn't got any feedback. At first I got an article which was approved by the teacher. But then when I tried to work on it, I found out that the topic of the article has little correlation with market failure.

540,"hi everyone. I (20F) need some advice. I’m having trouble making decisions lately. I got married last year, (no judgment please) and recently found out my husband has cheated on me. It kinda turned my world upside down. Anyway, I decided to try and work things out before leaving, because I love him and have been with them for over 4 years. I have moved far from family and friends to be with this person and have no intentions of going home, as things were harder for me there. I’ve felt extremely sad about a lot of things and wish I could stop thinking about my husbands infidelity. I also feel exhausted due to my work schedule. I am a preschool teacher and watch over 10 one year olds full time 5 days a week. I’m finding it harder and harder to not cry when something happens at work, like if one of the children spills something, or if one of the little ones bite one of their friends. I talked to my boss and she’s against me working part time because they are short on people. And this is frustrating to me. She basically flat out told me no. I feel pressured by my husband and boss to keep working. What I really wanna do is just take a break from everything maybe return to school to get my bachelors. I just feel as though I’m not doing what I want with my life, and I’m young enough to change it. I feel like I can’t take care of others right now because I’m so stressed out and sad. Am I being lazy? Should I take a break from working? What would you do? ",28Mar2019,1

She still texts me wanting to have a good talk and hang out. I really like this girl, and want to be more than friends with her. Is there anything that i can do? Or should i just stop texting her?

My grandma is dying of stage 4 lung cancer. She doesn’t have a lot of time left. Growing up we weren’t close. My parents got divorced and my dad moved 4 hours away with his parents (the currently sick grandma) so we rarely saw each other. 

We started speaking a little more regularly few years ago, but nothing more than, “what are you doing in school/work?” And that’s pretty much the same kind of relationship I have with my dad. Nonexistent. 

However I’m starting to feel like maybe I should go say goodbye, but frankly I’m terrified of it (as is everyone, and my grandma even more because she is the one dying), and I just feel like I don’t really want to in general. I feel like the last time I saw her was a happy one, and to leave it at that. And I know that in the future I won’t feel remorse for not seeing her in so much pain. 

But she lives 4 hours away. I’m a broke college student who has finals coming up. My classes are extremely hard right now and it wouldn’t do me any favors to take off work and school to drive up there to visit.

because of that, i was staying with her in the house to make sure she was alright and i didnt attend my classes for a Business course because i was feeling more depressed than usual as my mom is the only source of happiness in my life and i was worried about her and couldn't focus in class

anyways, we have a 6-day max absesences policy at univeristy, and if you exceed that  then you may get an F. now my teacher for that business class never takes attendance, so he has no proof/records of my absences

however, this week he sent an email saying that he will be enforcing attendance policy. so i came to class for the first time in 3 weeks after that email.

i walked into class and the teacher told me i should drop the course because i missed more than 6 classes. i told him i haven't. he told me to come talk to him after class.

so i went and told him my mother was sick. he said why didn't you send me an email? i told him it was personal and i didnt feel like sharing. plus, i missed exactly 6 classes not above (i count the amount of classes i miss) and he never took attendance in class, so i didnt really need to send an email. also, i didnt feel like sharing i was depressed and couldn't come to class

now he told me that he's going to have to enforce the policy and fail me because (he thinks) i exceeded the 6 absences. he said i have to get some sort of proof about my mother being sick (i didnt tell him the depressed part though) and he'll take that proof to the department who will then verify and make a decision

Now this is what im thinking im going to do:

* take photos of my mom's medical documents of her MRI on her brain, and her medical prescriptions and notes from dr saying she has epilepsy 

* go the the business department head my self and explain my story showing them the proof that my mother was sick


* ask the department if i should get a medical note saying i was clinically depressed (i've been depressed for years btw). i can do this by taking a diagnosis from the counseling center.



i can't afford to drop this course. i dont have money to repeat courses and my father would kill me for it. plus, it's important to mention that i've never failed a course in this uni, and all my other teachers from the other classes didn't talk about the absensces with me because they probably have on record that i haven't missed more than six

So I have clinical depression, first off. I'm in the middle of an episode right now so life really sucks currently. Its made worse by my schedule: I have three art studios that all meet twice a week (I'm an illustration major) and with the semester wrapping up, the pressure is getting worse but I can't get special education treatment because, well, the depression wasn't this bad when I started college in fall 2017. In short, everything is bad, there's a lot to do, and just thinking about doing any of it makes my chest tight and it gets hard to breathe. Even worse, I'm staring to realize/feel like my professors don't think I'm up to par. I don't feel like I can make it as an artist for a fuckton of reasons, one of which is definitely that I'm not good enough and I don't seem the have the drive to be better.

I'm guessing some people here have been in one or two of the situations I'm in now. So, how did the redditors who were depressed in college deal with it? Did you have to take some semesters off? I have considered it, but currently I have a scholarship that pays for all my classes as long as I'm a full time student, which doesn't leave much time for an internship.

568,"My boyfriend's mother loves her children beyond belief and would do anything for them. She is also a very sensitive person and very much takes things to heart.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has had obvious anxiety symptoms since we began dating almost 4 years ago. At least to me they were obvious, but to others they would not have been because it was very internalized anxiety. Since we got comfortable enough with each other I have been telling him he should go see a therapist. Since he was in high school he had been asking his parents periodically to get tested for ADHD because he could never find the motivation to do his work and stuff. His mom flat out refused every time with no question because she said that ADHD is just over diagnosed for addicts and people who want to succeed the easy way. Finally about two years ago his adviser called his mom and told her she recommends him being tested for ADHD. She accepted it this time and let him get tested.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is with his psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

The main things are :

He was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, not ADHD. I am a psychology major and pre-med, but I in no means claim to know more, however; I am very interested in it and have taken a fair share of classes on it. On top of that I have bipolar as well so I have been through it too. Seeing as he was diagnosed with GAD, from what I learned in class is that the standard treatment first is to go to a therapist. She prescribed him an ADHD medication and said therapy is not necessary. Her reasoning was that his anxiety stems from dissatisfaction in academic performance, which I had no idea where she got that from cause it was not stated at all. I did not say anything cause it is not my place and his mom was there.

&amp;#x200B;

After prescribing him  ADHD medication when he was diagnosed with GAD she said they would ""touch base on the phone"" in 6 months. For those that don't know, the initial period after going on a psychiatric medication is extremely tricky and it is typical for the patient to be checked on every 2 weeks-1 month (sometimes even more frequently depending on severity)

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor forgot about the 6 month appointment. Between the initial prescription and now my boyfriend was having increased anxiety to the point of panic attacks now because duh she gave him a stimulant for anxiety!!

&amp;#x200B;

After telling her about his increased anxiety she prescribed him Prozac for anxiety and Trazodone to sleep. After taking the first dose of Trazodone my boyfriend woke up with such blurry vision he could not navigate the room, extreme headache, and slept until 7 pm. I called my dad who is a pharmacist. He asked the dosages. 60 mg Prozac and 200 mg Trazodone. My dad said that is a lethal combination if taken over a long period of time consistently (in can result in serotonin syndrome). He also told me that Trazodone is an old antidepressant that is not used very much anymore because even on a correct dose the side effects are still obvious. Also he said the typical starting dose is 25-50mg, never 200mg.

&amp;#x200B;

We then checked with my dad about the initial ADHD medication. It was one that had only been approved by the FDA 9 months prior. It was a childrens ADHD medication that was not intended to be used for adults. The clinical trials resulted in 50% of adults developing suicidal thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend is now 5 weeks out from graduating college and has so many stipulations to graduate on time that his anxiety is at a sky high level. He is avoiding like crazy, not getting out of bed, and just generally unhappy. He is not very open about emotions so I often worry he could be having suicidal thoughts because he does express that he wants to be happy but cant be.

&amp;#x200B;

The two problems I have are one, my boyfriend is a HUGE hypochondriac so if I explain to him why this doctor is not good and that if I had not talk to my dad it could have potentially been bad, he will go into a full on panic about if the meds he is taking now are okay. He also has a constant irrational fear of having a heart attack and even taking advil when he drank the day before panics him. Sooo that means my only option would be to talk to his mom about it, but like I said she is very sensitive and defensive. I in no way think I know more, and up until my dad expressed how dangerous that could be I thought it was just my personal opinion. My mom is a doctor as well, so they both actually talked to me seriously to tell me (even though I knew) how quickly mental health situations can spiral when not handled properly. However; I do not know how I would be able to talk to his mom without the message coming across as ""I know what to do you are just making it worse"" which obviously is not my intention whatsoever. I know that we both have the same end goal, to get him healthy again, but she is his mom and he will listen to her no matter what and in almost all cases I would say the mother knows best, but maybe not this time.

&amp;#x200B;

does anyone have any thoughts on what I could do to not upset anyone, but also get him on a path that will get him healthy?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: you are also probably wondering why he does not just go to a different doctor where we go to school. my boyfriend was raising in the very traditional southern home where you never disrespect or go against your parents, especially your mom. his parents still financially support him, so he still abides by their rules. if his mom found out he went behind her back to go to a doctor here i really cant say if she would either get mad and angry at him or if she would be so upset and take it as her being a bad mother. although he could technically just go and pay with cash, i would not suggest that to him because i know doing that without his moms knowledge would give him even more anxiety.

573,"So basically my social life has been getting really complicated and I was kinda hoping that you guys can help me. Please bear with the long story.

Im a male university student studying overseas and I usually hang around with my group of friends (2F and 1M) for the last two years. Now I know that they are kinda toxic in that they like to talk shit behind people's backs but I learned to go along with it (and even join them from time to time). So basically, two years ago, these guys once 'kicked' me out of the group since I was friends with a person that they dislike and they said that they don't want me to bring said person along and 'ruin the mood'. We managed to talked about it and I decided to forgive them but at this point I knew that they were really defensive with a sort of this-is-not-my-fault attitude (loads of excuses etc). 

Last year, the male friend in the group (lets call him A) got a girlfriend (lets call her D). D and I are also really close friends. At this point I started to spend a lot of time with the other two female friends in the group (lets call them C and I) while at the same time I also managed to have another friend group (all guys). Basically at this time A was feeling more and more excluded since we assumed he was spending time with his girlfriend. At one time he was pissed since me and the other guys went to a restaurant without him, but since he is really timid, he didnt really say anything until I asked him about it. When we talked, he accused me of trying to isolate him as payback for last year (which is not true btw). After that we traded apologies and try to move on, but at that point I started thinking that maybe he's not such a great friend after all.

After that we all went on exchange for a semester. During which, D would sometimes call me and talked about her relationship which was surprisingly falling apart (they looked really lovestrucked when in public) and they ended up breaking up.

Fast forward to now, I ended up spending almost all of my time with D since their breakup and I honestly have developed feelings for her (which she said she cant answer now since the breakup is still fresh on her mind). At this point, A has gotten really close with C and I again and has excluded me again from the group, only this time I dont feel like trying to get into the group again. 

Honestly Im happy to spend my time with D but I also think its sad to lose my friends like this (as toxic as they are). I feel like if I try to confront A and the others again they'll just throw a bunch of excuses at me. What should I do?

575,"We are assigned a project twice a month to pitch to our boss and upper management. The work is painstaking and takes up a lot of time. The last 4 months I've been forced to work with Bob(36). On every single project, he's had something come up and cannot finish his side of the work, forcing me to do it days (and last month HOURS) before the presentation is due. I've talked to him about it before and he got very upset. He said I was nitpicky and all this stuff about how he's worked in our field longer than I have so I have to suck it up and just do it. I can understand maybe once or twice, because I get it...shit happens. But every month? I finish the work and my boss is always very pleased. Bob gets part of the bonuses as well when they are implemented which really grinds my gears because that is MY work.

2 weeks ago there was another project assigned, I decided to partner with a new guy at work to show him the ropes (and get away from Bob). The new guy is 26 and although he's not 100% familiar with guidelines, he's eager to learn and TRIES. Other than that, he's a cool dude. Bob seemed kind of hurt that I decided to work with 26 and I explained that I was trying to get into upper management so mentoring would look good for me (not a total lie). Bob huffed and puffed and walked away. I felt really bad because this nice lady I've worked with a few times was forced to work with Bob. 

The presentation is due on Monday the 1st. We finished ours on Tuesday night. However, I got a text from nice lady last night asking me if I could help since Bob pulled one of his stunts. She has to help her mother over the weekend so she wanted to finish the project early. She didn't know it was a norm for Bob so she let it slide. 26 and I went over to help NL finish the project, it wasn't a lot but about 2 hours of work with the 3 of us. 

We finished early at about 8 and decided to go out to this bar and grille to celebrate 26's first project/s. WHO DO WE SEE SITTING AT THE BAR? Yep, Bob. 
She was on the verge of tears so we decided to go out to another restaurant. I told her everything I've been through with him for the past 8 projects. She was shocked. Bob has been with the company for almost a decade and shes never heard anything about this behavior before. Our boss is pretty uptight and even has a sign that says ""NO DRAMA"" over his desk. He and Bob get along very well. 
 How can we tell our boss that he has been skimping out on the work and accepting the bonuses?",28Mar2019,1
576,"The problem started a few days ago, when i got an internship, i was very excited at first as i am in film school and i wanted industry experience. I live in Brazil and unfortunately the industry here is tiny and most brazillian don't watch brazillian movies (some of them even say they hate brazillian movies), so the only internship i got was in a company that makes soap operas for TV (unlike movies, soap operas are hugely popular in Brazil), since i started worked it has been a mental hell for me because that's simply not the kind of entertainment i want to make, i can't stand soap operas.

But again, that's either working with soap operas or making arthouse filmes to be exhibited to a festival of maybe 30 people and live off goverment money for the rest of my life. When i got into film school, i had a dream of making big hollywood-style blockbusters, that's the kind of stuff i'm into, my motto was ""if i keep trying and not give up, i could be first one to make it!"", but after a year and a half into film school, talking to people in the industry, teachers, graduates and simply seeing every genre/blockbuster-y movie made here (sci-fi, horror, action, thriller) simply TANKING massively in the box-office, i think i may be starting to realize that maybe my dream is stupid and i should have gone to law school instead like my family wanted me to and work for the goverment.

580,"Hi

This sub probably gets these types of posts often and I'm joining their ranks. This is going to be a longer post and I don't think I'll be writing a TL;DR because I think you should understand all of the circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know what to do with my life and I REALLY need your help.

I know this is extremely common, but I just dont know what to do. No short-term plan, no long-term plan. No plans at all.

I will break down the important details in separate paragraphs.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with me. I'm an 18 (almost 19) year old male. For most of my life, I've had difficulties speaking with people that I'm not already comfortable with. I know this is not uncommon at all, but for me it was so extreme that I literally couldn't bring myself to face some of my classmates. Luckily, though, I think I've grown out of it as now I have an easier time speaking to everyone. Although I still find it hard to maintain eye contact and I need to revise what I'm going to say when I plan on starting a conversation. What's this got to do with the topic? Well, I've figured out that **my mood is heavily dependant on the atmosphere around me**, so I think **having people around me is important**. However, this might be a double-edged sword, because I think I'm an introvert. **Being around lots of people for long periods of time tires me**.

&amp;#x200B;

Computer games. I've spent ALOT of my free time behind a computer screen. It's **my addiction** and I have **denied it for over a decade**, because ""it's not wasting time if you enjoy it"". Yeah, I enjoyed playing them then, but **I don't like that I** ***played*** **them now**. It's all I have ever done. Come home from school, play games, go to sleep. I haven't had many hobbies. I've practiced some sports, but quit them over the years. **Computer games give you enjoyment that you can't experience twice**. And now I'm almost 19 and don't have an interesting hobby. Even though I dislike the past me for playing games, I still play to this day. I feel like I can quit at any time, but I just don't have anything to replace it with. I don't have any hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

School. I'm **2 and a half months away from graduating high school**. I don't know if my school is easy or I'm just a little smart, but I've never had troubles with grades. I used to get straight A's without studying. Nowdays I also get a couple of B's (without studying). **The fact that I don't study will be my downfall** as I plan on applying to college and I'm sure that it will not be easy there. Don't get me wrong, I like to study, but it's hard for me to focus if the topic isn't interesting. Now, you might be thinking ""if you know you're going to apply to a college, then you know what to do with your life!"". Well that's the thing. **I'm applying, because I DON'T know what to do**, but I also **don't want to waste time by not doing anything**.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I good at? Well in college I want to study informatics, because **I know I can excel at programming and anything logic based**. It's what I'm good at. But **it's not something that I find particular joy in**. It's just that, if I'm good at it, maybe I could make a career out of it. Obviously I've gotten pretty good at some video games over the years, but that is not going to help me at all. Other than that, I'm not particularly good at anything specific. I see myself as a jack of all trades, but a master of none.

&amp;#x200B;

""Just find something that you enjoy doing!"". **I've tried**. Several times. I've sat down with no distractions, only a pen and a blank piece of paper and the goal of writing down what I truly enjoy doing and wish to do with my life. The piece of paper always remains empty. Whenever I think of something that could be fun, I just can't see myself doing it for the rest of my life, because I feel like **there's something better to do with my life**, but I can't figure out what. Maybe I'm being naive, but I understand that our time is limited and there's no turning back.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend. I've been in a relationship for a year and a half now and I love her more than ever. There's something that's eating me from the inside and that's the fact that recently **I've had trouble finding motivation to make her gifts** (Just a little side note: we don't buy eachother presents, we craft them ourselves). I know this is not the subreddit for relationship advice, but it ties in with my story. You see, right now, she is the **only thing that keeps me going**. I would have given up on myself a long time ago, but she keeps setting the bar for me and she doesn't know it. **I want to make her happy**, I don't care if I'm not happy (but in a way, me being happy makes her happy, so that's what I want to do).

&amp;#x200B;

Something which I recently started thinking about is ADHD. You see, **I have trouble focusing on things**. I find it difficult to read books, because my mind wanders elsewhere. I've never really thought that there's somethign wrong with me. I've always been average. When I visited the ADHD subreddit, **I was amazed by how much I have in common with those people**. Now, I want to go see a professional about it, but for that I have to make a phone call and that's what's been putting me off. I don't like phone calls very much, don't know why.

&amp;#x200B;

There are alot of other details that I wanted to mention in this post, but writing this took a considerable amount of time and I've forgotten alot of the details meanwhile, so you can ask me anything if you need more info.

One last thing to note is that I am NOT tired of life and living. I do not find various activities necessarily boring, it's just that I always think there's something better to do.

I like living and find it absolutely amazing and I want to have the best time I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if I've not structured this post well, I had some good ideas but I forgot them.

Please help me figure out what should I do now and in long-term.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",28Mar2019,1

582,"This'll be a long one I'm sure, but I'll try to keep it short.

A little over a month ago my friend came out as having gender dysphoria, I honestly couldn't care less if he has it or not, I just care whether or not he's a dick to me. So we had an argument about something I can't even remember and he decided to lie to me AND my friends and said these exact words,

 ""Oh yeah *op* there's something I've been pissed off about and I've been hiding my feelings about it, when I first came out you said ""OH YEAH, YOU'RE JUST COPYING TRANS YOUTUBERS AND ATTENTION SEEKING"" ""

And what he said is complete bullshit, he told my friends that I insulted his gender dysphoria, and now they all despise me, basically. See, our friends sorta work like this human Centipede where the guy with gender dysphoria is at the front and everyone's eating his shit, to put it into the most accurate and disgusting analasys possible.

Thing is, we all have legitimate proof that I did not say that, in fact, the first thing I actually said was ""I can't tell if you're joking or not"" since he was saying it in a jokey tone.

He's sorta what I would call ""Transtrender"" since he constantly brags about it and how much he wants to be the other gender cuz it's cool, you'd have to know him to understand, but who knows? I could be wrong.

He says he has a couple of other disorders as well which he seems to brag about as well, I couldn't bother to say tho. This post might come off as hateful and mean, but again, you'd have to know him to understand what I mean. Thanks for reading, I appreciate it.",28Mar2019,5

591,"The lead on my team is the most negative person I have ever met. We sit close to each other, and I constantly hear her mumbling negative things to herself about emails she receives or work she’s doing. She has picked me as a sounding board, so she vents to me about people or situations that are bothering her ALL THE TIME. And I actually had to make a chart because it’s so noticeable - she’s talked badly about every single person on our team to me at one time or another. After a certain point, I just want to say “have you thought maybe you’re the problem?” But she’s my lead, so I just kind of nod my head and try to stay out of drama.

But it is extremely unprofessional since she’s in a superior position to me. She comes across as extremely catty and volatile, and I think most people on the team (including our boss) are afraid of her because if you disagree with her in the slightest you face her wrath. I’ve seen her turn on people quickly... one day she’s talking about how much she likes someone, then they do something she doesn’t like and she turns on them, starting a smear campaign.

She’s been on the team for 8 years, which is the longest out of anyone, and she unfortunately has the most knowledge about everything so it would be a huge burden to get rid of her. Side note, but our head boss is also remote and doesn’t even know the full extent of how bad she is.

I’ve thought about setting up a meeting with the boss to discuss this, but here’s where it gets complicated... the lead on the team is literally the reason I have this job. I started off in an entry level position, and she went out of her way to advocate for me to join her team. I do appreciate that, but it’s getting to a point where I actually regret even taking this job because of her. Also, other people have submitted anonymous hr complaints about her but nothing was done.

We do have the capability to work from home so I’ve started working from home several times a week because life is too short and the head of our department told us we could “work from home a couple times a week if we need to.” But then my lead got controlling yesterday and told me I need to “clean up my act and come in more” which is bullshit because I get all my work done and our boss has not said anything. I told that to her yesterday and she accused me of being confrontational (which I can assure you I was not). There’s an element where I feel like she’s just very very controlling, and anyone that does not act exactly how she wants becomes an enemy. If you attempt to have a conversation about where she might be wrong. she comes after you. The more I think about it, the more I can’t stand her.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal?

To;dr - My team lead is the most negative, abrasive person I’ve ever met. She’s controlling and uses me as a sounding board to complain about anyone that does not act exactly how she wants. We have the capability to work from home so I do (a couple times a week) just to avoid her, but yesterday (when I was in the office) she got very controlling and told me I need to come in more. This is bullshit because our boss said we could work from home a couple times a week and I get all my work done. I still go in at least 2-3 times a week.When I told her this, she said I was being confrontational which is bullshit because I was nice about it, just trying to have a conversation. Nobody can disagree with her. She’s been on the team for the longest and has the most knowledge (even longer than the boss) so I think our boss is too afraid to get rid of her. Not to mention our boss is remote and oblivious. What should I do?",28Mar2019,1

595,"Hi,

It's been a year and 3 months exactly since I started dating my girlfriend. Recently, in the last 3 months, I've felt my spark of love for her slowly die and my interest turn to other girls. Around December I bought her a promise ring because she had told me she had bought me one and had it since we were dating for 6 months. She would constantly ask about it and out of stress I bought it. I then kept it in my closet. She was very snippy with me until I got tired of it and pretty much yelled at her about it. Then she became this doll-like version of herself where all she does is nice things and she seems insecure about whether or not she's being mean. A few weeks ago I returned the ring for full price and even told her a few days after, and she had no negative reaction at all.

I feel like I've broken her and I want to move on, I'm a junior in High School and she's a senior so I want to live my life unshackled for a while and not be a high school sweetheart.

599,"Relationships are interesting? I wouldn’t know I haven’t been in one. Well IRL anyway. I’ve had crushes don’t get me wrong but I’ve never asked them out. On the rare occasion I’ve actually asked them out I was met with the response nobody really wants to hear. I think you can guess what it is.

Regardless, I met this girl on Overwatch PC and she added me and contacted me via battle.net and eventually we got each other’s discord’s. We talked for a while and I really liked her but she was already in a relationship so I didn’t think much about it. 

When they broke up most people would “swoop in for the kill” (I genuinely hate using that phrase) and have her as a gal around my arm. However, I wanted to play it safe and be there for her. (Classic Rookie/nice guy move I know). But I was trying to be there for her genuinely.

At this time I guess she was experimenting (you know what I mean) and I thought my changes were over but I guess it wasn’t because one of her friends liked me (surprising to me because I hate myself). So we were in a relationship for a couple of days but then she said her mum didn’t allow her to date, but she would date me in 2 years when she was older

I told her that it didn’t matter and I’d be waiting for her even after 20 years. 

But when I talk to her now as a friend I can’t be there for her as she talks to her ex and her friends which is fine I guess but I don’t know if she even likes me anymore.

So we stayed friends and the first gal I was talking about got a bf out of the blue and I don’t know why but that’s ripping me to shreds.

With me being a physical person and liking hugs and what not e-relationships or LDR wasn’t going to be the easiest but I would try my best to make it work.

With all the emotional shit and me hitting rock bottom multiple times and even going overtime to my therapist this has not been going well at all.

Within the time I taken to writing poetry about suicide and depression and my teachers found out and m only made it worse.

There have been good days sprinkled in but it’s not as often as the bad days.

I just don’t know anymore.

I don’t think a bullet or a rope would solve the situation but I’m not sure what to do anymore.

If I ask her out and she says no (most likely) awkwardness and puts a strain on the relationship.

If she says yes (not sure how likely) I’ll be happy but probably hurt people in the process. 

I just don’t know anymore.


Regardless thank you for your time

This started an argument between the two of them and my brother went round to the driver's side to have a word.

My brother then went to the door with the bat and started banging on it .The driver called the police and said my brother was trying to attack him with a baseball bat.

611,"As the title says, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure yesterday at the ripe old age of 16. I am thoroughly confused by this. I was around 130/70 two months ago, and since then, I have lost around 3 to 5 pounds, limited by food intake, started watching the food that I eat, and exercising more, yet my blood pressure has risen to around 140/80. 

I have watched a few videos and conducted a few google searches regarding high blood pressure, and they all seem to say the same things. Lose weight, eat less salt, don't smoke, don't drink, and exercise more. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I have eaten a lot healthier in the past month, I am a little bit less than 160 pounds, 5' 9"" and I am a competitive swimmer, meaning that a good portion of my weight is muscle. However, I am going to swallow my pride and say that I do have a fold of fat on my stomach that somewhat sticks out. I am called muscular more often than fat, so I assume that I am not in denial of my physique.

What concerns me is the fact that I had changed so much of my diet, started exercising more, and lost some weight, but the problem only got worse. My parents have told me that I have to limit my intake of food, and that I have to start running for an hour a day since my swim season had ended recently. I am hoping this well help, but I am not sure why this time will be any different.

612,"Hey, I'm an early-20s guy from England about to move to a new town. It's pretty small and I'm not 100% sure about the facilities available but I plan on exploring after arriving. I've been a recluse for over 5 years now, and currently have no friends (except a few people I infrequently text whom I've never met), and a host of issues that have given me very poor self-confidence.

I'm really wanting to make a change and if not make friends, at least have a conversation with someone who isn't related to me so I can determine how far behind I am. Some caveats:

- I can't drive as of yet.
- I have very little money. Like barely enough to get a sandwich and a coffee. I dislike borrowing/begging from family.
- My interests are not at all conducive to being social. Video games (nothing multiplayer), music, writing. 
- I currently have no job. When I move I'll definitely be trying hard to get one, but I've been trying for over a year now with no avail. Probably due to poor qualifications and lack of life skills.
- My laziness is high and my motivation is low. It is incredibly hard for me to summon the courage to go even slightly out of my comfort zone.

So far, the only improvement I am envisioning other than getting a job is starting to play tennis (the only sport I don't hate, and I need some exercise), as there is apparently a tennis court in the area. However, I cannot promise my lack of willpower won't make me abandon that pretty quickly.

Any advice?",28Mar2019,2
613,"I’m on mobile so please excuse any grammatical error.))

Ok, here’s some background...
My friend who we’ll just call C for today, has been a very nice guy for a very long time. We both shared a passion for nature which practically brought us together as friends. 
Both of us start on the basketball team and he is really good. I’ve never personally looked, but from just examining I figured he has excelling grades.

Now this is where shit goes south...

My school is pretty loose on dress codes and stuff like that, although there are a few VERY strict rules that apply. Such as, if you are using your phone in class it will be taken away. 
Pretty much all of the basic things, no short-shorts or tank-tops, no gum, and no AirPods (which nobody follows anyways).

All of the kids in my school are pretty nice, but some are troublemakers and the “Popular Ones” that we all have, don’t really behave as wanted by the teachers. Although it’s not that bad.

Enters-New girl. (NG)

Now, this new girl had previously gone to a very ghetto school from what I’ve heard. From the first day I met her, I had an instant gut feeling that she was trouble. She’s a bitch to the girl’s outside of her clique, and the once nice girls before have turned into strange hoodlums. teachers can’t stand her, she is practically sitting in the office most of her day, and never really pays attention during the few subjects I have with her.

Now over the last few months my mom has been talking with me about an ongoing Juul and Vape issue in the school. (Mostly the sixth graders from her sources.) kids have been posting pictures of themselves vaping in the school bathrooms, which is incredibly stupid if your trying not to get caught. 

Recently some people in the grades threw a party...A big party...From what I’ve heard (I didn’t attend) there was lost of drinking at the party, and some of the kids were checked by a breathalyzer by the police afterwards. 

And guess who was at the party...C.
My other friend told me that he had been drinking heavily and he was especially worried. But I somehow let this go.

Fast forwards a few weeks later, I’m sitting in the middle row of three rows of desks in math class. It’s the last class before we have to go home, and I’m sitting next to C. The other person in our three man table group was at a band lesson. So it was just me and C...NG was also in the class, staying especially quiet for her usual self. Class went by normally, with some people getting yelled at like always (The troublemaker kids). Then NG walks from the back to our side of the classroom.

(Side note: our line of desks was right next to a table with a sink, and a box of tissues. So many people would come over to talk or get test answers while pretending to blow their nose. The teacher miraculously never noticed)

Anyways, NG was walking up to “Blow her nose” while looking C dead in the eyes. She was wearing a hoody with long sleeves just like C. And In a quick motion NG slipped a Juul out of her sleeve and into C’s sleeve which was sitting there expectantly waiting. He quickly stuffed it in his desk while the teacher wasn’t looking,
It was a VAPE PEN! I’ve never even seen one in real life, but I knew what it looked like. I looked down at his hands that were neatly folded over the desk, I didn’t know where the pen was anymore. I apparently looked shocked, because he just whispered to me,

“Don’t tell anyone I have this, my mom would kill me if she found out”

This SHOCKED me, he looked like he completely trusted me even though I just caught him contributing to an epidemic of Juul users.

But I just nodded slowly...I don’t know why, but I did, maybe I though that he wasn’t actually using it. A few minutes later he got a hall pass signed and went to the bathroom, I silently prayed to myself that he wasn’t using it. I could barely do my work with the conflicting emotions knocking at my brain.

When he came back, NG came back up once again. However she was the one to receive the Juul. She sat back down, and soon enough she went to the bathroom also.

Meanwhile the friend that had told me C was drinking at the party had seen it with me. He looked down absolutely mortified. He was a practical joker, so a few of our friends began to joke about how he was “So serious” and “Teacher! I’m worried about him” until he began to chuckle, although I could see he was feeling the same things as I was. The rest of class C was especially goofy, and I kept wondering “What if he’s high?” Trying to reason that there’s no way. 

Class finished and we all went home, it’s been a few hours and I’m just writing about it now. 

I know the most logical idea would be to tell someone, but something deep in my gut doesn’t want to. Maybe I’m scared that he’ll get in serious trouble and blame it on me, ruining our friendships 

I just need some advice, What should I do?

621,"I'm sorry if this is sort of lengthy, jumbled and confusing, but I need to get this out of my system and hear what other people have to say, so here goes. 

About a year ago I was at a party with friends. At this point I was 16 and had a boyfriend of 6 months. We drank some alcohol (I'm from Germany, you can drink with 16 here) and was lounging on my friends couch when this random guy my age showed up, let's call him Louis. 
Nobody invited him and we don't know how he came in, I don't know if he had drunk anything or not. I didnt let him bother me in my giggly, happy state.
There were a few other people in the room, but at this time I wasn't really interacting with anyone.

Louis sat down next to me and I started conversing and being nice, but appearantly he had other plans, because he started feeling me up. He kissed my body and started licking me and tried to undress me even with everyone else around. He put his hand under my shirt. I told him to stop, but couldn't get him off. A friend of mine noticed what was happening and came in to save me fairly quickly but the damage was done and I felt disgusting and dirty. 

I cried in the bathroom for a while after and when my boyfriend finally found me and I told him what happened, he was livid, as in ready to fight this guy. Someone held him back though and Louis fled from the party.

I didn't see him for a while, but the whole thing stuck with me. I talked it out in therapy. I know it doesn't sound that bad and I know other people have had way worse happen, but I just cannot forget that feeling of helplessness and disgust.

He lived close by and after about 6 months I started running into him then and again in public places even though I would try my best to avoid him.
Lately I've been seeing him more and more. He seems to remember me and think what he did was funny. Everytime my boyfriend and I see him in public he'll try to call us over, yell our names and ask us if we remember the party. His friends always laugh at us.
We try not to engage because he's a douchebag and we don't want to fight, but last night something a little more extreme happened.

My school was hosting a graduation show that the seniors set up every year where they imitate teachers, put on funny sketches and reminisce about their school days, it's always really fun. I was laughing and happy, but when they called three volunteers to come on stage from the audience my heart stopped. Louis was there and he doesn't even go to my school. 
I was sat in the first row and he just stared at me. I was shaking and desperately wanted to run away. I felt so dumb for being scared because he's only some scrawny dude, barely taller than me and he probably couldn't physically hurt me, so I stayed put. When the sketch was over he left the stage and I tried to forget about him.

About an hour later I had to go to the bathroom. Every single person present was in the auditorium, so the halls were completely deserted. After doing my business I went to wash my hands and fiddle with my hair in front of the mirror. That's when I saw Louis staring at me from outside the door. He had followed me to the bathroom and just stood there and stared. I was terrified. After what felt like ages he not only walked away, but left the building completely. I ran back to the auditorium.

When the show was over, it was already dark outside. My boyfriend (still the same one, 2 years and going strong ♥ ) and I headed out to walk home because I live very close to the school. Outside Louis and his group of friends were waiting for us. They had come back and started yelling obscene things like ""hey [boyfriends name] remember when I almost fucked your girlfriend?"" or ""remember me, sweetheart?"".
I just looked at the ground and we hurried away. The whole way home I was afraid they would follow us, but they didn't. I barely slept last night. 

Today my boyfriend texted me, he had gone grocery shopping and saw Louis and his friends again. He walked over to talk to Louis (or rather yell at him) and ask him what he thinks he's doing scaring me. Louis said he would beat him to shit in the parking lot if he didn't walk away right now. My Bf stood still and told him to try and hit him. 
(I am so grateful he stood up for me like that, but I'm scared of what could have happened, since Louis was surrounded by all his friends and my Bf was by himself) 
Louis did nothing. My Bf said ""that's what I thought."" and walked away. Louis spit on him but my boyfriend just kept walking.

I think Louis is really angry now and I'm afraid what might happen. I always think I will stand up for myself when I see him again but when the time comes I can't say a word and get really scared. I feel like a baby.

What should I do next time I see him? Has anyone expirienced anything similar? I'm afraid of what might happen. Please, please share your opinions and advice, anything helps. ",28Mar2019,2

625,"Okay so I would like to preface saying please only comment if you have genuine advice to give, this isn't to critique anyone or be mean. I just need to know how to best handle this situation.

So basically, my friend/roommate has gotten very comfortable borrowing money from me.

It started basically because she doesn't make loads of money, to be fair we earn the same p/m, but I have an overdraft as I'm a student, and I also have parents to rely on if absolutely necessary, she has neither.

I don't really know how to explain, I started doing little things like buying dinners, giving her rides (I have a car she doesn't drive), offering to buy her cigarettes or alcohol when she's broke. I've been there I get it being broke sucks.

But the last couple months I've realised she's just really irresponsible with money, as well as being pretty happy spending other people's. Within a week most of her monthly wages are gone, any money she gets extra like tips or tax returns gets immediately spent on things like coffee and clothes.

She'll suggest things like going to the supermarket, but expects me to drive and pay for everything. Today I ordered food, asked if she wanted anything, and she (very minorly) complained about where I was ordering from. Yesterday she ordered food from one of my favourite places and didn't even text to ask if I wanted anything (to be fair her LDR partner paid for it, but bc the restaurant is quite far, I wouldn't want to get someone to drive all the way out twice in one night, plus there's the face that it's cheaper for everyone if we order together with delivery charges and such, I ask every time I order food if she wants everything she has yet to ever ask even if I were to pay).

So here's the issue. I want to speak to her about it, but I want to know how to say it. I also want to get across that it's *really* bothering me. I don't mind lending friends a few quid here and there, but I'm talking oweing me near 100 each month which doesn't always get repaid. I'm good with money but I'm essentially supporting both of us most of the time and I'm tired of it. I have no disposable income. 

I know I'm not the only one she borrows from either. Mainly its her partner and I.

I want to sit her down and talk to her about borrowing money, but I also want to encourage her to look into options of having her own money (she could probably get an overdraft as she'll be a student this fall, which would definitely help). She's said multiple times she's happy to let me help her with finances and budgeting but we've yet to actually discuss it.

Anyway tldr; my roommate and best friend borrows a lot of money from her partner and I, spends all her own wages in the first week due to somewhat reckless spending, and I don't know how to approach the subject. ",28Mar2019,1
626,"Today I filed paperwork to withdraw from my university.

Overall I’m secure in my decision but I find myself wondering what to do next. I had always imagined that a Bachelor’s degree was required to get anywhere in life so by dropping out I feel kind of like I failed, but my school honestly made me miserable. I’m failing almost all of my classes and I don’t feel connected to a community at my school at all. Additionally there are no extracurriculars here outside of sports, no Greek Life, and no cultural clubs or communities outside one or two run by students.

I have never really had aspirations besides writing a novel one day but I’m well aware that writing novels isn’t going to pay the bills unless I become the next JKR, and I don’t think I have what it takes to be the next JKR. I have an OK GPA if I can drop some classes and focus on the one (I will probably still leave with over a 3.0 GPA), but it’s nowhere near enough to get into a college that I think would actually make me happy and provide me with the kinds of opportunities that I want/need (it’s Ivy League).

I don’t have any job prospects because I’ll be returning home to Texas and there is very little public transit in my city, and I can’t drive and don’t have a car. A lot of businesses are family-owned and aren’t hiring, or the positions offered at chain stores tend to require degrees as a minimum requirement.

Overall I just feel lost. Nothing has felt meaningful or fulfilling to me in a long time, and by leaving school I will be cutting off my access to a wonderful city (Philadelphia) that I really enjoyed being able to visit whenever I wanted.

When we first met, he had it cut, and he was full of joy, he promised me and himself, that he would go to his barber regularly.
Time went by, and he was lazy, or I don’t really know the reason, but his hair grew and grew, and it became unappealing for a lot of people. 
When my childhood friend’s birthday was coming up, even she asked if my boyfriend had his hair cut, because he looked waaayy better with a short hairstyle.
My mother was pretty straightforward aswell: she think it is just undemanding.
We had a plan, which was to go to my school’s ball, similar to prom. Then I told him without any kind, comforting words, that I would appreciate if he would take care of his hair, because I’m going to spend a lot of time doing my “ball” hair.
He agreed.
Our plan got cancelled.
Aaaand I brought the topic up again, I stated that I want him to get his hair cut despite the fact that we won’t attend to that event.
He first tried to defend himself, his reasoning was that I believe he is not taking care of himself, and it makes him sad.
Later on, I tried to talk about this again, and then he finally gave in, and told the truth: he has started to become bald, and that’s his biggest nightmare. He is not sure if he would be able to have long hair in the future.
An hour ago I talked with my friend and my mother again, and they are still on the “ cut it, now” side, and regardless of me being attracted to men with long hair, I have the same opinion. I sent him a message, that I told them that he is scared of being bald soon. And he got mad at me because of that, that I don’t understand how a “big deal” is this for him, and why won’t I let him have long hair.
Tl;dr: I can’t make my boyfriend go to a barber, and his hair doesn’t suit him at all.

The company feels like they can not fire her because she has doctor notes to prove illness, but she really isnt sick when she calls out and just fails to show up for work. They feel they would be liable to lawsuit as they assume she would claim wrongful termination.

I don't mind what I'm doing but at the same time it's just menial crap.. I don't want to be an electrician but I'm using it as a stepping stone into management or onto electrical instrumentation.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm already in two minds whether or not I should go back to college, I think I should, but maybe I would be better staying put since I'm doing alright for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought maybe they just don't want to lose me and so they're being nice but I wasn't suppose to hear what was said about me. 

So maybe it's genuine and I'm just doing alright.

Maybe the guys are right and that I should be going back to get a degree.

644,"So hey.
I could really use some life advice. I work in the film industry, not by choice but I'm decent at what I do. Get paid enough to survive in an over priced city (Toronto). And to save a little bit of money over time. But I hate it. This industry is toxic and I really want to move out if it, but i have no idea where to go or what i can do. Like the skills i have are completely useless and non transferable except for this industry. 

What do I do? I feel trapped. Far away from family and any financial support system. And even if I did... I feel lost, like my life does not have direction any more.

645,My lease is up in mid may and I don't have anywhere to go. Every place I looked at is a complete dump or just extremely shady. I know I probably shouldn't be so picky when I really don't have anywhere to go but still. My dad helps me pay my rent for right now but after my lease is up I'm on my own. My lease isn't going to get renewed because I'm living in student housing and I'm not supposed to be living here. I don't have many friends and should probably find a roommate but I don't want to live with someone I don't know. I also need a new car. Ugh I really don't know what to do.

We only lasted 8 months, but I was really in “love” and so I gave it to him half way throughout our relationship. It’s been over 3 years since I’ve talked to him or had any real conversation. Do you guys thinks it’s okay to ask for something like that back? Our relationship ended kind of roughly, but it wasn’t horrible or anything. I just really want that teddy bear back because it’s really important to me and I never asked for it back ( I should’ve but never did) and now I’m regretting not asking for it back. I technically gave it to him as a gift and I told him it was really important to me. Then we broke up and he never gave it back and I never asked for it back.

If I give my notice in now 4 weeks before I start I'm afraid I'm going to be taken advantage off and basically being treated like a slave,which is kind of the situation at the moment but thinking that it could get worst scares me and I know I wouldn't be able to take it for 4 weeks! Secondly there is a high chance I might just be told to leave and I know that's a chance because I and others know what the boss is like. I can't really afford to be out of work for 4 weeks. 

I originally wanted to give me notice in as early as possible, mainly due to the fact I wanted to leave on good terms. But after speaking to some of my colleagues who confirmed my speculations I know now that it's not a good idea to do it so early I just can't risk it.

My plan of change was now to hand it in about a week or so before I start my new job, then maybe I would be able to take their shit for a week. 

Any advice welcome, I would appreciate any feedback on what's the best thing to do in this situation as I want to be as respectful as possible but I don't want to take any risks that would leave me without an income of breaking me emotionally by their potential abuse.

So I was recently put on Trokendi XR for seizures and eventually got to 100 mg. My neurologist only told me that it caused dizziness and told me to take it at night before I went to bed, which is what I’ve been doing. However, after a couple of months I noticed I was experiencing unusual mood swings, confusion, weight loss, low appetite, and insomnia. I had trouble remembering basic things and I repeated the same words in sentences instead of using synonyms. So, out of curiosity, I decided to look up a full list of side effects, and everything finally made sense. I don’t know why my neurologist didn’t tell me about these side effects, and my next appointment is in 2-3 weeks. The last time I accidentally skipped a dose, I had a tonic-clonic seizure, so I can’t just stop taking it. 

I want to see if anyone on here has or is currently taking Trokendi and have found ways to get accustomed to the side effects, and any precautions I need to know about (like certain diets, supplements that don’t react well, exercises, etc.), or maybe beverages that help. I would post this on a medical subreddit, but I don’t think my question doesn’t exactly fit the criteria, since I’m asking other people who have experience with being on this medicine and not asking a doctor. 

I’m not going to try any over-the-counter vitamin supplements until I talk to my doctor, however if there are vitamin enriched foods or beverages that work, I’m open to trying those.

so this story is hella long so enjoy.

Oliver - Friend I talk to everyday on discord whee

George - a guy that calls me his ""best friend"", after leaving me for like 1 year and then i watch one of his livestreams on youtube and acts like he's known me for his whole life while at the same time he's talking shit about me (you can check it out if you want to the link will be at the end of this post).

Mia - an ignorant bitch that is a total dickhead to me and Oliver and plays fortnite 24/7 (god).

Liam - trying to impress Mia all the time and does nothing but spread lies about everyone in the class

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

(i'm NOT in Liam, George, Mia and Oliver's class so keep that in mind)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, it all starts in January where i'm in a discord server with George and Mia and we're talking about random stuff and then Oliver joins and I ask him to put on some music, to which he does and from then on we become friends. We're pretty darn close and we talk everyday on discord so that's nice. Now, we both go through a SHIT ton of drama, which we hate. We talk with each other about these things and I'm pretty sure we both get better after talking about it. After me and Oliver became very good friends we kind of stuck to each other talking and kind of stopped talking to George and Mia (keep in mind they do nothing but play fortnite 24/7) (i don't like the game sorry uiahdsaojhawio). So, one time George, Mia and Liam (plus a few other people) hurt Oliver very bad. And I mean VERY BAD. I start talking to George and he keeps on bringing up grades and how he wants to help Oliver and how he's bad in school and more shit that isn't what I was asking George about. I was asking him why they made him cry. I was literally holding back the tears at that point since my brother was in the room. George ***finally*** apologized to Oliver and everything's cool now (this all happened 20 days ago).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, Oliver has been telling me how George, Mia and Liam have been ignoring him and I decide to investigate with him. Just a few days ago we join a server that Mia and George were in. And they FULLY ON ignored Oliver and I start suspecting them. Today we joined the same server and they were in it. We join and I ask a question and George goes ""Yeah, you got a problem?"" Like bro wtf? Then Oliver asks the same questions 3 times. 3. fucking. times. and guess what. tHEY IGNORE HIM.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Then George starts talking shit about me and Oliver and we're completely done and we leave.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So please give us some advice on what we should do.

657,"During my stressful first-year of university one of my coping mechanisms is to play one of the sports I loved my whole life - soccer (football as my family would call it). I'm a pretty solid player and was respected by my peers at home and have always had a passion for the game. I decided to take up recreational drop-in soccer to de-stress and do what I love as a break from school.

However, the people that attend this activity are a large clique of overly competitive people that are audacious and at times impolite. I'm very introverted and don't have many friends coming from a small city and don't really relate to them (I'm often silent and don't really have anything to say to them) so I think it makes me an easy target.

I've been experiencing bullying as I've been treated differently than typical clique members.  I am scolded or yelled at if I make a mistake, while if it's thier friends they laugh it off or forgive each other. I am also purposely fouled (kicked, elbowed, hurt intentionally without trying to play the ball) and no one sees anything wrong with it unless they are a part of thier friend group. I also overheard them talking badly about me saying I was horrible and wondering why I even play the sport.

This also has actually made me play worse as I am playing in an environment where I'm scared and nervous, making it unenjoyable in its entirety. I have issues with depression and self-image so It's pretty upsetting one of the things I loved and used as a coping method has become destructive. After this dissapointment I've decided to take up running as nobody can harass me there; however I do want to play soccer but just not in a negative environment where I'm not respected and worsen my performance and mental health.

658,"I’m not sure this is appropriate for this sub but I can’t find anywhere else so link me if you can find somewhere.

I’ve always been very indecisive over the years but I’m getting to point where I generally have no compass to what the hell I want to do in life. 

I’m only doing A-levels but there is consistently increasing pressure to choose universities, subjects, go and try courses but the only problem is that I have no general interest in anything and it’s getting to the point where I feel hopeless.

I don’t have any major hobbies, and can’t think of anything defining that I actually enjoy doing. I just come home and I am so exhausted that I can’t bring myself to do anything otherwise be become overwhelmed.

Despite ether fact I am doing subjects I like, they are only vague interests and not anything I could ever see myself doing as a job, in fact the mere idea of having to go somewhere and do the same thing every day makes me sick to the core of what I might have to stomach in the future. 

Despite me trying my best, and doing as much revision as my body lets me I continuously keep flunking out in my exams getting E’s which makes me think that even if I were to choose a uni I probably wouldn’t get accepted and makes me think that there isn’t even a point in trying.

The teachers keep giving me “career tests”, “compatibility tests” or “personality tests” to complete but it doesn’t matter what the answer it gives me I could never see myself being happy doing so, even if I could get the best job in the world that pays kids I don’t think I would want to do it. 

Every day that passes the pressure increases and it’s getting to the point where I don’t even know what to do with myself anymore, my parents are pressuring me, teachers are pressuring me, I’m pressuring me but the fact is I just generally have no interest in anything and I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. 

Has anyone else had this, and if so is there anyway that you overcome it so I can change and decide before it is too late.?

660,"Im 14M and ill start from when i think it started. It all started when my brother was in highschool and we moved to america so my brother blamed it all on my mom because he had no friends and he didnt like america in general so he blamed it on her ( my brother is closer to my mom ) . My brother and my mom would have many arguments about how my brother doesnt like it here and how my mom is telling him its for the better so you can have a better future. FASTFORWARD. My brother is in college and he always had bad grades from the beggining and my mom is paying maybe $2,000 i think for each semester ( idk that was what i remember ) amd my brother keeps having to repeat years and i dont even know what year he is in and keep in mind we are not a very rich family. So mt brother keeps failing classes and making my mom pay more ( my mom pays because she is a nurse while my dad didnt go to college ). So my brother keeps saying how he wants to go to the phillipines ( where i was born and where we used to live before we came to america ) and he says he will be happier and he can make friends there but my mom says its too much for them and she cant afford that and my mom works 8 days with 12 hours every day from 6pm - 8am. Now if we go a little into the present my brother becomes depressed and somewhat suicidal because he cant have what he wants ( from what i think he became suicidal for ) and my dad doesnt wanna get involved because everytime he does my brother and my mom end up screaming at him. Now my brother gets if forst girlfriend BUT shes in the phillipines and my brothee is in america. So my brother and his girlfriend call every night and every day but whenever they get into arguments my brother secretly takes a plane to the phillipines and my mom LOVES him so my mom cant take it and whenever he does this she always stays home and doesnt go to work, she sleeps in bed for almost the whole day. Now lets go into a little bit into the present again. My brother goes to the phillipines for the third time without saying and it was because his girlfriend didnt pick up 1 call so he became overly jealous and its his first girlfriend and he is way to over protective with trust issues. Now he goes to the phillipines and we cant contact him and he has his location permissions off ( we have a app so we know where each other is ) and my mom is considering taking 9 days of work to afford him going to the phillipines and working there but too much work is dangerous and my mom tole me earlier litterally 20 mins ago that if she does die her life insurance can help me woth college and i have no money for college because my damn brother is stupid and he failed like 5 times already and he waste money like its nothing and he failed student loan so i dont know whats going to happen and i dont want anything to happen and im scared because im the one whos only giving my mom advice and i dont even like my brother anymore cause hes the worst person ive met. And i dont know what to tell my mom anymore and im scared about whats going to happen because where we live is really nice and our house is really nice but its my brother who tears everything apart and even his room smells like crap and nobody in thr house can sleep at night because my brother hits the damn walls and IS going to ruin the mortgage for the house.

661,"I'm sorry for the vague title, but the specifics are sort of long, so I figured I'd keep things short and deal with it down here.
One of my friends is a really smart guy, he's kind and fun and he genuinely cares about everyone around him, but theres an issue, he never really shows tact when problems arise and he will not admit that he is wrong as a matter of principle. This means that a lot of the time he argues with people about things that don't need to be argued about, and when anyone confronts him about it he gets very defensive and conversations never really end well. 
His girlfriend, and the other friend I mentioned in the title, is equally kind and funny, she also cares a lot for everyone around her, but she's a lot more emotional than her boyfriend, which means that when they argue she gets upset. They both love each other a lot, but theres a lot of tension at times, I only want to do something to help them, but I feel like a bystander and i don't want to overstep my boundaries and act as a babysitter.

665,"I came to the city I live in at the start of middle school and made a few friends. But one of them was a year older and the other moved pretty far away to another school so my last year of middle school was spent with a completely new group of friends. I got pretty comfortable with them and we ended up going to the same high school together. It was pretty good but some people in the group found new friends so now it's just me and two other guys that hang out at lunch. My older friend from middle school also goes to this high school but he's involved in bands and stuff so I cant hang out with him at lunch. Recently I've come to the conclusion that my friend group isnt very enjoyable to be around because of how mean they are, not just to eachother but to other people. I dont want to associate with judgemental people but at the same time they're really the only people I've invested time into and have mutual interests with (skateboarding, punk music, etc.) 

Outside of school I really dont hang out with anybody. Just the other day I hung out with my older friend and it was alright, but he's friends with someone who I dont like and it just bothers me because when he tells me about what they do I feel like he's negatively influencing him. My friend who moved away is the only person who is kind and enjoyable to be around (we had problems in the past but we worked them out and are pretty close) but he has found a completely new friend group at his school and I dislike a few of them (because of things they've done or said) and they always hang out outside of school. 

I just feel like I'm at a loss. All I want are friends who share a sense of humor with me, are kind, I can talk to, and are down to have fun, but I know at this age it's super hard to find people like that.

The caretaker was wearing jeans which help minimize any damage. The bite started because she accidently stepped on him and he went on the defensive. Her screaming led to a few more bites but the overall damage didn't seem serious. We took her to the ER immediately just in case along with my dogs rabies paperwork. ER doctor gave her some antibacterial shots but stated rabies shot was unecessary. She doesn't speak English and insisted on seeing her primary docotr which we did the following day with the same results. The bite itsepf has started to heal already but she's been complaining about headaches and lack of sleep resulting in bad memory. She has since decided to quit at the end of this week. Her conversations with my wife seem to hint at some sort of compensation, but she doesn't say that exactly and we don't even know what kind of amount is right.

670,"Hello there! My parents are strangely very scared of death and I find that sometimes absurd. I mean, even when I used to play Minecraft as an 11 years old kid, they always were blaming that game that it spreads violence and death, with zombies, skeletons and the possibility to kill anyone. My parents didn't allow me to play it, while it was a completely innocent game! Now I am 17 and currently studying in other town, about 200 km away of home. Once I saw an event on Facebook of a Club that is playing mafia every two weeks.  So I went there and it was really awesooommeee. I enjoyed it because it was my first time playing mafia with strict-respected rules and a big table of players. It was really unexpected to find out who the Mafia actually was, because thought that the killer was completely other person. Anyway, it was worth of it. But my parents had a very negative reaction when I called them and told I played Mafia. Only the word ""Mafia"" made them very angry. When I explained that the game is all about a Mafia that kills citizens every night they nearly had a heart-attack. They yelled at me because they think that the game teaches bad things, that it will cause me to actually kill people, and generally, I am in the other town just to study, anything else is forbidden. Well, I think it is unfair since every teacher says I am the best student and I have the highest marks. I spend very much time on my homeworks and my parents blame me of spending just less than an hour on an innocent game. More than that, they threaten me of returning back to my hometown's school. 
I am not afraid of any of their threats because I find everything silly and unfair. I just want to prove them that I am almost an adult and I can analyze and think on my own, without risking of getting bad habits, wasting money, being unsecure, and so on. Because they treat me like I am a naive child that doesn't understand how the life works. Also I want them to understand my point, that the death is not as frightening as they say. It isn't even a real death when it comes to games. I just want your opinions and advice on the problem I have right now... Thank you!",28Mar2019,1

674,"I’m in 8th grade at the moment and had a pretty freaky occurrence today. I’m part friends with the girl in front of me in history, we talk a bit and socialize well but we aren’t best buds or anything. She’s been through a lot of shit in life especially since she lives here now because (I think) she lost her parents, she suffers from stuff like depression and I learned today that she cuts herself. 

Anyway, in science today we were passing up papers and I noticed little cuts along her thumb, they looked like red pen marks so I couldn’t tell. I’ve never seen any scars on someone’s thumb so In a split second decision I concluded they weren’t self made, I asked “hey (name), what are those cuts?” And before I could even finish she tells me to “fuck off” in a sadish voice and just stands op and storms out of the classroom while crying.

I realized instantly the mistake I made and so did everyone else, the teacher didn’t mention it and I’ve felt terrible all day.

Am I at fault here? I’ve felt guilt about it all day because it was just a dumb on the spot question that I didn’t think through.

And if I am, should I go apologize to her? I saw her in other classes and she seemed normal as ever and we even talked a bit like we were Normal friends, she didn’t seem pissed at all.

What should I do and how do I handle this?",28Mar2019,2

This person doesn’t feel the need to discuss anything, finances, child-rearing, how to arrange the storage when cleaning out the garage, etc.

This person thinks it’s silly that the spouse desires to have an adult conversation with him on occasion, or get a nice compliment from him once every ten years, go do something that isn’t watching a movie silently, etc.

I don't like this major at all and I'm so close to graduating yet its my first year in college. Should I finish out this major that I don't like at all and probably won't land a job because my work isn't that great; I'm not inherently good at design. Or should I change my major for next semester to something more interesting like Management Information systems or computer science?

So I'm going to have my gap year before medical school coming up and I was interested in spending some time taking online classes towards either an MBA or a MS in Information Systems. I'm doing it for a back up plan in case my license gets revoked in the future. I'm thinking if something bad happens, then I'll just get moved over into something more administrative or maybe I'll enter Emergency Medicine and want to quit some day in the future. I'm basically just trying to secure my future in case anything goes bad. I feel like an MBA with a background in health administration would help in that regard.

However, I am interested in information technology and was thinking about getting an information systems master's degree. I heard that the degree has business applications, so I'm wondering if it would serve the same purpose as a health administration degree. Would I be able to get a job in healthcare administration with an information systems degree? Is it even worth it? What would you do? Not sure what path to follow.",28Mar2019,1

I have been going through ~~some~~ quite a lot of things recently and my body responded with aches. I tried to not tell anyone at work about them because I simply do not want to talk about that with them. But of course questions were asked after I took a day off yesterday and somehow EVERYONE started telling me their personal tale about where my pain is coming from and what I am supposed to do, even though I repeatedly told them that I know what it is, where it comes from, I adviced a doctor, etc. I know most of them mean well, but this just feels stupid and pointless. It is not like I walk around and ask for the attention. I do not complain about it until someone SPECIFICALLY asks how I am doing. Also, some of the coworkers I barely know try to get really personal. The office is really chatty and I do not want to have an open debate about my personal life and health.

I know for a fact this is not true in a lot of circumstances, seeing as more and more people are finding success without them. I would much rather make less money and be happy, than make like $30k more, have to work my ass of constantly, just to feel the same. I don't need much to make myself happy, and I am completely willing to work very hard for a living, because it makes me feel like I absolutely earned it.

716,"I am unhappy and dissatisfied with my life and even though I try really hard to make things better nothing I do seems to ever be good enough. I wanted to kill myself so much but didn't due to relgion and now I'm just stuck here not knowing what to do or how to come to terms with the fact that I don't have the life that I want. Here's what's going on in my life.

Relationship: tried to find a wife since I was 17 (23 now) and had five years of straight rejection. Had an arranged marriage to a girl who at first I thought was the hottest thing going but now I just feel like she's average and nothing special. I can't come to terms with the fact that I'll probably never date a top tire model looking woman. Am considering getting high class prosititues but probably won't because of relgion. My fiancée has her own issues and we had a very disfunctional relationship, I basically told her to loose weight, let me have side girls and become a nurse or I wouldn't marry her and she did. Still I feel like it's just two people with serious issues settling. I know settling is wrong but I feel like the best move is just to marry her so I will.

P.S I don't know why it's been so hard for me to find a girlfriend, I am hot (see profile for pics of me and my fiancée).

Health: have really bad anexiy and constantly feel like I'm suffocating and my heart is out of control. 3 cardiology vists and hundreds of trips to the A&amp;E have failed to find anything physically wrong so was diagnosed with anexiy and hypochondria. Recently got rediagnosed with autism (though I was over it) and it's depressing as hell. On the plus side no ""real"" health problems. Also have a messed up body from being morbidly obese when I was younger (loose skin and shit).

Carrer: busted my ass for five years to graduate with a top level mechanical engineering degree from a top level university. I work as a bank staff teaching assistant for retarded kids and make about £100 a week. Literally applied to hundreds of jobs and been to dozens of interviews but am always rejected or fired in the first few months. I did not work myself into a full scale nervous breakdown for this. 

Other stuff: family environment sucks, am bored with life.

Good stuff: rich parents who let me leech in their £1,000,000 mansion. Very loving okay looking fiancée. No pshyical health problems. Okay car. Have about £37,000 in savings (Leeched from parents / disability). No responsibility. 

Basically I feel scammed and want to die. I feel like it is in everyone's best interests including my own if I die. I don't want to be an autistic leech but I am. I want to make millions, drive lambos and marry super models but I can't. I can't accept how different my life is from what it should be and am a complete nervous wreck because of it. Therapy hasn't worked also, it goes so deep I don't think it can. 

If anyone knows how I can get over this and live a happy life please let me know. Thanks for reading if you're still here.",28Mar2019,2
717,"Background: I'm 30 years old and live with my parents. I need some advice. My dad was diagnosed with skin cancer last year and had surgery to successfully remove it late last year.  

I had plans to go to China and travel around Asia (I work on the internet so can travel and work) for a few months in February, but postponed my plans because I wanted to make sure he was healthy first and didn't want him on my mind while trying to have fun/explore halfway around the world.

In March he was starting to recover back to his normal state, so I booked a ticket to China for early April. Last week he noticed a new lump and the doctor did some tests and said he needs to have a biopsy, MRI, etc. as of his appointment today. 

This stresses me out because I assumed he would not be going through what he's gone through the past 6+ months again. I was trying to stay optimistic about it, and hoping it is nothing, but you never know until it's fully checked out. I was planning to travel for 3-6 months spending ~1-2 months in each location I wanted to visit.

My mom works full-time and helps take care of him so he won't be completely alone, but it always helps to have another person (aka me) around when she has to work and take the stress off her shoulders. 

I'm feeling kind of down about this recent news and really don't want to postpone my plans (already bought the visa, hotel for the first couple weeks, etc.) although money doesn't matter to me as long as my dad is healthy.

Any advice for me? Thanks.

718,"I don't really know where to put this, so I thought I'd ask for advice here to see where it takes me. \*Posting this on behalf of a friend, per their request because they don't have access to do so\*

My friend and I live in rural PA, and she is turning 16 later this year. Her home life is unstable, and as she says it herself, outright horrible. Her mother is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and an eating disorder, but there are suspicions of personality disorder and other diagnoses. She never stays in treatment for too long, and nothing seems to work. At this point, she denies having mental health problems. She is verbally abusive, degrading, and unpredictable in her moods &amp; parenting. Because of her own eating disorder, she restricts what my friend and her siblings (17 &amp; 13) can eat, which has led to them going hungry and not eating three full meals/day consistently. This is done purposely, and not due to finances. Father's involvement is minimal at this point. My friend has sought mental health treatment for her own depression &amp; anxiety, but her mother has historically yanked her out of treatment multiple times, and then will forbid her to continue. Last summer, she experienced suicidal thoughts and told her mother, but her mother still refused to let her have treatment, telling her ""it will be fine."" Child services has investigated several times, but nothing has ever been done. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in time, the mother has been in and out of residential rehab, apparently for her eating disorder. The three of them lived at home and was being taken care of by an older sibling, who the mother kicked out at 16 for having a boyfriend (she's 18 now). Everything was stable and happy for that period of time. The mother then left treatment against recommendation, resorting back to her old nasty habits. During this time, she seized my friend's phone, threw it, and broke it. She also threw her older sister's phone at her head, resulting in an injury. Older sister was kicked out \*again\*, even after she returned to help take care of kids that aren't hers. The mom went to treatment \*again\*, and this time my friend found a nice family friend to stay with during this period. She describes this period as the best she has ever had, and said it was the first time she was able to sleep &amp; eat several meals per day consistently, and focus on her studies. She has expressed that her mother uses every opportunity to tear her and her siblings down, and purposely has been damning their future. Tonight, the mother is coming home from rehab, and is demanding she returns home from staying with the family friend. She adamantly does not want to go home, and says she is terrified to go back to that situation. She states that if she goes back, she feels like she will have no future because of her mother and that makes her want to die. The family friend isn't willing to go against the mother, out of fear of legal repercussions for harboring a ""runaway."" 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend wants to know what her options are at this point. Child services has continually failed to substantiate reports of neglect and emotional abuse. I know this is the hardest to prove, but mental health services for my friend and her mother should be able to prove this!! Plus, the siblings all agree that NONE of them want to go home, and they WANT to enter foster/kinship care. They have families they know who are willing to step up as fosters, too. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My friend (15) &amp; her siblings (13, 17) are being neglected &amp; emotionally abused by their mentally ill mother, child services hasn't done anything in the past, and she is returning home from residential rehabilitation (eating disorder) tonight. None of them want to live with her, are fearful of her returning, and prefer to go live with family friends who are willing to take them in, whether through foster care or another arrangement. What are the options?! (PA) ",28Mar2019,3
720,"First time poster here, long story short I've had a patch of eczema on my left ankle for quite some time now (almost 4 years) and it's healing has been on and off mainly due to my own inability to control my impulses in scratching it. As an only child, my mom has always been overly protective of me, even clearly well into my young adulthood. I'm a social work student, I get it; my mom has good intentions and wants the best of me, and I know I'm extremely fortunate to even have such a caring mother as a lot of folks I work with don't have the same privilege, but honestly it's just so suffocating at times. Last night was a huge trigger. She suddenly asked me to promise her something, and I asked what she wanted me to promise for her. She said ""Promise me, after your busy semester that you'll allow me to find proper treatment for your eczema. It's clearly not getting better and you need help. I won't have no for an answer."" When I tried to gently turn her down she just dismissed it and went upstairs in fury. I know for a fact, as the person with the eczema, that it honestly is getting better and I only need to moisturize it with lotion more often, not scratch it, and wear less irritating fabrics that would touch the area; but my mom won't hear my explanations or proposals anymore. 

How do I approach my mom compassionately about this? I really don't want to see a doctor; I've boiled it down to a few reasons: 

\- It's not worth wasting a doctor's time when all they'll do is probably prescribe me over the counter cream, which won't do much help anyway.

\- I'm internalizing a lot of stigma because of the eczema, and it's making overly insecure about my body

\- I just don't think it's that big of an issue, and have had eczema on other places in my body that healed over time.

721,"Last month I found out my boyfriend of 8 months cheated on me. He has violated my boundaries a few times, but I'm not quite sure if what I experienced is sexual assault or rape. 

1. The first time this happened, we had only been in a relationship for less than a month. We went for a walk and he kept shoving his hands down my pants and I would swat him away and tell him to stop. I was a virgin at this point and just felt uncomfortable/not ready for sex or sexual touching. I felt extremely pressured. The next day I confronted him over text and he apologized and told me he doesn't usually behave this way and promised to be more respectful in the future. So I forgave him. 

2. A couple months into our relationship, we were about to have sex. He wore a condom and immediately put it in. I told him that it hurts and I want him to use lube and he responded to the affect of ''Shhh, shut up slut''.  So I just kept quiet. I don't remember what happened afterward, if he pulled out and used lube or not. 

3. I was always so adamant that he use condoms. He would always pressure me to have unprotected sex but I never let him. He was aware how terrified I am of getting pregnant but didn't take my fear all that seriously because ''I'd just get an abortion''. Eventually I snapped at him once and he finally shut up about it. But in late January, he was rubbing his genitals against mine and I let it happen since I was okay with it. Suddenly, he just slides his whole dick in, condomless. At first I was shocked, but I didn't outright say no. I kinda just let it happen, and he started kissing me and I kissed back. I was really anxious, but I was also slightly enjoying it too. But since I was worried, I told him to pull out and he did. However, after like 2 minutes, he turned me around, bent me over, and stuck it back inside me. I immediately told him to pull out and he did. 

4. This happened not that long after incident #3. Once we were fooling around and without any warning, he flips me over and sticks his raw dick inside me. I complained that it hurt and he just said ''Shhhh''. So I just told him to pull out and he did. 

I don't feel like ''traumatized'' by it. It wasn't the typical violent rape you hear of. But I definitely do feel angry and violated. Also upset with myself that I let this happen and didn't dump him earlier. If this is sexual assault, what do I do? I’m already in therapy. But is this something I should press charges over? I’m afraid that this won’t be taken seriously. The only proof I have is text messages of me confronting him.",28Mar2019,1

I have been extremely depressed this whole year and have been struggling in school because of it, but now about a month ago I was broken up with by my BF of 2 years who said he would tutor me in this class... I kinda just stopped going because I was depressed and couldn’t find it in me to care.

730,"I have recently been diagnosed +ve with HSV-1 (oral)/cold sores despite not having any sexual activity (kissing included). I'm a 22y male and a university student and this incident has impacted me greatly. Knowing that it's not my fault yet I get this....makes me disappointed. The fact that it's chronic and not curable hurts a lot as there is no way around it. 

I always used to take care of my health (exercise, food, etc) and feel like this virus makes me feel dirty and that my healthy efforts have gone to waste. I also feel like I'll be lonely more than before since most likely most in my age group don't have this condition; Fear of rejection over this too, since I'm not a lair and can't live as one.

The doctors where giving me Canadian BC statistics for 18-50 but that number didn't help me much since I was more interested for my situation (age group).

I most likely have gotten this by my parents during last summer since my dad was cheating on my mom overseas, infected her during his 1 month stay. I lived with my mom for the last 5 month of 2018 and somehow caught something during that time. The doctors told me the virus stays dormant and appears every now and then. I got my sore this month but it might have been hidden and suppressed in my body waiting for my immune system to be low to reveal itself. I have a relatively challenging and stressful program at school so I feel like having low sleep (hence low immune system) will be a recurring thing, even after school.

I'm very depressed, hurt, and under-performing academically. Is there any hope moving forward? someone in similar situation that was able to figure things out? Anything that I could know to make this feel less ""bad""? Is it possible to still have a partner the same way as before? I'm sorry for all the questions, for some it might seem like I'm overreacting, I just don't want this to steer my life as it current is.

PS: I would also like to learn about this condition a bit more, how the virus works and is spread, etc. Doing my own research disturbs me (thinking how low the chances are of me getting in and how unlucky I am) a bit and I get mixed answers. I considered dedicating my life to find a cure using the technical skills I have but I would say that is letting the virus seriously steer my life and goals.

731,"I'm an autistic first year uni student who's been trying to get along with a girl I'm kinda interested in. Being socially inept, I've had my fair share of awkward conversations, but she seemed to be getting comfortable with me (regularly smiling and showing open body language and keeping sustained contact online) for the most part prior to the reading break we had in the middle of February. During that time we had little to no contact, but I reached out to her after the break asking if she wanted to partner up for any group projects we were going to have. Things seem to have gotten a bit awkward due to minimal contact over the period of a week or two, but it didn't seem too bad (at least from my end). After that point she seemed to have stopped taking the bus (which was our main source of irl interaction besides class, and the only times in which we could talk about more personal stuff outside of school), and she just didn't feel comfortable around me at that point. After our second group project (I was late for the first and the spot she saved for me ended up getting taken), she seemed to start completely shutting me out. 

Her body language made it clear that she no longer felt comfortable around me, and she stopped initiating any online conversations, or when I initiated, she would either try postpone her response or end it ask quickly as possible. It seems as though she has started trying to avoid me in general. I've already told her about my aspergers when asking her if she wanted to partner up with me again (which I regret now as looking back on it, it seemed like I was putting her on the spot), but I was wondering what I can do to fix this. For the duration of the second group project (which seemed like the turning point) I don't think I did anything to warrant any of this as we mainly just spoke about the class material and discussed the project with one another.  It got even worse after the last class as she got in a visibly better mood once we transitioned from one on one conversation into group work, when other people besides me were included into the conversation.

I (20F) have been extremely insecure my whole life pretty much. I can honestly say I don’t remember a time where I was ever happy with myself. I was kind of a chubby kid growing up, I had a tooth gap, and I guess I just always felt like my face was ugly. 

My family used to give me nicknames that related to my weight, my sister used to make fun of my teeth (which I know most siblings make fun of each other but she and I have a 7yr age gap and never had a great relationship to start with) and I was even bullied a few times for doing stuff that I was really happy with doing. 

No one ever really said I was pretty and even though looks aren’t everything, no one cared that I was doing well in school because it was expected of me, I didn’t have the opportunity to develop skills because we didn’t have money, just pretty much nothing was in my favor. The one thing I have always wanted to do is act and even with that, something that I feel like I’m really good at, I haven’t been taking seriously and I am starting to doubt that I have the ability to even take the leap of faith.

I feel an impending sense of doom 24/7, like I’m going to fail HARD the second I decide to pursue acting seriously and should just not start to avoid wasting years of my life.

739,"I'm a female software developer on my 20s near 30s and I have a problem speaking up at work, and getting out of my comfort zone. Whenever we have group discussion, I find myself just listening to my team's conversation, and that's all I do for participation.  


I work with a team dominated by males 4/5, but I'm not sure if this is a big factor for my timidity. I did go to an all girls school up until high school, and all my close friends are ladies. I don't have a problem mingling with males, like if I talk to my male coworkers, there's no awkwardness. I also have hobbies that click with guys, like playing games, climbing, etc.  


Maybe you can help me out? Do you have this problem, or any advice on how to overcome this?  


Thank you. ",28Mar2019,1

742,"My best friend of all time got a new boyfriend recently. Well, they started see each other 6 months ago and they’ve already moved in together. I felt like things were moving really fast between them, but she seemed really happy at first so who am I to judge? So today they finished setting up their new apartment and she invited me over to have dinner and see the place. For the first two hours everything was super normal. They gave me a quick tour and we got all caught up with each other’s lives but then we all sat down to eat. That was when things got weird. She made a joke along the lines of them getting a puppy or something. And this guy just slams his hand down on the table and stares at her and says “shut the fuck up.” I felt like I jumped 10 ft in the air as I was totally caught off guard by this behavior. She got really quiet and we finished the meal in complete silence. She walked me to the door and (I assume) he went upstairs to the bedroom or his office. She opened the door and stepped outside with me and profusely apologized for his behavior. She came up with all these excuses that he’s scared of dogs and doesn’t like them being brought up at all. What was really weird though is that she was half whispering all of this as if she didn’t want him to hear. 

So now I’m home and reflecting on everything that happened and I’m not sure what to do next? I mean, am I just overreacting or is his behavior actually really strange? 

Tl;dr: After being together 6 months, my best friend and her boyfriend moved in together. He got really weirdly aggressive over an innocent joke and she tried to just sweep his behavior under the rug. Am I overreacting or do I have a right to be concerned? 

Also, apologies as I’m posting from mobile. And I wasn’t sure which flair was most appropriate so if there’s a better one to use, let me know.",28Mar2019,1
743,"My brother is young, he’ll be 10 this year.

So my brother has extreme anxiety and It’s affecting everything he does. He made a post on reddit asking if he can make friends online, talking about him not having friends and being mildly depressed.
There’s a few problems to why he doesn’t have any friends.

Problem #1 He doesn’t want to go do activities because whenever he does he gets overwhelmed and cries.


Problem #2 Whenever I try to get him to chill with me and my friends he cries.


Problem #3 Him and I are homeschooled, so he doesn’t get to have social interactions with other kids as much as he used to when we were in school. 


Which leads me to the next problem.


Problem #4 He refuses to go to school and if he did he would be extremely stressed and cry way more than he already does. And since my mom knows this she doesn’t want to send him to school.


Any advice would be greatly appreciate.

745,"I’ve tried a LOT of different things to try to fall asleep, but none of them work. 

I go to bed at 9:30PM, fall asleep around 1:30AM, and wake up at 7:00AM for school on a usual night. I’m supposed to get 10 hours of sleep but end up getting a little more than half of that. No matter how tired I am, I just can’t mentally shut the fuck up. 

It got really bad a few nights ago and I got about 3 hours of sleep. I went to the doctor and was told to use melatonin, which I used about 0.4mg and felt really tired. After an hour of staying awake the feeling of tiredness went away. My memory after that is foggy and I don’t know how long I slept. I do however remember waking up at 1:00AM and not falling back asleep for at least another 2.5 hours, which defeats the whole purpose of melatonin. Last night I used a larger dose, about 0.7mg, and didn’t fall asleep until 4:00AM - giving me an entire 2 goddamn hours of sleep. 

In the past few nights this has been absolute torture and on a normal night I get half of the amount of sleep I should get.

I don’t have any other mental illness, I just dont get tired and cant mentally shut the hell up. If I’m dying of tiredness, my brain is wide awake. If I’m mentally tired, im physically energized. During the day I’m so damn tired and during the night I’m way too energetic. 

I’ve had this problem since forever, it’s lasted most of my whole life and the more I pay attention to it the more it gets worse. Is there anything I could do about this?

746,"I made a throwaway because some family knows my main and I haven’t even told my own mother about this ..

This is long, I’m sorry, so TLDR : I was raped and had an abortion at 13 weeks. I have a son now,I think about the fetus almost everyday, and it’s destroying my mental health and making me hate myself. I can’t afford therapy and don’t know how to cope.

Back in 2016, I got into an argument with roommate and went to stay over at a mutual friends house. He was really supportive and let me rant through my problems. He offered my a drink, and the next thing I remembered, I was naked in his bed with him. 

I was not remotely attracted to him, he had a long term girlfriend and I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship, so I know I would not have done this sober. I started panicking and vomit everywhere. I called my roommate and she called 911. They found rohypnol in his apartment and I was very bruised internally and also around my wrists and neck where they say he must have held me down. The hospital tested me for every std in the books and my arms were heavily bruised from all the needles. I was brought into an office room sometime later where I had to repeat my story an endless amount of times to some officers. Everything was a haze, I don’t remember most of it. My roommate picked me up and we stayed in watching movies for a couple days. I couldn’t process what happened, it felt like I was in a fever dream that wasn’t ending. 

I missed my period at the start of the month, and my roommate bought me a test. We sat and held hands as it processed and it was positive. I couldn’t believe it. My entire life was falling apart because of this man. I stayed up all night crying and the next day I called some hotlines. 
Unfortunately, one I called was a Christian in disguise one. They scheduled me to see one of their counsellors who told me abortion would make the trauma hurt more. I listened, for awhile. When I was past 8 weeks, they told me it was too late for the pill abortion and I would need surgical. They told me what they did to the fetus and I swore I couldn’t do it. 
I was 10 weeks pregnant whenI went to a clinic and they scheduled me for an ultrasound. The baby was waving his nubs and the technician was pointing at how cute it was. I realized as much as it was my baby, it was also that mans. I loved it and was scared of it all at once. I couldn’t give it up for adoption, because it might turn out like him. But I couldn’t raise a baby that might look identical to him. I realized I had to abort it. I left the ultrasound and held the scan photos for hours crying. 

I was booked for an abortion 3 weeks later. No one went with me. They had a communal room where all the women who just had an abortion were sat. Most were snacking on the food they gave us, I was dry heaving trying not to make a scene. I didn’t have the money to pay for it, and I ended up having to spend my student loan. I failed the course and have 20,000$ in debt that keeps building. 

I have a 6 month old baby boy now. I love him but I look at him and think about the fetus I aborted. I have never been religious but I sometimes wonder if it’s in heaven hating me, and that I deserve to go to hell for what I did. I want to be a good mother but I can’t. I feel like I’m being tortured by the choice I had to make because of what that man did to me. 

My boyfriend is not the best as support, though he tries to listen, it is not his personality. I am not close to my family and I don’t feel comfortable telling them anyways. I can’t afford therapy, I am already in severe debt from the loans I had that year for a course I failed.  I don’t know what to do. It’s so hard. I go to sleep crying almost every night, numb all day, because it keeps going through my head. Any advice would be great.. thank you ",28Mar2019,40

So I’ve been really stressed lately choosing what to do next year. (I’m a high school senior). I’ve been really excited to get out of high school since its been so rough. Living in the dorms and meeting new people would seriously be a dream come true.  But the problem is that tuition would be about $30,000 a year to do that. I could always commute but it would still be $13,000 and I wouldn’t have a very easy time meeting people since i’m so introverted. 
I really just want to find somewhere where ai can fit in and I think thats what I value most at a college, but that means I will be in years worth of debt. Any advice I could get would be so great, thank you for taking the time to read my messy post. :,) ",28Mar2019,1
749,"He has been dealing with the bullying since he was in 5th grade. We talk to the schools about it, and nothing is done. We've talked to his teachers and they don't really help. It's as if the schools and his teachers don't care.

We tried moving him to different schools, but the bullying keeps happening. He keeps getting teased and physically assaulted. He tells us that people call him names and consistently make fun of him. Our son has told us he has been pushed down the hallway, kicked in the back, smacked in the face, and had things thrown at him.

Our son is suffering. We have him in therapy right now. We complain to the schools and his teachers about the bullying he's enduring, and they do nothing.

750,"I have the best family anyone could ever ask for. However, my mother has always been a pack rat. My family never really let it bother us, but this has evolved into full blown hoarding over the last decade .

My mother has been through a lot over the past few years. 5 years ago, she lost both of her parents in less than 2 months. This happened after personally caring for them by herself for a couple of years, including changing, feeding, and cleaning them and their home. During this time, no one was able to look after my parents' home (father is away from home about 50% of the time due to work travel and my sibling and I are in a different city for college). The mountains of junk grew in size and number whenever she came home for a couple of days. At this point, my mother was not only facing the death of her parents, but also had severe mobility issues and was obese. She was truly too exhausted to do anything when not caring for her parents. We all knew this, so we did not say anything.

After losing her parents, she successfully lost over 100 lbs. After that, she had double knee replacement surgery. Over a year after the surgery, she is much happier and healthier. We could not be more proud of how far she had come in those areas of her life. The rest of the family thought this meant that she could now focus on taking care of our home. Unfortunately, the hoarding is only getting worse. Now, only about 10% of the house is not a 4-5 foot pile of junk. There are rooms in the house that have not been accessible for years. I fear that there will be irreparable damage to some of these rooms after so much neglect.

She has also started to snap at the rest of the family. It is getting difficult to spend more than a couple of hours with her. We cannot bring up the state of the house without getting screamed at for an hour about how unappreciative we are of the things she buys for us. My father has sat her down and offered to take her to therapy, but she blew up at him, too. He has stated to me in private that he is fully aware of the problem and wants to fix it.

I have tried several ways to tell her to clean the house. I've offered to help, I've begged, I've screamed at her (I regret doing this one), but I cannot get her to change. I do NOT want things to come to an ultimatum, but I feel that my family has tried everything else. What should I do?",28Mar2019,1
751,"I hate blood draws. I hate IVs. I even hate shots. IVs are the worst by far, though. The thought of a tube being shoved in your vein and having liquid pour into your bloodstream absolutely makes me gag. Getting it in there hurts like fuck and burns for however long it stays in. You can feel the catheter fishing around your vein and it's agonizing. Your vein might burst. The catheter might fall out. It's a completely horrifying experience. I've had this phobia ever since I got an MRI, where they hit the center of a nerve ending and it felt like someone was shoving a knife up my arm. Some of the worst pain I've ever experienced. 

I also have Crohn's, which means I get an infusion from an IV every eight weeks.

It never gets easier. I just got done with one, and I'm trying not to have a panic attack. It just feels so disturbing and violating. Even though it's not in my arm anymore, I cant shake the feeling. I feel sick to my stomach. There's no getting around these infusions. How can I cure my phobia?",28Mar2019,1

Now that I’m an adult, I have to take into consideration of affording my own healthcare.

I'm in therapy, once a week, but I don't feel like it's really helping. I don't feel like doing anything because when I did do things and tried to be normal, my life was still miserable. I feel like I will be stuck feeling this way for the rest of my life and I am frustrated. I have thoughts of dying at night that usually keep me up.
