1,"I’ll try and make this brief and to the point. I pretty much begged for an old job back as a housekeeper at a hotel. I quit three years ago because it was a dead end job with no perks, it made me depressed and I started to act like an asshole because I really felt used by them. 
I went back two weeks ago after pleading that I really needed work, because the hours are relatively convenient, and I know how to really rock it there. I don’t mean to toot my own horn but I know I’m the best they’ve got and have ever had. What can I say people only do as much as their payed to do. I went/go above and beyond because that’s just who I am, and it leads me to feel used and shitty. I mean... since I’ve been there I’ve cleaned out all the mouldy coffee machine trays because I don’t think the other workers ever have since I left 3 years ago. Anyways- I just got a job at a thrift store (sounds lame but it’s low key my dream job- I’m obsessed with thrifting and finding treasures ha!) the job offers perfect hours for me and it’s a refreshing start and I won’t be so tired after work because I’m not cleaning 15-20 rooms a day anymore. 
K I’m done rambling- I start new job on Tuesday and I don’t know how I tell my current employer I’m done and can’t give anytime for them to replace me. (I’m only working about 14 hours a week so they can’t need me that bad really.) I despise this hotel job, in the two weeks I’ve been there I’ve felt a little depressed but mostly just angry. Angry at the stupidity of management and co workers. Angry that it’s such a dead end job, angry that no one says “good job today, see you tomorrow” I’m already miserable being there and am super pumped I get to leave for a job I’ve always wanted. (I’m a 30 y/o woman I do have goals but am currently just working part time because I want to spend this summer with my daughters who are 7/8 and I’ve worked at hotels and resorts since high school and I’ve generally missed a lot of their lives, so this summer is about family for me, then I’ll be seeking a college education, for anyone who thinks I’m a huge underachiever, which I totally am LOL!)",30Jun2019,1
2,"So its a little hard to explain in words but I work in  a small shipping company that deliverers appliances, there is 3 office workers including me and 10 delivery men who are often in and out of the attached warehouse. My problem includes  my manager, the head delivery man and a my coworker.

&amp;#x200B;

So about a month back I overheard the delivery guy chatting with my manager about my coworker, basically saying he isn't doing their job and he should be replaced to which my manager replies ""Yeah we're working on it"" It was said in front of other people but definitely when my coworker was out of the room.

&amp;#x200B;

Then tomorrow its the reverse, apparently the delivery guy got mad at a customer that asked him to bring a very heavy piece of furniture up several flights of stairs and they got into an argument. So my coworker and manager are talking about the event (While the guy is out on another delivery) and my coworker says the they should fire him to which again my manager gives a ""only if we could"" (its hard to find people willing to move furniture up and down flights of stairs all day).

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I'm not misreading something because they all seem friendly to one another, I feel like I should tell them but I'm not a 100% sure that my manager is even seriously looking to fire them.",30Jun2019,2
3,"I don’t care about school anymore, I’ve been drinking way too much and I’ve been hooking up with random people including some of my friends. I don’t see a purpose in life anymore and I feel like nothing matters anyways if there isn’t something to live towards to. I feel like part of this has to do with not believing in a god or a heaven/hell. I don’t necessarily feel like I’m suicidal but you could say that I wouldn’t care if I didn’t wake up anymore. I know everything’s going to shit but for some reason I’m extremely calm about it and I feel like it doesn’t matter anyway. 

I know that if I don’t bring a stop to this I’ll ruin my life even more, but at this point I really, really don’t care anymore. It’s just whatever for me honestly. Worst part about all this is that I’ve got people that care about me a lot, but for some reason that doesn’t change my perspective on anything at all. 

For my future self’s sake, what should I do?",30Jun2019,2
4,"I'm new to reddit so I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this (the bot that deleted my post on r/askreddit suggested it might be) so here it goes...

It's not a really big office. We're 13 people, six of whom are women and every valentine (since 2014) I buy a small box of chocolates for every woman in the office (a rose for women's day). Currently, one of the ladies is married and another has a somewhat new bf (the dude in question) and the rest are single, but regardless of their relationship status they all seem really happy when I give them the chocolates. I did this again last valentine and the bf sent me a message on Facebook that night telling me that he thought it was inappropriate that I gave his gf a valentines gift since she has a bf, as he should be the only one that gets to do so, his argument being that that is the nature of a valentine gifts. 

Now tbh, the main reason I do this is because it comes off as chivalrous and that's kind of my persona and number one factor for getting laid. On the looks scale I'm a 6 at best, and I've found that being perceived as elegant, chivalrous and confident overcomes that issue very nicely (75% succsex rate, i.e. 9/12 based on empirical data). I also know that single women can feel sad seeing their friends show off valentine gifts from their bfs on social media, which makes me feel sad as well and as little as a box of chocolates is, it's better than nothing. However, I truly despise betrayal in all its forms especially cheating, so I've never and would never approach a woman in a relationship with any intentions of hooking-up. In fact, the only reason I give a box to the two ladies in relationships is because it wouldn't be nice to exclude them. 

Anyway, I'm definately going to continue this habit regardless of what the boyfriend thinks, unless the majority of you guys deem it to be inappropriate as well, in which case I will stop.",30Jun2019,78

7,"Now I’m not exactly pretty, and it hurts a lot when my friends and others around me get attention for their looks from boys and other people in my school while I just get passed by. Sometimes it seems like you have more freinds the prettier you are to me. I’ve even been compared to my other class mates on social media and I never get chosen as the prettier.It’s sick how society is somewhat based on how you look.

I walk in my house and I catch my self looking in the mirror wishing my face could be prettier, my skin unblemished , my body a few pounds lighter , and my curly hair less unruly.
I try to use cosmetics to help fix my hair and skin and I try to exercise but  I always give up. You should also know that I’m not a big makeup person either. (I’ve never really tried makeup that much. Would I be judged for wearing makeup to school?)But in truth I don’t really want to rely heavily on makeup to be pretty. I don’t want to be something I’m not. 

I’m not doing well. I try my best to hide it from my mom. She knows something is wrong but she doesn’t know the severity of my feelings or how low my confidence is getting. I’m worried my sadness and resentment will turn into something worse as I get older and continue on through high school. I need to learn to love myself.

How do I feel comfortable with who I am?",30Jun2019,0
10,"Hi everyone. This is a throwaway as it's a bit sensitive. This is long by the way. When we were younger, we moved house (and country) to get away from dad who was abusive. We lived with my mum and her best friend and kids for about 3 months. 

We being my mum three sisters (24f, 20f and 10f) and me 18m at the time. My mum's friend's kids were 17m and 13m at the time. We lived like one big family as the dad's of both families weren't around. And the house was quite big.

My little sister told me then that the younger boy 13m, had been touching her bottom and kissing her by force. I told my mum and threatened to beat him, my mum spoke to his mum and a few weeks later, we moved house.

I thought nothing of it as he was 13. I just put it down to hormones. And I thought as it was just a kiss and he hadn't done anything else, she was OK. I was very close to the older brother, we were like brothers ourselves and had been tight since we'd been about 6. He even chose to go to all the same schools as me.

We grew apart as happens with life but we're still close, in a strange way. I had his back and he had mine. I got married four years ago. I tried to invite him and get him as my best man but my mum kicked up a huge fuss. She didn't want him or his brother there, and I thought they were over reacting over a kiss over 10 years ago. Their parents came but I didn't invite them. 

We've been slowly reconnecting again. And I've been feeling guilty for not having them at my wedding as they were my brothers and it was one of my biggest regrets. Until I spoke to my sister two days ago. 

Apparently the older brother who was 17 then, used to make her watch porn with him. Then he started touching her and then getting her to touch him and perform oral sex. She was 10 at the time. The younger brother then tried to get involved and that's when she told me.  She said they did everything but have sex with her. 

She didn't tell me everything they did because she didn't want to get in trouble when we were kids. That's why she didn't tell me about the older brother and said it was just a kiss. 

She thought it was her fault and she knew it was wrong. She's had a few problems with guys and miscarried at 15. She's only now started getting her life together. Our family is messed up anyway as my dad used to beat my mum and nearly killed her. But I didn't know anything about the sexual assault. 

I feel really rotten as I could have protected her. I've always looked out for her and I thought she could tell me anything. She said as I played a dual dad/brother role she didn't know what to tell me. 

My problem is this, the older brother at 17 should have known what he was doing was wrong. He was my best friend and at the same time was abusing my little sister. He's always been the golden child, alpha male, always got it together. He has a great job and he's engaged. But it's all a lie. 

I really want to confront him and have it out with him. I'm so angry with him. And I feel betrayed by my family as I think they knew what he did. We moved out too quickly after my sister told me about the kiss and I told my mum. Their anger at the wedding invite also proves this. 

I feel he needs to pay for what he did. My wife thinks it's too late now. My sister wants me to just leave it but I think something needs to be done. I can't ignore it. I feel like I let my sister down and that I was best friends for years with the guy abusing her. I want to hurt him. 

TLDR: My best friend and his brother sexually assaulted my little sister when we were children. I'm not sure what to do about it 15 years later.",30Jun2019,1
11,"so my dad (56) came to my mom’s house. She isn’t home right now, it was just me, my dad, and brother (20). He’s on the phone and we’re overhearing him say “I haven’t gotten my check yet, I don’t have any money” etc. we find out he’s talking to his “friend” who is a 25/26 year old female who asks for money every single time he gets his paycheck(for like 5 fuckin years now.

She yells at my dad to get out of the house. They get into his car. My dad and brother were about to go somewhere right before he just showed up out of the blue so he’s confused. He goes up to the car and she starts making threats to break all the windows in our house. Also that she “knows people” and her brother is a gangster. Obviously implying other things, subtly. She started writing down my brother’s license plate number for some reason and claimed that she knew someone who could look up all his info and whatever bs, all because he confronted her about making all these threats. My brother came back inside and told me everything. Then he just sped off with her in his car. I’m home alone.

14,"I don't know if anyone will read this since the title is not nearly as interesting as some of the other posts here, but I figured I'd still post just to get it off my chest. Buckle up, it's a long one. 

For convenience sake, I'll refer to the girl as Valerie. 

I met her at the beginning of my freshman year of college. Valerie and I, along with a few others our age, are teammates for our college team. All of us spend an enormous amount of time together, so we all hit it off quickly. We've hung out so much and done so many stupid things together, some of the upperclassmen and coaches have commented that they have never seen a group so close, and that we've got something special. I used to be equally close to each member of our group, but as time drew on I became especially close to Valerie. We had the same sense of humor, took almost all the same classes, and always seemed to be free when the others were busy. After a few months she became one of the closest friends I've had in my life. However, from the very beginning I made the decision in my head that we should just be friends. She came into college with a boyfriend of a few years and I had went through a similar predicament with a previous best friend and ended up getting hurt. Everything was great though. I was happy being her friend and she was happy being mine. Because we spent almost every waking hour together (this is not an exaggeration), our friends, teammates, and coaches began to think we were romantically involved. It started with a couple jokes from the coaches, then it became a daily thing, then soon enough everyone on the team was teasing us and thinking we had a crush on one another. Neither I nor Valerie liked these comments. They were fine at first, but after a couple years it gets old. The reason I didn't like these comments is because I truly didn't like Valerie like that, or I guess I wholly convinced myself I didn't. I had told so many people, including myself, that I didn't like her and I meant it every time. I always knew I could start liking her if I wanted, but I knew it was no use. 

A lot of people talk about ""the turkey drop"" or how all the people who bring a significant other into college end up breaking up around Thanksgiving, but this didn't happen with Valerie and her boyfriend. In fact, part of the reason I haven't fallen for her is because she and her boyfriend make a great couple. He's a friend of mine now and is such a nice and charismatic guy. Everyone always teases her for having a perfect relationship. Even I can't really see them breaking up, there's a chance but it's abysmally small. There's been multiple times in the past where her boyfriend gets worried that I am stealing her away from him, but I always call or talk to him to assure him nothing is going on, because there isn't. They've gotten into a few disagreements before about how I am causing a rift in their relationship, which makes me feel just awful for being a problem child. 

Saying all of this makes it seem like I have absolutely no chance and I'm just a mini homewrecker, but there's more to it than that. Valerie and I have spent countless late nights, just picking each others brain, I know her like the back of my hand. One of her greatest fears is me and her boyfriend hating each other, the thought makes her tear up every time. He and I are two of the most important people in her life, and she can't stand to see either of us go. I've never acted like or alluded to me liking her once. I once told her that my soul felt unfulfilled because it was clear that I needed her in my life, but she didn't need me. She had her boyfriend. She responded my looking at me with teary eyes and saying ""I  d o  need you""

I went two years not loving her and telling everyone I don't. I'm going into my junior year of college only now just beginning to sort through the possibility: what if I do love her? Spending a summer alone for hours in my house has given me plenty of time to think, and I think I do love her. My brain could lie to myself all day long, but my body can't. Its the little things that give it away. My heart pounds and I get nervous every time I see her after after not seeing her for a while. Everything I say makes her laugh until her cheeks are tired and her abs are sore. I can't help but smile when I see her face every morning. I eat lunch and dinner with her every day, and something feels off when I don't. Theres nothing like those warm evenings, driving with the windows down blasting our favorite songs. The feel of her hugs are stuck like concrete in my mind, I can still imagine them and the warm smile that accompanies them as I write this. She's always the first thing I think about when I wake up. Just the other day someone passed by me while my eyes were closed, they smelled like her and my pulse raced as I opened my eyes expecting to see her. I'd give anything to make her happy. I don't want to be responsible for her and her boyfriend breaking up, but I know hearing the knews that they are getting engaged will make me smile, but wound my heart deeply. At the same time, I don't want to risk jeopardizing our amazing friendship by telling her how I feel, and I'm not sure how she feels about me, especially in comparison to her boyfriend. The chances are low but there's something in my gut that tells me that she might have thought about me in the same way, deep in the back of her mind.

I don't know what to do. I'm happy with the friendship we've built over the years, but I'm scared that she's the one.

16,"Before I even get into the details, please know that I understand how awful this is. It’s completely fucked and that’s why I’m posting here, because I don’t know what to do. Also, we’re both gay men. Grindr is a gay hookup app for those that don’t know. 

I have a best friend, we’ll call him Chad. Chad was diagnosed with HIV almost a year ago, and he does take medication but has yet to be informed by a doctor that he’s undetectable and that he can’t transfer it to someone else. Basically, for those that don’t know- being undetectable means that the HIV viral load in your body has been minimized so much (usually through a rigorous medicine regime, in time you’ll become undetectable) that it’s not possible to transfer it to someone else. He isn’t confirmed to be undetectable yet, which means that his body likely still has a chance of transmitting it to others. That likelihood rises significantly when you don’t use protection, which he always never does (we talk about this stuff, I guess it’s a gay thing.)

I’ve known about this for a couple of weeks now and it’s slowly kind of eating me alive. Maybe it’s not my business, but I feel like my best friend isn’t who I thought he was. I feel like he is a *bad* person. Not for having HIV, obviously, but because he is willingly and consciously still hooking up with men and NOT telling them that they’re at risk of getting HIV beforehand.

I talked to him about this in depth last night when he was drunk (he doesn’t talk about it much otherwise, and he’s actually the one that brings it up every time, including last night) and I told him bluntly that what he’s doing is wrong. That he could be really damaging peoples lives. Any adult has to make a decision as to what level of safe sex they want to practice- but his actions still don’t sit right with me.

I tried to figure out why he didn’t want to tell people and he gave me a few theories. This is in the order that seemed to make the most sense to him, so the first is the biggest reason and then so on:

1. He simply wants to have sex, and if he tells them about his status, there’s a chance that he won’t be able to. He said it’s not about rejection as much as him just being able to have sex. I told him that some people are understanding and if you were to just go to the doctor and confirm that you can’t transmit it, there will surely be some people who will be okay with it. I know this, because I’ve had this conversation with men who are HIV+ and it wasn’t a big deal to me as long as they were honest and as long as they couldn’t transmit it. And I know I can’t be the only one who is understanding about it. I can’t really remember what he said to this, I think he just nodded.

2. He feels like someone else gave him this disease, he didn’t ask for it so why should he care if someone else gets it because of him? This one is especially fucked, I truthfully didn’t even know much of what to say. I told him  that you have a choice to be a good person or a bad person. You know your status, you have to be a good person now and be responsible. Someone gave it to you and that really sucks, but don’t take it out on the other people and hurt them now just because you were hurt by someone else.

3. I suggested to him that maybe there was some self-loathing, that he hasn’t come to terms with his status yet and that he might be engaging in destructive behaviors because of it. He didn’t say much to this but I think this also might play a part in why he does it.

What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to do anything? Do I just mind my own business? It doesn’t feel right. He’s my best friend and my roommate and I’m starting to think he might just be a bad person and that’s really bothering me. I don’t know what it’s like to have HIV so I can’t and won’t try to pretend that I do, but I feel like maybe I should be doing something here. I don’t want him to be this person and I don’t want others to be hurt because of his actions. We have talked about this a couple of times in the past few weeks and he says he knows he needs to stop doing it and start being honest but he’s just... Not. He’s still doing it. I want to help him and I want to try to stop this but I don’t know how. We are very close and he hooks up pretty often, at least once a week and it’s commonly with a stranger/someone new. I’m sure everyone’s experience when being diagnosed with HIV is different, I’m sure it effects people differently. I’m sure it’s still not a fun thing to have to say to people before hooking up with them, whether you’ve come to terms with it or not. I don’t want to pretend that I know what any of it feels like- but this just seems very ethically wrong. I need advice. I don’t know what to say to him, I don’t know if he’s a good person. I’m just feeling really off about who he is as a person lately.

Or just tell me to shut up if it’s not my business, that’s acceptable also lol.

18,"Hello, first time poster and on mobile so apologies.

So a couple months ago, my mother in law was staying with my husband and I while ""taking time off work to travel the country."" A few weeks ago she decided to up and leave out of the blue to visit her friend across the country on the west coast and we had no idea why....until yesterday. 

An undercover cop stopped me on my way upstairs to my apartment and said they were looking for her because she failed to appear in court, showed me her picture and everything. It turns out, she got caught trying to steal $1000+ worth of clothing at Victoria's Secret.

While my husband was at work, I did a little digging and found A TON of stuff I wish I didnt. There are 3 incidents where she was on local news networks for stealing credit cards and buying gift cards with them....HER FACE WAS PLASTERED ON THE NEWS. None of the stories could identify her. 

Then I check social media on a fake account and she has a ton of stuff that's been posted for sale ""new with tags"" over the past year... I think its obvious where they came from.

To top it all off, we also found out that she actually l got fired from her job for stealing.

I guess what I'm asking is what do I do? My husband wouldn't think of turning her in, he knows shes a garbage person but he believes it will catch up to her on it's own. I know what I want to do is fueled by a lot of anger at how she treated us over the years. 
Do I even do anything?

The thing is she knows I like her because my friends an anus and called her, and told her the second I told him. Our friend who hangs out with her more than I do has told me multiple times that she likes me too.

So, I would ask her out but in summer school it seems like she kind of avoided me, i may be ""paranoid"" (idk if that's the right word) but it seems she would walk alternative routes to not have to walk with me and I'm scared and don't know what to do.

24,"Hey there reddit, I’ve been pretty bummed out recently. I’ve been thinking a lot on the things in my past that trigger my poor behaviors and I’ve been wanting to see a therapist but I’m hesitant. I don’t have insurance at 22 and I have a lot of things going on that keep me from focusing on important things.

I remember when I moved in with my dad at 8y/o and meeting him for the first time. It was always down hill for me and this was no exception. He was an alcoholic and trying to build his life and I always felt like a burden. After years of my grades declining and my sadness growing, he took me to a friend of his, a counselor for underprivileged youth who ran a family counseling practice in her home.  She had a room upstairs for kids to express themselves and would talk to me and my dad about what was going on. 

I don’t remember what I would talk about but it always felt like a time for my dad to vent. Mostly about me and the issues he can’t solve, like eating, bathing, school work. I always felt like I was special because of things he would say but I never felt like he was there for me. And these sessions only put bandaids on the problems at home.

After each session I would sit alone in the car for a while and thought it was as a separation so he could talk to her privately.
I learned later on that he was sleeping with her. And they would do this after most sessions. We knew her out side of this practice as they were friends. My parents were never together so it wouldn’t cause any other issues. But I always felt like this was a tribute to how little effort he placed into my development over his own needs. 

I’ve distanced myself from him, but as we’re getting older I want to reconnect more. There are a lot of issues and abuse, but this one always comes to mind. Do you think I should bring it up as a way to help put water under the bridge?",30Jun2019,2
25,"18f here, gaming has been a part of my life forever. I play xbox a lot and I'm very active on clash of clans / clash royale. I just love to game with other people. One thing I'm sick of in the gaming world are sexist gamers. Constantly people saying ""oh you got this because you're a girl"" ""oh they only play with you cuz you're a girl"" and lots of sexual remarks, accusations, and lots of classic ""sandwich making dishwasher."" 

Honestly I'm so tired of being good at games and just trying to play without people treating me this way. I can combat it, and I try, but I have very little sexual experience and when people say things like that often am speechless. I cant stay in a clan on clash of clans for very long due to this problem. I cant find consistent people without ulterior motives to play with on xbox. I cant find people who see me like themselves- and I have no idea what to do.

So basically I'm looking for advice- girl gamers, do you struggle with this? Guys- what goes through your mind when you say stuff like this?(not saying all guys do) I just want to be treated a bit more normally and I was just wondering how other people deal with this problem in the gaming world. 

Some people have suggested changing my name on these platforms to be more manly. However my names arent even anything girly. I dont tell people I'm a girl I let then find out on their own. I can deal with joking and stuff, I do that just fine, but blatant small minded discrimination is different.

Clash names - Mady. 
Xbox name- Same as reddit. 

I just want some advice from you all as to what I can do to battle this shit in the gaming world.",30Jun2019,3

27," 

Before I started dating my current gf, i talked to alot of girls and only ever kissed 2 but nothing more. I was still friends (strong word) with them and she knew from other ppl what happened in the past. after this, she has been very suspicious of me and other girls. im interested in a certain type of girl and the 2 girls and my current gf all have this characteristic (being purposely vague). i dont think she likes that and i have assured her that nothing serious even happened with them but she doesnt want to believe it because in the past i foolishly bragged about what i did with them to my friends and overhyped it. to try and calm her suspicions, i tried to thoroughly explain everything that happened in the past. a few days ago i was on facebook messenger with my sister and i could tell she was reading my screen when i was in the main page of the app with all ur contacts and previous messages. I dont know why i did it but i instinctively turned my screen away. this set her off and made her want to look to see what i was hiding. I am not hiding anything but im just scared of the possibility that there could be anything. she found an old conversation with one of the girls and asked why i would be messaging her if we werent even close. she said it didnt line up with what i told her about my past relationships with the girl.

I find it hard to blame her. with only recent context, it seems like she is extremely controlling. however, i used to talk about girls to her when we were becoming a thing and i was very immature at the time.. i would also be very insecure in her situation. this is both of our first relationships. it's been over a year and we are as certain as we can be that we are the loves of each others lives. this is our only problem. I think it is my fault originally for how I acted about past relationships but i dont think shes justified in doing this. what do I do? Im chalking it up to us being immature as this is both our first real relationship.. i just dont know. any help is appreciated

**tl;dr:** used to brag about stuff i did in past relationships to friends and overhyped it. gf hears about it and is wondering why i lied to her about my past relationships (i didn't lie to her, i lied to my friends in the past to make myself seem cool). now she gets very suspicious at me when anything about them or any girls comes up. our relationship could not be any healthier besides this. what can i do?",30Jun2019,1
28,"Even dbcddjidx\_BcIwantABetterName for this throwaway was too long no matter how I worded it  


I want g⊃θs but Reddit won't let me use special characters maybe there's a way to get the names meaning without them?

**Meaning**:  
My real name is Gus ""⊃"" is an unusual way to make a right arrow and ""θ"" Theta in mathematics can represent an angle, so it's an orthogonal way to spell my name. Which if you look at the archaic/hipster definition of orthogonal you will see why this is very important to me.. If you still don't understand well you're not really supposed to but I once  politely after a class asked a jiu-jitsu teacher   
**Me:** *""what does Oes mean?""* (I do not know the correct spelling of ""Oes"" that's just what it sounds like)  
**His memorable response:** ""...Oes means Oes, ""...

  
**Me:** *""umm( quietly) ""*  
**Teacher**: *""..It's to show respect(idk but confident tone, also \*shrugs slightly)*  
**Me:** *""alright,, see you next week(friendly hide the pain tone)""*   
Kinda stopped going not because of that( I did turn up the next week). I don't like it when Jiu Jitsu schools that say they are MMA but mostly just stuff, he was a good teacher should go back thinking of this.  
Basically what I'm trying to say here is that: ***orthogonal means orthogonal***  


Anyway, there's gotta be a symbolic cryptic way to replace it?  ""&gt;"" the meme arrow isn't accepted and the ⊃ is important because if you rotate it to the right you get U. I need to somehow represent cryptic orthogonality along with my name in a way that Reddit accepts but how??

When they were filming the surprise, they made me stand in front of a very nice car, and they were congratulating me on graduating from high school. I thought the car that we were standing in front of was going to be all mine. Once they gave me the keys, I pressed the unlock button, and well, the car that unlocked was not the car that I expected. The car is so broken down and it’s a 2003 model.

I know I sound so ungrateful, and usually I’m not. I don’t know how to feel. My sister could tell on my face that I did not like the car. I don’t want to disappoint my grandparents by selling the car for a new one when I get a job, and my dad would probably get mad at me. I know I’m in the wrong

35," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her wiping the table , she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

36," 

This  is a bit of a long story so be prepared, I do appreciate any help with  this though if you do not want to read it all I totally understand.

I  used to go on this online chatroom app a lot. I made a lot of friends  on their and everything. But at the time (and I still do feel this way a  lot) anytime I would see someone struggling with anything, even on the  app when someone just wasn't feeling their best, I took it upon myself  to try and help them. I would continue to do it a lot on there and  eventually it would be too much for me. People there would tell me  really serious stuff about them contemplating suicide or their  depression (I want to mention I was in high school while all this was  happening, I still am too) and I really had no clue what to do. I also  would talk to people at my school about this and already thought it was  too much and it was starting to take a big toll on me, but if I didn't  do anything I started to feel incredibly guilty and that if anything  happened to these people it was my fault, so I continued to stay.

As  time would pass on eventually I realized that people would do this  frequently and the more I learned about these people I realized that  they were about my age (or younger) and realized that they may be over  dramatizing stuff. I tried talking to someone about this and they told  me that I'm getting myself into a bad situation and that these people  are using me for some fake sense of support or attention, at least  partially. I decided to do my own investigating and I realized that some  of these people did in fact over dramatize things, and also I would  realize that they would lie to me a lot about certain things (I found  this out from reading older conversations about them self, things they  do, and just using common sense, its hard to explained but point is I  know they were lying at least about some things). I sorta tried telling  one of them about this that I need a break because it was starting to be  too much for me and things got worse again when they begged me not to  leave them and that they need me and that I was their only hope. It hit  me hard so I decided to keep staying at least for a bit longer.

After  a bit things get worse than me, and I start getting constantly anxious  about everything and I start constantly checking on people on the app  and in real life because I really started to believe that if anything  happens to them it's my fault, because I wasn't there if they need me,  and eventually I just stopped doing anything because I didn't wanna go  do something in case they needed more and because I couldn't focus on  anything else. I realized that I shouldn't live this way and so  eventually I just started to fade out. Once enough time past and I  became inactive their I told everyone that I was gonna take a break,  just to handle some personally stuff, and I signed out after talking to  some people and giving final pieces of advice.

Fast  forward to now, I feel really awful about this, still. I feel like I  truly left these people and abandoned them despite them most likely or  partly doing it for attention and them lying to me. I would check in on  these people still over time, I would check their bios and stuff to see  how they were feeling, check their feed to see if they were still alive  really and I learned that everyone was fine. I even tried signing in and  I had no missed messages really for anybody needing me. I did step in  at one point when one of the people were advertising on their profile  they were suicidal to try and help and they changed it the next day  afterwards so I think they were ok. I still routinely check on these  people every now and then to see how they were, by looking at profiles  offline mode (I know it sounds stalkery but I didn't know what else to  do, I couldn't relax unless I knew they were at least a live) and also  these people would usually have bios set up to show how they were  feeling and you could see their moods and everything with how they  updated and designed it (I could tell because I did know them once so  depending on the theme they would have, quotes they would have in their,  songs, mood boards, etc. I sorta could tell somewhat).

Nowadays  though I start feeling this same feeling but I still try and support  the people around me and friends and continue to try and help people at  my school and on other places I talk to people (like discord and such),  and I've been doing better with the whole anxiety thing about this  people but sometimes it comes back and I feel like I have to do  something, even if I don't know the person, or else it is my fault. Even  know I feel guilty asking what to do because I feel like if I change my  sort of ""I have to help people regardless of how I feel"" idea then I  won't be a good person anymore. It also doesn't help that eventually I  start thinking more and more about the chatroom and I start feeling  really anxious.

Anyway the thing I need advice on is two things actually relating to this:

1. I  still feel guilty and that I sort of abandoned these people, a lot of  people have told me I need to focus on myself but people have seen me as  someone who helps other people a lot in a selfless manner and I've  prided myself on that knowing at the end of the day I did something good  in the world, but I just feel like what I did was completely selfish  and a bad thing and I just want to know what I should do to handle the  guilt, like if I should go back their or not, or what else I could do.
2. I  actually ran into someone from there on a discord server (I knew it was  them due to similar name and pfp) and they recently left, I'm not sure  why but people have been telling me he and a lot of other people have  left due to newer users in the discord not being the best people to hang  around. He didn't recognize it was me and I kept it that way for now.  But after him leaving I worried it was maybe from one of the other  issues he would tell me about on the chatroom app I was talking about  earlier and I'm not sure if I should try to see if everything is ok but  I'm worried it will really re-open that whole can of worms.

Sorry  for all the writing, I've really been debating doing anything about  this or not or trying to get help but I felt like it was finally time, I  appreciate any help, you guys are great and don't worry if it's all too  much for you, I totally understand and I hope this story didn't make  you feel sad or bad for me because that's not my intention, again  though, I appreciate y'all!",30Jun2019,2

41,"When I was in my teens, I was active in a volunteer organization.  Every year, the organization ran a leadership program, and volunteers had to audition to be part of the program.  But once a volunteer got in, they were practically assured a spot in the program in subsequent years.  The only time I was aware of an ""alumnus"" being rejected was when a creepy kid made some sexual comments toward a girl in the program.  


I auditioned several times for this leadership program and was rejected.  Which made me realize I needed to grow a bit and work on some skills.  So I worked hard, and on my fourth time auditioning, I got in, and things went well.  In fact, the following year, I auditioned and was accepted again -- and given an even higher position in the program.    


But the next year, I auditioned -- and was informed in a terse letter than I was not chosen for that year's program, with no explanation why.  


Shortly after I got the rejection letter, I went through some very difficult, unrelated life events, and so instead of processing and coming to terms with the rejection, I think I kind of repressed the memory of it.  


Cut to 15 years later.  I had not thought about this organization in a long time.  I honestly did not remember being rejected.  In my mind, everything ended on good terms.  I happened to reconnect with some of the people from the program.  Nobody ever brought up the fact that I had been rejected after two years in the program.  I joined a Facebook group for alumni of the program.  I even (cringe) grabbed lunch with the person who made the decision to reject me, all the while having no idea that she had done so!  


That is ... until a few months ago, when I rediscovered some journal entries I had written at the time I received the rejection letter.  And it all came flooding back.  


So now I'm in this really weird position where I still don't know why I was rejected and am afraid to ask.  If I was able to repress the memory of the rejection, am I also repressing the memory of something really stupid or offensive that I did that led them to decline to invite me back?  


And among this friend group, I don't know who was told what about why I wasn't brought back, or whether any of the things they were told are actually true.  Maybe nobody knows anything and their memories are as bad as mine.  But I can't help questioning just how genuine these friendships are.  Do they act nice to me because they actually like me, or do they merely tolerate me but don't want to be rude by giving me the cold shoulder?  


And let's assume the best case: Nobody has any memory of this stuff and the friendships are genuine.  Even then, knowing what I know now, am I going to always struggle with the fact that they all left the program in good standing and I was one of only a very few who was disinvited?",30Jun2019,1
43,"So I recently started working back at my old job. While I was gone, my boyfriend of a few years and I broke up. About a month or so ago, my former boss (the one I work for again) messaged me asking if I wanted to go out for drinks. I entertained the idea for a couple weeks and we snap chatted back and forth but I never actually hung out with him.

Once I started working for him again, he started snap chatting me again. It got really flirty, to the point we were just teasing each other, and even at work he would flirt with me. So one night I ended up going to his house and we drank, and talked for hours and ended up having sex. While we were talking he admitted that when I messaged him back it was the happiest he had been in a long time. No one can know about it because it is against the rules and he had already been in trouble for the same thing before... After that night he slacked off on snap chatting me because I’m sure he is scared he will lose his job. It’s been about a month and last week he started snap chatting me and flirting with me at work again... BUT on snap chat he will just change the subject compared to when we are at work, he is constantly flirting. I’m confused as to why he would act different on the phone than at work. 

Well last night I went out with a male co worker knowing my boss and other coworkers would be there at the bar. I came with my coworker but I really just went to see my boss who didn’t even know I was coming. After about 15 minutes of me being there he left.

I want to know if it is because he got jealous even though I am not interested in my coworker. Now I’m second guessing going out last night because I feel like he isn’t going to try to talk to me anymore thinking my coworker and I were together.

Also, would he get jealous if all he wanted was sex or does it mean he likes me? And why did he start snap chatting and flirting with me again after not talking to me for 3 weeks? I can’t bring myself to directly talk to him about it but it’s killing me.

1. **How do I receive and organize their ideas?** Right now they are coming up with ideas faster than I can keep track of, (and all in a few discord channels) and it worries me. I don't want their contributions to be lost in the mix because I know from experience that if one's ideas are ignored, one stops contributing.
2. **How do I create a vision?** Effective leaders instill their followers with a mission and a purpose. How does that work? My mission is, ""to create a single multiverse that swallows up all of fiction, one crossover at a time."" (And I know that it's outlandish, and I have my heart set on it, and I refuse to change course). Am I supposed to repeat that like a mantra? There's got to be more to it than just telling my comrades what I want over and over again. Does reminding them what I aim to accomplish actually increase the likelihood of accomplishing it?
3. **How do I ask them to do unpleasant things?** I started a wiki to try to organize contributions, (I figured it was a way to turn ideas into writing projects), but so far I'm the only one who has written in it, and it's too hard to do alone. I know why, mostly: I didn't say, ""let's put these ideas down somewhere, polish a few of them up and get started on one."" So none of my new friends even know why the wiki exists. But saying the ""let's put these ideas..."" sentence sounds to me like saying, ""I have decided a problem exists. Here's my solution. Please put your time into my solution,"" which is a ridiculously one-sided conversation. I have a hard time believing anyone would have responded if I had gone that route. Which relates to my next question:
4. **How do I start two-way conversations?** If I carefully craft a message to my coauthors, firstly explaining why a particular obstacle exists to our goal, secondly presenting evidence to support my claims, and thirdly signaling a willingness to consider alternative solutions (or alternative obstacles to pursue), is that going to culminate in action? Or is there groundwork that must be laid beforehand?
5. **How do I avoid being Castro?** I once saw a documentary about Castro's Cuba: whenever Castro visited a farm or factory, its production would shoot up, enough to exceed the Party's quotas for that month. Everything would be wonderful right up until he left, and then in his absence production would plummet. The same goes for a lot of writing communities: when the founder takes a hiatus, the community follows suite. That won't work for me because in order to consume the 60,000 books in the public domain, this project has to become a near-uncontrollable monster gobbling up everything in its path. How do I create such a monster without becoming its only source of strength?
6. **How do I build their confidence?** I'm beginning to get the impression most of my coauthors are young teenagers. I am 28. That means I have just over a decade on them in years, but it was that decade (18-28) that contained most of my practice. Essays, essay workshops, tutoring, diary entries, casual emails to pen pals that stretched out thousands of words. All of that happened in the last ten years of my life. We haven't written a word yet together, so maybe they are all child prodigies and I have nothing to worry about. But hypothetically, if it turns out there is a noticeable gap in our writing skills, how do I keep the gap from discouraging them? (Discouraging them is bad because I need my coauthors to eventually become experienced writers).  

I know this is a whole lot to respond to. Thus, even if you answer a single bullet point, you have my gratitude. And thank you for reading through this monster of a reddit post. It means a lot to me that there are people out there so determined to help someone that they made it all the way to the end of a 700+ word post. I've written essays shorter than this. Thanks.",30Jun2019,1
53,"Hey guys,
So I am looking for advice on this particular situation I am encountering at work. There is a male coworker who has been making the younger women in my office very uncomfortable. The coworker is around 30 years old and has been married for years. His M.O. is getting close to our new hires who tend to be younger women. He gets very close and flirty with the women, he even privately snapchats them (aka where messages expire and disappear). The women with whom he is interested in do not seem to mind, but they are young, doe-eyed and naive and they are just starting  out at the company and when an older, attractive, cool coworker gives them attention, they are flattered. I have had three women coworkers approach me and tell me that this male coworker has made them uncomfortable. He has even been inappropriate with me, and I am a manager.

Myself and two other coworkers who had approached me about the situation are going to speak with our boss on Monday about what is going on. I was planning on going to my boss earlier in the day to give him a heads up about what is going on(so he doesn't feel bombarded).

I am so conflicted about this. I know I have to say something, I am a manager and the women under me are telling me about a situation with a Male coworker that is making them uncomfortable. I'm just not sure what to expect or what my boss can do perse.

What are your thoughts? Any input is much appreciated.",30Jun2019,8

58,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Please forgive any weird formatting. I started a job around 7 months ago and my immediate supervisor and I don't get along. I know its not uncommon, but have the feeling that she has it out for me. And she has been doing it in the most passive aggressive way. Here is one example of what she does:

&amp;#x200B;

The other day, she came over and said to me who gave me permission to leave work early. I said I didn't know what she meant, as I didn't leave work early. She brought up the fact that I did in fact leave work early the other day: I left at 3:53 instead of 4:00. I informed her that my bus had come early two days in a row and I had missed it. I hadn't told her this, so that was my bad and I said that I would stay extra. She said not to worry about it and insisted that I leave at my normal time. 

&amp;#x200B;

OK, that was my bad, I just won't do it again. No big deal right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that is what I thought until about a week later when my I have a meeting with my big boss and my supervisor. During the meeting, she turned to me and said

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ""Aren't you going to tell her who gave you permission to leave early?"". 

I asked her what she meant, as nobody had given me permission to leave early. She continues with 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Then why have you been leaving early lately?"" 

I try to explain that I left early one day because I had missed my bus and I offered to stay and make up the time, but she just keeps interjecting with:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""But you DID say that you left early then?""

All in front of my big boss, who is now looking at me thoroughly unimpressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

There have been several other instances of her asking me why I did something and then 'innocently' bringing it up when upper management is in the room. Strangely she fails to mention the fact that she has done the very things that she mentions.

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me is that it is so passive aggressive that I find it hard to react or halt it. I don't know how to cope with how she plays dumb yet insistent. I get that she is trying to box me into a corner by trying to make me admit my own fault and then using that against me. I try and dodge her questions, but she won't stop asking pressing me about the action that I did until I either:

1. admit fault
2. evade her questions so thoroughly that my other coworkers  ask me why i don't just answer the question.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a perfect employee, I know that. But I genuinely need this job and all I want is peace while I do it. I genuinely am under the impression that this person wants me gone. And I don't know how to stop her. I want to keep this as professional and cordial as possible as I really need this job right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is appreciated.",30Jun2019,1
59,"Its quite a long post, so it doesn't matter if you want to read through this

From the start of my life, I have been living with my grandmother, as my parents are divorced and my mother gained custody of me. She was very busy to get a good job to raise me and my grandparents. I lived with my grandparents until I was seven, so I saw my grandmother as my mother instead of my own mother. (it's weird but that's just how I viewed it) 

After that, I started living with my mother. I was curious as to why I don't have a father and she'll make up this story about him being drunk all the time (at the time I didn't know it was a lie). 

This is a bit depressing but my grandmother died during Christmas in 2012 due to cancer. And I vividly remember not wanting to visit as I almost fainted from walking to the hospital (due to the weather and the steep slope, and no one told me about what sickness she had). I still regret not visiting her more. 

Throughout my stay with her at 7 up until I was 16, she'll hit me whenever I did something wrong. When I tried to explain the situation in my perspective, she'll brush it off and say 'you're still young so you don't know anything', even if she is in the wrong. She'll scold me and put words into my mouth until I admit that I was in the wrong.

At around 16, I met a guy online and fell in love with him. At first he was reluctant, so he confessed to my other friend A and they dated for a while, with my watching the whole thing go down. My other friend A knew that he was messing with me and accepted his confession to protect me (you'll see why later). After the broke up, he dated me for a while until one day, out of the blue, he called me 'curse', which means that I'm not natural and am something that should exist in the first place (this definition was provided by someone else when I asked them what it could mean). Needless to say, this affected me until now. 

As shown before my relationship with my mother is really bad, considering we argue whenever we talked and that she could go on a business trip for two days and I wouldn't notice.

When my great-grandmother passed, I asked to go to her funeral (it was in a different place from where I live), not wanting to make the same mistake as I did with my grandmother. She said no, so I asked why. She stated that it's because I'll miss school. But I also missed school when attending my grandmother's funeral, so I told her this and she replied with 'if your grandmother's funeral was in a different place, I wouldn't have let you go as well'. This really affected me as my grandmother was like a mother figure to me when I was little, so I got mad and slammed the door on her.

After all these events, I went to a psychiatrist after convincing my mother (who laughed when she first heard that I had depression). I was then confirmed to be clinically depressed. My mum talked to the psychiatrist after I explained it to the psychiatrist, as I didn't want my mum to intervene. The psychiatrist then told me my mum was extremely concerned, and wanted me to have sessions everyday. So I thought my mum is finally showing some concern towards me. Although the rest of my family except one of my cousins believed that I have depression at first, I thought maybe I could fix my relationship with my mum. 

After a few months, my mum told me 'you don't have depression, you don't even know what it is, and that the talk about you harming yourself is fake'. This really broke me.

I then went to another psychiatrist after that, and it turns out my condition was worse than before. But my mum still didn't believe it and said 'As long as you think you don't have it, you won't have it. Its only because you 'label' yourself as depressed.'

There's still a lot of details missing, but I think I got most of the large problems. I have never wanted to go to my mum for advice as she has blamed it on me everytime, even when I told her I was being bullied.",30Jun2019,1

63,"I’d love some input but also advice. My moms father had another child (according to my moms mom who always said he did but presumably didn’t know who) and nobody ever knew who she was or if it was true. I ended up finding out who she was a few years ago by accident and found out that my grandpa was on her birth certificate and they look identical. My mom has known the woman basically her whole life through school and just our community, and she grew up with another father. I grew up with her son who I was good friends with in high school and I know for a fact that she’s actually my grandpas daughter. It was so easily accidentally found that my grandfather was her biological father and even my mom believed it right when I found it. She just was absolutely amazed that this woman she’s been aquatinted with was her sister. Well, after my grandfather died last year, my mothers real sister took his entire inheritance. My mom isn’t one to tell the family about that so she just distanced herself due to that and a lot of other crazy bullshit, but due to this, she’s really lost her whole family. My aunt took their mothers inheritance as well and it’s just always been a sour subject, and then she did it again, and told my mother that she would never be able to afford to fight her on it. 
Anyways, sorry I’m ranting, but I can’t stop thinking about her other sister. My mom is very family oriented and she’s been so alone the past year or so. I just wish there was a way to approach this woman appropriately, even if it was through her son that I hung out with constantly in high school. It’s just so weird and I feel in my soul for whatever reason like it’s important to do, but I don’t want to shake up anyone’s life. I myself have a sibling that I most likely doesn’t know her biological father, and I’ve never felt the need to approach her. For some reason I just keep thinking that I need to do something about this and I can’t help it. I know this sounds ridiculous and that she’d come to us if she wanted to, but I almost have a gut feeling that she knows her dad isn’t biological but never knew who was. I just don’t know how to edge into this and I know it’s none of my business, but going through something similar and just so easily letting it slide by, this for some reason feels like I have had this deep deep gut feeling that this is something my mother and the other woman need.

70,"Simple as that. She enacts laws within the house that I can only assume are to feed her hunger for power, things like telling me what chairs I can and can’t sit on, when I can have the door open, making me get up and leave when she enters a room,  and when I try to stand up for myself as I believe these to be unjust, she simply resorts to cruel name calling and physical violence. She takes it upon herself to ruthlessly criticize the harmless actions or characteristics of myself and others, and sometimes even my access to basic care depends on what kind of mood she’s in. She’s quick to lash out at anyone who attempts to make her aware of her obvious temperament issues, and it’s been going on for years. I don’t know how I’m supposed to keep living with her.
People still say things like, “Your mom just wants what’s best for you,” but I can’t see how that could be the case.

76,"Something happened at work the other day and it prompted me to post this, here's some context. My boss very recently decided to put me in another department, at work (because the one I was working in was about to close). My boss, being fairly incompetent in management, failed to notice me that the day due for my  department switch was not next Monday but last Friday. So I got to work to my usual department, what I thought was my last day there but about 1h in, a supervisor came to tell me that I needed to be in my new  department. No big deal, I put my stuff in order and walk to my new  department. There waiting for me was my new coworker (not a superior, just a coworker), who had been waiting for me since I got in to work apparently (1h15 before).

&amp;#x200B;

His greetings were basically: ""Where in the *fuck*  were you??? I've been waiting for you for HOURS."" Throwing in some more bad words here and there (I'm french and I can't translate very well but you get the idea). He was yelling at me and was very aggressive, to the point where I thought he would snap if I said anything about it. I just stayed there and answered his questions calmly. He kept trying to find a way to put his troubles on me but it wasn't even remotely my  fault so we argued for a bit. Anyhow, this whole situation made me feel very uneasy in my stomach and it reminded me of how terrified I am of physical confrontations.

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, if this guy did attack me I would probably have been able to hold him off with relative ease. I'm a tall guy, I've got broad shoulders, I go to the gym and do labor work, so I'm fairly athletic. All of these facts didn't really help me in the moment though. I've never thrown a single punch in my life, I've only ever gotten clocked in the face by ""friends"" in middle school, once or twice (after which I cried a lot, it was pretty humiliating). I suppose these events may have sort of traumatized me. The potential pain of a physical confrontation doesn't intimidate me so much, I feel like (having been in a nasty car crash recently, I doubt anyone could top that without a car). What frightens me is the potential humiliation, I think. I'm scared of getting clocked in the face at 19 and then crying like a bitch, exactly like in middle school.

Typing all of this out helped me realize some stuff, I should do that more often. Anyway, sorry for the long post, what do you guys think? How could I work on this anxiety? Thanks a lot.

77,"So a coworker of mine is in an abusive marriage. One night when I was drinking whiskey and scrolling through Facebook I saw a post he made with a corny poem that reminded me of something my crazy ex boyfriend would write. I was tipsy and commented “LMAO” on the post, and he replied “what’s so funny” and then proceeded to comment another 20 times calling me every name in the book, including a butch/dyke..which I’m not.., and accusing me of screwing his wife, and demanded she block me, and when she wouldn’t he said “you win, my wife won’t block you,” and told her to “keep this butch.” He did not make any threats through. He then went through my Facebook and commented on a very sensitive post of mine “LMAO” to get back at me because he know it would be hurtful and I blocked him before he trashed my page more. 

The next day when I got to work she said she was sorry about her husband, that he talks to her like that all the time, and has talked to many people like that, including her mother. She said they met up in a parking lot that night and they fought each other, that she defended me to him and refused to delete me off Facebook, and this was the final straw for her and she’s divorcing him. She showed me a picture of her at one time with patches of hair gone because he ripped them out. So I said I was proud of her, that he’s a piece of shit and she deserves better.


Tonight I was in the mall and saw them both, so I don’t know if she’s actually divorcing him or not. I doubt it. She waved to me, and I was a dumbass and waved back. He didn’t look at me, so I hope he didn’t see/recognize me cause I didn’t have makeup on.

81,"To give complete context, TLDR at the end:

Im almost 20 years old and have been studying in university for the last 2 years. 

I like what I study, and the first half of past year was great, It went downhill from there, due to a complex break up (we both had personal problems) and the fact that I had to struggle with psychosis and hallucinations after said break up. (Doing well now, dont worry about it). That year I passed half my subjects.

My parents were really supportive with me although they knew I did shit. This year started well but I ended failing every subject. We talked about it and Im dropping university since its pretty obvious Im only making them lose money. 

Thats where the problem begins. Both years I was living in a shared and rented flat with other 3 students, although the flats and the people were different each year. This city is at 30 min by car from my village. They were paying the rent and those things this year, since first year I had a public schoolarship and I met the requisites to not have to refund it. 

We decided Im gonna study a different kind of formation but same field (Computer Science btw) which is in a similar level (a bit lower) than university. Im happy with this. But I also decided that Im going back to live with my parents since my mom (who works for the administration) was able to move for a year to a job in the city that matches my schedule pretty awesome (and its great for her since its a really good place to work). 

The main reason to come back is not to get things done for me by my parents, but because I think is better for me. Living in this city has been pretty funny and enjoyable since almost all the friends I have live herw but I cant seem to focus on my studies.

I have grown to be heavily less talkative and worse in social interaction during this period of time. Thats mainly because of the problems with my ex, and friends who turned their back after the break up. 
Before I would talk non stop to 20+ people at the same time all the time and be just okay. Now I have like 4 friends and dont feel like being able to  talk to anybody new. And even more if I know nobody in the new place im going to study.

I feel like if I stay the next year in home, I will go further deep in the lonelyness I feel. 

TLDR: 20yo coming back after 2 years living away from my parents, and changing the place where I study due to shitty grades. Feeling Im not able to socialize anymore

Question:
I think the going back to home thing is right, but is it? If im right, how can I prevent the thing of becoming kinda of a shut-in?

82,"I’ll keep it short so maybe more will read and offer insight. My two childhood friends, one from a state I lived in until I was 14 and the other from where I lived from 14 - 20. Both were like brothers to me. I kept daily contact through Xbox live or phone and frequently saw both. 

One died in 2013 from being struck by a drunk driver while walking home from a bar. The driver turned himself in later that night. 

The other passed in 2014 of heat stroke from sitting in his car too long after having a panic attack. He had sever ptsd from being kidnapped for several days while in college. 

I have never gotten over it. I still have our entire text logs and can’t bring myself to delete them because I don’t have anything else from them but memories. 

I’ve never been good at making a lot of friends. Out of all the short friendships I had growing up they were the only two that remained in my life as my best friends. 

I think I’ve gone too long without friends. Work friend never seem to go any further. 

We were supposed to become old men together. 

Please help. I’m incredibly lonely and think about them at probably an unhealthy amount.",30Jun2019,1

84," This has really been bothering me lately because a few weeks ago a  couple of my friends and I got high. Everything was going alright and  everyone was having a good time. Eventually, I accidentally interrupted  one of my friends while he was talking and he snapped. ""You know what  OP, you've been so annoying. Do you know that no one likes you?"" Idk  what to make of this because I consider him a pretty good friend, but  i've heard that people can say some pretty deep-seated shit while high.",30Jun2019,1

87,"This is my first time ever really posting on Reddit so I don't know if this is the right place to put this but if it isn't please tell me!! Also sorry for the spelling errors if any I have troubles with English sometimes. Also Trigger Warning but this post is gonna talk about domestic abuse and also!! I'm not trying to clown on anyone's beliefs so please don't think I am.

So, before I get into everything here's some underlying context.
I am a 15 year old guy and I live with my 24 year old sister and my dad (and my small dog)
My mom has always been religious in one form or another and is very stubborn when it comes to reasoning with anyone and ESPECIALLY my dad.
She also claims to see/hear Angels and even God himself talking to her and she also says she can see demons/ghosts and people's auras. All that religious and spiritual stuff pretty much.

So onto the actual situation it's self, lately my mom has been VERY mentally unstable. I'd say it all started around 3-4 weeks ago on my birthday and it started out with small things. Mostly her chanting about God ECT. ECT. It's nothing me and my family haven't heard before so we didn't pay much attention to it until she started boarding up the windows and forcing all of us into the living room and telling us things like ""The sun is evil and is trying to kill you."" And also that the air was polluted and that one breath and we'd die. Yes, I know this sounds crazy but please trust me because this actually happened. Later that night I tried reasoning with her (big mistake) and told her she was being overly paranoid and on my fault I shouldn't have said it like that and worded it better but in the heat of the moment I just said whatever I thought could defuse the situation and in response she yelled at me and told me she was just trying to protect me and keep me away from all the ""negatively"" I still don't really know what she meant by that tbh.

But yeah after that we had an argument that lasted I'd stay one or two hours and in that hour I ended up having a nervous breakdown and called me friend ""R"" and asked if I could stay at his place since I felt scared/anxious at mine and he let me stay. I stayed there for about 2 days before I got picked up to go home and the moment I did my mom started up again about how we NEEDED to stay inside or else we'd be killed and she would yell at my dad calling him an evil man or just straight up insulting him calling him an ""animal"" and a ""worm"" as you can guess I retreated back to my friend ""R's"" place and this time stayed for like 3 days. I went home on the 4th because I thought that maybe my mom had calmed down but was I wrong.. cut to a literally yesterday she lost it again and this time she dragged both me and my sister into her car and refused to take us home. And dad had said that if she refused to take us back home to call the cops and I did. 

It took them 3 hours to get to where we we're at (A park) and we had to call them 5 times just to get a cop to come out. When I finally called the 911 for the final time my mom slapped (more like punched?) Me in the face and put me in a choke hold before getting the attention of some other people and they quick rushed over and called the cops and tried prying my mom off me since she now has both her arms wrapped around my waist and refused to let me go. When the cops got there they got her off me and got our statements. I told them that my mom and dad had gotten in an argument and that my mom dragged both me and my sister into her car and refused to let us go and then started getting physical when we would try to leave or call for help. And so they took her to the hospital to get mentally evaluated, again another big mistake because the very next day (so today) she let herself out of the hospital and came straight home and this is the part of the situation that actually happened like 2 hours ago.

But basically like I said she was waiting for me my sister and dad since we had actually gone shopping before she came home and the moment she saw our car pull up she started yelling and thrashing things around the front of the house yelling at us and asking why we called the cops on her if all she was doing was trying to ""protect"" us. I instantly got scared and got out the car and tried to book it inside but couldn't since my mom was blocking the door and that's when she yelled at me and my sister to go inside and that's when I called 911 again and told them that my mom was arguing with my dad and that she might start to get violent. That's when she grabbed me by my shirt collar/hair and dragged me into our home saying she was doing this for my own good and that God will save me. She also tried knocking the phone out of my hang and hung up on 911.

 She then went after my sister and grabbed her by her hair and started screaming at her telling her that she was ""infected"" I quickly grabbed my phone again since it was on the bed next to us and ran outside using the back door calling back 911.
The same dispatcher I got the first time picked up the phone again and I told her that now my mom had struck both me and my sister. My mom had followed me outside so I quickly ran back inside and both me and sister locked ourselves in my bedroom and I was still on the phone with 911
I'd say it only took like 5 minutes before the police showed up and they arrested my mom since she was still outside and this time was fighting with my dad and it turns out she actually cut him with her fingernails and was actually trying to go for a knife yelling ""I'm going to kill you"" when they we're inside arguing in the kitchen. Ofc my dad didn't mention my mom saying she was gonna kill him when the police started asking questions because he didn't want her to get thrown in prison. 

My mom kept yelling at me while getting transported to another cop car that she was just trying to protect me from the bad things in life and that I'm making a huge mistake and I just tried to block it out. Fast forward to now and my dad is calling my relatives telling them what happens and that he has had enough and that he's going to get a restraining order. I've texted my gf and best friend abt what's happened and tbh I still kind of feel like I'm in shock. But mostly regret, a lot of it. Like, I think I know what the obvious answer is but still.. what she said is bugging me. Did I make a mistake by calling the cops?? I don't think so.. but that was my mom.

Also kind you the entire time this was happening the group of neighbors came out and was basically being super nosy and watching everything go down instead of actually helping us. I get not wanting to be involved but don't just stand there and watch!!

 And I just can't believe that of all the people I had to call the cops on I can't believe it had to be my mom. So yeah, believe me or do but I'm just a scared teen trying to make sense of all this. So,, yeah pretty much asking for advice like how do I cope and get threw this because I just don't know and also did I do the right thing or did I pull a classic teenager and over react? I'm not asking for legal advice mind you my dad's already taking care of all of that. Again sorry for any spelling errors and sorry this post was so long. Also probably not gonna use Reddit again after this. Also I left out some details because I wasn't really sure how to add them in so if anyone wants I can let you know more details just tell me.",30Jun2019,1
88,I love this girl but she has a boyfriend and I’m not the kind of guy to flirt with her when she has boyfriend. We’ve been friends for a while...,30Jun2019,1
89,"This will be a long one, so I hope you will all bear with me.

I’ve known almost all my friends since high school. At some point during college, I realized I was depressed and wanted to die, and it really hit me that that was why I was sad and down. I hid it well when my friends were around, and I doubt any of them ever realized I was/still am depressed.

I started to date a guy around 7 years ago (we’ll call him Tim), and things have been somewhat rough, but we had almost always managed to get through it. We had a period about 2 years in where I was conflicted about our relationship because his behavior was not what I was expecting from someone who claimed to love me, and we broke up, but were still talking and planning to get back together. He decided to set conditions for getting back together, one of which was to get a job (I had quit my old one to move out of town, and then moved back into town a few months later and was staying with a friend while I looked). 

I found a job and we got back together, but then my mom moved up and found a place in town and I wound up staying with her because it was cheaper. My sister wound up moving in and got pregnant and Tim was adamant that he would not stay over with a baby in the house. I moved in with a couple of friends who were super messy and never cleaned, and I was uncomfortable with the sexual nature their parties seemed to take on, so I found a different place. Tim had helped me move in with them but complained a lot throughout and he complained a lot while helping me move to this new place. He complained a lot about the parking at my new place. He complained about the neighbors. He complained about the ice that would build up on the driveway in winter.

And at some point at the new place, bed bugs happened. I don’t know where they came from, but I almost lost my mind. I would wake up thinking I felt something on me and turn the flashlight on my phone to look. I would check the bed every other night. I bought sprays and powders and all manner of other things to deal with them and was stressed throughout and he complained about having to help me lift the mattress and not being able to touch the powder. He kept telling me to knock it off and that they weren’t there. I hated it. My depression kept getting worse and I just couldn’t bring myself to clean more than the litterboxes or to take out the trash. I kept saying that I wanted to move and he said he would not help, and that I should stay put, and that I move too much. I couldn’t stand the apartment any more, and I was scared to go to bed. (Somehow, we managed to kill them off, the landlord got a heat treatment)

There’s a guy we’ll call Dan. Dan is married and about my age (28), but he just keeps giving me weird clingy vibes, and other women I’ve talked to have said the same thing. He’s nice enough, but he cannot take a hint. Dan invited us to dinner at his place. I thought it was going to be Saturday but it was apparently Sunday. I normally do my laundry on Sundays. Saturday passed with no mention of the plans so I thought it had fallen through. Sunday happens and I’m in the middle of doing my laundry and Tim accuses me of deliberately not doing it til today so that I wouldn’t have to go and we have an argument. We break up again a day or so later.

Within 2 weeks we’re back together but keeping it a secret from our friends because there are conditions again. I have to get a car. I have to clean. I have to stop being a picky eater.

I move into a new place. I decided to leave all of my furniture from the old place, bed included, because I can’t look at it without getting the beginnings of a panic attack. I buy an air mattress. Tim complains about having to sleep on it. He complains about the parking lot at the new place. He complains that the new place is on the top floor.

I play Magic the Gathering. One friend’s wife also plays but we don’t have a lot in common besides the fact that she plays and I know her husband. I don’t know how to interact with her (I’ve never been good at talking to other women), and apparently she thinks I tell people how to play their decks (when I’m actually attempting to use politics). There was a Saturday when plans were to play Magic, but I couldn’t get a ride. The group went to the LGS but left when they saw a player was there that we don’t like. I finally managed to get a ride, and found out they weren’t there and texted to see what was up. They said they’d gone out to eat but would head over when they were done. Three hours pass. I had tried to text sporadically but I wasn’t getting answers from anyone in the group until close to the time they left the restaurant and finally arrived. By that point, I was pretty grumpy and snappy, and they tried to say there were no concrete plans to play.

A couple weeks later, I decided to make a group chat for the playgroup to make it easier, and friend with wife starts ignoring/ghosting me. He tried to claim to a mutual friend that it was blowing his phone up but it wasn’t. 

Now he’s claiming that he didn’t like the way I was treating his wife and that’s why he doesn’t talk to me any more. 

Then I got into a fight with a different friend’s girlfriend. They started dating when she was 17 and he was 25. (We’ll call him Jack, and her Claire) Right away my brain was saying that that was bad, and he kept complaining about her on and off throughout their relationship (which was online and long distance until a few months ago when she moved to our town). Now they’re 27 and 19. She’s basically the complete opposite of me and reeks of immaturity. Neither of us really gave the other a chance.

I was in a game with Jack and some other friends when one of them was going to do something that would have completely locked me out of the game. I was attempting to convince him not to do it. 

Claire decides to jump in on the discussion despite not being in the game and said “Don’t let her bully you”. And I told her to fuck off because she wasn’t in the game so she needed to stay out of it. She goes “You know what, bitch, I’ve been wanting to get at you for a long time. This is why all your friends are ditching you.” I shot back and told her no one in her department at work liked her. One friend could see I was upset and asked if I wanted to go home, and Claire said “Yes I would. I didn’t even want to come here because I knew she would be here.” And she and Jack left.

Now Jack won’t speak to me. It’s been almost 3 weeks. I’ve messaged him to apologize I don’t even know how many times. And then Tim and I got in a fight again and he said that maybe we shouldn’t be together until I get therapy for my depression and now we’re broken up again. And I can’t stand the way I’m feeling right now. I don’t see a future. I don’t see a way out of this. I feel like I would be better off just not existing. My friends don’t text me any more anyway. I’m a zombie at work. I barely have money because my wages are being garnished for my student loans. I’m at a complete loss for what to do or how to act.

How can I try to make it up to my friends and get them to stop hating me? Should I even bother trying to get back together with Tim? What do I do?",30Jun2019,1
90,"OK, where do I start. I currently live with my fiance and her mother. Her mother is in her 60's but has tons of health issues. She's had a brain tumor as well as heart issues. The problem is that she's a total b\*\*\*h. She expects everyone to do everything for her and shows absolutely not gratitude. Her doctor wants to to lose around 75 pounds before he feels comfortable performing the heart surgery she needs. The problem is that she won't do anything. Every 5 minutes she's yelling from the other room, hey I need this and I need that, but she doesn't do it in a polite or friendly manner. It's really difficult for me to describe how terrible a human being she is. At this point she's just rotting away because she won't do anything to help herself. I don't know how much longer I can be in the same house as her, and the worst part, it's starting to have a negative impact on my and my fiance's relationship. My fiance is always in a terrible mood because of it and it's almost impossible to have peace around here. I don't know what to do. We have looked into hospice care until I learned that you have to have been give at most 6 months to live which isn't the case here. Are there any other services out there that i'm not aware of that can help. Any advice would be great. Thanks!",30Jun2019,1
91,"I’m honestly at a loss here so a few months ago My friends invited me over to his house and he had his cousin over, (who he thought was super annoying) she kinda was but I started to know her as a person and I felt really close to her. But I recently felt like I was a predator or a pedophile because she’s going into 6th grade while I’m a sophomore in highschool.


I really don’t want to believe I’m a pedophile because that’s an awful thing, but I really like her as a person. I’d be lying if I said it was all her looks though, I am attracted to her.

I haven’t made any advances on her at all and I don’t have her phone number or anything. But this has been eating away at me ever since my friend introduced me to her. If I am a pedophile please tell me, I really want to improve myself and get help if this is the case.",30Jun2019,2
92,"A little bit of background: I met her in middle school and we stayed friends until maybe second year of high school. We had a rough falling out due to immature reasons, and both went through the rest of high school without interacting and never really resolved our fight. 

I decided to reach out and call a sort of truce in senior year, as I didn’t want to leave with any burdens or bad blood. We were going to different colleges and she wanted to hang out but plans didn’t go through, and I didn’t speak to her once in college. We didn’t follow each other on any social media platforms and I didn’t have her number.

I just finished my first year of uni. Randomly she followed me on Instagram, sending me messages about how she wanted to be friends again, misses our sleepovers, etc. she started to become very clingy, asking me when I was gonna be home, when we could hang, when I could FaceTime. It’s evolved into her asking to join me on my trips with friends she doesn’t even know, proposing times to hang out every free weekend since I work full time, etc.

I have no intention of being friends with her. We don’t have very compatible personalities and I really dislike being around her. I’ve been nice so far but have been careful to keep saying things like “I’ll have to check my schedule, I’m so busy with work so idk,” etc. I’ve beat around the bush and avoid making plans with her. 

Should I keep these empty conversations/implied plans going? I’m not sure if I should be straight up and risk being rude to say that I don’t want to travel with her or hang out with her, or if I should just be polite and make this small talk with her.

I don’t usually have issues telling people off and being brutally honest, but for her I can’t seem to bring myself to say I just straight up don’t want to spend time with her. I really don’t have a reason, I don’t care about her and she’s not connected to any of my friends so even if she starts shit it really shouldn’t affect me. She’s an easily offended person and I’m just dreading the conversation.",30Jun2019,2
93,"Hey everyone, I’m a recent college graduate (M), and for the past few weeks I’ve been really debating getting my ears pierced. I would just get studs, not gauges, but I’ve been paranoid that it could hurt my chances of landing a job.

I’ve read that it depends on the field of work you’re going into, but I plan on getting a Human Resources position. 

Most of the posts I’ve seen on this topic are outdated, on average I’d say about 7 years old.

If it weren’t for my paranoia of looking unprofessional, I would have certainly already had it done,

95,"I'm looking for advice on how I should move on from this situation.  I'm also looking for some confirmation on some things. This is extremely long, (like really long) and I'm sorry about that. I feel like I need to paint a very clear picture . the bolded words are basically what happened and the rest is explanation                                    -                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The only thing you need to know about me is that I'm a young adult girl. I have to acknowledge something too; I don't know if I have been emotionally abused/ maybe neglected or if this sort of thing is normal and my response is different. The reason I'm so confused is it involves my loving parents. I know for a fact that they love me. They say they love me almost everyday.   But every time they say that I think back to a lot of things that happened growing up and are still happening. I'll try and list and explain some of their actions.       (also note that I was never physically hurt and nothing like that has ever happened. Physically I am in a safe environment)                                                                                                                          **-Yelling.** Constant yelling growing up. Not so much now as I am insanely careful with my words and actions. They were under a lot of stressed. We had money stolen. We went from almost upper middle class to at the poverty line. We were also being sued (this was thirteen years ago and we're still dealing with it.) I understood (for the most part I was about five and didn't have a grasp of money really) the stress they were under and I started being extremely obedient thinking it would help. It didn't.  No matter what I did I wasn't doing enough. I was constantly grounded. I hardly ever spoke bc it would annoy them. I didn't ask questions bc I was scared and they didn't have much time to spend with me anyway bc of the legal trouble.                                                                                                                                                                                                  **-Lack of teaching**. My older sister, who is only a year and a half older than me taught me my abc's. My mom didn't ever read with me, none that I remember. It was the middle of second grade and I could barely read. This may have been seen as normal if it wasn't for the fact that my mom is an english teacher. One of the best actually in our district. She's won awards.  My mom didn't teach me feminine things. Like shaving or even how to put my hair in a ponytail (or even how to brush my hair). I had to figure it out myself. I didn't know how to ask. When I was still pretty young I would ask how to do something and I would get shot down and told to ""figure it out and use my brain."" I felt so stupid most of the time. When I figured out how to do my hair I was so excited and showed my mom. She got kinda mad bc she expected me to know how to that. She would get mad too when I wouldn't dress a certain way. also makeup. She wanted me to wear makeup but I had no idea how to apply it. I'm better now but I keep it safe and basic. I'm really confused. I don't know how they expected me know to how to do...everything. I guess maybe they thought I would learn by watching them. That didn't really work. My parents had to be workaholics to keep up with finances so I didn't spend much time with them. I spent a lot of time with my four siblings.                                                                                                                               -                                                                                                                              -**I was bullied by my mom's students**. In the middle of second grade I transferred to the school my mom taught at, it was a private school. It was very small. I graduated from there with 14 people in my grade (7 guys, 7 girls.) My teacher noticed my twin and I were extremely behind grade level wise. (one of my siblings is my identical twin. Yes we look exactly alike in our faces. our fashion styles and hair are extremely different though, which annoys people bc they want us to look exactly the same. I don't like being referred to as an object. I am the technical younger one.) We were so behind she ended up having to tutor us for a half hour everyday for a few months. I discovered that I could actually read and in fact by the end I was reading above my grade level (which at a private school means I was average bc of the high expectations but still.). If it weren't for her I wouldn't have ever caught up. However this isolated me from my other classmates. From 2nd to towards the middle of 5th grade I was mostly ignored by my classmates, but then I started getting bullied. A lot. My mom taught 5-8th grade English (classes were combined bc school was so small.) My intelligence and my weight were picked on quite a bit. My hair too. My mom would get mad about my hair too. She has straight hair. Mine is curly. She didn't teach me how to take care of curly hair and actually did more damage to it with what she told me to do. She called my hair a rats nest quite a few times. I wasn't ever overweight, just slightly plump and higher on the average side. most of the girls at my school were actually underweight and I honestly hope they were all ok. Still, the boys especially would call me unattractive. My mom knew I was being bullied in her class. She didn't realize the extent until weeks before I graduated, but she knew no one liked me. She didn't do anything bc she knew the parents would throw a fit bc she needed to treat all of her students equally. She never acknowledged it though. She never pulled me aside and said she saw what was going on. I know she knew. I just wish she would have let me know. I was pulled from lots of school events so it wouldn't look like she was picking me bc I was her daughter. I thought I didn't get parts in school plays bc my voice was terrible or my acting was bad. Nope. I found out later it was because she didn't want to make other parents mad, which was kinda funny bc the parents actually like me and would talk to me during other events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 - **Isolation**. My parents, bc of their work, wouldn't take me to friends house when I was really young (like 7 to 8.) Before attending kindergarten I had hardly spent time with other kids my age, which is why I ended up getting bullied at my first school and it's why I transferred to the private school. Although, I didn't know it was weird. I thought hanging out with friends after school was irresponsible, at least I convinced myself it was. It wasn't until I was speaking with the school counselor at my HS in 11th grade (junior) that I realized how weird this was. He was concerned about my mental health. I had transferred to a public HS after spending two years at a very large private HS, so he was already weirded out as to why someone like me would leave an elite school and go to a pretty less than successful public school.  He asked me what I did everyday. I told him I would wake up, hop on the bus, go to school, hop back on the house, get home and spend a few hours cleaning, cook dinner, sleep for an hour, wake up and do hw and then work on my graphic design commission that I was doing for my dad's business, and then I would draw. I didn't mention that by then it was normally past midnight when I finally started to wind down but he knew that I had (still have) bad insomnia and I had to take medication. His face confused me. He asked if I ever hung out with friends, went on walks, went shopping, etc. I said no. My parents would yell at me if I didn't do my chores. It was a this point that my mental state fell apart for about the third time. I was in an awful state beginning of freshman year. I was recovering sophomore year but my twin almost died several times due to heart failure so that messed me up and taught me that a lot of people don't care about  your problems. I don't want to believe that's true, but that's all I can figure at this point.                                                                                                                                                                                          
**-Responsibility**. This is pretty straight forward but I was expected to do a lot. My parents actually considered me to be their favorite kid next to my older bro. I know this bc they confirmed this when my siblings asked. Kinda mean but ok. I was the favorite bc I was extremely obedient. I just didn't want to get yelled at.  My dad lost his lawyer license or whatever and took up coding (i'm actually proud of him for acting fast and adapting.) He started asking me to help him with things. I was about 13. I said sure, I already did art all the time, I could help. He did pay me (not as much as what I would get if I worked for another company but I still appreciated having money) . At first it was small things but then it started becoming things that really should have been done with someone with a degree. I was only 15 at this point and if you've ever heard of Adobe Creative Cloud applications. Yeah. I had to learn all of those by myself. Keep in mind that with my extreme isolation I was really being introduced to social media for the first time in 2013. I had no idea about anything. I hardly knew what youtube was. I did figure everything out though and I will say I'm happy to have learned those programs (and I got new equipment), but.. ultimately it did a lot of harm to my mental state and social life. Most teenagers in their first job, well their boss doesn't have to worry about investors and stock and conventions and presentations and extremely tight deadlines. My bosses did ( I had multiple at the same time. my dad was commissioned too and I was hired by him  through my bosses.) I should have spoken up and said I didn't want to do the work anymore. But I was too scared and at that point I had isolated myself so much that I had no connection anywhere else. (I lost most my friends and had no car bc no one taught me how to drive plus couldn't afford one.) I ended up with skills I didn't want and at the end of it... I was never credited for any of my work. No one knows it was me. Yeah Walmart. I did those stupid slides you liked so much.                                                                                                                                                                              - **I didn't want to be what they wanted**. I'll make this one short. I wanted (and still want) to be a comic book artist (I know the industry is kinda dying that's why I want to help revive it). I've told them that. I have been ridiculed quite a bit. They can comment of my messy hair, my uneven eyeliner, my clothes that somehow have holes in them ( i need new clothes but they are kinda expensive) and at this point those comments hurt but I can eventually get over it. They could have shown me how to be more put together but they didn't and I don't blame them, I kinda blame me but I'm still teaching myself stuff. Anyway, I also taught myself everything I know about art and holy goodness I'm very passionate about my art. It' something I take a lot of pride in even when I feel like my art isn't good enough, it's my art.  I made it. My parents wanted me to be a painter at first and pain renaissance style paintings. That wasn't tooo bad to fight through. What was bad was I almost started my own animation company. I actually had everything planned out. All the estimates, connections, and had potential investors. I actually worked as an animator for a time. my dad was very proud. But then I realized, I had skipped an entire year of high school to start college early so I could run a business I didn't want? Nope. I dropped out of college after only one semester and looked towards studying abroad. It was one of the first times my dad directly tell me he was disappointed. No side comments or lengthy sentences around it to try and spare my feelings. Dad, I was seventeen, eighteen now. I don't want to be sad anymore.                                                                                                                       *-good things they've done. They aren't bad people. I think so at least. Here are some things good things they've done that  appreciate. my dad helped me get my first job outside of his work. I may work as a dishwasher, but I honestly couldn't ask for anything better. I'm so grateful and my boss cares about me a lot. She bought me a mini cake for my late HS graduation (I graduated a year early but wasn't celebrating until the rest of my class graduated...so I waited a year.)tbh I cried. My mom and I have become much more tolerant towards each other. After i changed my style a little bit she commented less about it and now she thinks most of my stuff is pretty cute. She recently bought me shoes with grumpy cat on them. it was super sweet (i needed new shoes too the soles were coming off ooof). She's much sweeter now. Definitely doesn't yell much anymore. They tell me that they love me almost every day. that's more than some kids get I know. they taught me my religion the right way. It had some bumps but eventually the lesson ""love everyone, no matter who"" stuck with me and I'm glad. I think that was super important. I never went a day without food or clean clothes. My needs were always taken care of. Not my parents, but my siblings and I are all very close. It helps*                                                                                                                                                                                      \-**I want to leave all of this behind I want to move on and focus on things I want to do, but i don't know how**. I don't know how to let go of my negative thoughts about me. I feel like I should address my parents about this but they haven't ever said anything. I know they've made me upset, but have they actually done stuff that is wrong? I feel hurt and want to forgive them but if they've done nothing wrong then what am I doing? **I'm already in counseling and it's been very good**,  but if I want to study abroad then I must..must get over this constant fear I'm sorry the advice is so broad, and it's ok if you don't have any to give.

96,"I’ve recently gotten out of a very toxic and harmful relationship. I lived with him in a very dilapidated and gross house, and it caused many fights and arguments. I broke things off with him because he told me so many evil and hateful things that absolutely broke me to my core, things dealing with my previous rape and assault right before I got with him. My family didn’t believe me when I explained the extent of the verbal and mental abuse I suffered with him, so going home to them was not an option. I moved to my state’s capital to stay with my other ex since I had nowhere to go and no longer felt safe anywhere near him. 

At first, I was happy here. I had a clean bed to sleep in, I had hot water, a clean kitchen, and just everything in general is much better. But for the past two weeks, I’ve grown antsy here. I dread him touching me, I don’t want to be around him, and I just feel really out of place here. I don’t have a job yet, I have more or less a couple hundred dollars to my name, poor credit, and only own my clothes and my cat. 

I’ve always wanted to live in the west, specifically in Colorado. The deep south state that i live in is one i absolutely loathe being in. My town is very very violent, full of religiously hateful people. I’m bisexual and mostly liberal. I don’t feel safe here in the slightest. 

I know i’m not healed from my last relationship in the slightest. I don’t know who I am as a person, or what I truly love. Me being here with him, I know, will not help me grow. 
In colorado, I have a friend (NB21) who has offered me to come stay with them and their family in the upcoming months, but not immediately due to some money issues. They used to live here in my state and went to school with me. I know them very well and stay in contact with them daily. Regardless, They work a minimum wage job but just accepted a side job that pays twice as much and wants to hold on until they get enough under their belt to have us some money secured to get an apartment on their own.
Do I wait and work for a few months and save up everything I can? I don’t pay rent, nor does he let me pay for anything unless it’s not needed. 

I know I need money to move. I need a job, currently have applied to five in this area, but I don’t know what else to do. I have nowhere to go to in this area. How do I even talk to my ex about this? How do I even tell him that I made a mistake by jumping into something so soon and without a clear head? I want to tell him how I really feel but I have really severe anxiety and this whole situation has kept me sick to my stomach for days. I have not a single clue as to how to start all of this. I just know I want to start my life over far far far away from here. 

I’m so sorry if this sounds so jumbled and weird. My thoughts are pretty much all over the place and I haven’t been feeling or sleeping very well. I feel like I need to add to this that my NB friend’s second job pays $1000 a week and they said that they could very easily get me a spot there, almost 99% guaranteed. 

TL;DR I left a toxic and abusive relationship and had nowhere else to go so I moved in with another ex. I realized it was very stupid of me to do so and now want to move to another part of the country to start my life over. I have a friend who is willing to let me live with them in a couple month’s time and can easily find me a decent job there.",30Jun2019,1
97,"I was asked to do this by my counselor well here goes.....

Almost a year ago i reconnected with a guy from my past. Matter of fact 5 years to be exact. The first time we met it was short and sweet we didnt remain friends long. So as i was coming home from a trip with my son he hits me up through a social media site i was using he had remembered things from the past and he would bring them up in conversation which weirded me out because i didn't recognize him at all. So we continued to talk for a long time he invited me over i was hesitant at first but i went we got friendly a little too friendly and we had sex...this was not my intention as i told him that. Well we kinda got close after that as in spending a lot of time with each other spending the nights together cooking for each other buying things for each other you name it we did it. With all this being done i started having real feelings for him but never told him. I met his mother (twice she loves me for some reason) i met his cousin and two of his aunties. To make it clear we were not in a relationship we were just friends. So back in feb he started wanting to go to dallas which was cool he would go for the weekend just to get away from his life situations. I thought nothing of it so he went again in march this time he stays longer this time. So having a conversation with him he reveals that he was thinking about getting into a relationship i was like great then he reveals to me it was someone from his past (a young lady from his past). i was pissed...it broke me into pieces...so one day in an emotional outburst i told him how i really felt about him i told him i loved him and i wanted to be his but he said to me boldly i just dont feel that way about you i only see you as a friend my best friend. After that our friendship became rocky...no more phone calls (we use to talk for hours on the phone all times of the night) we text it usually a good morning text and a text here and there through out the day. No more seeing each other only occasionally. He recently told me that he was moving to dallas and has transferred his job as well. During this time i have been going to counseling because this has opened wounds for me and i didnt know how to handle it. I told another good friend of mine that i still had feelings for him and he  suggested i tell him i told him i couldnt cause the fear of rejection. to shorten this story i have wrote this young man a letter telling him we can no longer be friends that the lines of communication will be cut off i told him that i still loved him in more ways than many and i needed to let go. I plan on giving him this letter in a few weeks but my counselor say i should do it like now and get it done with she says that this is damaging me emotionally and mentally.

98,"I'm a middle eastern/Iranian teenager living in Brooklyn, New York.

My uncle made an insulated cat house out of plywood, and I offered to put siding on it to keep it weathertight and to match our houses.

105,"So around early March, I had a bad cold, possibly sinus infection. It last longer than usual, almost two weeks. I had all the cold symptoms under the sun. But normally I heal quickly.

In the weeks following, my sense of smell and taste lagged longer than usual. I started regaining stronger tastes and smells like tomato sauce and pineapple juice. Still cant smell or taste subtle things. But then I started getting this weird ""gasoline"" smell whenever I experienced a new odor. For example, when I entered a new room.

Last week, I went to an ENT specialist, who didn't seem that concerned. He looked up my nose and said I have some swelling, so he prescribed me prednisone for a week and told me to return in two weeks.

My medication ended today, and I no longer get the gasoline smell BUT a faint weird ""popcorn"" scent in almost everything. My sense of smell is still pretty weak, but my taste has returned about 70% overtime. I read about phantosmia and am afraid I may have gained that permanently.

110,"So my friend recently told me that she's pregnant and getting married to her new boyfriend. I was surprised because they've only been together a few months, but I'm happy for her and she seems excited to start this new chapter of her life. 

The problem is that before she started dating her now fiance, me and her were together, and had been dating for 5 1/2 years. We broke up around January, so not that long ago. We're both over our past relationship and just see each other as purely friends. However shes told me that she feels bad whenever we hang out because it feels like she's being dishonest / sneaking around her fiances back. we just have dinner and talk about our weeks like once a week. When i asked if she would rather us not hang out anymore, she said she enjoys it when we hang out and has a good time, and that she really doesn't have any other friends. 

But With her recently becoming pregnant, shes definitely not going to have as much time to meet.

Normally, I wouldn’t haven’t a problem with it because it’s her coping mechanism, but I feel as though it’s hindering her productivity. For one, she stays up all night watching this show, so she’s always late getting up and, consequently, late for work almost every day. The house is a mess, and when I ask for her help to clean it, she throws a fit. We both work five days a week; however, she works two additional hours per day (9 hours in total). I would understand her being tired, but in comparison, my job is more physically and mentally demanding... Yet, I still have energy to run errands and take care of the house and whatever else I need to do. She puts any responsibilities off on me in order to make more time for her show.

115,"I’ve taken a bunch of planes before, when I was younger. I do have memories of eventually being relaxed on flights, but I also have memories of being incredibly anxious on each flight. It gives me a vertigo type feeling. 

I’ve been trying to prepare myself by looking over my balcony (12th floor... tough for me.), but even that makes me feel like the ground beneath my feet is weak, makes me dizzy, screws up my depth perception, and gives me such crazy butterflies that I feel nauseous. That feeling gives me such anxiety, and I’m worried about having a complete panic attack on the plane. 

The flight will be about 6 hours long I believe (well, the first one will be about 30 minutes, two flights both ways.). 

Has anyone else felt this nervous about flying? What can I do to help myself? Do I just have to power through the flight? I am prescribed lorazepam for when I have panic attacks... will that be enough to get me through the flight, do you think? 

*The logical part of me is completely aware that planes are safer than cars. When I began having anxiety about the flight, i researched all of that. That’s not what’s giving me anxiety. It’s literally just the fact that I’m in the air. The closest feeling I can compare it to is in the “Get Smart” movie when he accidentally ejects himself out of the airplane bathroom.

Anyways - fast forward we had an argument about it and he told me that he views me as an object, and that he doesn't want ""friends with benefits"" just ""benefits"" and only wants me for sx and that he wants to talk to me like any other girl he knows. So basically he wants to use me as a toy. He kept on saying that he knows he sounds like such an idiot but that's just what he wanted. He feels bad about it now but I just feel so stupid that I lost my virginity to him when I didn't really know his true true intentions. Like I want to be the friends with benefits but he could at least treat me with a little bit of respect afterwards and not treat me like shit? I just feel so disrespected because everyone was telling me he was a genuine guy and I don't know. Like I have a brain and thoughts, not just a vagina. Like, I don't understand. He said he's going to message me today to sort it out but I doubt that he will. I just feel so grimy and disgusting that I let it happen. Like, the first time was supposed to be special you know? He also kept on saying that ""you're not the girl for me"" ""i would never date you"". Like okay I get that but you can atl east treat me with respect - because it's so different for a girl, like I could get pregnant. Should I still go through with it, or am I overreacting about the whole situation? Please help, I'm so stuck.

122,"I consider myself fairly knowledgeable on the current issues of the U.S and what I think is the solution. If you go to my reddit account, you'll be able to find the debates I had with other redditors, and that I've done well in those online debates. 

However, in real life, I'm absolutely terrible at debating in real life. There's a few reasons why I think so: 

1. I'm generally a calm, passive person with terrible social awareness. Socially, whenever I want to ""get out of my shell"", it almost always falls flat. My jokes don't land, my voice control isn't appropriate, my timing is always off, and my physical movement is awkward. So, knowing what tone of voice, what gestures to make, when should I get loud are unknown to me. I wasn't taught these things when I should've been, and now, it bit me in the ass.
2.  I can't fact check my opponent on the spot and my opponents don't believe the facts I give. What I usually do when I get into political confrontations in real life, I tell them to debate through text/social media. Because if they do, I can fact check and pick apart everything they post, which I simply can't do in real life. I've caught people lying through their damn teeth by first being confronted in real life, telling them to debate me on social media, and fact checking their statement. 
3. I'm a slow thinker. When arguing political philosophy, I like to think about my argument with the unlimited time I have on social media. But I don't have the ability to multitask to stall my opponent while I deeply think about the argument(I hate using anecdotal evidence/comparisons and I almost always call my opponent out on it, even in real life). When I debate in real life, I don't even think about what I'm saying, and ultimately, say something stupid, in which case, I'm railed against. 
4. I have trouble with this even in online debates, but I can't identify logical fallacies quickly. I don't know if it's because I'm not intelligent or I didn't ""practice"" enough. And then I don't call it out, and I fall for their trap. 

Every. Single. Time. I attempt to debate someone in person, even though they are so easy to obliterate online. I always seem to lose and fall flat, and I have a million things in my head that I could've said within 2 seconds after the conversation ended. 

So, am I completely screwed? Should I study the facts more? Is there a secret about debating that I'm not aware of? 

Thank you for responding in advance.",30Jun2019,1
123,"My dad has stage 4 cancer but has been living a fairly independent life since diagnosis a few years ago (working part time, driving around a lot, keeping up with hobbies). Two weeks ago, he was admitted to the hospital because of trouble breathing. His condition has spiraled downward since then and he has been unconscious most of the time. He was very close to death only a few days ago due to infection, sepsis and pneumonia, but it has actually improved slightly since then. 

We had a very candid talk with doctors today. They said the best case scenario would be him surviving after a long hospital stay and moving into a rehab facility as he regains his strength. He will need continued treatment, it may be invasive and it may be painful, and we have no idea if we he would be at the same level of being able to talk/walk/do things as he used to. He will likely still pass in a few months if he survived the hospital stay due to his cancer.

The second option, as my family is religious (not Christianity), is to take him off life support tomorrow, which happens to be a very ""holy"" day in my family's religion. This would minimize pain and suffering, as he is currently not in pain/is sedated and would be merciful if something like a painful heart attack or stroke happened. He would likely not wake up in those final moments after taking off life support and if he did, he would be completely confused and out of it given that he has been sedated for over two weeks.

His directive says he wants to keep kept on life support in the case of serious brain injury that would render him unconscious. He also wrote that he wants to be given CPR at all costs - even against doctor recommendation. He marked that he has no religious/spiritual preferences. He wrote that the most important things to him are seeing his children (me and two other siblings) grow and succeed.

We (the family) never had a talk with him about death before this happened. We think he never expected to not be able to communicate if his cancer got worse and if he was on his deathbed, and we never got any closure from him or were able to say last words to him because he was sedated/out of it once he got to the hospital. We decided to keep him on life support as long as possible to see if he can pull through because we think this would have wanted. I think we're all feeling bad because we don't know 100% if that's true and if he would have rather gone peacefully, but we agreed that he would be the type to fight through the pain and procedures if it meant a few more months with family, including his teenage daughter, and based on the wishes he expressed in his directive.

I’m looking for advice that would help me cope and improve my mentality and happiness in moving forward. 

So recently I got a haircut. I absolutely love it. It’s short, and stereotypically for males, but I went for it since I was curious, and I have the mindset that my hair will grow back anyways. Around here, many have the stigma that short hair females = lesbians. I’m not lesbian but my family came back from their vacation and they absolutely hate it.

Short story, I am apparently an embarrassment to them their whole life, and this tops it off because I look lesbian and they don’t want to be seen with me. I used the little money I earned from when I accompanied music students to get this haircut and they made fun of me and literally laughed saying “Oh you have money?, I pay for everything else.” I’ve respected their money, and lived frugally as best as I can with it, but the fact they made fun of me for it. Not the best feeling in the world. 

I’m also taking a summer class, and they brought it up again. They mocked me for not passing Calculus 2 the first time and that I was dumb.

I’m not suicidal, I do have a little sibling that I’m determined to support in whatever endeavors they have when they’re older. 

I wonder when did haircuts determine a person’s gender/sexuality. 

All in all, my only plan right now is to avoid them all of next week and come home late everyday so I won’t have to see them.

138,"I want to start by saying, I know my mother loves us.  I don’t not think she’s a bad parent. I genuinely believe this all started from a place of concern. 

Six years ago, I moved out and two hours away four days after I graduated high school, leaving my three younger sibling with my mother and our stepdad. A year and a half later, when my youngest sisters (twins) were finishing third grade, another threatened to kill one of them. This went on for months before my sister said anything, and it caused her to have anxiety episodes, which triggered her asthma. The asthma attacks were bad enough that she’d end up in the hospital because we couldn’t get her O2 high enough. She missed the last half of school.  Our gp gave my mother a note excusing her. My mom and the doctor believed the best thing for my sister was to pull her from school for the next year to do homeschooling. 
Everything started out fine, but the twin who was still in school started to decline. Mom was concerned, so she pulled her too and started “homeschooling” them both. 

Again, everything started out fine. But over the last 6 years the homeschooling will go on for a month or two and then stop for six. They’re socially behind. Educationally behind. They can’t read or write past a fourth grade reading level.  They’re 14 now and the initial twin wants to go but is scared to “because I will have a third grade education as a high schooler and no one will want to be friends with me”.  Guys. They’re supposed to take the permit test next year. I don’t know that they could even read it. 

We’ve mentioned to my mother that isn’t working but she shuts down anytime it’s brought up. “They’re fine, they’re fine. They’re testing above grade level.” I don’t know if she sees how far this has gone and is ashamed or genuinely doesn’t see how serious this is. 

I don’t know what to do. I know them going back to school needs to happen immediately, but they’re behind enough that I’m afraid DFS will be contacted...that there’s a risk of the girls being put in emergency placement.

I daydream a lot... Well more daynightmares I always have these terrible thoughts about what could happen potentially and what I would do in said scenario. For example, If I am at say the grocery store I imagine what I'd do if there was an active shooter. Some seem more realistic than others.

Anyways after hearing about the music festival I immediately thought: ""I could go with A."" But this daynightmare popped into my head. What if this terrible man came up and started harassing A? We are both fairly young, and she is a pretty young woman. It made me sick. In my mind I figured I'd call this guy out. Unfortunately I am not tall, I am big, and nor am I strong.

148,"Hey everyone,

I recently decided to take a new job offer.  I was not actively looking to leave my previous one, but had the opportunity come my way from an old co-worker.

My previous job is the ultimate comfortable job:  great salary, senior position with freedom in day to day work, great work-life balance, unlimited PTO, can work from home as much as I desire, excellent manager who I am still friends with.

I decided to take the new job offer, which requires me to start from the bottom again.  I took it because I felt it would lead to better opportunities, given a management team that seems to care about progression and the company itself is in hyper growth mode.  It would certainly be much more stressful in terms of the volume of work, as well as having to prove myself all over again.

It was a difficult decision.  I've had a month off between these jobs, and I've come to the realization that what I truly wanted was a comfortable job so that I could enjoy my personal life, which is a bit in shambles from previous stressful jobs.  I especially feel this way as I just begin to enter my 30s.  I feel I made the decision to leave based on a constant guiding philosophy I had in my 20s to continually seek out ways to progress my career and always be going to better places.  However, I'm feeling right now that this is not longer a valid philosophy for myself and is a quick road to burnout.

With this new realization, I have entered a pit of depression, and I completely lack energy to do anything.  With my previous job, upon reaching seniority and having a great new manager, I was finally feeling like my job was not a chore to go to and was feeling considerably less stress day to day.  Instead of staying, I listened to the societal pressure of seeking more money and prestige, and I find that I've abandoned considerable freedom.  I am completely dreading my new job for this reason.

How do I stay positive here?  I have a good relationship with my previous manager, so shall I try to return there?  I can't help but feel despair and immense regret.  I'd like to hear any similar experiences that others had, and what they did/how it turned out.",30Jun2019,1
149," 

Hey I'm at my wits end here and was hoping to get an outsiders perspective on my situation. Like the title says I have suspicions that my friend might be bi and maybe into me. But she is so set that she's a hardcore lesbian which is why I haven't really tried to make a move to not make things weird. I met her at work(Target), we didn't kick it off immediately but after a couple of weeks of seeing each other at work she randomly stopped by my department one day and started talking to me. I thought it was a little weird because if our manager caught her in the wrong department talking to me it would've meant a lot of trouble for both of us. After this interaction I noticed she would linger around my area and would randomly poke me when she would pass by me. I mean to me these are signs that this girl probably likes me, but after we started hanging out outside of work I found out that she is a lesbian that is ""only into girls"". I moved on from the idea that she's into me until we got drunk and she said ""If I was straight I would date you."" I should've made a move then but I didn't because she was intoxicated and I didn't want to feel like a rapist or something. But when she sobered up she denied being attracted to me. Fast forward a year later and our relationship has gone through so much shit. I've hurt her she's hurt me but we're still very good friends and I feel like we are very close because of how much we have gone through. I feel a connection with her and I know she feels it too but she's really focused on dating girls and ignores what we have. Everyone at works thinks we are a couple just by the way we are with each other. I'm basically like a boyfriend to her. We go out to movies and restaurants a lot where I usually pay for most of the outing. I fix her car, help her with her homework, I'm there when she's sick or when she's having a bad hangover from drinking too much the previous night. Like I'm trying to show her that I really care about her and maybe we're more than just a friendship but she still denies the idea that she might be bi like being 100% gay is such a big part of her that if it were to change its like her whole identity would change or something. I feel like there is something more I could be doing just not sure what. Or I could just be crazy along with everyone else at my workplace that thinks that she's secretly into me but is denying it. I feel like im wasting my time trying to crack her but I really don't feel like there are other girls in my life that I connect with the same way I connect with this girl. How should I proceed guys?

150,"I have had days of being unable to sleep, and now im starting to feel anxious and dizzy every day. I am also annoyed because my family are making it worse and I need to calm down before I explode on them, because right now im so wound up I cant fall back asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the worst room in the house, its faces the sunrise so everytime the sun comes up it beats down on it and with this british heatwave, my room becomes unbearably hot, it has the poorest curtains so a  lot of light gets into the room.

&amp;#x200B;

Im not supposed to be in this room, me and my family agreed that I use it for 1 year, and then my sister for 1 year and we rotate on that basis, of course when the time came, my sister and mother decided nope, it wasnt fair to switch because shes used to the better room.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents room is on the same floor as mine and my dad has had a few days off work, so that means drinking more, so he falls asleep on the sofa every evening for 3 hours and then cant sleep all night, so he walks around and slams doors like the bathroom one in his sleepy state and it shocks me into waking up multiple times in the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Its happened twice now tonight, its 5 am and ive had maybe 2 and a half hours sleep, im feeling so annoyed, too anxious to sleep, I just wanted to unload and get some advice for how to fall back to sleep in this hot and irritated state.",30Jun2019,1
151," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",30Jun2019,0
152,"I've known my boyfriend for half a year, but we just started dating about a month ago. I thought I knew him extremely well. I should probably also mention that we met online through a mutual friend. He told me the following things about himself. For privacy reasons, we'll call him H.

* H's parents gave him up for adoption. His mother left him on the streets when he was two, and his father killed himself.
* He has had multiple friends who have killed themselves, and has even witnessed one of their deaths. 
* He found his two cats on the streets when he was six.
* He dropped out of high school to do tafe courses (He lives in Australia and is 17). He also has chronic depression.

I've met H's mum a few times before tonight, which is when I figured out. The conversation topic changed from his hometown to his pets. Out of curiosity, just because I'm always paranoid about liars (And he's lied about stupid stuff before), I asked his mum how they ended up getting his pets, and she told me a completely different story. Obviously, I asked him about this, and he told me that he lies to seem interesting to people. When I asked him if he had lied about anything else, he told me that he was never adopted, he's never known anyone that's committed suicide, and when he replies to comments on reddit, he tells some people that he's either an adult in college or that he's seventeen. When I ask him about this, he tells me he only lies about his age so people take him more seriously. 

He's crying on the phone with me right now, telling me that he's sorry and that he can't control his bad habit of lying. I told him if he ever lied to me again that I'd be done with him, and he told me that he doesn't know if he can control it. I'm obviously hurt right now (And extremely confused). I love him. I knew I have since I met him, but right now I don't know what else he's lying about. What do I do?

157,"I met him through work. He used to work there, it was my first week, and we hit it off. I didn't know how old he was for a while, I assumed around 18 or 19 based on his behavior. I didn't find out he was 23 until he'd already slept with me once (both of us drunk).

He ended up getting me extremely drunk and high and sleeping with me (with and without consent) multiple times throughout the summer (probably between 10 and 15 times?). He was also drunk or high every time we hung out and would drive like that. He would never tell me where we were going and I didn't know how to drive or get home by myself at that point. 

He was incredibly manipulative. He would gaslight me and ghost me as well as lie to my face about anything and everything. He was a skilled liar, I still have no idea what was actually true about what he told me. I am good friends with an ex of his and she had the same experience plus he physically and emotionally abused her. He never hit me or got physical, but did leave me relying on him to supply alcohol and Adderall (I was not addicted but did come close).

I do not want police involved, nor do I want my parents involved much (they know about everything, this happened last year and they want to move past it). Should I try to reach out to his parents and family and let them know? I'm mostly concerned for any future partners he might have. His parents know about his drinking and put him in a sober house at one point. My friend (his ex) told his parents about the abuse she suffered at his hands. Is there any point in me sharing my story too or is it best to forget about it and move on?

172,"Alright, guys, I need some help and this is a long story so brace yourselves

Disclaimer: I know a lot of this is unnecessary but I feel that It's important to know the context

...

I'm a 14-year-old male in high school

Last year, there was this girl in my music class

I didn't notice her at all as it was a  class of 30 and I knew no one

Until one day she approached me and was somewhat fangirling over my past achievements (I'm in the top 25 in the school of 2500 for academics)

At the time, I was a really different guy, I was really dense and didn't catch on to the fact that well, she was flirting with me

I didn't think much of her at the time as I was just a bit of a depressed anti-social dude who was just drowning in books and studying

Anyways, music class was only for the first half of the year, so I now no longer had any mutual classes with her, not that I cared at the time, I only talked to her like 4 or 5 times there anyways and it was always her starting the conversation :joy: 

So I kind of forgot about her

Until about one week afterward, I was walking down the main corridor to my locker to get some books I needed

And I see some random stranger make eye contact with me, I had no clue who it was

Until... she smiled, and I instantly knew who it was, the same girl from music class

Not only that... I fell in love, for the first time in my life

A lot of stress was put on me at the time, but that smile was so warm and genuine the whole day that was all I thought about

...

So... that happened on a Friday, and on the following Sunday I decided, I needed to talk to her

I knew her email as it's in the school system, so I asked for her discord and stuff

That day we talked for 6 whole hours straight... it was the nicest feeling ever

And I talked to her quite a bit for the next few months, however, it was only ever online

Then it started to get a bit boring... I thought she might be getting a bit annoyed so I messaged her less and less

To the point where it became like monthly... or less

...

So I manned up and 2 months ago I confessed my love, I told her what she meant to me, without asking her out

So she said it's ok, and we can still stay friends (I was afraid I was going to be blocked instantly)

This girl I later realised is pretty popular among the boys

She even called herself a boy magnet once lol

So I was happy about that, that I didn't lose her as a friend too

But then her best friend talked about it with me

And idk it was just the way that she was talking, that made me feel like she was pissed, or annoyed

I asked and she said that she wasn't pissed (I asked both her and her friend)

But somehow, I felt that she was, and a lot of my friends just called me insecure for that

No joke, my friends betted money

One dude betted $20 that she won't talk to me again by the end of the term (There were 7 weeks left)

And I thought, if she doesn't, then she probably won't talk to me again

So I made sure I didn't message her first, I only waited for her

A month went by, and I was beginning to think that maybe I'm not a genuine friend to her

Maybe she's just replying because she's a really nice girl (and she really is)

Maybe I'm just an insignificant bug to her

...

But then I got a message from her

And we talked for a while that day, catching up on a month's worth of gossip

She told me how I'm one of her closest friends, which made me feel good

This was last week btw

...

So after that, it was just like a few messages every few days or so

But then two days ago, we had another nice talk

A 3-hour talk

And I could sense it, it wasn't cuz she was being nice

She wanted to genuinely talk with me

I got nostalgic feelings for the past

It felt great

But then mid-conversation, there was a minute or two of silence

And I thought maybe she just got bored and started doing her own thing

But she wasn't... she was preparing herself

You know how on discord it tells you when someone is typing?

Well it didn't show for this message... because she copied and pasted it

She wrote it in notepad or something and checked for mistakes

Before pasting it

She said ""Hey you ever want to go watch a movie or something in the holidays? :))""

I stared at that for a whole minute before I decided to respond

I didn't know what to say, and literally, all I said was ""Uhhh""

Then she started explaining how she really wanted to talk to me in real life

As I've said like 4 sentences to her verbally

So I'm like sure why not... if you want to?

She was surprised, she thought I would say no because it would be awkward

I just said ""If it means I can be a better friend to you, that's a small price to pay""

Her response? ""😭 Omg THANK YOU 😊""

I really felt warm inside after that

...

Now... here's where I need help

This may not be a big deal to most of you

But it is to me, as I have no social skills whatsoever

If I try and talk to any girl around my age, I freeze

This happens almost daily at school, even when I have friends around me

A female tries to talk to me, and I don't know what to say

And instinctively, I act very disinterested and bored of the conversation

Except I have one female friend who I'm very close to who I can talk to freely

And that's because she's told me about this, and helped me overcome it

Whereas other females just leave the conversation thinking I don't like talking to them

But I really do like talking to people, and I'm an expert at it online

It's just in real life that I'm a bit weak at it

Soooo now I'm gonna go watch a movie with a girl, 1 on 1

Who I have hardly talked to irl

If I freeze with the females in the class, who I have been in the same class with for a year and a half

I can't even imagine how I'm gonna react to a 1 on 1 situation

So, I need your help everyone

What are some tips, to avoid making everything awkward

What can I do to ensure the conversation runs smoothly and we both enjoy the day?

Any help, and I mean ANY help would be appreciated

Please... I'm very very very desperate

Thanks in advance everyone

I was raised in a very Catholic family with an older brother 6 years older, and a sister 4 years older. My childhood was very sheltered, I was surrounded by other so-called perfect families, I didn't meet someone with divorced parents until I was 9 and was homeschooled until last year. We have a family friend that was from Houston, and I never understood how we knew him but I just assumed he was a neighborhood boy or something, since my grandpa who we visit lives in Dallas. A few years ago, he and his wife moved to Atlanta not too far from us so we visited them often. They now have 3 little kids so we go over to play with them sometimes.   


Last night my mom explained to me that after high school she took a gap year and was in a serious relationship and got pregnant and found a place near where she was going to go for college to help with her pregnancy and adoption for the child. She eventually had a closed adoption, and went on to college. But years after, they found each other through facebook.

179,"Long story short: I graduated in social sciences but now I've decided to change and go into bio-chem.

I've done bio and chemistry courses so far with no issues. All that's left are math and physics courses, however I am not only terrible at math but I also haven't done maths since high school.

I have 3 math courses to take: Differential Calculus, Integral Calculus and Vector Calculus.

I was told to take Differential first, as it was the easiest and it would help to understand Integral Calculus.

I now have 2 months ahead of me and I want to get ready as much as possible to face this challenge.

What I'd like to know is what topics should I start studying in order to prepare myself for differential calculus? 

Note that (for various reasons), I don't have any alternatives, so I can't take other math courses or whatnot. I am inevitably doing Differentials starting in 2 months.

The closest thing that I remember doing is solving quadratic polynomials with completing the square method and some *a(x - h)2+ k* equations, if that helps you situate my level.

Given the very short time I'm given, I'd like to focus on what is directly used in Differential Calculus and skip over what won't be of any use.

What topics do I absolutely need to start studying? Quadratic functions? Factorization of polynomials? Logarithmic functions? etc.",30Jun2019,3

It’s ruining the group dynamic.” I did stop flirting with here. Don’t get me wrong we still had our private hang outs but we kept them private. Skip one year to this summer and now Smith and Sammy are dating. I always thought he had a crush on her but this just blind sided me. Now I’m only here for two weeks this summer and our whole group rarely hangs out bc smith and Sammy and dating now. They’ve withdrawn themselves and I just wanna hang out with my friends. Any advice as to what to say or do?",30Jun2019,1
185,"I’ve posted this on the r/life thread aswell, I’m just trying to cast a wide net and get as many peoples opinions as possible. 

I've posted little things about this before in the past but I'm going to make this a longer post and really break everything down.

I'll be a senior in high school this year. I'm 17, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. I know that I know nothing about life, love, careers, etc. 

I'll start with what really slapped me across the face and gave me a dose of reality. I was always a really big introvert and never really had friends. My sophomore year of high school I became amazing friends with this new group of people. For the rest of 10th grade we did everything together. Towards the end of that summer I developed feelings for one of my friends sister and she developed feelings for me. Long story short we ended up dating but then drama started with our group so I stopped talking to my girlfriends brother. He blamed her for it and he would constantly yell at her and berate her and tell her it's all her fault and just scream horrible obscenities at her. Even though I loved her I felt like I had to let her go so she could be at peace with her family. She lost her dad and her mom had breast cancer and I didn't want to be the reason for the family not getting along. So I broke up with her. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. I missed her so much and I still do. Only recently her brother and I have started chatting again. He apologized and admitted that he was wrong and was the one at fault here. He said he didn't know how to handle losing a friend and took it out on her. Of course I was pissed because I had to let a girl go that I loved in order for that family to be at peace. I wasn't going to yell at him for it, I forgave him because he had the balls to admit that he was wrong. She's in another relationship now with a kid that isn't really that great for her. I know that sounds bad coming from me because im the ex but he's really an idiot and doesn't respect her. He get's drunk all the time and is a huge JUUL fiend. They fight all the time but she still sticks with him and I can't help but feel responsible. Sure I wasn't the greatest boyfriend ever to her. It was my 1st relationship so I didn't know what I was doing but I still care about her. 

I told her all of this over the phone recently and she gave me the courtesy of listening to me. I told her how sorry I was that this all happened and that I still care about her and have feelings for her. I know that may have been a scummy thing to do but I felt like I had to get everything out of me to be at peace. Since the breakup I've tried really hard to work on myself. I take cold showers and get up everyday at 5:30 and go to the gym. During the day I work and when I come home I try and eat a healthy dinner and I try to read for an hour. I'm trying to become a better man. I constantly watch Alan watts videos and Elisha Long videos. I try to put all of that into practice. When I was on the phone with her I told her that I know this is all high school but I still really want a second chance with her to prove that I've changed. She said she understands but tried to explain to me that she's just some girl and that she's super proud of the work I've done but she said she is very happy with her life right now. I told her I understand and wouldn't bother her ever again. 

However, Her brother wants me to come over and hang out again but I just simply can't. I'd be too emotional and her boyfriend would freak out. I see his side of things I'd be pretty pissed too if I was him, that's why I'm not going to drive a wedge between them. He's a pretty hot headed guy, he fights people over the dumbest stuff. He pushed a kid up against a locker because he said hi to his girlfriend. One thing that really upset me was my ex said she wants me to be friends with her boyfriend if possible and work things out so I could be able to hang out. It felt like she didn't respect me at all, how could I be friends with her boyfriend when I dated her! Especially considering I think I've made a mistake breaking up and all. she knows how I feel about her!

Other than that I'm trying to put that all behind me now. She showed who she's loyal too and I respect that. I was the one who left, I was the one who ended things. I know I shouldn't put her on a pedestal but I worry that she was the one for me. I worry that I left a girl who I was mean't to be with. I'm very afraid that I'll never find someone like her again. She was beautiful, smart, funny, clumsy, giddy, etc. She was the perfect girl. I know i'll probably meet more women given my age. I'm trying to see the bigger picture. Life takes over after high school and most relationships in high school don't end up working out anyway. 

I'm just afraid of never being able to meet another amazing girl who loves me for me. I know that this fear is something that's deeply rooted in my person. It's something that I have to work out because if I can't be content alone I won't be able to care for someone else again. I'm trying to get over this I really am and I've heard the 1st heartbreak is always the hardest. I know a million other people have probably said and experienced a similar thing, that's why they call it a first love. 

Apart from that I'm worried about my life in general. I don't know which road to take. I want a job I can be happy with but at the same time I want to experience as much as I can. My cousin told me that when he was in college he hated it and he wanted to change his life and experience something totally new. So he dropped out and joined the Marines and now he gets to be a crew chief on a UH-1Y and flies around San Diego Bay everyday. He said he thought it was really sad to see all of his old friends back home just being herded like sheep into careers they didn't really want and aren't living their lives. He said the most fun they ever have is going to vineyard on weekends with their girlfriends and he said that it's sad they are doing things like that in their 20s, it's something 50 year olds should be doing. I don't want to end up a slave my whole live just living day by day and watching my life drag on. I want to see and experience amazing things. I'd also like to meet a girl who shares the same dream. I don't want to settle down in my 20s, I don't want the house with the white picket fence and a puppy. I want to live in different places, I want to travel, I want to see and talk to as many people as possible and hear their stories.

I kinda have a plan for the future. My dad works at a local college as a security guard so I can get free tuition. I'm defiantly going to take it, I cant pass up free college. I don't really know what I want to major in though. I know I still have time but I'm just worried I'll settle for something I'll end up hating and then be stuck with it. If I don't feel that college is for me I do plan on dropping out and joining the military. If I can make it through college but end up with a degree I don't like then I'm probably going to join the military as an officer. I do have to take into consideration that I have no idea what life is going to throw at me and my plans will most likely change.

After the big falling out with all of my friends I really don't have anyone to talk to anymore. I just feel pretty sad and lonely. I have some hobbies but I get pretty bored. I guess I just feel like I'm stuck in a rut. I'm sure I'll meet new people later down the road but I don't want to end up like my parents. They aren't bad people at all but they are just very sad in my opinion. They only have 1 other couple they hang out with but that's it. My dad really doesn't have a whole lot of friends and I just think that's a sad way to live. I really don't want to end up like him though. Don't get me wrong I love him a lot and i'm very grateful for the sacrifices hes made for me but he's just a shell anymore. My mom cheated on him twice with the same guy. I give him credit for staying around after all of this. My sister told me at one point he almost killed himself but that's another story for another day. I don't want to meet a woman who will do that to me. My mom is a good mother but she is defiantly not a good wife. What she did was wrong but she's my mother and I can't hate her for it.  The thought of that happening to me has me freaked out. really all I want is to meet someone who complements my life when I'm ready to have a stable relationship. I've got a lot of work to do on myself before I can allow that to happen but I just worry that all this effort I'm putting into changing myself will just be for nothing.

I really feel like I'm lost at this point. I guess some would consider this an early life crisis. I'm glad that I'm having it at this age and at this time because now I really see what I want in life I just don't know how to obtain it. I want to create an amazing life and make some amazing friends and meet an amazing woman. If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it. I'm just a very confused man and I'm pretty intimidated by life. Maybe it's because i'm weak or maybe it's because I'm a pretty deep thinker. Whatever it is I don't know and I don't think I'll ever know, That's the beauty of life I guess.",30Jun2019,1
186,"Throwaway because I just really don't want this to be remembered and it really sucks.

So I've been with this girl for almost two years, we're about to go into our first year of university in September and we had an amazing relationship. We were so great to each other and it never waivered throughout the entire thing. 

Naturally, because of this I decided I would go to the same university as her as I didn't have high grades so it didn't matter what university I went to because none of them would be impressive on a resume anyways. So I registered going to the same university as her and everything is good.

However, my girlfriend has been doing a sport her entire life and she is super commited meaning she has practice almost every day, and she is on the university team for it in the coming school year. One night she wasn't able to hang out with me and I got pretty upset because she had blown off our plans we had made prior to go with her friends who she somewhat blows me off for quite a bit. We got into a little fight and I said some harsh things.

Anyways, the next morning she came by my house to talk and she has the intention of breaking up with me saying that if the time she gives me now isn't enough for her then it won't be enough in university. And while I understand where she is coming from, it is entirely false for multiple reasons, I can indulge you if you PM me. Anyways I had convinced her to think about it and not to break up with me for some stupid reason and we spent the following two months (more so I spent the following two months) really upset and she eventually told me that there is no way we are going to university together anymore. She said she needs to break up before so she's not going through a break up and sadness during the sport season and we can't try to make it work because if we break up during the sports season she won't play well. 

I've accepted it, and we're going to break up soon, so it's basically set in stone. I just don't know how to proceed because she told me if after a while and she's adjusted we may be able to try again and be together. While this sounds great, I don't know if I would be able to handle coming back after she's been with someone else because I'm assuming she will have even if it's just a fling or something.

So I'm kind of looking for an answer on how the hell to get over being jealous thinking about her with other guys after we finish. Thanks for reading my long ass rant/essay.",30Jun2019,1

I tried to get her to get her t come home with me so I knew she was safe but I couldn't because she wouldnt come and I had a ride home. She left with a guy who I don't know who seemed to not have the best intentions. I feel so guilty that I couldn't get her to a safe place.

189,"I am so done with them. They always shove their “success” in my face and treat me so lowly. My dad doubted that’ll I graduate high school, they don’t take me seriously, and always describes me as negative. I hate the fact that my mother told me that I’ll die alone because people will isolate me. I regret not studying abroad and staying here. I thought it was for the best but I was wrong.....

My father and mother  always speaks lowly of me and put my little sister first  (she is the queen bee of the house, the popular in high school, always surrounded by friends, has good grades, parties a lot, and has a “valid dream”) while I am the total opposite of her...

I don’t like going out a lot, I get bored easily, I have friends but I don’t even have the energy to go out with them, I like drawing and art but never finish a piece because  then I get reckless... i had to transfer college twice because I didn’t pass a subject and because it was delaying my graduation. 

My dad said a hurtful thing today and my mom blamed it on me because I have “low self esteem”  but how am I supposed to be good with myself since I’ve been practically raised in a household where my parents sees me as a failure, burden, waste of time, someone who can’t do anything right, and so on?

They even treat my sister’s best friend as if she was their daughter! I can see the difference by the way they treat me and her. They blame me because I don’t spend time with them, but I try and whenever I am with them they always told me that every bad thing happens when I’m there.

I’m so fucking done.  I don’t know what to do...I’ve been trying to work on my insecurities and surpass any obstacle that life puts me on but as I manage to get over something worse comes to hit me in the face making my life miserable. High school experience (hospitalized 6 times, had to undergo surgery for ovarian cyst 7cm, ear infection causing me to pass out, couldn’t enjoy senior year because I was failing 6 classes thus affecting my dream to attend NYU or get an scholarship) college experience (attended an university that allowed me to study 2 years in my country and 2 years in the States seemed promising but didn’t like the system. I took a gap year but then A  attended a local catholic university...things went smoothly at first but things got worse during the middle of the year for I had to retire a class because I was failing at it then I didn’t pass the requirement class for my major graphic design because my professor was a complete unprofessional asshole who didn’t teach anything, had a very bad portfolio, and a very archaic method of teaching.) wasted my whole time.... 

My life decisions sucks and I fear that my parents might be saying the true....",30Jun2019,1
191,"I love my girlfriend. We've been together for about 4 months. She makes me happy and this is the most mature, stable and promising relationship I've ever had. Before this, we've been really good at honest communication but now I feel like I might fuck everything up by making a mistake. 

One of my best friends I've known for a long time told me he has feelings for me. It was really suprising because he is super hard to read and I honestly had no idea. I don't know why he told me. I had already been with my gf for a few months by then. He said he just wanted 'let go of the weight' he'd been carrying around and claimed he had no intention of trying to interfere in my current relationship. He hasn't said anything about it since but honestly I thought it was a pretty dumb thing to do, especially since if he has had feelings for me as long as he claimed, he had plenty of opportunity to tell me when I was not dating.

Other than my annoyance with his timing, he's still a great friend, but I find my self questioning his motivations lately. Is he spending time with me in hopes of something more in the future? He's one of the core members of my small but close friend group, so I haven't been able to avoid him. But I also don't really want to. It's a little awkward in the moments when we're alone for more than a few minutes, but other than that, I still value our friendship and the history we have. 

I don't want to date him. I don't want to sleep with him. I don't have those kind of feelings for him. My girlfriend doesn't know anything about any of this. And it feels like I'm hiding something big, especially since he's always around. 

I want this relationship to last and I dont want to start keeping secrets. But I also dont want to bring up unnecessary strain. Another thing that might be important is that I am bisexual and my gf is lesbian. It's not uncommon for lesbians to feel more threatened by someone of a different gender than one of their own sex. It's not great, but it's a thing. My girlfriend isn't an insecure person but I havent had this discussion with her.

192,"Life took a turn early 2019. Left a down spiraling relationship. Moved on,  moved out of state.  But right before i left state, i met this guy. We hit it off within the first few minutes of our date. Spent the next three weeks together constantly.  I left state as I had initially planned. We keep in contact. Then as things do, it was great at first then something happened on his end and he just wasn't as invested as before. 

To give some background we're both technically still married to others, but seperated for around the same amount of time- he probably has more drama involved than i do. 

So we haven't seen eachother physically in 2 months.  I was missing my home state and not to lie, I was missing him so I booked a plane ticket home.  And around then is when it clicked how dumb I am. He's spent a couple months saying sweet things, things that felt so honest - but now I'm kinda wondering if it's just stringing me along. The last couple weeks- around the time i booked i ticket, I barely hear from him.  

It's sad, cause it seemed so real and honest but on the flip side, i know it was so fresh and we both still have b.s to sort through

So my friend and I were out and about when we meet this guy. Hes really cute and my friend, we'll call her Janet, liked him. I respected girl code and tried to be her wingman. As the night went on however, it was obvious he was into me. Still, I didn't budge. 

Later he was texting me and told me he liked me. I continue to try to convince him to date Janet, but he said he wouldn't date her. So I tell her all this, and ask if I can have a fling with him because he wouldn't date her anyway. She says no because it would hurt her feelings, even after I  told her I would do it for her. Janet insists that we can just stay friends with him, but I don't see the problem with me dating him, because it's not like he's her ex.

He can't even remember my little brothers names- he's met both of them, i talk.about them a lot, we even took the older one to the water park (younger one has been acting out a lot &amp; can't swim) but he still can't remember their names, but i can remember is moms, dads, cousins, &amp; both sisters of his sisters names. I can remember things about them &amp; him. If I'm feeling down he'll just act like i should toughen up- I've been abused a lot &amp; i just got adopted &amp; my adopted mom has a literal hole in her heart, he knows this &amp; how hard it is on me, &amp; yet he still does this even though I've asked him to stop- I'll tell him to stop while he's saying it &amp; he won't. 
He tries to equate his life to mine- he was a born into a middle class white family, good parents &amp; family, he had/has all he ever wants, he's always been in good schools, always had friends, been on a ton of trips &amp; even a cruise. Yes bad things happened- he had to move more often then others (not a ton) because his father was in the air force, he got mildly bullyed in middle school, &amp; his parents put him in a program kinda like scared straight because he did e-cigs &amp; weed. Yeah thats shitty, but he knows i had it a lot worse- i was groomed, abused, i had a bad speech impairment that left me unable to talk for a lot of my life &amp; got bullyied badly from first grade to 8th grade &amp; my parents neglected me due to this, I've always been really poor at times could barely eat, never went to a good school intell now &amp; I've had to fight tooth &amp; nail to do good in school &amp; stay on pair/exceed the other kids who've had good schooling their whole lives, the list goes on &amp; on. It really hurts to have what I've been threw be equal to what he's been threw, especially when he's said he feels bad for everything i went through &amp; shit when i told him. 
He'll also refuse to just do simple things- ie if your helping me with the dishes please don't spill water all over the floor (he likes to help so he feels usefup) &amp; he'll just continue not caring, I'll ask him to tell me if he's going to be moving a lot or i won't cuddle you if your moving a lot Because i can never get comfortable if he's always moving but he never does &amp; then when i don't cuddle him he gets pouty, I'll ask him not to act so hostile while playing games or driving (he'll get mad at a long drive or other drivers) because it scares me but he never stops. 
I asked him to get a memory app that helps with your memory (he's more hands so thought it would help more) &amp; the other day i was organizing his apps on his phone (with his consent of course) just because i was bored &amp; because messy, he even thought it was. When i did i found no memory app.. I brushed off as him trying to find a better one- he did tell me one he tried out was shit &amp; you had to pay for it so maybe he was just trying to find a good one, but i doubt that.
I'm at witts end. I get so on edge &amp; i feel like i can't open up to him at ALL because he'll just forget or not care. A part of me whats to break up, a part of me wants to stay together. I'm scared to break up with him because he's my only friend who i can see, &amp; i also really like his family. &amp; without him I basically no to do summer things with.

201,"Hello,

I'm a college student looking for some advice. For the past 3 or so years, I've considered myself a feminist, having become educated primarily through Twitter. While I obviously haven't experienced it (and cannot thus say I fully ""understand"" it), I am aware of many of the obstacles women face, and how men, particularly white men such as myself, contribute to the problems women encounter in all facets of life.

However, some problems have arisen in college and my summer job that have made me realize that my behavior doesn't always align with my perception of myself as a feminist. I'm a super talkative person, and, despite my efforts to sit back and listen more, has resulted a tendency to interrupt / talk over people, which is received very poorly by women (as it should be tbh). I've also been told that I come off as too flirty; while this has been said by people whom I had no intention of flirting with, there are times where it is hard for me to draw a hard line between work and social life.

Finally, I am also a physically large (6'6, large/muscular) person with some anger problems, and this makes me worry that I come off as very intimidating to women. To illustrate this, I'll provide a story: I got frustrated at a female colleague who was making fun of me to another female colleague, who started laughing uncontrollably. We later had a meeting w/supervisors to resolve this, where she was asked to re-tell the story of her making fun of me. I asked her to repeat it, as I couldn't hear from across the room, and they had me sit closer to her. As she repeated it, I gestured to my eyes, implicitly demanding she made eye contact as she said it. When I did this, the other colleague burst into tears. I believed that, having been made fun of and feeling like an outsider/'victim', I was just responding defensively at the time, but I feel like the way my frustration manifested was close to the way an abuser treats others, and could have been extremely triggering for someone who has experienced or witnessed abuse.

What can I do to improve my behavior, interact better with women (in professional/friendly, not necessarily dating, context), and ultimately succeed in manifesting my feminist beliefs through my behavior?

I'm not feeling much as it's only been a few days and I'm extremely mad at myself for staying with him for so long and being so naive to his behavior, but we had plans to be engaged this year, to have kids next year, the dogs, the house, etc, so I know eventually the pain will kick in. 

He was so manipulative and I allowed it. I got back together with him after he gave his phone number out to girls at bars. I excused his bad behavior of having to exchange social media with multiple different women every time he was out without me, allowed him to manipulate me into thinking I was crazy, jealous, and insecure for being uncomfortable with this, for feeling terrible every time a woman walked by and he would watch and stare at her. I cannot believe I stuck around for as long as I did, I can't believe I neglected myself, having the worst anxiety I've ever had in my life and allowed him to talk down to me telling me I was weak for not being able to control it. I can't believe I neglected every friend of mine of the opposite gender or I was accused of being shady, or being a cheater. 

The control, the jealously, the manipulation that overtook this relationship was insane. I know I will eventually miss him (how fucked up, I know), I will miss the comfortability, I will miss him making me feel like everything will be ok. 

I hope when this happens I can look at this post or read your comments and it will bring me back to reality and help me remember who the fuck I am.",30Jun2019,2

205,"I'm 19f and I didn't grow up with the best home life and I really want to go back to the person I was when I was younger. 

I grew up with a whole Asian family that fought everyday and ruined every aspect of my life. 

My dad is kind but lazy and hated everything my mom screamed at him to, so he cheated on her with single mom he showers with love and affection. 

My mom is the biggest control freak I've ever met in my life and she's ruined me with how I deal with other people. She'd wake me up in the early morning just to make me clean the entire house, she'd get mad at me for not doing the things she says she told me about but never really do, she gets mad at the smallest things to the point she'd get mad about a pillow on the floor and go ballistic. 

I know she means well but every Sunday she'd demand we deep clean the house and make sure everything's perfect to a T but we're never able to live up to her expectations and she'd always go on a tirade of how we don't do anything in the house, how we don't listen and how much we're hurting her by not listening to her (she's done this every Sunday my entire life) and I just want her to shut up and let us live our lives but it's been choking to say the least. 

When my mom found out that my dad cheated on her she'd use it as ammunition in every fight and bring it up every chance she got. Everytime my dad didn't do what she said immediately she'd go ""of course you won't listen, why would you? You don't love me one bit so why won't you go to your mistress and shower her with everything you can buy"" it's gotten past the point of why even bother with everything. 

When I lived away from my parents and they'd fight she'll always rant to me about something my dad did and I used to always tell and reassure her how everything's going to be fine and that I loved her, I used to kiss her everytime she left for work and I even made the effort to make her things for mother's Day and her birthday but being blamed for every little things and being told how much I never listen and never really cared about her and how she wishes she's dead really turned me into this giant desensitised person that whenever she'd cry or get mad or is in pain I'd just stop in my tracks and try to avoid her because it just feels so annoying to me. I've come to realize how much it's affected me because I would often just talk to my boyfriend and accidentally say mean things with no regard for his feelings because I've stopped caring about other people and how my words and actions would make them feel. 

I grew up depressed and I've attempted suicide multiple times in high school and I regret not jumping off my schools rooftop because life has gone downhill from there. I don't know who to go to or what to do because I can't afford anything and I've just started my third week at my office job and I'm contemplating if I should just leave my family or go home to an extremely disfunctional family",30Jun2019,1

210,"Some of my best friends all live a couple of hours away from where I live. While they live not that far away from each other, so they get to see each other more often.

I don’t get to meet up with them so often as it is kind of an expensive trip, going over to them. And it is usually me going to them, instead of the other way, as I am only one person. Also for some reason most of them are biased against the city I live in, because it is slightly smaller than the one they live in. 

Anyway I don’t get to see them often as they do not want to come to where I live, and always want me to go to them.
I’ve started to say no when we talk about getting together and they want me to come over there, because I think it’s a lot of money to spend for only being there one night, while also having to pay for food and drinks. (Which they also like to complain about when I invite them to come here for once). They get annoyed at me when I do say no, as they seem to think I’m ruining the mood or something.

211,"I(f15)'m planning to date this guy(m15) but when he asked if we would be good together I told him to wait because I need to figure my shit out 

I'm indecisive as fuck and making plans with me is hard. I don't think I'm completely comfortable with him yet and I think that's also a big problem. So whenever he asks if I want to do something, ill say yes but idk what i would do with him. Like I'd be thinking, ""oh I wanna eat"" but then I would be too self conscious to do it irl so I don't even suggest it. He knows I'm too self conscious but he doesnt understand why. He keeps reassuring me he won't judge me because he already likes me etc but i can't seem to shake my insecurities. Most of the things I can't do with him because I'm insecure.

He seems to have the right words for everything, like I'll be afraid he's gonna run away but then he will reassure me in the sweetest ways, while i'm speechless. I want to be able to tell him that I still like him very much but I can't find the words for it and I'm afraid he'll be like ""oh wow you're just using the same words I am"" and I'll be embarrassed. But I know he won't do that.

I've asked him if he gets slightly frustrated when I don't reciprocate the reassuringness or when I take several minutes to respond over a call (because I'm speechless and idk what to say and I'm also embareassed/shy) and he said he does get frustrated. So like that's on me. Idk How to fix it.

212,"I've been trying to write this for days and I'm not sure if this is where it belongs but I'm far better at giving advice than actually running my own life.

First, I have been through counseling (over $1M worth of mental health care) and I have a psychiatrist and I'm medication compliant. I don't think that I need another therapist but that may be part of the ultimate solution.

The problem is that my life story sounds like a work of fiction. I dread getting a new therapist because it takes so long to explain. I am self-conscious about it and most of my life I've just compartmentalized all of the different weirdnesses. I was even diagnosed with DID (multiple personalities) but it's actually just different masks that I wear to avoid having to deal with the details of different parts of my life.

The short version of the last few years is that I married prince charming and he turned out to be a narcissistic psychopath (one of the therapists opinion, not just the bitter ex) and I had him prosecuted for abusing my child. I went from suburbs to hiding out. He went on a crime spree and everything that I built was destroyed, including my ability to work in the field with the master's degree I just finished. During the investigation, my entire body of work was taken into evidence (where it still sits) but my degree was conferred. (I walked two weeks after he was arrested). 

I started a new master's program and had a 4.0 and GA gig doing important research and got pregnant. I had previously spent years doing fertility treatments and was unable to have children, until I was 3wks into a fling. The pregnancy was very rough and I bombed out of the program. My twins were born 10 days after my (now ex-husband) was finally convicted. 

I'm having the appointment where my doctor says that I have finally recovered from the pregnancy next month and I am desperate to start building my new life. 

I don't know how. 

Narcissistic abuse sort of consumes you until you wake up and realize that you haven't been able to make a decision or set boundaries in a decade. I started college in 1999 and was set to graduate, again, in May. All of my work was basically ghost writing for him (karmic justice - he was fired and lost all respect in  the industry after 6mos without me). 

I have a teenager and 6mo twins. I got my last name and my car in the divorce. Then notification from the IRS that I owe them (innocent spouse just cut the amount in half) plus almost $200k in federal student loans (borrowed at a lower rate so our assets could be used to make a higher return - those assets never existed...) 

I have medical problems and I was declared permanently disabled in my early 20s but I have fought my way through as many skills and credentials as possible because I don't want to be on ""welfare"" and I've always been a workaholic (at 22 I had paid into the system enough to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance). 

I've had 12 majors. I was always focused on acquiring more skills and knowledge because I was told that I would never recover from the drop in my IQ. Officially tested at 121 at age 13 (adjusted, of course) and repeatedly in the 80s at 22 after a bad reaction to a neuro med. In preparation for graduation I had a full neuropsych evaluation and I still have deficits but my IQ measured 123 at 33. 

That's just a smidgen of the highly unlikely stuff in my life. After gaslighting from my ex, I keep documentation for everything, so I will provide proof (without being offended) if ever necessary. 

To the point: I need advice on how to find a mentor or life coach or someone who can help me navigate through. I didn't grow up in a healthy environment. I'm a first generation graduate and all of my ancestors are deceased. When I have to make important decisions, I still experience the panic of being in a domestic violence relationship. I've always done great work but the process of getting a job is completely overwhelming. 

I know that this is a long shot but I have to harness my potential for my kids. Any/all advice is appreciated.",30Jun2019,1

221,"I’ve rewritten this post so many times. I’m so afraid of sounding like a douchebag and getting criticism and being told that I’m crazy for feeling this way. But I think it’s better to see if someone can offer advice than to hold back in fear of pissing someone off.

I seriously struggle with saying no. Long story short, I lost my job 7 months ago and have spent the entire time selling my paintings and making money through that while eating into my savings. During this time I have had so many genuinely great opportunities with art come up that weren’t financially wonderful but I said yes in order to avoid pissing people off. Looking back, not smart on my part and now I am filling up with resentment and irritation. Some of these opportunities include - art company reaching out to do product marketing together (unpaid work) in exchange for art supplies; people commissioning me to do paintings (have had 7 so far and feeling completely and utterly drained, not charging enough money because of my problem with fearing confrontation); previous coworker asking me to design the logo and branding for their new company, unpaid (still not sure how or why I agreed to do this for free, again, so insanely scared of confrontation that I didn’t mention money and neither did they); local companies wanting to collaborate on projects — I knew these jobs wouldn’t bring in a ton of money if any but I agreed anyway; friends, on their own accord, putting me in touch with small businesses to sell my artwork in their stores (creating reproductions of your artwork takes time and money and coming up with new ways of selling my paintings is a large undertaking for someone who does not have the time to make this a priority, not to mention the profit from these stores would most likely be minuscule compared to the energy spent upfront creating the products); doing art shows at events hosted by friends. 

I don’t think I’m even counting all of the opportunities that have come up. They are WONDERFUL, and I am truly fortunate and beyond appreciative, but right now my focus is on getting a full time job with benefits and a career path, and I truly do not have the time to keep doing these small jobs to appease people. I have put off for months going full time at applying to jobs. I have been scraping by with my savings and bringing in money through art. I have a large social media following and I am blessed that most times I post a painting, it sells within a few hours for a few hundred dollars. But I’ve spent so much time doing small jobs for people that I really feel like I’ve missed out on making the money that I could have been from selling original paintings, and I’m finally reaching my boiling point. Job searching takes serious energy and between that and painting I don’t have the capacity to keep taking on new projects.

I think the reason I felt pushed over the edge enough to write this post is because I had someone send me a long message today that they went into a local shop and basically told the owner that they have an artist who can sell their work in the shop (in the form of bookmarks, prints, cards - all things that I don’t even sell or have created) and then they told me they expect me to call the shop owner and they want me to tell them how it goes. I felt so pissed off when I read this, they completely overstepped my boundaries. I don’t even have more than 5 paintings on hand to sell because I have sold out all my inventory. Now I have to worry about this shop owner thinking I’m a douchebag for not being interested in selling my work with them after this other person telling them I was willing. Extremely agitating when I can barely keep up with commissions and should be focusing on my priority which is sending out job applications everyday and writing cover letters, all time consuming things. So I told this person quite nicely that I am very appreciative of them thinking of me and doing this for me but I don’t have the capacity right now to take on the extra project. They completely disregarded my explanation and replied with just listing off additional ways I could sell my art at the shop, followed by an ellipsis “...” as if I am an idiot.

On top of feeling stressed out with saying no to people in regard to art, I keep having men reach out to me (via text) asking to get coffee or hangout/go on a date, and they don’t take no for an answer when I use it. Even when I say no, it’s like there’s something around me that tells people that “no” isn’t a real no because it’s coming from me, the nice girl. They continue to ask to get together, or inquire about my life as a way to continue conversation, or the best - they get irritated and send a negative reply.

I’m truly just feeling so drained. I realize I am responsible for all of this. Completely take responsibility and I honestly feel like a fucking idiot. I cannot believe how little of a backbone I’ve had. But I’m serious about wanting to change and start having one. I desperately need a job and I desperately need to stop giving so much of a fuck what people think of me. That’s what it comes down to. I don’t want people to dislike me because I tell them no. Well, I won’t be alive to even talk if I don’t put food in my mouth. All these side projects and coffee dates are not my priority and are not in my best interest right now. I guess I just want to hear if someone has relatable experience, or truly any advice you can offer. I seem to cave in every circumstance when a new project request comes up, because I find a way to justify it, but I truly don’t have time to keep spreading myself so thin anymore :(",30Jun2019,2

223,"So here's the backstory:  


My mom and brother were in checkout. 

I decided to go check to see if  they had this body wash I wanted. People were crowding the walking area and lining up at registers, so I decided to take a shortcut by the empty cash registers. There was a HUGE puddle of watermelon juice that you would have not been able to see until AFTER you fell into it. 

I slipped and fell into the aforementioned liquid in that area and there was only a printed out piece of paper attached to the side of the empty cash register. There was no caution sign or anything whatsoever. 

 Luckily other employees and the manager saw it and helped me file a report.

Actually, they insisted I do so and at first, I wasn't because I didn't wanna go through the trouble, but I started getting this terrible throbbing in my right ankle and decided to do so, before leaving the store. The employees and the manager were super helpful with everything and made sure that they got every little detail filled out correctly. 

My main issue is that it was my first time filing a personal injury claim  and the janitorial staff immediately started cleaning up the  puddle. I don't know why they did this, but thankfully, the manager got pictures of it as they were cleaning it up and interviewed the employees that saw the accident happen, along with some customers. 

This happened in another state (I live on the FL-GA line) so I had to go to a hospital in my own state  and the doctor there told me to immediately see a orthopedic (I see one  next week) due to the sharp pains and spasms I’m getting in the injured leg.

I talked to a PI lawyer, just in case. 

He’s on standby and advised me to email the lady who contacted me from Claims Management of the events that happened and to say the same exact thing or as much I could recall  for the recorded statement. This way, nothing can be used to build a  case against me.

 She said she’d be in contact with me within two weeks  and that its gonna be an insurance claim against Wal-Mart. 

I don't really know what any of this stuff means. I’m 20 yrs old  and this is my first time having to do anything like this. If anyone has had a similar experience and can let me know that I'm going about this the correct way, I'd very much appreciate it!

224,"My mom [45F] got a call early yesterday from her abuse ex boyfriend [50?M] of 7 years sister. She invited her for a girl's night around 1pm yesterday. This is harmless itself, however there's a lot of background so bear with me. 

My mom and her boyfriend who no one likes were together for 7 years, give or take. He isn't a good man, drug addiction, stealing, threatening to kill my whole family, and just a garbage individual. We knew him since my grandfather and him worked together, my mother was 14 at the time and he's been obsessed with her since. She saw numerous other men, all terrible, before settling in on him, which was and forever will be a massive mistake. 

Recently she's had enough. Attempted to leave him multiple times this year and last, but finally put her foot down. Won't receive calls, avoids texts, and refuses to see him. It's been a couple weeks since then. He's even offered to pay her money (she's not doing so hot in finances) just to see her. She rejected, not wanting to be apart of that. 

Here comes Thursday night. I get a call at 3am, but I'm obviously asleep and don't return the call until the next day probably around noonish. I talk to my mom and she's very excited. Something about her exes sister wanted to have a girl's night with three other girls. She hasn't had a friend in years in this relationship, so she's quite happy and talking about getting ready. I immediately tell her I'm unsure and don't have a good feeling about this. She said it's fine and it'll be fun, her and the sister had always gotten along fine. I tell her to have fun and to keep us updated, my grandmother and I. She has not contacted us, however the sister has spoken to my grandma, but my mother hasn't spoken. This is not normal. 

This is where I am. It's Saturday night, grandma had called me an hour ago, it's about 1am, so technically it's Sunday morning. She has still not heard anything from my mother's mouth. I haven't heard from her at all, which my mom treats me like a friend, she contacts me often for updates. 

I know it isn't that late. But this is not like her. She would call us with her own voice if everything was great. My mom is weird, she is a heavy drinker, she could just be totally out of it and the sister is just letting us know she's fine. However, it's fishy. It's unsettling. I have a bad gut feeling about this and I'm very nervous and anxious. I would like to note my mother isn't the most stable, she's gone ""missing"" multiple days before, but this isn't a normal occurrence. Before it'd be with new guys, but that was many years ago and hasn't been this way since. In fact my mom has called me from gas stations multiple times, she always calls somehow. 

I'm probably overreacting, but I'm taking this seriously.

I am not comfortable being undressed in front of her anymore but she'll insist on going into the family changing room so she can make sure that my clothes fit well. I try to give her the benefit of the doubt since she didn't grow up here. But I have boundaries and feel disrespected by how she treats me at times. I am not a child anymore.

230,"I'm really insecure when it comes to letting my guard down and opening up to people, mainly I'm just insecure in general, but I started talking to this guy who made me feel accepted and loved. He told me I was gorgeous, which no one had ever told me before. I felt like I didn't have to worry about having to put up a facade when I was around him. 

(He was a senior and I was a junior in high school when this was taking place. He was leaving the fall after graduation to join the Air Force)

After talking for a while, he asked me to be his girlfriend, which made me ecstatic. I got so attached and fell so in love with him. Like I fell so fucking hard that it was physically and emotionally painful. 

We talked everyday about thing I never thought I'd open up about, and I was never bored or uninterested when I was around him. One day, we were talking about personality traits and characteristics that we didn't like about ourselves, and I told him that I felt like I could be too clingy at times.

Like I said earlier, I'm insecure about stuff like this. So when I told him that, I wasn't expecting him to say that he liked clingy. I finally felt like I could be myself around someone I like. 

I know this sounds cliche, but I was in love, and he said he was too. He made everything better. 

Until eventually, I noticed he started to become distant and we started arguing a lot more. It might have been unintentional and he might not have known that he was hurting me, but I didn't want to say anything about it because I didn't want to start an argument. I loved him, and if loving him meant him hurting me, then I'd let him do it. It was probably pretty unhealthy, now that I think about it. 

I thought ""Maybe I'm just overthinking it"". And I could have been, but things between us just felt weird. One day, he just started ghosting me, and when I confronted him about it, he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. I eventually forced it out of him. He said, ""You've just been really clingy."" and he broke up with me, just like that. It hurt like hell too because I had become so attached to him.

The walls I built to keep me safe were no longer there. And the person that I tore them down for, wasn't even going to be there for me to help me rebuild it. 

He also said another reason was because he was joining the Air Force. I wish that could have been the only reason. Of course, something had to be wrong with me.

After we broke up (through text), he cut things off completely eventhough he said we could ""still be friends."" He even said when he got back from the Air Force, that he might want to get back together with me. 

If I'm still ""too clingy"" when he gets back, won't he just dump me again? 
Would it be stupid of me to get back with him?

231,"My friend and I had a common interest we'd talk about a lot. But I started losing interest in the topic and I told her about it because she asked me if I did she'd want to know. She was really bummed out-- this was months ago but it still bothers her and when she talks about it, she talks a lot. I try to listen, but I dont know what to say. She seeks answers from me, but I don't have any. No matter how many times I tell her she seems to circle back to is. This is my fault! She's miserable about it because I told her I wasn't into it and it upsets her. It's my fault, so when she vents I feel awful. I'm not gonna pretend I'm interested in the topic anymore because I don't want to hurt her feelings. I value her and I care about how she feels but I feel worn out. She doesn't intend it but it's very guilt trippy. What do I do? Should I tell her whenever she vents about it she's accidentally guilt tripping me? She's pretty sensitive lately because she's been having a hard with life stuff so I don't want to hurt her. How would I go about it? Should I just suck it up and listen silently?

232,"I left for college like 3 years ago and it seems every time I come back home for breaks I have a lot of issues with my best friend. I really like hanging out with her but a lot of the time the relationship feels really one sided, I don’t even remember the last time she asked me how my day went and most conversations seem to revolve around her and her college friends. Whenever I bring up any of my college experiences she shuts down and doesn’t want to talk about it. We even had a big fight last summer where she told me I was selfish for only wanting to talk about my college experiences and at the time I considered it fair and I toned it down but now I find her to be very hypocritical and super unfair because honestly I’ve been having a really good time at college and I just wish she would be happy for me and the conversations could be mutual instead of this weird competition. I buy her a lot of things because she never has money and she’s super stingy with her money and makes me pay her back ridiculously small amounts even when I tell her I can’t. And a lot of the time she’ll use astrology and stuff to say that’s why she’s acting like that but like I think it’s super unfair to do these mean things and then just say “it’s because I’m a Leo.” I find her holding me to really ridiculous standards, she’ll yell at me for talking with my hands too much or for singing in the car. She invalidates my feelings and my sicknesses a lot (which is honestly really weird but like an example would be I brought up how I wanted to get tested for ADHD and she said you don’t have that as if she’s a doctor) and then gets mad that I don’t tell her things. I just feel like I can’t make her happy no matter what I do and the relationship is really just starting to not be worth it to me. I can barely hang out with her unless I’m high out of my mind. Even though all these things suck really bad, I still am scared to talk to her because she gets really defensive and yells at me and I am honestly scared to lose her friendship because she is my only friend back home basically. So I am debating whether or not it’s worth it to say something or just ride it out for one more month until I go back to school because I also think I might just be spending too much time with her. And if I talk to her I’m not even sure what to say because of how defensive she gets and I really don’t want her to yell at me. And I’m also scared if I talk to her she’ll just flip it to make her the victim because she plays that a lot and I feel like if I say anything it just won’t even be taken seriously. But I also don’t know how to get alone time away from her because she gets mad when I just want to sleep.

I’ve had a fair share of men ghost me, turn me down, call of dates whenever I try and bring it up. I know some of you might suggest I wait until I’m in the relationship, but I see that as unfair.

They fight a lot and 90 percent of the time It's him who's apologizing. Lately she has been manipulating his behavior a lot. She already dumped him twice and patched up again, said some really mean things about him and his family in the process. My friend however values her more than his self respect. She doesn't let him talk about the relationship to anyone(including me). So, I have very little insight on the details. He doesn't tell me whats wrong when there's a fight between them. She recently blamed him for giving me so much space in his personal life (She knows that I dislike her). I can clearly see multiple red flags and he wouldn't listen to me.

236,"To start off, I have two questions...

Does ANYONE know what it means if 1. someone has a habit of fake laughing ALL the time? Not just with people and situations where they feel obligated but alone too.. it’s so weird.

And 2. No matter what you do to try and feel comfortable around someone, you just can’t do it?? Believe me I’ve tried to be normal around him, but I feel like everything comes off as fake because I’m so skeptical about him.

(I’m asking about my moms husband who is an ex felon— Registered sex offender. I have reason to believe he’s lying ALL about his past)

— he’ll be in the bedroom watching tv I hear these strings of what sounds like extremely forced fake laughter, and I swear to god (it’s like watching someone on TV laughing at scenes that they don’t genuinely find funny, yet doing laughing because 1. It’s part of the plot (and they’re not acting well) or 2. They’re just demented or something) —his case is something like the mix of both.

It’s all so crazy, because my mother is in her own head about him. Last time I questioned about his charges, she basically told him that we were talking about him. I don’t feel comfortable telling her something that he wouldn’t end up finding out because of it.... she defends him to the max. I’m not even going to begin to explain how weird he’s been with me...

Supposedly, when he was 13, and adopted into a family, his 11 year old step sister used to “entice him” to do things to her. I was told it was just light fondling. He was charged with 3 counts of lewd and lascivious acts against a minor when he turned 18. He told us they waited for him to turn a legal age to go after him.

His explanation was that nothing truly bad happened between them, and that the light messing around was all clearly consensual because “they still talk throughout the years and they’re still friends” but the girl repressed all her memories from that time. He’s told us that when he brings it up she doesn’t really respond to it. Well my thing is, why the hell is she traumatized if it was all 50/50! I’m thinking he just molested her.

Allegedly, she “lied to her mom about him doing these things” and since she was pregnant when this all came out, and had to depend on her mom, she went along with it to press those charges... (bc supposedly the step mom had a vendetta against him, some aspects I believe, but the false accusations make no sense)

that’s the bullshit story that’s been regurgitated again and again. I don’t buy it but my mom thinks she loves him. It feels like he’s using her financially too.. he’s jokingly called her his sugar mama so many times and she could hardly take a well needed break from work (has always brought in more money than him and I can’t really be angry because he is a felon, it’s hard to get a job as it is) but the entire time my mom was without work while going to college full time to become a nurse, we could barely do a day without him complaining about work and the bills and stuff,  then he was so quick to talk about quitting his job and relaxing in life once she starts making money....

I just feel like he should take better care of her. but love is blind.

I think he’s absolutely a chameleon.. my grandma (moms mom) said the same thing but when she pointed it out, my mom kind of turned against her (didn’t help they’ve had a weak relationship beforehand so my mother got defensive) but I still see right through it all. I’ve tried to accept him but at the same time I want my mom to still know that I don’t truly trust him. I guess I’ll just have to have this talk with her at the right time.

Right now he wants to go to nursing school but he's kind of iffy about it now because he got another job offer at a university and he used to tell me before how much he regret not going into nursing school when he was younger. 

Now I'm off to college to pursue my bachelor's degree at a university (Sidenote: the university that I got into was my safety school, not necessarily my top choice so I chose nursing as my major when applying because that's what my parents and the rest of my relatives told me to do) and I told him I got into their nursing program, which I am super grateful about but I am very unsure about nursing as of now. I told him how I have doubts becoming a nurse but he just kept on going about how nursing gives you financial stability (which is not a lie) and how any other careers won't give you as much money as nursing does. And EVERY TIME we see other relatives, he always tell them how I'm going to become a nurse. 

Now I know he's just trying to be supportive and all but the way that he talks about my career is as if he's trying to make it as if its his own. It's so frustrating. I'm already lost because I don't know what to do with my life and to put me in uncomfortable situations is just making me not want to be near him anymore.

253,"Hello 

I’m 29/F and having a major life crisis. I’ve been depressed to various degrees for most of my teen and adult life but have managed to forge a career in a creative field I like, however I’ve ended up in the wrong part of that industry and just sit at a desk all day, sending emails or sitting in meetings. I like the city where I live but I’m feeling totally overwhelmed, dispirited, and actually approaching some kind of total meltdown. I can barely focus on my work or relationships and cry most days. 

I have endometriosis which is tough but what’s brought me to this point is that I recently suffered an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy - the doctors missed it but I was able to avoid surgery (just) - the impact on me emotionally and physically has been enormous. I am exhausted all the time and sleeping most of my time off. My partner and I are barely hanging on by a thread but that’s a whole other thing. 

I’m seriously considering moving back home to live with my parents for a year - to take stock of my life, help my dad out with the house, care for my grandma, then maybe go to grad school, and spend some time selling shit to pay off my debt and travel? I feel very stuck. Is it stupid to leave a promising career because of a health crisis, or is it better to take a break now before I truly lose my mind? I have no savings or anything like that. 

I’m scared of losing everything I have here including a relationship, some fledgling friendships and projects - but I seriously feel like I can’t go on like I am, and my life will never be what I wanted it to be. From the outside I look like I have my shit together and I seriously don’t - I’m not sure I can keep up the charade.

255,"So I have this bestfriend Joe, who I love and care about. We've fought and have had ups and down over the years but he's like a brother to me. We started hanging with this amazing young married couple around the same age. We all went to the same college and are cool fun artists. 

The wife and I had a drunken spat a few months ago over something stupid and since then I find out my friend Joe has been hanging with them without me. Joe has also started answering my texts in one word answers. Everytime I offer us all to get together I get some type of excuse. Then I finally hang out with Joe and find out they hung out 2 weeks ago together. I call him out on it and he gets defensive, saying its only happened a few times. Says I can be too high energy (so is he?) And they just want chill nights so he gets invited over.

Joe used to tell me every little thing happening and now Im finding things out, like him getting a new apartment, weeks later. I dont want to lose my friend and I fear me calling him out on hanging without me mightve made things worse. 

I have other friends that are not in this circle, I wont be friendless if I drop them but I LIKE hanging with them. And they liked hanging with me for such a long time. And I consider Joe my best friend. So it will hurt a lot to leave but i also understand that friends come and go.

Should I just remove myself from this circle and see if Joe and the couple reach out? or should I try reaching out to hang out one more time and call it quits of they say no?

Tl;dr Joe is hanging out without me with other friends and I can't tell if I'm being irrational or should just let them go.",30Jun2019,1
256,"Before I start this post, I'd like to make a disclaimer and say that,
nobody in my home has ever physically hurt me, or threatened me.

I live at home with my parents and I've been going through a lot right now. There are boundaries I want to set, and other thing I should discuss with them but I'm too scared to approach them.
You see I'm not very good at defending myself, so I usually let other people make assumptions about me. Whenever I try to bring up a problem they take it personally. My parents also pull the ""if i can put up with it you can"" card. My dad dismisses emotional problems and my mom is the kind to tell you to suck it up. 
I'm just to scared to tell them that I need their help with things.
Whenever I talk to them my stomach churns and I have trouble speaking. I want to avoid whatever room their in and I mentally panicked if they even disagree with somthing I say.

Should I approach them, and is being paranoid of my parents normal?",30Jun2019,1
257,"My younger cousin has just turned 19.

She's heavily involved in the local music scene (big bands and orchestras) and has friends and acquaintances of all ages because of this.

However, there's one guy in particular that she messages on an almost constant basis. He's a little over 10 years older than her.

Her parents know this, and don't seem overly concerned, but my gut feeling is that something is off here.

I've told her this, and very often remind her to just be careful of the situation. She insists they're nothing more than friends, but I'm worried that he could have an ulterior motive of some sort.

The group they play together in have frequent ""after-parties"" and post-gig drinks, and she's not the most careful about how much she drinks at times.

I'm not involved in any of the groups, and don't see her more often than once a week, so I can't really keep an eye out for her in these situations.

I've yet to see any untoward messages from him, but from the conversations she's shown me, he's definitely at least a bit flirty. 

How do I get it across to her that it's not normal for someone that much older to be showing an interest in her to the extent that he does?

258,"Hello, 20 M here,

(Hopefully this belongs here.)

Through the crazy magic that is ""small world"", my ex girlfriend turned out to be pretty good friends with a girl I knew from school for one year in the 2nd grade. This friend of hers was always nice, I went with my ex to a couple of her friend's parties, but I never really got close, despite my ex trying to make us become friends.

Well, fastforward to a month ago, I got involved in a hobby that it turns out the friend is involved in. I'm no longer with my ex (obviously), and I realized how distant I'd been with her despite all our previous meetups. 

So, I told her ""hey, sorry I was always being so distant, life was weird for me in the past and I used to be a lot more awkward."" She said it was fine, but the conversation ended sort of abruptly.

Was that something I should have said? Should I say sorry for saying sorry? I realize it came off as rather cryptic, since prior to this I'd had VERY little communication with her. I think I might like her, and I'd hate to ruin my chances by being a neurotic weirdo.

I mean... I know I'm a neurotic weirdo, but still.

259,"I will provide context to this. Also TL;DR at the end.


A couple of years ago, I met a girl online who I kinda liked because she had a nice personality and was kind to me. I was like 12 years old at that time, and so was her. We became friends and talked sometimes, I made other friends, everything was very nice, but there was one thing: the girl I liked had depression, she posted some bad things sometimes but not so extreme. After like 2 years, I finally said I really loved her and all of that, but she warned me about her depression and how it could affect our relationship. At first, I didn’t think it was very bad, so I said to her that I would help her always and remove the depression of her life. We became a couple, after that.


The first 6 months were very good, I was everyday texting her like an addiction. We loved each other and I helped her with some things she told me. She slowly started to show me how messed up she was with some anger issues or lack of patience, but I didn’t care too much and I helped her. But after that period, one day I saw how messed up she was. She opened completely to me. She told me she was bullied to death on her old school, and her parents didn’t care at all for an extreme period of time, even worse, she told me that they were dicks to her and insulted her, called her weak, things like that. When they showed a little bit of interest, they changed her to another school but only that. At the moment, she was devastated. She had low self-steem, anger issues and EXTREME depression, which she hided from everyone. She told me she had suicidal thoughts and that she frecuently cutted her arms and legs. I was shocked to hear all of that, but I had hope that I could be the light of her life and helped her with absolutely everything. But there was a problem with that.


I developed something like an anxiety for some situations. When she had an episode of anxiety or panic attack, I was always EXTREMELY nervous but tried my best to calm her, and it worked a lot of times. It started to get worse after some months, at least one or two episodes per week. That devastated me. I was always nervous and paranoid that something would happen to her, or to our relationship. She had some anger episodes because I wasn’t with her sometimes, or because she thought that I lied about my love towards her or things like that. I even started to think that she hated me when she had her anger episodes, or that I was guilty for not being sometimes with her and  all of that devastated me. I had a ton of pressure in my back, but I never hated her and I had all the patience of the world just for her. Her mental state, the state of our relationship and my own mental state were killing me. 


Fortunately, her parents listened a bit and gave her medications and a psychologist. She got well for a couple of months, and also me. On that time, I changed. I went to the outside world to improve. I got better grades, made new real friends, I had time for myself to enjoy things, and I got closer to my family while also texting her and loving her a lot. But then, the medications and psychologist of my girlfriend were no longer working.


Episodes again 2 times per week, and even worse now that I was kind of distant from her. She almost killed herself one day if it weren’t for me. She started to insult me, manipulate me emotionally and all of that when she was angry. Slowly, I started to grow hate towards her for all of that, but ironically I still loved her a lot. I was never rude at her, and stayed patient, until december of 2018. I was so tired at the moment that my advices were empty and I started to care more about myself. Fortunately, in all that time my good real life was still very good, but I still had to be the “babysitter” of my girlfriend. 


I was so tired that we had a disscussion and broke up, and after that we became just friends. We were more calmed, we talked to each other sometimes, all of that in a week. Then, it started again. The whole thing of “you never loved me” and all of that. We argued a week and she blocked me. I felt bad, but at the same time I didn’t. Then she messaged me a week or less after that saying that she was sorry and those things. I said we could continue to be friends, but only that. I continued my life and texted her sometimes per month, but in those months I didn’t even want to see her, but didn’t want to hurt her, so I continued until I got a message three weeks ago from her that if I still like her, and that she wants to talk.


I didn’t open it, I continued my life. I didn’t want to live all that mess that tormented me some years. 


But did I? 


I still have remorse of ghosting her, I never wanted to hurt her, but I also want to be happy. I am still thinking if I should ghost her, fake my death, something, I don’t know. I just don’t want to get back.


What should I do?


TL;DR: I met a girl with depression online and we became a couple. I tried to help her always but it was a lot of pressure for me, and she also hurted me because of her insecurities insulting me or manipulating me emotionally. I started to leave her slowly after some time, but she wouldn’t let me and I wouldn’t let myself because of the guilt of hurting her. I broke with her, stayed away from her but still texting her sometimes as friends, until now, when she asked me if I still loved her and that she wanted me and I didn’t respond for three weeks, thinking if I should ghost her or not because I don’t want to get into trouble anymore, and I want to live my life, but I still don’t want to hurt her.

260,"The past two summers my sister and I have gone over to our dad for about a month each time. The entire point of this trip is to keep our bonds with our dad, though that's mostly failed, because only 5 of the days the last trip we actually spent quality time with each other without going out. The rest of the time I just sat there on my computer or hung out with my stepmom(She's amazing btw). We went out a good half of the trip and my dad was there for very few of them. This trip also makes me decently worse as a person, being an impatient brat whenever I'm over there because we are spoiled. We are about to go this year, and recently I got a job offer for when I turn 16, which is before the next years trip.

264,"I’ve been friends with and liked this guy (let’s call him William) for a few months. As it turns out, he’s liked me for a few months too. We’ve gone out on a couple dates and we text and FaceTime almost every day. I really like him and feel like I can be myself around him. 

Let’s say William’s race is X and mine is Y. My mom says she doesn’t care about that. When we were driving him home once though he randomly brought up this one time where another person who is X followed his family and told them that if they were really X they shouldn’t be doing a certain thing (because some consider it to be more of a thing Y people do). My mom acted like nothing was wrong but then when he got out of the car and we were driving back to our house she said that she doesn’t like that he was brought up race and that it seems like he can’t get over the fact that he’s X and I’m Y. He has said some things about Y people but after I told him it bothered me he stopped and my mom knows he stopped. 

But we were on a date today and his mom was late to pick him up so I stayed with him until she got there. They live about five minutes away from the place we were at and she showed up 15 minutes after the time we said we were going to be done. To me, people being late isn’t that big of a problem if it doesn’t happen all the time because we’ve all been late at some point. My mom was 1.) tired and 2.) impatient, though. Once I got in the car she made a comment about X people being slow all the time and doing things at their own speed. I understand that she was tired, but that was uncalled for, even if he wasn’t there when she said it. It doesn’t end there. 

I will admit, William does have a tendency to be a bit feminine. I know this is stereotypical, but before we started seeing each other I wondered if he was gay. I know being gay does not equal being feminine and being feminine does not equal being gay, but it still made me wonder. When he told me that he liked me, I didn’t worry anymore because if he was gay then he would have just said we could stay friends or something. But then in the car today my mom got me thinking. Williams parents don’t treat him equally to the rest of his family (my mom asks me if that’s just his perception but all he stated was facts). My mom said that she was talking to my grandma and my grandma asked if his parents (who are religious) don’t like him because he might be gay because he has a higher pitched voice and is a bit feminine (my grandma has never met him and I never told my mom or grandma I thought he was feminine before this conversation, keep in mind). That made me think, okay, he told me he likes talking with a higher pitched voice. He likes more feminine shows and stuff like that and cares a lot about his appearance (again, all these are stereotypes, I know, but I have a friend who came out as gay who is a lot like William). 

William has also brought up conversations about people who are gay a few times. For example: he was saying that he believed being gay is a result of looking up to someone who is gay and that it is a choice. He also pretends he doesn’t like his old friend who is gay, but then bought him an $80 gift for his birthday. If you really can’t stand someone that much, why would you buy them an $80 gift? What the real red flag is here is that he pretends to not like this friend when he clearly does. He’s brought up this friend a few times. I don’t know if he says these things because he truly means them or if he’s just saying them to act like he’s not gay. But at the same time, he still acts like he likes me. He’s a bit shy when it comes to starting conversations, but if I don’t contact him first he’ll usually text me and ask me to call or whatever. He also asks me to hang out. If he didn’t like me, he likely wouldn’t do those things, or at least not as often. Also, he’s mentioned things he’s done with other girls in the past when he lived in another state but I have no way of knowing if those things are true because he was in another state. I’m still scared he might be using me to pretend he isn’t gay. I have no problem with people who are gay, but if he’s gay that means he never liked me and has just been using me. Maybe I’m all overthinking it all?? And maybe my mom truly thinks he’s gay? Or maybe she just doesn’t like him and wants me to stop talking to him (she has a way of controlling situations to get the outcome she wants).

266,"Apologies for the long post and mobile format. 

It's very difficult for me to share personal information, even with therapists I feel deeply uncomfortable. 

But I just had a very bad fight with them, and I truly don't know what to do anymore. Thanks for reading my rant in a time of desperation. 

My biological father had depression most of his life and committed suicide the summer before I started first grade. My mother was the first to find his body, and was greatly traumatized, I think to this day she never stopped blaming herself for his death. Shortly after, she came to the US to visit family and to get away for a while, and they introduced her to my stepdad. A couple years later my mother married him and we moved to America. 

He was an alcoholic and chain-smoker, and abused my mom almost every night. I was attending an American school, had no friends, no family support, and every night after school I'd listen to him drunkenly yell at my mom to take her daughter and get out of his house, because my mom had to sell her business in order to move here, and he thought she lied to him about the money. (It was 2008 when the world economy was crashing around us, she barely paid off the debts during that financial collapse). My mom worked really hard here, she went to school and got multiple jobs and raised me the best way possible, and he would always verbally abuse her by putting her down, making fun of her English, telling her she doesn't make any money and doesn't help him with the house, when all he did was get drunk and terrorise everyone. She practically raised me on her own. 

When I was 11, he got upset during dinner because I didn't like his cooking, and he told me, right there at the dinner table, that he was going to make my life hell. When I was 13, my mom had to take care of a family matter so she flew back home for a couple weeks, and I caught a cold and missed her; he heard me crying in the middle of the night, came into my room, punched me in the stomach and told me to shut up. That same year, he got into a fight with my mom, went to push her, lost balance and cut his own leg on a laundry basket. I then heard him take his phone out to the backyard, and called the police telling them my mom hit him. Police officers showed up and took my mom to jail because he showed them the cut and insisted my mom did it. Later he defended himself by lying to her that the neighbors called the police. But I knew it was him. I heard him. I saw him. 

I was massively depressed and suicidal throughout middle school and high school because of this. Whenever he's at home, I'd get very tense and nervous, I never left my room, and jumped at every little noise in the house. If you were to walk into our house, you wouldn't even know there was a kid living here because I had no trace of existence outside my bedroom. 

I struggled to make friends in school because I was that weird kid who didn't talk to people and wore boyish clothes. I was always sleep-deprived because of the domestic abuse and never went through that phase of wanting to dressup nice as a teenager. I used to get made fun of because I didn't know English very well and misunderstood things all the time. I'm a solid writer now and professors have approached me about publishing my writing, but to this day I am still self-conscious about the way I speak and write. 

My mom grew up in a culture that sees mental illness as a taboo, so she never really understood why I behaved a certain way, nevertheless, she did the best she can to take care of me. At one time I used to resent her for not giving me the right support when I needed her the most, but now I no longer blame her. She was preoccupied with trauma, stress, her own life crises. 

My senior year in high school, shit really hit the fan. My grandparents came to see me graduate and stayed with us, for the first time in years, and he got drunk every night as usual and would loudly complain and tell my grandparents to ""fuck off"". My mom would argue with him, and I'd always drop whatever I was doing at the time and listen to them because I was afraid of him hurting her. One night I came out of my room and caught him in the hallway with my mom, about to punch her. So I intercepted and called the police. By the time they showed up, he retreated to his room and pretended nothing happened. I knew he would come at me for doing this, so I asked my mom to sleep in my room, locked the door, and had voice recorder on my phone ready to go. He tried to break into my bedroom by breaking the lock on my door with a hammer, and I had to call the police a second time while he stood by my bed with a weapon laughing like a maniac. 

The next day, I contacted a friend and asked her if I could seek sanctuary at her house. I planned to leave after driving my mom to get groceries. When we got home, he came out to my car, the car my mom bought me with money she earned, and took my car keys while I was taking groceries inside so I couldn't leave. I had to literally tackle him to get my keys back, which my mom snatched off the ground and threw to me over his head, I caught it, sprinted across the driveway, and drove away. 

This all happened during graduation month, while I was preparing for 5 AP tests and college admission. 

With the recordings we had of him threatening to kill me after I drove away, I was able to submit restraining orders for myself and my mother against him. When he showed up in court, everything he told the judge was a lie, and I just sat there listening to his bs fail to holdup. The lawyer I got us from legal aid offered to draw up divorce papers pro bono, but my mom didn't want to do it. We moved out, got an apartment, and I went to college on a fullride scholarship, where I finally had a full-blown suicidal crisis and sought therapy for three years. 

Fast forward to last year. My mom saved enough money to buy a condo in the nicer part of town. I lived there with her over the summer, where we were happy and nothing went wrong. She still hadn't divorced him yet, and I'd been trying to pursuade her. Right as summer was ending and school had started, my mom told me that he got cancer. 

He lost his job, didn't have any savings, had no money for the surgery, and had lost his house to the bank. Despite my adamant refusal, my mom took him in and paid his medical bills instead of signing the divorce papers. She took him to our home country where healthcare was affordable, and waited on him hand and foot the whole time. 

My mom has always been the only family I had in America, and even though I hated, *hated* the idea of being under the same roof as him again, she begged me to come home over break this year, so I did. 

And now I'm regretting it. He still acts the same way, after having recovered from cancer, claiming that he owns the condo, telling me to get out of his home, that I don't belong here, and fought with my mom all the time even though he's been unemployed for almost a year, expecting my mother to pay for his idea of ""starting a woodworking business"". 

He woke everyone up at 1am saying that he's going to throw my cat out the window for being annoying, and I cussed at him with all the energy I had left. 

I just can't do this anymore. What happened before I moved away really burned me out and gave me PTSD, I'm not mentally stable enough to live with him right now. I'm constantly stressed, nervous, can't sleep at night, I spend most of my waking hours outside away from him studying for the GRE. 

But I can't keep refusing my mom pleaing for me to come home and stay with her, somehow she still believes that we can be a family. She has miraculously forgiven him and wants the same from me. 

I've never had so much intense hatred for any person in my life. All of my misfortunes, up until this point in life, began the moment I met this man. I don't think my mom understands the severity of my condition, yet I hate to put the stress on her because I know she's still affected by my birth father's suicide, and she's afraid that if she left my stepdad, the same thing's going to happen to him. 

I guess I'm looking for advice on how to reconcile with this family situation and how to be able to live my own life, hopefully happy and nonsuicidal one day, without putting strain on my relationship with my mom? 

Sorry if I'm making a big deal out of this, I'm not sure what's the appropriate emotional response anymore because I've never shared this with anyone but my therapist, and all the advice I've gotten was to not make a big deal out of it. 

Thanks to anyone who finished reading this depressing autobiography. I wish you the best.",30Jun2019,1

The reason why I ask such a weird question is because I posted a picture in a different subreddit and a lot of people said I should loose weight. I’m at a healthy BMI. I guess I just need to tone up.

The left picture (watch link) on the before/after picture was my body a year ago. What should I improve about myself?

My BMI level is 22.5 so I'm still healthy, but what do you think? I'm only a male of 5'7"" so I'm pretty short. Am I what some people call ""skinnyfat""? Is being skinnyfat bad for you?

The only excercise I get is cycling, almost a hour a day. And walking of course, but that's nothing.

People never called me fat. So are they just being nice or is it the truth? I'm posting here because I don't know of another sub that would be approriate to ask a question like this.",30Jun2019,0
275,"Hi, I really need some help with figuring out what’s wrong with my grandmother. I’m really sorry for the long and all-over-the-place post I’m about to make, but to be fair I’m only 17 and this has been really confusing for me to take in.
Also, I read the rules and it says no asking medical advice, but I’m not really sure where else to ask this? 

The first time I noticed something was wrong was about 2 years ago when she would take me to my drum lessons. Every week we would drive the exact same route, but then suddenly sometimes when we’d be driving she’d begin to get extremely confused and not know how to get there and I’d have to pull out my GPS and guide her back on track. Often on the way there and the way back home, she would repeat the same stories to me or ask me the same exact questions. I went along with them, figuring she’s just getting older and is having a hard time remembering things.

Flash forward to things now, and it’s bad. For a while, her new thing was buying my family and I big bags of those Ocean Spray Craisins. It confused the hell out of all of us, as no one in the family eats them or likes them or mentions them, it was so random. There was even a time when she had come all the way to our house to deliver a bag of them because she thought we needed them. It became a running joke with my mom and I if we were going to visit, to make sure we make room for the Craisins. But quite honestly it bothered me because it was scary.

Another thing is that she looks as if she’s hollow. My grandfather dropped me off at home one day, and she was in the passenger seat. I waved goodbye to them and she stared at me with a blank expression as if she had no idea I was waving at her. I kind of shrugged it off but with the Craisin thing starting, again, I was worried. 

Recently she has been getting violent. I don’t like thinking of my grandma this way and I don’t even like saying it, but I really want to get to the bottom of this. She has started hitting my grandfather sometimes, and when my family asked her why she would do that, she replied that “it’s fun.”

She is not a violent person and never has been. Ever. My mom even attested to this. 

She also just went on two major trips. She went to Canada with my grandpa and she went to the Grand Canyon with a family friend. When she came back from Canada, I asked my grandpa how she was during it and he told me that she twiddled her thumbs the entire time on one of the tour buses and barely looked around at the scenery. 

When she came back from the Grand Canyon, I asked out family friend how it was and if they took lots of pictures. She replied “I have a whole camera roll full, but your grandma didn’t take any.”

Which is odd, because she owns a cellphone and I used to go through her camera roll to look at her pictures. She’s been on many trips and gets excited, but for these ones she seems to be apathetic.

Her “newest” thing now is threatening to leave the house. She tells my grandfather that she’s leaving, but we can’t let her do that because she’s stuck in a daze most of the time and isn’t in her right mind. She wouldn’t have any idea where she’s going. She’s been forgetting what day of the week it is. She called my mom to tell her that she went out to eat with my grandpa but she didn’t know why or something like that. Turns out it was a different restaurant than she told me mom and my grandpa had taken them out for their anniversary, but she had no idea or any recollection of that. Every time she calls us, something about her story is off and confusing.

The last example I have is when she came to my work (a movie theater) 

The family friend I mentioned before is a manager at my work and we are very close with her. Because we work at the movies, we see movies for free and she always takes my grandma. They’ve been friends since kindergarten and they are in their late 60’s now. 
I wasn’t working that day, instead I was leaving with a group of coworkers I just saw a movie with, and they were standing in the lobby. I went up to her, it seemed like she almost didn’t know who I was. I asked her what movie they were seeing and she had no clue. It truly felt like she had no idea where she was and it scares me to know that she’s so lost all the time.

The doctors say it’s depression and anxiety. She has been to multiple. I think it’s something else, maybe Dementia or even Lyme Disease? We have a family friend who had that and he suffered really strange things and he didn’t know what day of the week it was either.

My grandma retired from working for a bank a few years ago. She’s very smart, always was organized, always very clean, and always knew what to do.

A few years later, she is confused all the time, starting to get violent, not organized anymore and I guess she doesn’t clean the house like she used to be adamant about anymore.  It seems as though she is a shell. It’s like my grandma is locked away somewhere in that body. 

I’d appreciate any insight. It’s really fucking depressing. I miss my grandma and how she used to be, she is the best grandma ever and i feel like it being written off as depression and anxiety is a disgusting misdiagnosis. She’s clearly suffering something, and no one knows what it is.",30Jun2019,1

279,"So long story short, my friend and I got into quite a spat tonight. I’m not going to waste space here explaining the whole situation, but I am confident to a fair degree that most would take my side in this. We talked about it just moments ago, and we have come to at least a mutual understanding about each other‘s feelings. But earlier in anger I committed some petty revenge.

My friend, who is also my roommate, works for an engineering firm and has his own work truck. To be petty I let the air out of one of the tires, the idea being that it would inconvenience him, and cause him a bit of a headache without any real harm. I’d like to also note I was somewhat intoxicated when this happened. However now that we have talked about it, I feel a bit of guilt. It’s not something that is too serious, so I’m debating whether I should just avoid admitting to it, and possibly offer assistance if he tells me about it, or whether I should admit to it, and risk starting another fight/argument. 

There’s also the third possibility that I might try to fix the issue myself, however his truck is much larger than my car, and I don’t think I have the right tools to fix it without his assistance.Any advice is appreciated, though I  would kindly ask that you avoid passing judgment , I know it’s a shitty thing to do, and I don’t need reminding of that.",30Jun2019,1

281,"For context I am a full time student but I work three part time jobs during the academic year because I am putting myself through school. Currently I am on an academic program for the summer in another country in order to finish my degree sooner and save money in the long run. I saved up a lot of money working this past year in order to go on this program. 

Cut to yesterday. I made a friend on this program and her birthday is in a few days and she invited me to come along with her shopping for clothes. We go to this boutique and I have no intention of buying anything and just want to be there to help her pick out some clothes. While she’s in the dressing room I am idly looking at some jewelry and really like these earrings. A saleswoman comes up to me and starts talking about them and how great they would be. This store is pretty expensive and I know I shouldn’t spend that much money but I’m too shy to say anything. But I like them a lot and I haven’t bought anything fun for myself in a while. My friend comes out of the dressing room and starts telling me how much they suit me and that I should get them. I buy them and I actually love them. I wear them out of the store and feel amazing. Then we go to different places around the city until we finally go home. Once I get back home I realize that one of my earrings has fallen out. 

Usually this would not be a big deal to me and I would cut my losses, but this earring was expensive enough on my budget that it stung to have lost it already. And since I realized I lost it I’ve been inconsolable. I had my breakdown in private but I was legitimately crying over an earring and it turned into me thinking I didn’t deserve it in the first place and that I should have just saved my money. And it’s my fault for being so careless and if it really mattered to me I would have noticed when it fell out. 

My need for advice is that a spiral like this happens every time I make a mistake like this and I don’t know how to get out of it. Like I can’t just let stuff go, and it’s even worse when people try to validate my feelings by telling me it’s okay. Every time I mess up I just play these thoughts over and over in my head and I end up feeling worse. Even right now, after I told my friend about it she’s been helping me call different places to see if they have the earring because it’s pretty unique, and I can’t stop thinking that I don’t deserve to have it back or to have a friend that helps me look for it.",30Jun2019,1

283,"Sorry for the long post in advance 

For the past 6 months, I’ve been feeling kinda uneasy. Like someone is watching me or something.  But I’ve brushed it off to paranoia because I don’t know anyone who would stalk me. (I don’t have any prior relationships or confessions gone wrong)  so reasons why I think I’m being stalked is  

-my mom got weird phone calls on the home phone for about a month where the caller wouldn’t say anything for about 10 secs and then hang up. I’d never pick up my phone if I don’t know the number (even before this happened, I wouldn’t) so not sure if the same thing would happen to my phone (all in all I’d say there were about 8 calls) 

- I slept in the living room for a week and I would hear weird things like (the main door is right by the window) I would hear that knob turn (I’m a very light sleeper, the littlest sounds wake me up) my mom said that has never happened before

-my parents and sister would say they sometimes see a man outside our house and it’s happened two days in a row this time. Every time they sees a man, it’s usually when I’m home alone and they are coming home (it’s usually at night so they can’t see if it’s the same man but these passed two days he’s had the same car) everytime this man ends up running away. Yesterday he was at my front door, leaving in such a hurry that the screen door was left open. a few weeks ago there was a man just standing in front of our house and staring. 


These usually happens for a while and as far as I know these activities have been coming and going and sometimes coming back again. I don’t think a stalker would be so wishy washy? (i don’t know the word for it) but at the same time, None of this stuff is normal. As I type this I realized I’m probably just crazy but I’d still like a second opinion. Does the behavior seem questionable? Am I actually just paranoid? 

Ps- my family thinks it’s questionable but they don’t believe it’s a stalker. My parents said if they see anyone questionable action, they’ll install cameras",30Jun2019,1

287,"hello, everyone. I’m scared and my mom is in danger. My dad has been cheating on my mom for over 6 years but we never knew up until now. The problem is that we are from the middle east and that our community is stupid af. If my mom wants to get a divorce, everyone will blame her and say it’s her fault. She’ll be seen as a disgrace by her own family and she’ll never be able to return to her country again. If she tells people that my dad was the one cheating, I think my dad will kill her or someone else from my dad’s family will (because it’s a shame for him to cheat).

My dad doesn’t know that we have proof he’s been cheating. If we talk to him and show him everything, he’ll probably get very angry and demand we delete everything (then keep doing what he’s doing). It’s killing my mom she’s been crying nonstop ever since she found out. 

What should she do?

So some back story.  I was at a party with a bunch of mates, later on that night more people arrived and a few hours later we all went out to town.

Later on that night her and her friend were going to get food to eat and i went with them ( couldn't of cared less about the food we were getting, i more cared about chatting to this girl more.)  Some time later it was just me and the girl sitting in a McDonald's car park talking for another 2 hours or so about our family's and life. If your wondering why i didn't ask for her number or to see her again is because we were both drunk and a part of me didn't want to come across as ""sleazy"".

I haven't been in touch with her after because was wrapping up my studies and was looking for work in a workforce thats hard to break in to and was emotionally taken up by all of that.

315,"I need help with my shitty father being a shit pump. 

Back story: I'm 30 male. I'm the oldest of al my fathers kids (or so I'm told). He and my mom split because he was an alcoholic and a drug addict when he was younger. Next comes my half sister, let's call her Melissa. 

Melissa's mother tried to trap my dad in a relationship by getting pregnant. My dad still left her and now will not have anything to do with Melissa. This has been the arrangement for years. 

Next comes my other half sister, we will call her chloe. Chloe's mom was fucking nuts, so my dad left her. He still talks with chloe and views her as his daughter. 

Keep in mind I was estranged from him the entire time and didnt get in contact with him until a few years ago. He has sobered up and has tries to make amends, we get a long but now, as a man, I dont need him anymore. 

However, Melissa does need him. She has gone through addictions and she is still struggling to find her way. She could benefit from having a father figure, even at a distance. 

My father flat our refuses to deal with her, he calls her a user and a drug addict. How can I get him to set up.",30Jun2019,2
316,"Without going into the details of how we got here, I (32F) have found myself in becoming the confidant of a very senior colleague (50M) regarding some personal issues he has been having along with his struggle with mental health.  I like this person very much, in a purely platonic way, and as friends we get on really well.  I have made it clear than I'm always here to listen if he needs it, and it doesn't have to be under the guise of a work related conversation (which was the vehicle he was using to engineer chats before), which he seemed happy and relieved about.

&amp;#x200B;

However the more he opens up, the more I become concerned about the state of his mental health.  He has sought some professional help, but not enough in my opinion.  His external personality is very typical of a man his age with status and wealth, self-assured, confident, arrogant and little intimidating.  The disparity between what's going on on the outside and what I now know to be going on behind the scenes is really concerning. To the extent that I find myself relieved every day when I see him or hear from him that he survived the night.  He doesn't have a great support network at home, I'm not a mental health professional and I really don't know what else I can do.  I have been very frank and direct with him in telling him to get more help, but I can't physically make him go.

318,"Fist of all I know that I'm not the only one who goes through this and there are way worse things but I really don't know what to do. I'm 15 years old and my parents has been married for 14 years. I also have two siblings that are 9 and 6. Every day I have to listen to their dumb arguments over the smallest things and they are both hypocrites (say the other did/said something wrong and then do it themself). You can say that every couple argues but they do that everyday, even a few times a day. Also I hate that we're pretending to be a perfect catholic family which we clearly are not. I really am tired of this and honestly I don't know why won't they divorce. I'm not saying they should you know, it's their business. I luckily have 3 more years until I'm 18 so I'll be able to move out but I really can't stand it. What am I even supposed to do until then?",30Jun2019,6
319,"First of all, I would like to apologize for the mistakes I may make with the language. You will soon understand why I can't do this in my native language, Russian. Now, let me explain the situation: I am a 18 years old Russian boy from Moscow. My family is the typical Muscovite family, soft Рutin supporters, Orthodox Christians, conservatives... They are not the most radical traditionalist people, in fact, they are slightly more progressive than your average Russian family. However, you can be sure that, if they were American, they would be Trump and GOP voters. My father is a physician and my mother is a nurse, I am the youngest of three brothers. The oldest is very kind with me, he is a very good sibling. The second is another story. He is three years older than me and, for no reason all, has always hated me. Why? I don't now. The only thing I can say is that I haven't tried to win his love. Fuck him, he is mean and disgusting in nearly all possible ways. His name is Daniil and he much more extremist than the rest of my family. He is a hard line homophobe, who loves Putin, hates muslims and he even called Trump a leftist globalist. He is the biggest problem of my life, and you should keep this in mind. Maybe you are imagining it already, but let me be the one who say it: I am gay. With a few bi hints, by the way. Of course I am a Russian gay, deep inside the closet. After years hiding my true self I have mastered the art of deceit. Sad, isn't it? Well, I only want to live a quiet and safe life, even if I have to live in the shadows...

&amp;#x200B;

Now I will explain my plans for next week. Before starting, I have to make clear that this is not a love story, but a family one. Eleven years ago my grandfather died, and he left a good inheritance that caused serious problems in my father's family. The seven siblings cut the relationship, and they haven't talked to each other until last April. Then my father and one of his brothers resumed the relationship, I don't know why.  But everything has gone very well, to the point that we have been invited to spend a few weeks at their home in Kaliningrad. They lived in Moscow until 2010, so I was in contact with them ultil 2008. They are a married couple with two sons, one of them, the youngest, is extremely close to my age (his birthday is July 19, mine is July, 22). Being that close in age, we were also close as friends. We weren't the best friends, but we were friends for all that. I remember him as a kind and warm boy. 

&amp;#x200B;

And here is my worry: for several weeks I have been feeling bad with myself. I feel that I should share my worries and problems with someone, but you already know that it isn't an easy task for me. If I'm going to do it, I must carefully choose the person, because, as I have previously said, the Russian society is not very open to the idea of homosexuality...

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, this boy, let's call him Alex, texted me unexpectedly. He said that my father gave my number to his father, and that he was very happy to have contact again. We shared some anecdotes and talked about our lives. He was exactly as I remembered, a very kind boy who didn't have any prejudices. So I have startig to wonder if he could be the appropriate person for me to share my true self. However, I must be very cautious. I don't want to turn my life into a hell because of a poor judgment. I have only texted with him for a few minutes, so I don't really know him. What I know is that my brother Daniil and his brother have always been close. They are very similar in what concern to the social thought. So, if Alex at the end is not like it seems, he could tell to his brother about my sexuality, and his brother would surely tell to mine that I am gay. And my brother would tell that to the whole country.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to start a new relationship with him and then tell him about me when I'm sure, so if I don't tell him by the start of our holidays, next friday, I won't do it. Let me say that I don't feel good about myself, having to lie and manipulate the people I love (and Daniil), but you also have to understand that I don't live in Brooklyn or New Hampshire, but in Putin's Russia, so the ''just be yourself and get out of the closet fearless'' is not really the advice I'm looking for. I have to say that Kaliningrad, my destiny and a Russian enclave in Europe, is somewhat less retrograde than the rest of Russia, so the risks are smaller and if things go wrong, I could think some plan to move forward when I return to Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that being said, I wonder: Should I tell Alex that I'm gay? 

I understand that this is a difficult situation, so if someone can help me, I would be very grateful. Thank you anyway for paying attention to my problem.",30Jun2019,1
320,"Over the last few months, my life's been really good. My job is going strong, my family loves me, I got a bomb-ass computer and everything, like things are doing alright. However on the inside my minds been racing with a combination of rage and ego. I've been feeling like my head's filled up with something but I just don't know what. My mind's been doing crazy things and I think the worst thing is how I think of killing people from time to time even if the reason is completely ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

Like, as an example, I'll be at work and let's say a few kids a little younger than me, so like, 15, come up to me and start messing with me. Nothing too physical or anything, just like one line about how they're going to sneak back in or something stupid. On the outside, I'm calm, completely fine and just chilling, but in my head, in this theoretical situation I'd think up something along the lines of ""It's amazing that people as smart as you are allowed to be kept alive in this country; You're worthless, and I can't understand why your parents haven't abandoned you yet. If it were up to me, if I were the president or something, I'd make sure people like you, who have such a low IQ as you, get massacred in order to make the world a smarter place."" Then I imagine how I'd kill them and get away with it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my mind doesn't think it's ridiculous. My mind just thinks it's the logical next step society needs to take to become a smarter place. I feel like it's my duty to cleanse the earth of people who can't function or can't realize the difference between right and wrong. My mind justifies this by saying that it'll solve so many global issues like overpopulation and that I'll make robots taking over common jobs not matter because every human who has a job will be smart enough to get a better job than the jobs the robots are taking and shit like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where my hatred stems from. I'm a 17 y/o kid and I hide in my room 24/7 so I probably won't become Hitler 2.0, and I already know that murder is stupid and will ruin my life, so I'm definitely not going to kill anyone anyway. However, the fact that I want to kill people in the first place is the problem. I just constantly feel like I see people below me and it enrages me that it feels like there are only a few people who're smarter than me. I mean, when I look at the facts, 120 IQ is pretty high but there aren't just a few people who're above me; There are lots, but for some reason, I still feel the way I feel which completely contradicts my mind always telling me that logically, yes, I am smarter than the average person, but the facts say I'm definitely not one of the few smart people alive today. My mind's a hypocrite, thinking one way, feeling the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't want to hate people so badly, and I want to know what I should do to solve my internal predicament.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I don't rage out loud; It's all internal. When I talk about these radical thoughts out loud I speak as if I was having a normal conversation; Like my opinion is so justified that there's no reason that I should get externally heated over it. All of the rage is in my head.

\-Same maintenance also stole a dirty Tupperware bowl from my sink, complaint was made to management and nothing has been done

330,"So around early March, I had a bad cold, possibly sinus infection. It last longer than usual, almost two weeks. I had all the cold symptoms under the sun. But normally I heal quickly.

In the weeks following, my sense of smell and taste lagged longer than usual. I started regaining stronger tastes and smells like tomato sauce and pineapple juice. Still cant smell or taste subtle things. But then I started getting this weird ""gasoline"" smell whenever I experienced a new odor. For example, when I entered a new room.

Last week, I went to an ENT specialist, who didn't seem that concerned. He looked up my nose and said I have some swelling, so he prescribed me prednisone for a week and told me to return in two weeks.

My medication ended today, and I no longer get the gasoline smell BUT a faint weird ""popcorn"" scent in almost everything. My sense of smell is still pretty weak, but my taste has returned about 70% overtime. I read about phantosmia and am afraid I may have gained that permanently.

 We've never talked about being in a relationship or putting a label, we were just together and it was going great. We still hang out and are just as close as before without any of the affectionate touching and I miss it, I miss having her. We've talked about it and she says she is attracted to me, still wants me, still likes me and still wants to be with me but just can't be because she has a hard time with her emotions. She hasn't had the best experiences with her previous relationships so I can understand her shying away from her emotions or accepting them. It's just all too difficult to come to terms with after being with her romantically and then losing all of that in a matter of seconds out of nowhere.

I've asked her if she would like space, if she didn't want to hang out or talk as much but she says she doesn't want anything to change. It has been a month and a half since then and it hurts to hold back my feelings for her, to not be able to express myself to her and to kiss her and hold her like I once did. We talked the day before yesterday about it all again and she still says the same thing, that she still likes me and she wants us to try again to be together but can't tell me when.

I've asked our closest friends what to do and I've gotten both ""if she's worth the wait, wait."" And ""Give up, move on. If she wants you, she wants you."" But it hurts to wait and I don't want to give up.

335,"Long story short, I’ve had a rough life and an especially rough childhood. Circled the drain of the foster care system, suffered every kind of abuse from those appointed to protect me. I worked really, really hard to beat the statistics and become who I am today.

The last three years of my life have been incredible. I managed to land a scholarship at a crazy good private college and graduated on top. Landed my dream job at a great workplace that paid well. There I met the love of my life. After a year at that company, my love and I moved to New Zealand for the ski season, and moved back home in the summer and I landed and even better job. I started my own business (not an mlm lol) which is flourishing incredibly. My love and I travelled a lot and got our own place and a kitty and life was great. I never knew I could ever feel this happy. When I first met my love, I tried really hard to push him away; I was so scared of letting someone in and getting hurt again. I was a firm believer that ‘it’s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all’ was complete crap. I knew I had to guard myself, because letting my walls down and getting hurt could destroy me. 

For three years, I felt so incredibly happy. Then, a few weeks ago, my partner sat me down with his car packed of all his belongings and told me he didn’t love me anymore and had felt that way for a while. He was moving to the snow for 4 months and wanted a clean break. 

It destroyed me, like I knew it would. I had built my whole life and future around this person. He had promised he would love me forever, he promised me everything. He helped pull down my walls and assured me that he wasn’t going anywhere. I know people change, and they sometimes don’t understand the promises they’re making when they’re making them, but those promises meant a huge deal to me. My trust has been crushed. 

We ended up meeting up few weeks later, and chatting more and we decided to give everything another shot (sounds odd, but he had lied when he said he didn’t love me anymore, and the break up was because he panicked about how serious everything was getting etc etc etc). Dont heaps want to get into it all, but we’re working on it all.

I feel like I should be happy; I got him back! We’re communicating well and I am certain we will become better than ever.

But. I feel like everything’s changed. I can’t stop thinking about how easy it was for him to give up on me, and all I can think about is how easy it was for everyone else in my life to give up on me. My birth father left us when I was three. My mother took us to community services when I was seven and told them to find better homes for us. I lived in 40 different homes, and I lived in 3 for two years. After two years, all three told me the same thing; I was too much and they wanted to leave.

My whole life, I’ve been unwanted, unloveable and a burden. I feel like I’m not worth much, because it’s always been so easy for people to leave me. My two best friends ‘broke up with me’ in the last year (one stole my card and racked up a bunch of purchases, and the other lived with me and refused to pay any bills, leaving me with $2k owed to me when the lease ended and has refused to pay any of it back). I try so hard to be loveable to people, but they all end up leaving and I don’t know what to do.

So I guess I want advice on this: how do I find my self worth? Because right now, I don’t feel like I’m worth a lot. I know that I can’t depend on one person to show me my self worth, and I need to learn how to love myself, but it’s so hard when everyone in my life has given up on me - like maybe if I was worth more, they wouldn’t have abandoned me so easily. 

I just want to be happy. I want everything with my partner to work out, and I think a big part of that is learning how to love myself so all that’s not on him.",30Jun2019,1

At that point, when my friends turned to go and started walking he pushed me up against the wall and started choking me.

341,"Need unbiased opinions/advice 

Here’s the deal, I’m 24 Years old minimal schooling (60 college credits just enough for the job that I thought I always wanted) and pretty much hit a fork in the road where I’m having trouble deciding which way to go in my life and career. I can’t ask my family for advice because they all have the 9-5 normal job type, play it safe type mindset so they keep on telling me just stick with what I’m doing and continue being unhappy.  I started a  door/lock repair business when I was 21 (family trade) and it took off pretty fast. My first full year in business I topped over a 100k in profit after taxes were paid and everything. Life was great at this point, had a ton of easy money coming in , enjoyed time with family and friends and really had no complaints about life. This is where things get complicated, It was after that where I also got a job in law enforcement which I thought was always my dream job. Top pay slightly over 100k 5 years in , good pension and decent health care. The thing is I’m absolutely miserable now, I barely have a life , never see my family and lucky if I get 1 or 2 days a week to see my girlfriend. Currently in a stretch of 12 straight days without a day off and it feels like it’s all for nothing being that base pay is crap. I barely bring home 500$ a week right now. My commute is 2.5 hours back and forth on a good day and each shift is 8.5 hours assuming you don’t get stuck on something and actually get out on time (rare). Basically leaves me with time to go to the gym and that’s it. There’s days we’re the job isn’t so bad and even kinda fun but for the most part I hate every second I’m there. The business is still running as I have family members doing the the work under me however with me not able to put any effort into things it’s slowly dwindling. (With minimal work I can get it back to how it did the first full year ) Do i take the chance and go back to my business full time where nothing is ever guaranteed and have no pension and no healthcare or even job security in the far future or continue being miserable with my job just because of the job security?",30Jun2019,1

Interior designers and Architects of Reddit “I hope you’re having a great day” I have some questions for you

ME: I just finished my bachelor in interior design, I’ve studied AutoCad 2-3D, ArchiCad21 and i have a vague idea what 3dsMAX is. I personally use ArchiCad for everything, but in the décor aspect it's been a little limiting.

I did some research in which software are the best but it only made my brain into mush and i can't think straight anymore so i thought i'd ask here for a final thought.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

"" Talking about the EU ""

1- which software should i use as an interior designer? 

2- is Archicad a good choice overall to stay on and perfect it?

   ""I see people saying that Revit is the new way up""

3-which Master program do you recommend?

So, I started writing a novel a while ago. I actually came close to the end of it. Instead if finishing it, I started wiriting another one.

Fast foward 2 years... I now have 4 unfinished novels. For two of them they are missing the last chapter, and I have what I want to write all in my head already. I also have dozens of close to finished stories, erotica etc. I want bring myself to finish them. The goal is to be a published author, naturally. 

I've always been very sub-par when it comes to anything. Mainly for a lack of effort. Despite encouragement from all my family and friends whom, love my writings and success with a blog that I used to write. I can't bring myself to finish them.

Writing has always been my hobby and passion. The one thing that connects me to everything. To be honest, I've been having an existential crisis my whole life. I truthfully don't know myself outside of writing. That's where the fear comes, because if I were to publish and they fail. I feel like I would take it hard.

The situation is that I have minimal bills (shared rent, phone bill, internet, psn, groceries, etc.) which average out to about how much I make through the PJ (piano job), so the FJ (fruit job) is really only there to help give me a little extra to spend and save, but I can admit I need to have a secondary income either way.    I loved working at the FJ originally, but staff changes and poor management have made me sour about working there, and I honestly never thought delivering fruit could be so damn stressful at times.

I'm sorry if this post comes across as aggressive or biased, I'm trying to make it as neutral as possible.

​

So my brother (25) after finishing university has been trying to get a job for about a year now and after having no luck finding a job while applying from home (in a different continent), him and my father (66) suggested that he should move to London and apply for jobs there since he'd have better luck if he could actually make physical interviews. Even though my Dad is in between jobs, he was fine with financing all of this as long as it means that my brother would eventually find a job.

​

When either of us are living away from home, my parents generally send both me and my brother £120 weekly while also paying for rent separately. This money is to be used for stuff like food, travel, going out or literally anything, it's a pretty generous amount of money and I usually manage to save a lot of money because of that. We even get extra money to get ourselves presents for out birthdays. We also have a (kind of) agreed pay day between us and our Dad, but sometimes he might send it a few days late which isn't much of a big deal anyway.

​

So his first week there, my brother asks my Dad for an extra £20 for transport or something and then another extra £50 so he could pay for a gym membership (he is into bodybuilding), my Dad was a bit skeptical to do it, but he did it anyway and chalked it up to my brother adapting to his new life.

​

And then this week, on the day he was supposed get his money, he messaged our Dad a day before the usual pay day and asked him to send his money. My Dad was taken aback by it and asked him what he spent all of his money on, and he said that he spent it on food and transport or something like that. If this was the first time this happened, I think my Dad would've been more understanding of it, but he did the same thing consistently throughout his 4 years of university as well, and my Dad kept giving him second chances. So my Dad told him to wait a few hours. He then asked for his birthday money from our Mom and so my Dad got frustrated and told him to wait a few days.

​

He reacted by asking my Dad stuff like ""How do I know I can trust you to send the money"" which my Dad found disrespectful, so he responded by asking him about why he's more focused on getting money than searching for a job. So my brother starts talking about how he felt like he was wronged because he expected to get the money on the pay day and he planned his spending around that.

​

My Dad got increasingly frustrated and told him something to the effect of ""You need to learn the consequences of your spending"" and my brother kept pressing him for the money and essentially trying to guilt trip him into sending him money. My Dad then asks him why I never ask for my money so persistently, to which my brother responded ""Don't compare me to him"".

​

At this point, my Dad is fed up, so he didn't respond to him, so my brother stats messaging me and my Mom about it, asking us to talk some sense into him. We (Me, Mom, Dad) all talked about it amongst ourselves and even put him on the phone, and told him that he was being disrespectful and that he was spending irresponsibly. After that, he started pleading for a chance to show that he could be responsible with money, which he'd been given before, so my parents got angry and hung up the phone.

​

So the next day, I wake up to the sound of my phone getting hundreds of notifications of my brother begging for me to convince our Dad to send him money and I got really angry. I completely went off on him, calling him a leech and a child (and a lot of other mean shit) and then he responds by (of all things) making jokes about his situation, and saying stuff like ""I'm starving"" and ""I've been rejected from so many jobs"" and even some stuff about suicide unironically.

​

Maybe I could've dealt with this situation better, but I have dealt with this same situation so many times that I'm sick of it. I told him ""to go fuck yourself"" and that he was ""the most manipulative piece of shit I've ever met"". He then asked me how he was being manipulative which pissed me off even more so I then searched through our message history of all the times he'd mentioned 'suicide' and 'starving' to refresh his memory on the messages he'd sent 10 minutes ago.

​

It turns out that we had the **exact same conversation** 3 years ago. Our Dad got angry about him pestering him for money and then he responded with threatening suicide. After sending him screenshots of proof of him being manipulative, he kept asking me how he could aplogise to our Dad and I told him to figure it out himself because there wouldn't be any point in me making an apology script for him.",30Jun2019,1

367," Not sure if that’s the right term, let me explain: I don't know how to spontaneously connect the dots when dealing with people and I assume everyone means what they say and do / says and do what they mean. 

**Here’s what I mean:**

\&gt; I ask the cashier for change, I hand him one $10 bill and he tells me he only has two $5 dollar bills and that he doesn’t have any $1 bills. I tell him it’s fine, I’ll take whatever change you have. He opens the register and asks me to look, to verify that he really only has two $5 bills. I didn’t mind, I just wanted change. I took the bills when I shouldn’t have because he’s a cashier and he’s going to need that change more than I do and that he was just too polite to say so himself. He didn't let me peek at it to prove anything, he just couldn't lose the change he has. I didn’t connect the dots until later. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; M is the shortest kid in my science class. We were sitting in the lab, when our professor moved to the white board to explain some stuff. All my classmates piled up in the front, and so they took all the free seats within arms reach. I’m too lazy to grab a stool so I stood behind them, and I could see the board just fine. M was already sitting behind me. She got up and got me a chair from the end of the lab. I assumed she was being nice because she occupied the seat I was in before she got here. She wasn’t. She got me a seat so that I sit down so that she can see the board. She was too nice to tell me to move. I didn’t connect the dots then and I was too focused on the lesson instead.

Now to last night. We were supposed to go to some club with or friends but plans changed, another guy dropped out so it was just the four of us friends. We go to one guy's house but didn't really do anything and she and her friend go out back for like 30 minutes. I then go outside to see what's up and there I walk in on them making out.. It was a mix of emotions but after that I immediately walked outside and told my friend to drive me home. She texted/called but I haven't responded and don't really want to

Since my mom started becoming “spiritual” when i was 13 it did put a strain on our relationship and i was angry with her for a long time, i still am in certain ways. I’m not angry because she believes in that stuff, i am angry because of how she has acted in the past and is currently acting because of it. In a lot of ways this has taken over her life.   

She writes a lot of “weird” things on her facebook that other people have commented on as weird in the past, and we argued a lot about that when i was younger and i basically told her to unfriend everyone that knows me, because i was so embarrassed about the things she was writing. I can’t remember exactly what it was, but it was a lot of texts about spirituality and one time something about aliens. One time i remember we had a really big fight about this and i was crying and begging her to not write those things on Facebook for people we know to see. We are not friends on facebook, i have blocked her a long time ago, and none of my friends are friends with her but she is still friends with some old family friends (my fathers whole family unfriended her).  

She also has a lot of online friends that believes the same things as her, and because my mom is so naive she is not careful at all with who she talks to. One time someone tricked her to spend money, and another time one of her facebook “friends” started writing some really weird things to her, that he wanted to marry her and he loved her etc, I don’t know what her facebook looks like now, or what she’s writing because it would just trigger my anxiety if i were to look at it. To be honest i don’t want to know. I remember she told me when i was younger once that i would understand when i get older, and that the only reason i’m feeling that way is because i have “feelings deep rooted inside me that i need ti deal with” and i was really angry with her for saying that because i know i would feel the same way in 10 years, and i still do.  

She can’t watch movies anymore, because she can’t handle seeing any type of violence which she had no problems with before she became “spiritual”. If a violent scene comes up (even something very mild) she covers her eyes and sighs. This to be honest really annoys me and has ever since she started doing this. It is pretty distracting when we are watching a movie and something barely happens, and she covers her eyes. I don’t know why she does this, or why it interferes with her spirituality.  

She sleeps bad most nights, and she says it’s because of what she is going trough with her spirituality. She has had the same problems and told me the same thing ever since she started with her spirituality.  

We sometimes get into fights because she will mention something about her beliefs or her spirituality and say it as facts and i get annoyed at her. She tells me these things like it’s absolute fact.  

Those are just examples, but there are many things that are similar, and we have argued a lot about these things pretty much my entire life. It’s really hard to explain the situation, but i wish things were different. I wish she never got into those things, because of the strain it has put on our relationship and our entire family.  

At on point when i was 14 - 16 we were fighting a lot and i was angry at her all the time because of her spirituality that basically took over her entire life. She divorced my dad because of her spirituality (maybe not the entire reason why, but a lot of it was because of that.).  Basically my whole dads family thinks her behavior is weird and their relationship is awkward because of that. One time they even tried to talk her out of it. 

I don’t know how to deal with it. I have accepted the situation but i have started to feel annoyed at her again. I feel like i have a lot of feelings deep inside me from years ago when we were fighting a lot.",30Jun2019,1

382," So the title may make this sound worse than it is, but essentially I think a girl is slutty and I know that it's a bad idea to have I just don't know how to stop feeling that way.

So some backstory. And as an ahead a lot of this will be rather personal, and yes I know at the end of the day it isn't my business, but i'm trying to change a bad opinion and that's why i'm trying to speak candidly. I will straight up say all my thoughts in the hopes that maybe there’s a crucial core to my feelings that people can help me change. I have kept a lot of this bottled up, so I apologize if it’s long and there’s unnecessary detail.

My friend, let's call her Nancy (31F), and I (M23) have been friends for a little under a year. It is a platonic relationship, although admittedly I may have had some feelings for her in the past, but I am over such feelings. I feel people will get caught up on this, but I can assure none of the following is rooted in previous feelings. Now I genuinely like Nancy as a friend, I agree on her with a lot of stuff and we came from similar backgrounds. That said there is one thing I really kind of disagree on, her view of relationships.

It's hard to explain in so many words, but she essentially views relationships as very disposable. Not to say she doesn't put effort into them, just that she has blatantly said she really doesn't ever expect a relationship to last and she's okay with it. I personally disagree, but i've never quite said as much to her.

Secondly, and this is what I really want to change. I can't really shake the feeling that I kind of think she's slutty. Before I really dive into that, let me be clear, I don’t think it’s wrong to have sex be it with a committed relationship or honestly a hookup on occasion, I feel she’s slutty for some mixed reasons. Let me explain why. Part of the reason I suppose is because she low key slut shames, she trash talks girls who dress provocatively, and she trash talks people who sleep around even though when asked she'll say she doesn't care if people do. I've known her for under a year and in that time she's had two committed relationships yet she's slept with around 5 guys. I know it's the modern era and all, but truth be told I guess I kind of do feel that's a decent amount for under a year when a good chunk of that year supposedly she was monogamous. 

She does this thing where she’ll be mostly seeing one person, even sleeping with them, but still dates on the side stating that they aren’t exclusive. Supposedly she doesn’t sleep with the guys she sees on the side, but I guess I just generally feel uncomfortable with that set up. I feel it’s unfair to the main guy that she still sees others, and its unfair to the other guys that she’s simultaneously screwing with someone else.

She also is really wishy washy with owning up to how many people she's slept with. As friends we shoot the shit and the topic has come up a few times, and she's changed her answer from as low as 9 to the high teens. And to me it seems kind of weird to either not know or to purposefully change the number so drastically. 

I will be square. The number of people she slept with isn't exactly sky high even if it is say 19, supposedly she didn't lose her virginity until her late teens if not at 20. Then she was supposedly in a totally monogamous relationship for 5 non-consecutive years. So with the 5 in the last year, 12 people over 5 years isn't bad I suppose, I mean yes I’ll be honest it does still seem somewhat on the high side to me but I guess part of it is the people she has slept with.

The most recent guy she went on her first date with and four days later I know she was sleeping with him. Before that I don't know the exact timing, but I believe it was within a week of meeting the guy also. One of the last guys she was dating she knew had slept with over 40 women, and she shames him for it, yet she still was with him for a good little bit of time. Lastly I suppose I’m kind of uncomfortable with the fact that she essentially had a fuck buddy for 5 non-consecutive years while she still dated other people.

To kind of wrap things up while we were hanging out once I was looking for something and opened her nightstand drawer to find tons of condoms, a deck of sex position cards, some weird pills, sex toys, and some sex outfits. In total fairness there’s nothing wrong with any of this stuff, and it is totally normal stuff to have, I guess just kind of going back to how she can low key slut shame I found it a bit hypocritical to have so much stuff specifically geared for sex.

So all of this is to say, well yes I kind of think she’s slutty but at the same time I know that’s a wrong and unfair opinion to have. I want to get over this opinion, but it’s hard to when everyone’s answer is essentially “what she does is her business.” I agree, but it doesn’t change my feelings and I really would like to as I do still see her as a good friend.

TL;DR My friend has slept with not a ton but a decent amount of people and has some views on relationships I disagree with. I have reserved feelings she’s slutty but I know I shouldn’t think that way.",30Jun2019,1

385,"We don’t know exactly how long it has been, but my gf has noticed a guy stalking her.

We are from Sydney Australia, and in the last two weeks, my gf has noticed this one guy always following her when she goes to work by train and when I pick her up after her train ride home. I drop her off at the train station in the morning and pick her up when she returns home in the evening, as I work locally. But that hour long train ride, he is usually in the same cab.

At first, she noticed him and thought he just happened to stop at the same train stations in the morning. And coincidentally finishes work at the same time and ends up at the same train station in the evening. It’s not unusual to see regulars at the train station or on train. But it wasn’t until she started being aware of him, and noticed she caught eye contact with him, as if he is always watching her. He would always be in close vicinity to her. If she doesn’t see him, she would have a glance behind or around her, and would actually find him looking at her. She thinks he has been taking photos on his phone, as it’s always in his hand (not unusual), but she feels something is off.

I still haven’t yet seen his face, but have seen him. He is usually wearing casual clothes, not office wear like majority of people travelling to the city are going.

The last straw for me at the moment, was that we left earlier for work than her usual time for the week. She hasn’t see him, but then last Friday, she has seen him on her lunch break, close to where she works, just casually “walking by”. At this point, we are beyond coincidences. He has been around at the start of the day, at her work during the day, and stops at the same train station at the end of the day. I’m just very wary that he might follow us home one day and find where we live.

He hasn’t done anything yet, but the situation has become concerning. I’m not sure if I should confront him, and demand to see the last photos on his phone.  But so far he has been keeping a distance, and it’s making my gf very nervous and anxious. 

She has even started to have nightmares. It’s beginning to affect her mental well being, and it is getting worse. When we went out this weekend, I noticed she would be on edge in the car ride. She would be slouched down in the seat, silent and just scanning her eyes around out the car window. She didn’t seem comfortable at the restaurant we were eating at. There were moments when she seemed to have forgot and relaxed a little, but I fear it’s gonna affect her more. I’ve tried to comfort her, but i know I can’t always be there. it’s the work days that are of concern as I’m not around to help. And if he has followed us home, thats what is worrying me, as there are times she is home alone.

We have nothing to go to police with.  No photos of him, no names, just a description. And there hasn’t been any incidences, just the far too numerous sightings of him in the same public space. But if we told police, I feel like he has an alibi for being at the train station. But what could he be charged with anyway? We feel so helpless in this situation.

What can we do?
I’m not scared of him, just scared of what he can or might do. Should I talk to him? Would that scare him away? Should I intimidate him?

I thought about turning it around, and start following him somehow, so we know where he lives. Maybe recruit a friend to help. 
We need advice on how to resolve this, so it doesn’t escalate to something worse for my gf.",30Jun2019,3
386,"I've been told ""when the other person can't meet your needs in the relationship anymore"".

I met this guy, let's call him Steve.  Steve was a really sweet guy.  I felt like I could be really open with him over text.  When we first spent time together, I could ACTUALLY talk to him (which is very rare for me w new people)

When we had sex, it was really good for me because I felt heard, safe, beautiful, and cared for (which is also kind of rare for me, at least this year)  I was just really happy.  I got emotional and I was kind of embarrassed abiut it.  He said that it was okay to be emotional.  And he held me.  That was weeks ago

And now, the bad stuff.
He keeps pushing me away now.  Like we've had these arguments that just leave me so sad and conflicted.  On two occasions we've said goodbye to each other over text during these heated arguments and then he always comes back and apologizes.

We've only been dating for 3-4 weeks and he says he doesn't want me to be with other people.  The thing that prompted him to break things off the second time was that I told him I met a girl and talked to her for a bit and that I'd probably cuddle her at some point.  He told me that I should be open with him about that stuff but he lost his shit when I was.  He apologized and said that he thought he was doing me a favor by breaking things off.  Maybe I should've let him.

He stood me up last week.  He said that he'd forgotten about me til the last minute then kept me waiting for an hour before saying that he wouldn't make it.  He's cancelled on me last minute on 3 occasions in the last 2 weeks.  He was late to our date this week.

I find myself trying not to talk to him in order to maintain an emotional equilibrium/ avoid disappointment. I tried to do that this weekend with everything unnecessary til my homework for the week was done and ended up going back on it.  And I went back on it. He texted and I responded.  We made plans and he reneged on them.  
I wasn't even that disappointed because this has become so commonplace.  I think I might've answered this one for myself.  I think this is over, at least for me.  I don't know. And maybe I'm leaving a lot out or didn't explain well enough, but yeah.  What do you think?",30Jun2019,3

390,I recently got left by my girlfriend. This was because she still lived with her parents. She was homeless when I met her .

I don't go to her house because her parents freaked out call the police every time I show up.

So on that day I decided that everybody deserves to be loved and I was going to love her. it was awesome we had a great relationship and then we argued over silly stuff every now and then and you know we mainly talked about everything we talked about everything. This woman became my best friend and I promised her that I would never give up on her. it is to the point now where I'm still in so much pain inside cuz I'm not being able to talk to her or see her or be around her that I don't want it anymore I don't want this pain I tried to find her on different social websites I've tried calling old numbers I'll try calling her family's I've tried I tried getting ahold of her and it's like she just disappeared anyways it's been months and I'm tired of hurting do I let her go do I give up what do I go from here.,30Jun2019,0

he just wouldn’t stop that i got a little bit scared and i started escaping ( for the past years he would suddenly physically hurt me, like hitting me and suddenly throwing his freaking hard toys)  and i felt the need to drink water. after getting a glass, he took it from me and started to try splashing it in the floor, which i stopped him to. i tried to place it in the counter, but he was a strong kid that i couldn’t let his hand  go— i just got pissed at the moment that i let my grip go and let the water be thrown at him, in which he got mad at me ( understandable ), and i immediately regretted it, i was also shocked myself because of what happened, i didn’t know what to fucking do.


he left the house using his bike which i eventually followed, i started saying sorry but he just kept saying that he doesn’t hear anything and “you threw water at me” 

it got resolved, thankfully, but i still feel guilty about it and i’m crying rn

400,"Break down: 

- 1st friend: 26 years old still lives with parents with no Drivers License. Insists we drive him every where we go with a thank you probably 20% of the time with no gas money. Always wants us or tries to get us to pay for him. Goes job to job as well randomly deciding not to show up to one randomly then moves to the next one. 

Also belittles us constantly with comments constantly about us being a ""little b*tch"" etc. So I decided to confront friends about it and we all agreed it's best to cut ties with him. 

- 2nd friend: Lives with his grandma at 25, agreed to what I said about friend 1. Never goes out of his way for anyone ultimately leaving me to do the driving for a friend in town while he and friend 1 smoke pot as I drive 40 minutes to get to them. 

Ended up telling friend 1 what I said upsetting friend 1 and also causing a questionable relationship with me. Ignores me when I'm texting to hang out or call to hang out. Only comes to me mainly when he wants something. Doesn't seem to care much towards me. 

- 3rd friend(actually my roommate): She's in an open relationship with her girlfriend and my other roommate. Known her for a while like 10 years. Open relationship is rough on the two of them as they're both very jealous and get very sad about it when the other is out with their side partner. So they vent to me and I just try to let them know maybe this open thing isn't for them. They still go for it and problems consist. Now friend 3 wants to break up with her, but has been saying that for months. 

She doesn't reply to my messages either here and there about wanting to hang out and leaves me on read. I've paid for countless drinks and food for her as we have hung out in the past. We do get along, but I can't help, but feel this...tension between us? Not sure why she's kept me on read multiple times and I'm never pushy about it either, but it bothers me. 

- Friend 4: Drank a lot together and was one of my best friends and agreed with everything on friend 1 actually confronting him one drunk night about how he treats him like sh*t. We had each others backs and he has now left for the navy. Really glad for him. Sadly couldn't really trust him with girlfriends though because he will slyly try to flirt with them (caught by my twin brother) and called out by me towards my girlfriend. 

- Me: Work full time grave and drink about once a week while I did drink a lot back in the day, but slowed it down just to take better care of myself. I can be a bit of a goofball and try not offend anyone at any time. I'm trying really really hard to improve myself and go to the gym 6 times a week, eat healthy, keep busy with a start up podcast I'm wanting to work on. Travel to places such as Disneyland, New York City, and even recently London for the first time by myself. It just really really hurts that I don't feel like I have a solid foundation to come back home to. 

I'm there for them as much as I can(except friend 1), but I do feel this kind of disconnect from each one? Like they're only there with me because they had nothing else to do rather than wanting to be there...I try to mainly reach out and support them with anything they have going on and ask ""that's awesome, what's next?"" For them and I'm not even pushy about it. But they vent to me about issues and leave it at that after a night of ""well let's get you off your feet and start doing things! Taking action!"" Then I won't see them for weeks. 

Maybe I'm the issue? Push them too hard? Come off to clingy with a text at least once a week to see how they're doing? 


Re-reading this I don't feel like there's anyway I can be the a$shole here, I just mainly needed to vent I suppose. Frustrating part of my life.

401,"Hi guys, I’m new here, but I feel like this is a safe environment to share your current situations and get some advice. I feel like it’s quite evil, unfair, and perhaps illegal? 

You see, I (18 y/o f) left my house without saying and went across the US on a plane to see the love of my life (38 y/o m). We met about 4 months ago online. My whole house went bananas. They thought I was missing, despite me calling and telling them I’m in NY (not true, but that was my plan of telling them.) I only talked to my mom, I told her that I’m leaving Thursday night, but she got so upset and told me they wanted me to be home immediately. I never called back because I was upset, however, I did call one of my family members to come pick me from a bus station. My family was crying as if I was dead when I was a the bus station. They asked me about where I was, and so many questions. Little did I know they filed a missing person file at the police station Friday, my sister has a huge advantage since she’s a detention officer. So, they immediate located me and everything, and found out I wasn’t in NY. She found out the truth, took my phone away for further investigation, my family made me delete most of my social media accounts (I only have one left which I’m allowed to keep), and told me that I’m no longer allowed to practice my faith and spirituality because he’s also a practicer. I’m being monitored and shoved down a forced religion on me. Which I believe it’s cruel and illegal, right? I was genuinely happy with him, because I finally saw that there’s a whole world out there besides my room and my traditions. My self-esteem was fully restored, I laughed, I smiled, and I was with him. I was the luckiest girl in the world! But when I went home, goodbye to my prior life and true joy. Now, I’m really depressed and I feel like I’ll never be happy again or see him either. He’s not a bad guy, he’s sweet and very respectful, plus, he presented me to his mom on the first day I got there. My family saw otherwise. Even my mom said that if she could, she’d set him on fire. That’s much they hate him. ’m also being placed on therapy because the letter I left behind was extremely depressing. Oh and to make things a bit more worse, they thought he drugged and raped me, which I know didn’t happen. Which lead to get blood work done and went a gynecologist to check me. Gosh, it’s so awful and I just to want cry, and wish there was a sort of time machine to go back in time and stay with him forever.

I’m not sure what to do now, I don’t want to restart my life like my family wants me to. I’m not happy. I just want to back with him, he even told me I can be enrolled in college over there and he will take care of things. I even got a promising starting career over there if I wish to work as I’m in school, 28 an hour? Sign me up! Anyway, I just want some guidance and advice.

I live with my girlfriend who has three cats.  They wake me up somewhere between 4:30 and 5:30am every day for breakfast.  I say “me”because she will just roll over and try to enjoy some terrible restless sleep. They have also trained my dog to do the same.  My dog would sleep until I woke up to eat but now she has become a knucklehead too. 

I know this seems like some easy advice but...my girlfriend is crazy.  I will tell you all the things that I have suggested that she refuses to do. 

Get automatic feeders (they need wet food in the morning...wtf)
Lock them out of the bedroom.
Lock them in a far away room to sleep at night.  

I am looking for ways to “manipulate”the situation to change.  Some of the things that I am considering are -

Sleeping in the guest bedroom until this changes.  
Leaving the house everyday at 5:30 when I get woken up (she has trust issues)
Pretending to fall asleep from exhaustion right before we are supposed to go out.  

Any advice is appreciated.  And don’t brother with “get rid of the cats”because I am a huge animal lover and would never do that.   

But please help - I am miserable.

I was genuinely considering asking her out, but I decided against it because I've thought that people asking others they know irl over an app would be awkward/weird. Is this generally the case or just a myth?

Also, this occurred almost a month ago. I messaged her this morning asking if she's had any luck on the app. Is it safe to say too much time has passed? If so, I'll probably just pass the question off as just a friendly conversation piece.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

421,"Hi everyone - I appreciate everyone that contributes here. This sub is an amazingly supportive place.   


So, my partner met a couple that asked her to house / pet sit while they are away on vacation.   
She agrees. The house is great, I've been doing what they've asked - but they have a dog that has been an absolute nightmare. She snaps &amp; bites at people, she barks through the night, doesn't listen at all &amp; honestly is just spoiled.   
\-   
Before we agreed to do this we knew that the dog was bad, but she has become much worse now that the owners are away. This morning she tried to attack a man on a skateboard &amp; managed to break the buckles on her collar. Luckily, the gentle leader we have been using stayed attached so the dog wasn't completely loose. Minutes after she starts attacking me for holding the leash &amp; it turns into her getting away. I have to dive into the road and physically catch her at 5:30 in the morning.  Honestly, I don't think she is a bad dog, she's just spoiled &amp; they don't have a yard or anything so i can't just let her out and go get her after.   
\-  
At this point it feels kind of dangerous, my partner has to walk the dog alone sometimes &amp; I know she has snapped at a few other people while with her. If what happened to me today happened to her I'd be afraid of someone being hurt or the dog ending up getting hit by a car.

Also, FWITW  - i've had dogs my entire life, I might not be like the best dog trainer ever but I don't think I'm doing everything wrong here. I just think it's a bad situation.

2. Music news: Pitchfork, Steroegum, Consequence of Sound
3. Dont know if theres a way around this but I follow a lot of band's facebook pages to stay informed of upcoming releases and tours.

So I’ve known my current partner for 3 years. Started off as friends. For the last year we were seeing eachother on and off. Since April, we’ve officially began a relationship.

We just went on holiday to Greece, was lovely. Then he came to stay at my house for a week. I cook, cleaned and really looked after him.

I love him so much. He’s intelligent, funny and we are both quite aloof/different. We just click. He can be very nice to me, but often he’s quite spiteful/rude and cold. 


The other day, he wanted me to come over for the weekend. He didn’t tell me that all his friends n their gfs were over having a bbq. I don’t like being around a lot of people. I quickly went up to his room. I don’t know why, but I just burst out crying. I couldn’t control it. He said I was being silly. I just could not Bare to go down stairs and talk to his room mates or anyone. I felt sick.

As the night went on, I was still crying and just wanted to curl up and die. He knows I suffer from anxiety and depression, yet he didn’t help this by saying I was ‘draining’ and ‘boring’ him. He said I need help. He said he loves me and that I’m the perfect girlfriend yet when I needed him the most he said I needed to go home and that I needed my family right now and not him.


I love him. But he makes me feel very alone sometimes. 


I feel really bad for not being able to speak to his friends or even come down stairs. But he should have told me everyone was at his house. I wouldn’t have come over if I knew. 


He hasn’t even messaged me today. To see how I am or if I got to my family’s safely. I brush it off because I feel we have a deep connection. Yet he leaves me feeling insecure and unsure of where I stand with him.

They can't flat out fire me for this. Where I work we have a point system, at 10 points you get a written warning, and I believe at 11 you get terminated. With this sick day I'd be put at 7, so I don't THINK they can fire me...?

443,"A few weeks ago, I \[28M\] met a woman at a bar. While we were both fairly drunk, it seemed like we hit it off pretty well. We laughed, joked, drank more, and took a bunch of pics we were sending back and forth on Snapchat. Just one of those good ol' drunk nights out. At some point during the night we were talking about places we wanted to eat at. She took interest in one of the places I had named, so I went for it and said we should go some time. She agreed, and told me she was free the coming Saturday. We talked everyday on SC (getting her number slipped my mind because of how much we were talking on there), and every other day she say how she was excited about Saturday.

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday rolls around and we're talking like usual until that evening. When I went to check SC her contact was gone, and when I tried to look it up I was unable to add it again. Obviously, I was blocked, essentially stood up, and had taken a huge blow to the self-esteem. Fast forward to a week later, and I saw her out and about. I walk up to her and say ""Hey, what's up?"" which gets me one of those polite stranger greetings as she walks past me and goes on her way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong over the years, but all my attempts at pursuing something romantic has resulted in some form of me getting curved or ghosted. If I get to the point where I express that I'm interested, I always say that it won't hurt my feelings if they feel otherwise. But even still, it goes silent on their end. I'm just getting tired of this treatment, and am getting less motivated to continue trying. While I like to think I have pretty good self confidence, hitting the same conclusion is starting to do a number on me. In any case, any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated.

444,"Alright so a little back story, I have been playing keyboard for a little over two years, granted it’s been off and on, I used to find great joy out of it, and this happened

For a school project I had to bring my keyboard to school, I was super excited to play with my friends and stuff, I had worried about this kid the night before, so my initial goal was to ignore him. We waited in the cafeteria for class to begin, my keyboard was laid out as I was waiting for class to begin, the kid in question, let’s call him Jon, comes up and says “Hey Can I play?”, I say  “I don’t want to set it up right now”, he then reaching for the keyboard said “I will then”, at that point I just went with it and let him set it up.

He preceded to play things way above my level of skill, I’m talking classical pieces, and many more things like that, at this point I was curious and asked him, “How long have you played for?” and he said “9 months”, this made me devastated, especially since I have played for two years. After he finished a song everyone in the cafeteria began to clap, and I mean EVERYONE. At this point I was about to cry, it seemed so unfair. Jon already has everything, straight as, rewards, clubs, and everything.

It’s been 6 months and I still think about it everyday. Whenever I go to play piano, I immediately think back to that, I angry play for a good minute, and then just stop. This jealousy has been haunting me and preventing my progress, my train of thought always goes back to “oh I’ll never be as good as him”. So please reddit, what do I do?",30Jun2019,1

447,"So I met a girl who is practically my dream girl, we get along amazingly and hang out pretty much all the time. I’ve never had so much in common with someone and it’s honestly intimidating how close we’ve already gotten. Whenever we hang out it ends up turning into hours of talking and laughing and we regularly go out to lunch and end up talking and playing video games til well past midnight. I’ve always had trouble having close friendships and I don’t think I’ve ever been closer to anyone. 

Even though we’re just friends, we talk all the time about things we want to do together, including travelling and seeing the world. Occassionally this gets awkward because we’re both in a program that will eventually end and there’s no guarantee we’d ever even see eachother again. For me, I really mean it because experiencing anything with her makes that thing a million times better, but I don’t know if she feels the same or if she’s just making conversation.

The problem is, we both very recently got out of long-term relationships, and our close friendship developed while we were both in those relationships. Both of those relationships were pretty unhealthy (particularly mine) and probably should have ended a while ago, but it’s only been a couple weeks that we’ve both been single. The dynamic has stayed pretty similar except that we’ve been spending even more time together. 
 
I really want to tell her how I feel but I have some concerns. First, neither of us have a lot of other close friends and if it goes poorly I’m both really concerned that she won’t have anyone to be there for her and that I would lose someone I consider to be one of my best friends ever, immediately following a breakup, which is scary. Secondly, she’s very difficult to read, and other than the fact that she seems to never get tired of hanging out with me, I have no reason to believe she likes me. No real hints or flirting or anything, but again, we haven’t been single very long. I also have very low self-esteem as a result of some abuse in my previous relationship, so it’s pretty impossible for me to believe that anyone as incredible as her could ever actually like me. 

So basically, I’m open to any suggestions. Am I an idiot for not saying anything? Is it overstepping her boundaries to bring it up? How soon after a breakup is even appropriate?

It’s been a long time since I had to do this so honestly I’d appreciate any input. Thanks everyone.",30Jun2019,1
448,"My (F19) boyfriend (M21) and I have been dating for a year now, and although we’ve had our moments, our relationship has been really great!
That is, until the other day when something happened that just hasn’t settled right with me. 

I’ve had an extremely rough past, partly because of past partners, but mostly because of my abusive parents. My self-confidence is at an all time low due to this, and has been since we started dating. He knows this, and he’s been great with letting me know I’m beautiful, I have worth, etc etc.  Because of him I can happily and honestly say that my mental state (although not perfect) is most definitely better than it had been a year ago. 

In the time we’ve been dating I’ve been working on how often I go on social media, how often I post, etc. so I can try to separate myself from the online world and reality. It’s helped a lot, and I rarely ever have the urge to post anymore. A few days ago I posted a short 2 second video of myself on snapchat showing just my chest and face , and on the video I put a cute sticker that just said “hot”. I was feeling myself, I had done my makeup and hair and thought I looked really cute for once (I had the tiniest bit of cleavage showing, but I was wearing a shirt I’ve had for years). I didn’t mean anything by posting the photo other than as a confidence booster.

A couple minutes after posting, my boyfriend’s best friend replied to the video simply with my boyfriend’s name with an asterisk next to it,  implying that I was wrong to say that I was “hot” and should remember I have a boyfriend. I laughed it off thinking that my boyfriend, the same man who’s constantly talking me how gorgeous I am and how I shouldn’t doubt it, the same man who knows I have dreams that one day I can model professionally and has never said anything negative about it, wouldn’t care that I posted a video. 

Instead, upon showing my boyfriend the video I posted only minutes before, he withdrew himself and seemed upset. After I asked what was wrong he explained how he felt that it seemed like I was “looking for trouble” and that if his best friend had those thoughts upon seeing my photo then I should take it down. He further went on to say that it made him insecure because I was beautiful and he was afraid I would leave him, that it really makes him uncomfortable, etc. He even went so far as to tell me that he’s stopped opening up to me due to his insecurity that I’ll leave him.

I felt...dejected. Finally, finally! I was feeling good with myself and comfortable in every part of my skin! Finally, I had taken a selfie that I didn’t immediately wrinkle my nose at! But oh, I apparently wasn’t doing the “right” thing. Suddenly I was wrong and being a bad girlfriend and my mood was completely ruined. 

I talked to my boyfriend about it. I told him that I didn’t mean it in any promiscuous way, and I apologized for not bringing it up to him before posting. I also told him that I understood his insecurities, but again assured him that I do not intend on leaving him and I didn’t mean anything by the photo. 

He kept feeling bad and I started to get frustrated. The reason for my frustration is that yeah, I understand exactly how he’s feeling. I’ve expressed the same insecurities and uneasy feelings in regards to him constantly looking at images of nude women  in the past (we’ve had many talks about it, I am not anti-porn completely but he let it interfere with our sex life, and continued to do so after we talked and I explained that I have trauma from it in the past. He completely disregards my insecurities in relation to it because it “doesn’t make sense to him”, but expects me to instantly be okay with his insecurities and do what he wants). I only brought this up to him in the moment after he got upset with me because the way he was expressing he felt was similar to my feelings in regards to pornography.
He told me my insecurities with porn “are different” than his with me posting selfies.  
Anyways, that’s not the point. 

The point is that he isn’t okay with me being comfortable with myself, and I don’t know what to do about it. If I were an ugly girl and I posted that I guarantee he wouldn’t mind. Am I in the wrong and I’m just not seeing it? 
It’s been on my mind the past few days...",30Jun2019,3

450,"I don't know where to start. I'm absolutely heartbroken. 

This morning, after our last night out, a female friend of mine messaged me to tell me that several females of our university friendship group feel uncomfortable with how much I touch them on nights out. 

I hug or put my arm around my friends shoulders when drunk.
This has always been a way that I show my affection for my friends, male or female, and has always come from an innocent place. 
Because it comes from an innocent place, I have naively assumed it would be received the same way and never even considered that it might be taken another way or make people uncomfortable.

With my friends from my hometown, because they've known me 20+ years, they know that it comes from a good place. My new university friends apparently do not. 

I'm absolutely devastated that I've made them feel uncomfortable and that it's been interpreted this way. I feel so ashamed. 

I feel like I am a good person with a good heart. So it's devastating to know that this has not been the impression that I have given off. 

I won't be seeing any of them again, unless we arrange a reunion. But we do have a pretty active group chat on Messenger, which I now feel like leaving out of embarrassment. 

I suppose the lesson here going forward is that I need to consider how my actions can make others feel and how they can interpreted by others.

I have explained and apologised directly to the girl that brought this to my attention but should I address this issue and apologise on the group chat?

Thanks in advance.",30Jun2019,1
451,"Sorry for the novel, I ended up trying to work through some shit. TL;DR below. 

Last night we (my husband 31M and I 23F) were having a long serious discussion because we're in a tough ""transitional phase"" waiting for immigration stuff so that we can move back to my home country. In the meantime, I can't work and have put off my studies, and it's pretty lonely for me because learning the language has been nearly impossible, nothing I try has helped much, so I pretty much spend all my time at home watching Netflix or scrolling reddit. Basically, our relationship hasn't been very easy and I think a lot of our issues stem from my struggles with this situation. I haven't been easy to live with. 

Also background: I had a terrible childhood and have since completely cut contact with my father because he systematically destroyed any sense of self-confidence or worth that I ever might have had. He definitely has some kind of undiagnosed mental heath issue, I suspect something similar to narcissism if not that. Let's just say I have no sympathy for him as he continues to do all the same shit to keep my siblings stuck in his orbit. It's sickening.

So last night my husband and I were trying to talk through some of our situation, and I know I get a little long winded because I want to be really clear, and I'm especially careful with my words because English is his second language and we constantly have minor misunderstandings because of it. When he says (paraphrasing) ""you know, you act just like your father sometimes.""

I took a moment and then asked him to explain, he offered to point it out next time he noticed it. I tried to calmly explain how that would be unwise because he knows how painful it is to talk about my father (I definitely used to word triggering), but if he wanted to explain it right away I thought I could handle it. He said that I was doing it then, that I was ""taking one sentence he said and making assumptions"" but couldn't tell me what I was assuming or why he thought that way and by this point I was loosing my cool and I started crying. He tried to drop the subject, but I explained to him, calmly through barely contained sobs, that we could either talk about this and get it sorted out because he brought it up and I was obviously distressed, or I needed to ""go... I don't know, to bed or something."" and he walked away.

So I went to bed, and spiraled. Because, fuck, yeah, I am like my father, I'm manipulative and selfish and I talk to much and I'm always analyzing my feelings and justifying everything I do and every mistake I make to the point where I honestly don't know what's true anymore. I come to the conclusion, lying in the dark and silence, that everyone would be better off and happier if I weren't around. That the best/kindest thing I could do would be to kill myself. Then again, I'm also a pussy and know that cleaning up after that would be hell for him, but also, if I were gone he would at least have a chance to move on afterwards.

At some point in this he had come to bed and he thought I was asleep, then he tried to cuddle me and realized I was crying. He did his best to stay calm and comfort me, he was scared I taken something, but I communicated that I hadn't. I never really ""said"" anything to him, but he did his best to comfort me and we eventually fell asleep.

I woke up not long ago and he was already gone, having decided to work today (although he didn't have to) so I'm still in bed. I still believe all that stuff, but it's harder to have conviction when the sun is out, if you know what I mean. I just don't know if I can face him, or what to say. A part of me honestly wonders if it would be better if I figured out a way to just disappear.

So, Reddit, any thoughts?

455,"Conflicted on what to do!

I have been talking to this boy from tinder all week. We progressed from texting to calling and our first call was 2 and half hours. We got along really well, and we planned a date for today. I had also planned to meet a friend in the city beforehand as I live 40 minutes away and it’s hard for me to commute as where I live the public transport isn’t great and I don’t have a car right now.
We have been messaging a lot and there were no games of “waiting an hour” to reply or anything like that.

I had told my friend I was meeting him at 2pm, that is what we vaguely discussed on the phone, but I assumed when I was in city we would confirm it as he was meeting a friend beforehand and so was I.
He didn’t write to me all day and wasn’t online. I told him that I waiting outside, rang him once with no reply or answer. 45 mins later he asks me where I am with no apology.
Is it too soon to cut it off? Or should I give him a second chance. It’s pretty disrespectful I feel to give the excuse you slept in until 2:45(who tf sleeps until that time) and neither I or my friend bought it. I wasn’t exactly happy about it either and didn’t answer his calls because I wanted to enjoy the rest of my day with my friend.

Is it setting the standard for the potential relationship by just getting over it and giving him a second chance and thinking he can get away with “sleeping in” or is it just a major red flag and should I avoid?
He told me how much he couldn’t wait for our date and was so excited, so I’m just bummed at how he was all talk, and basically no action.

456,"Hi guys, I’m 24 years old, male, gay (I think it’s relevant), and I’ve recently realized how bad my social anxiety is. 

I’ve thought of myself as a very social and outgoing person all my life. I’m loud, funny, and people tend to like me once they get to know me. When I was in high school I had lots of friends. When I went to university I was an RA (worked in housing) so, even though I moved to a different city and knew no one, it was very easy for me to meet a lot of people super fast.

When I graduated I moved to Spain because I feel more comfortable here. The first two years here I lived in a smaller city, I began noticing my social anxieties then but it wasn’t so bad because in my small town there were only a few English speakers who lived there. We all met one another on the same day and basically were forced to get to know each other / be around each other. It was a little harder but knowing that everyone was in the same boat as me reassured me.

Last summer however I moved to Madrid and I still really haven’t met any friends. I’ve tried. I’ve tried to hang out with coworkers, I’ve gone to meet ups and the like, but nothing ever sticks. Here I am, a year later, and I still have no lasting friendships and I’m getting bored and depressed. 

This year I’ve noticed that when I’m talking to new people, I try to end the conversation as soon as possible because I get scared. I don’t look at anyone in the eye (I never have). With someone very new I speak in such a hushed tone that I can barely recognize myself (I’m loud as hell). When I go to parties I need to get at least tipsy to lighten the load. And when people hit me up, sometimes  want to go but I choose not to because....I’m safe in my room. 

I know that I haven’t developed any friendships because of my habits. I can’t help but feel like this stems from something when I was a teenager, from like 12-18, when I lived alone because my parents were swingers and either worked or were at various couple’s houses for weeks at a time. That was when I was coming to terms with my sexuality (I’m from the south / Baptist upbringing), I had suicidal thoughts most days, bad depression, never treated or seen about. 

I don’t know I just feel like I’m a mess socially and this is the first time I’ve really been forced to think about some things. Anyone have a take?",30Jun2019,2
457,"(This is just a throwaway account because my best friend knows my main one)

I suffer with severe anxiety. It has destroyed my life. I barley attend my main school, I only ever leave my room to shower, I have trouble eating properly, and I barley communicate with anybody who isn’t my dad, my best friend, and good internet friends.

A while ago, I had a meeting with my headmaster and the mental health teachers about my attendance. They came to the conclusion that I obviously would not be able to attend the school for a while.

They sent a referral letter to a small school which focuses on mental health, to see if they could give me an education and improve my mental health for a bit.

I was under the impression that I was only going to attend that school for a few months, as it would help my confidence and anxiety.

When I had a meeting with the headmaster of that school, I was then told that it was full time.

The school looked amazing, it’s practically my dream school. Small, not a lot of students. Because I was so happy, I didn’t even acknowledge the fact that I’d have to tell my best friend I’m never attending my old school again. 

I had before hand warned him I might be attending somewhere else, but only for a bit. Like I mentioned, I was under the impression that I was only attending this school for a couple of months.

I’m seriously scared to tell him. We’ve been best friends since primary school, and not once did I think about the fact that I’d move. 

I do actually have a small group of friends that includes him, it’s just that we’re much closer then everybody else involved, so I don’t think I’ll have as much trouble telling them.

I should mention that he doesn’t really understand mental health. Understandable as we’re both 16, but he tends to joke around about it, and pokes fun at it. Usually I’m ok with that, as I tend to do the same thing, but sometimes he goes too far and it slightly hurts my feelings.

He might think I’m just leaving him. Or he’ll think I’ll replace him. In reality, the school is in the same city, and we live quite close to each other. We also talk on a daily basis. But at the same time, he’ll might think I’m just plain abandoning him, and I’ll just leave him in the dust.

I don’t know how to break the news to him. I don’t know how to tell him nothing will change. I’m literally terrified, and I have a panic attack thinking of the worst.

Can anybody who is or might’ve been in the same situation offer me some advice please? I’ve tried talking to my dad, but he can’t offer much as he doesn’t understand.

461,"Obligatory mobile format warning 
TL;DR at the bottom.

Okay let me start off like this. 
I have a troubled relationship with my mom. Emotional, physical abuse and all that jazz. But that's kinda a different story. 
As a kid, she taught me to avoid friendships and anything outside of my planned schedules
So when I eventually fell into a depression, and she started to give up on me as her golden child, I never left the house. Even when I wasn't in a deep depression, I felt so much anxiety about being by myself outside of the house, and I had no friends to rely on. 

I still haven't gotten over this. Even if I managed to dorm in college and get away from her, I oftentimes find myself unwilling to leave my room, even on weekends 

It's boring. Terrible. I'm working on it in therapy. 

So
My mom, after realizing that I will literally stay in bed 24/7 if I don't have school, has become hellbent on sending me to a different country each year 

Not so that I can relax, but just so that I can learn a language. Last year, she sent me to a 3 month program in Spain. 

This year she sent me to family in Panama. 

And here's where I need advice. 

I've been in Panama for about 7 weeks. 
My mom escorted me there for the first two weeks, then went back to work.
My dad came to stay with me on the fourth week, but his mom died after the fifth week and he took an emergency flight home. 

Beforehand, we had all agreed that I should stay in Panama while my dad returns, because my mom didn't have enough money for me to return to Panama afterwards, and I knew that if I came home, I would just stay in bed. 

But when my dad came home, both of their opinions changed. They argue that living with family is boring and if I left I wouldn't get bit by mosquitos anymore. (I am a SNACK) They complain about the lack of comfort, and how there isn't much to do. My dad has been sweetening the deal by offering a trip to Haiti instead for the remaining weeks.

But I like the family I'm with. Even though it is kinda boring, they've noticed that my mom has sheltered me my entire life and have encouraged me to step out of my shell. I would feel guilty about leaving, and I wouldn't be fluent in Spanish, which was the original mission. Plus, this would have never have been an issue if my dad didn't have to leave, and my mom didn't realize she could yank me out of Panama too. 
Also the legal drinking age is 18. I have a safe space to drink with people I trust. 

What should I do? My parents are getting more insistent, and I don't know if by coming home, I'll be ruining the opportunity I have to grow outside of their watch. 

TL;DR: I came to Panama for three months. My parents are asking me to return halfway through because they don't want me to deal with more discomfort. I don't know if I will lose an important growing milestone if I do.",30Jun2019,1

466,"I’ll just explain this in a way I don’t give away too much personal information, but so you guys get the gist. 

I compete in a sport in which we race against each other on a track which is timed professionally. There’s about 4 people in my category who have admitted to me in casual conversation they use a certain method of cheating to improve their times. When I told them I don’t do this, they seemed shocked and believed ‘everyone does it’. Whether or not this is true, I don’t know for sure because nobody else has admitted it - but I know for a fact I don’t cheat in this way and never have, whereas these people do. 

Anyway. I have no video proof of these people actually admitting to the cheating but it’s super annoying because it’s kinda ruining the racing knowing there’s no chance of me beating them unless I cheat too which I’m not going to. What you can notice, is that there’s a significant jump in the total time taken at the end of the race between the ones who cheat and who don’t. Would it be wise for me to show all this to the event organiser and try to get them banned or should I just get on with the fact they’re cheating? I honestly don’t know. I’m thinking of setting up a fake Instagram page so I can message the guys and get actual proof they’re cheating, or is that a bit far? 

My only issue is, although it’s right to get cheaters disqualified, I can’t help but feel like a snitch and dishonest when thinking about telling someone. Can you guys help me find a solution!?

P.S. I probably wouldn’t care otherwise, but if these people didn’t cheat I would actually be podiuming every race I’ve done.",30Jun2019,2

471,"I entered into a friends with benefits relationship with a man I've been friends with for ten years.

 We have been family friends since I was a teenager - literally a decade

 Our FWB ended abruptly no explanation, he just stopped texting. 

Initially he texted me almost everyday or at least once a week then he became disinterested.

 Now I haven't heard from him in almost five months. If I don't contact him, he won't contact me

I'm embarrassed I have feelings for him and they're lingering. 

I technically broke the rules of friends with benefits by developing feelings.

472,"Before I get into my explanation, I'd like to state that, to my knowledge, this individual has not done anything illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I spent many of my childhood and early teenage summers with him. He is a few years younger than me, but we bonded very quickly once he joined our family. We eventually went our separate ways as we got older, only seeing each other at family functions.

&amp;#x200B;

I gradually started to grow into my more authentic self. I'm gay, and out now, and the last time we saw each other, I could see the disgust on his face. He came up as a suggested user on Twitter, and I was curious, so I clicked his profile.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some things I found out:

&amp;#x200B;

\- He has joined the White Nationalist Movement, or at least subscribes to the ideas of the White Nationalist Movement. He re-shares content from contributors such as Stone Toss

&amp;#x200B;

\- He very much dislikes gays, which did not surprise me

&amp;#x200B;

\- He has said things recently like, ""Let's just start another civil war."" (This was most troubling to me)

&amp;#x200B;

\- He has a general dislike for women/women's rights, and has suggested our sole purpose is to produce babies

&amp;#x200B;

While none of this is illegal, I find it very troubling. I have tried to tell his parents and they insist I am over-stating it. Nobody seems to be worried, but I personally see the writing on the wall. What would you all do in this situation?",30Jun2019,1

475,"I'm 20, and I was always into video games, books, watching shows on Netflix or whatever, and tinkering with my computer. Nowadays I just..I'm starting to lose interest. I've always loved pokemon, metroid, legend of zelda, general metroidvanias, from software games, and horror games in general. I've played the metroid prime series multiple times, I tried to get into the older ones and I don't know, they just seemed too hard to get into. I love hard games dont get me wrong, its just at a certain point I want to have fun with the game and not get absurdly frustrated with dying all the time. Pokemon is fun but its lost its touch with me because the formula is always the same. I understand that the series is just made that way, but I want something new. Hopefully sword and shield helps with that. The legend of zelda has gotten stale too. Granted I havent played it in a long time so I'll have to get back into it. For whatever reason I have terrible issues with the dark souls series, but I absolutely love bloodborne. I even got a tattoo of the hunters mark. 

When it comes to books, I havent read anything in a long time. I love sci fi books, but I never know where to start reading them. Horror novels are also the same way. 

When it comes to shows, again sci fi or horror are the best. 

I don't know what I even want from my post. Maybe just some tips on how to maybe get back into things, or find new ones. Thanks for reading.",30Jun2019,1

486,"So I met a girl who is practically my dream girl, we get along amazingly and hang out pretty much all the time. I’ve never had so much in common with someone and it’s honestly intimidating how close we’ve already gotten. Whenever we hang out it ends up turning into hours of talking and laughing and we regularly go out to lunch and end up talking and playing video games til well past midnight. I’ve always had trouble having close friendships and I don’t think I’ve ever been closer to anyone. 

Even though we’re just friends, we talk all the time about things we want to do together, including travelling and seeing the world. Occassionally this gets awkward because we’re both in a program that will eventually end and there’s no guarantee we’d ever even see eachother again. For me, I really mean it because experiencing anything with her makes that thing a million times better, but I don’t know if she feels the same or if she’s just making conversation.

The problem is, we both very recently got out of long-term relationships, and our close friendship developed while we were both in those relationships. Both of those relationships were pretty unhealthy (particularly mine) and probably should have ended a while ago, but it’s only been a couple weeks that we’ve both been single. The dynamic has stayed pretty similar except that we’ve been spending even more time together. 
 
I really want to tell her how I feel but I have some concerns. First, neither of us have a lot of other close friends and if it goes poorly I’m both really concerned that she won’t have anyone to be there for her and that I would lose someone I consider to be one of my best friends ever, immediately following a breakup, which is scary. Secondly, she’s very difficult to read, and other than the fact that she seems to never get tired of hanging out with me, I have no reason to believe she likes me. No real hints or flirting or anything, but again, we haven’t been single very long. I also have very low self-esteem as a result of some abuse in my previous relationship, so it’s pretty impossible for me to believe that anyone as incredible as her could ever actually like me. 

I really just don’t want to make things harder for her if she just needs me as a friend, but I also know I’ll regret it forever if I just resign myself to never knowing.

So basically, I’m open to any suggestions. Am I an idiot for not saying anything? Is it overstepping her boundaries to bring it up? How soon after a breakup is even appropriate?

It’s been a long time since I had to do this so honestly I’d appreciate any input. Thanks everyone.",30Jun2019,1

I (24, f) lost my father when I was 7 years old. It’s about the age where I know I loved my father but I can’t for the life of me remember much about him or many memories we shared. 

My mother and him split up when I was 5 maybe? I have no idea as I was just a kid and my mum told me some bull crap about where he was. He moved to Thailand and I saw him now and then whenever I visited Thailand. For some reason it never registered with me that him and my mum were split up at that age.

Anyways, fast forward to now and I’m still not over his death. I have just moved to Thailand (which is where he died) and it has intensified my feelings of sadness. My mom and I don’t have a close relationship, I wish it was her that had passed away instead of my dad. My mom was never there for me growing up (drugs, alcohol, abuse etc).

502,"Hello Reddit. Today I come to you as someone who needs guidance. 


Background: I am a former high school drop out. I quit high school when I was 14  because I was depressed, and that went on for roughly 3 years. Once I got better, I decided to finish it and be the 1st one of my family to go to college, which I did. I graduated with honors from high school and even managed to get some college credits prior to attending college. In college, I completed 5 (turbulent) semesters, and had some of the best years of my life. But then life took an unexpected turn during my junior year. My dad almost lost the house he had recently bought. At that time, my dad was in court trying to evict a tenant that hadn't paid rent in over two months. While waiting for our court hearings to come to an end, one of the house's main pipes broke down, and damaged it so badly that we had to house 4 families in a hotel for 3 weeks, as it was unsafe to live here. Additionally, he had to get the permits, the work done, and pass the necessary inspections before the tenants could move back. Add this to the mortgage and lawyer/court fees, and it's pointless to say that all this took a toll on my dad (psychologically and financially). He was the only working at the time, so I had to halt my education and work so that we could make ends meet. We managed to keep the house, but at a great cost. Fast-forward a year, and I'm trying to go back to college and finish it, but I can't get my transcript as I have a 15k bill at the college I attended. Since I stopped mid year (never went back for spring semester), my financial aid was revoked and I now owe 15k. I've tried to get personal loans and student loans so I could pay the balance. However, student loans won't cover bills that are over 6 months old, and a personal loan of 15k is not easy to get. I have been working and saving trying to come close to that value as I still want to graduate, but my dad is retired now, which makes this harder. 

Question: is there any programs/organizations that I can get aid from? I've come too close to quit, but I can't seem to find a way to go back (sooner rather than later). I'm hoping that there's something out there that can help me, and that I don't know about. Please help me if you have the knowledge to. Thank you.",30Jun2019,1
503,"As the title states, i do not feel safe in my house anymore. This is going to be long as hell, i might add a tl;dr if possible. I dont know if i can some everything up in a sentence. Before anything, i just want to say im a dude and still a minor. I live in the united states too if that helps. So to start, my mom found a man to marry around the time i waa in 5th grade, so around 2014 i'd say. I would be around 10-11 and my sister would be around 12-13. My mom got married to him that year and soon he moved in with us. Now before i go on, when i met this man, who i will call R from now on, i got bad vibes from him. I didnt listen to them, however, because my mom seemed happy with him, so i pushed the feelings away. 

Once R moved in with us, thats when strange stuff started happening. My mom, R, sister, and me all shared one room, since we lived in a small apartment and a lot of our family members lived with us. I didnt mind, nor did my sister, since we didnt have any reason not to trust him. My sister and i had a bunkbed, while they slept on the floor. One day, my sister started telling me about how she would wake up at night to a man touching her leg, and then stopping when she moved. I dont know exactly what happened to her, as the last time she told me this was years ago. Needless to say, she told everyone about it and soon enough we believed there was a ghost in the house. I dont remember the exact time frame this happened, but i remember hazily waking up one morning to R trying to take off my blanket and go towards me. I bolted straight up waving my arms around me and yelled ""no, dont touch me,"" but since i had just woken up it was just gibberish nonsense. I saw him jump like hell and and yell at me for scaring him. I thought i dreamed this moment up though, because when i saw him he was just folding his blanket. I went back to sleep and thought nothing about it anymore. We moved a while after this incident because we wanted more space for everyone to comfortable to live in.

When we moved, my sister and i still shared a room with my mom and R, however the room was way bigger now and there was a divider in the floor that kind of acted as a boarder between both of our sides. There was this big closet on my sister and i's side, so every morning my mom and R always had a reason to be over on our side, since they had clothes in there. We spent a while in this house, as i was now 12 and my sister 14. Then one day during the summer i played the piano for R and my sister. R said it was beautiful and amazing. I would be elated by a compliment by that, but when i looked at his face there was just something off. There was something sickly sweet about the comment he made and it just disgusted me. The next day is when it happened. I woke up really early that day, my mom was already gone for work and R was getting ready to leave. I decided to stay awake and go to R and my mom's bed, since i hated how it was so dark on the bottom bunk. I was lying down playing games and then R came in and laid down next to me. He put his hand up my shirt and told me i was too skinny, but i didnt think much of his hand there since everyone told me i was skinny back them. Then shit happened and i felt like abosolute hell afterwards. I cant bring myself to type it out. He didnt put anything in me but it was just so violating. He straight up had a boner and i knew because it kept fucking poking me when my legs brushed against him. I ran to the bathroom when i got my chance and felt nothing. I forced myself to cry just to feel something. I went back out onto my mom's bed and lied down and he came back in to get his stuff and said bye. I still remeber the clothes i was wearing, how i felt, his fucking stupid looking face. I never told anyone, even though i had watched videos of people saying if anything like that happened to you, tell someone. I just ignored him everytime he tried to talk to me, which i am still doing. Nothing more happened in that house i believe, other then him being racist, homophobic, and trying to be close to me. Since i never told my sister, she still talked to him.

After a year of living there, we moved again since we were being sued by those crazy lunatics in the apartment below us. Not that important but the charges were dropped so we forgot about it. When we moved to the house we currently lived in, my mom, R, my sister, and i still shared the same room. There enough rooms for those two to sharsle alone and me and sister too, however R refused to let us have the extra room and said it was for guests. I was very angry, and confused as to why we couldnt have the room and why guests were more important. We dropped it though and eventually just gave in. Everything was fine, i'd say, except for the occasional home less dude R would bring to live with us every once in a while. Now that was wack but we thought he was just being nice so we let it slide. While one dude was staying with us, shit started to happen again. R always came late from work, meaning he came home around 12 or 1 am. Then he would spend and hour in the kitchen just eating or whatever the hell he does. Once hes done he comes upstairs (this house was two floors; three if you count the basement but we rent it out to people so we dont go down there) and goes to sleep. This room was quite small, my sister and i traded the bunk bed for a levated bed with another one that slides out from under it. My mom also had an acutal bed of her own to share with R, so when i pulled my bed out to sleep, there was very little space to walk. One day R came up and i was still awake, trying to go to sleep though. I heard him moving around and then all the sudden feel an immense pressure on my crotch. Then the hand lifted itself and i had that terrible feeling again. I knew it was R. He was the only one awake and only one walking around. I tried to rationalize it though. I thought he was maybe falling over and caught him before he did and his hand ended up there. I stood up and left the room after thinking about it and saw R had made himself very cozy next to my mother. A while after that, i was awake again late at night and just couldnt go to sleep. I tried and tried but i was still awake when R made his way to the room. Nothing happened, and from thw movements i heard i knew he was in bed already. Eventually i started to drift off to sleep when i feell a slow tug on the blanket. I disnt think much of it, as i had felt it before and it was always nothing, but for some reason that i still dont know, my head bolted up and my eyes were now looked with R's. This fucking pussy looked like a deer caught in headlights. He eventually just ran back to his bed with my mother and started to sleep. I left the room once more but eventually came back thinking i couldnt sleep anywhere else.

The next day went by and i didnt want to go back to bed. I had enough and was just done. I told my sister what happened the night before and then we told my mother. She laughed at first thinking R was just cold and trying to take my blanket for warmth. But when i told her he ran away quickly after i caught him, she said she would talk to him. After a while we got to move to the extra room, which was still right next door to my mothers room. I felt safe for once and happy. Sort of. There was a door connecting both rooms together that was shut with wood and nails after we moved in, so if someone was in the other room, they couldnt get in. I kept looking at that door every once in a while and looked for a possible hole. I dont know why i just felt i had to. I did find something that looked like a hole and covered it with tape. I think i told my sister but im not certain. A few months after we moved into the room, i was in my moms room just chilling with her when i had a strong urge to examine the door from their side. I did, and underneath a receipt hung to the wall i found a hole i would say the size of a finger. It was a clear view of the other view and my heart dropped. I showed my mom and she asked what we should do. I said i would kill him. I was in rage. Furious. R came up a few minutes later and the two of them got into a fight. You could hear them from downstairs. He tried explaining himself. He said it was there for a long time. He made it to keep an eye on the homeless that used to be there. But i remember very clearly about how smooth the door was before and there was absolutly no hole there. I was starting to believe him when my sister heard him say ""theyre old enough it shouldnt matter anyway."" Like wtf. Why? I should explain that before this incident he was making inappropriate comments to my sister and making moves on her. We were already on edge with him and then this happened. I broke. I couldnt stay in that room anymore. My sister and i slept in my grandmas room that night. My sister moved back though, but i stayed a while longer. 

The situation with the door happened a month ago and nothing has happened since. R has stopped trying to talk to us and my mom installed a chain to our door. However our door knob does not work right now and i dont like how often it breaks on us. My mom has decided to keep him around because, according to my sister, said ""the devil is just trying to test my fate and hes not winning."" My mom is going mad i believe. Shes also very christian and that doesnt help much. Ive thought about ao much shit i could do to get out of this. Such as calling the police, or cps, or maybe even running away. I also thought about killing myself but the thought of leaving my sister behind to that monster kills me more than the idea of suicide. I think i suffer a form of ptsd after all the shit that has happened but im not sure. Im still depressed and i keep a knife in my drawer just in case. I have asked my mom for a therapist so that i could at least tell a person my situation that is outside my family but she hasn't done anything yet. The reason why im not calling the police is because the lack of evidence we have. I only have photos of the hole in the door which i took just in case. Other than that its just my words and my sisters against him, and idk if its good enough. I could move in with my actual dad, but he lives across the country and in a state where i know absolutely noone. I dont know if i have the guts to leave every one of my friends behind, and my dogs. Just tell let you know, my sister and i are both still teens and not financially independent. I have told her to buy an apartment when she turns 18 and take me with her but she said she wont have the money to do that, since shes 17 right now and has not saved for that. Im just at a lost of what to do. Im confused and scared and mad. I need help and this is the only place i thought to get it. I tried to keep this as short as possible but its long. If you want more details i'll add more in an edit or comment. I have photos of the door if anyone is interested. Please if anyone can help i would very mucb appreciate it. 

Tl;dr - mom marries what i believe is a pedophile and she wont get rid of him. I live in fear about what he is going to do next and cant stand to be home with him around. I need help. (Whole post explains everything better and i suggest you read but to each their own)",30Jun2019,0
504," 

I have a friend who tore his hamstring about two years ago, and he hasn’t yet fully recovered. While his hamstring is no longer torn, he has faced many complicating injuries until now, and as a result has become very physically impaired, to the point that he's basically bedridden. He can still walk in short bursts, sometimes needing the aid of crutches, so he’s been going to physical therapy for a long time now to basically learn how to walk again. He, his mom and grandma currently stay with his aunt here in a city in the southern portion of the US, and his mom and grandma are his caregivers. But his aunt recently got married and informed him that they (he, his mom and grandma) have to vacate the house by October. He’s going to get an apartment with them in our current city.

When he told me over the phone that his aunt was kicking them out, he told me that he felt really betrayed and at one point he broke into tears, saying, “Who’s going to leave me next?” I felt really guilty upon hearing that, because I’ll be finishing college in December and have been thinking about moving to a different part of the country once I graduate. 

I’m not sure if he has any other friends in the area - he’s told me how he feels like most of his friends have fallen away since he got injured. I’m the only friend of his I know of who still hangs out with him. (He has friends outside of our city, but he can only text, Facetime, etc. them.)

Also, as a result of this prolonged recovery he’s been going through, he attempted suicide in the recent past. The last time we talked about his mental health, he tried to assure me that he was OK by telling me he’s been getting therapy and that he’s been feeling better - but I fear that he might attempt suicide again. I tried to encourage him to talk with his mom and aunt, but I'm not sure if they know about his attempt. I’m worried that my leaving could contribute to him having suicidal ideation again.

So now as I’m looking for jobs for after graduation, I’m basically wondering: would I be doing the wrong thing by moving away? Considering his struggles, I wonder if I should stay in the area so I can support him until he’s recovered.

Any advice is greatly appreciated - thank you.",30Jun2019,1

I have been dating this guy for a couple of years and it’s a serious thing but you know, sometimes people don’t know you’re in a relationship so they try to get your number or some sort of social media. A month ago this creepy guy asked me for my snap chat and regardless of being creepy, I gave it to him but I wasn’t going to except his request. I was going to ignore it and if I saw him again and if he asked why I didn’t accept him I’d come up with an excuse. I’ve always done it this way and it’s worked.

Well I told that to my boyfriend and he got upset with me saying I should be able to tell someone no and I shouldn’t feel obligated to give him anything. I do see where he’s coming from and I do appreciate it and after that I’ve decided to work on that

Fast forward to last week, a regular came in to where I work and he’s a nice guy and a good conversationalist and he never seemed to hit on me and maybe that’s what thrown me off because he asked for my snap chat and I wrote it on a piece of paper and gave it to him and after he left I realized I shouldn’t have done that in case he was trying to hit on me or if he was trying to get some discounts from where I work so I figured I’d ignore it

Again, this week, I see the regular and he said he typed it in wrong and asked if I could write it down again. I was going to tell him I couldn’t do it because I had a boyfriend or it isn’t company policy but There were people behind him so I felt rushed and I couldn’t think so I wrote it down again and gave it to him. but after he left I realized I wrote it wrong (lol) and I don’t want to tell my boyfriend because I don’t want him upset with me and hearing what I know he’s going to say to me so I’ve decided to take my boyfriends advice and just tell the guy no I’ve changed my mind and I don’t want to give out my snap chat info.

517,"Sorry for the long-ass post. I'll try to TL;DR it at the bottom as best as I can. 

This happened a couple weeks ago, but I've been living with my grandparents since I was 5. I'm now 16, and I'm moving to my dad's this Wednesday. He lives in the state next to us. This is important for later context.

We (me, my grandma, and my little sister) were visiting my aunt and uncle, as well as their infant. One day while we were there, my great grandparents came over for a visit as well. It was a mini-reunion, basically. 

I believe my sister was occupying my great grandfather who, bless his heart, can still be a kind and social soul, even though I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know what's going on sometimes.

My great grandmother, who's more... hm... ""aware"" than him, for lack of a better term, and my aunt were playing with my baby cousin. 

My uncle was off at work.

This is just purely off of my unreliable memory, though... As I said, this was weeks ago. I do clearly remember what my grandma had said to me. 

We were talking about something or other. I think I mentioned how my great grandparents (my grandma's parents) are still happy and well despite their old age. She muttered ""well, maybe they want to live."" 

And her tone wasn't really a tone that was just telling a fact like ""hey, they want to be alive, even after all they've been through in life""; it sounded like more of a tone that implied ""well, they want to be alive, and I don't"". 

I'm only slightly worried, because my grandma is rather infamous among family and her co-workers for not having a filter, and not really thinking about the aftermath of what she says (which has led to some pretty harsh arguments, but that's for another time) before she says it. She's also not very apologetic, and the things she'd say would need to cause a lot of damage for her to be even moderately remorseful. I mean, I'm sure her friends think it's a riot, but it can be really frustrating and hurtful at times.

She has hopes of retiring in these upcoming years and moving to St. Lucia, or Costa Rica, or just somewhere tropical... and boy, she does NOT let us forget. If something pisses her off even slightly, no matter what it is, she'll usually say something like ""I'm so sick of this shit. We need to go to Costa Rica. I'm tired of living in this place."" We live in a city currently.

If she gets annoyed by me and my sister, she won't hesitate to let us know that ""Well, I could be retired and living on the beach, but I gotta take care of you kids."" I (M16) am moving to a different state to live with my dad in a few days, as I mentioned earlier. It's heartbreaking for everyone, especially me, and I have many reasons as to why I'm doing it. But one of my reasons is to, in fact, help my grandma reach her dreams, since I know I'm weighing her down. She thinks I'm bullshitting when I tell her this. She then continues to tell me how happy she'd be if she were living on the beach right now. 

Before I set my moving plans into motion, if she was mad, she'd sometimes tell me things like ""I can't wait until you and your sister move out of here"" or something.

I'm not trying to hold too much against her. As I said, she says things without really thinking it through; however, she says these things quite often, and the whole ""can't wait until you're gone"" thing has been going on for years. I know she wants to get rid of me, but I don't think (or at least I hope not) she's as stubborn about it as she comes off as.

She does tell me that once I move this week, she'll be very sad and she'll miss me. She also does remind me frequently that she loves me, and that the whole family loves me. I remind her that it's gonna be saddest for me, and that I'll miss everyone so much, and that I love her and everyone else too. 

That's the thing -- we have some pretty nasty moments, but we do have some good moments together. We like to spend time together... Until things eventually and inevitably go South, then it's time for a break. It doesn't always turn bad, though. There are plenty of times where we have fun and just leave things with a happy ending. 

I'm not the only one in on this either. My mom completely agrees that my grandma is an awesome person as a whole, but she can also say the worst things without feeling regret over them. My grandpa feels this same way as well. My mom was raised by my grandparents, and mom's obviously a lot older than me. My grandpa has been married to my grandma for... Shit... I don't even know how long. They both tell me that this is just how my grandma's always been. There's no changing her. And yeah, she's been like this my whole life, but as I said, I've only been alive for 16 years; they've been with her a lot longer.  

That being said, even if you're someone who doesn't always say the most pleasant things, allegedly implying you want to die is something worth noting in my opinion.

I can't remember what I told her, but I brought it up with her once a little later that same day, but I didn't directly confront her about it. I believe what I said was more on the side. I got no response from her.

**TL;DR** My grandma, who is known for saying things on impulse, implied that she doesn't want to live.

519,"I have been feeling extremely unusual lately. As someone that struggles with anxiety and depression, I can't remember the last time I had the energy to see something through that wasn't for school. I am almost always constantly in a state of self doubt, which manifests itself in different ways. 

I had an intense episode around two weeks ago when I was alone overnight for the first time in months (I live with my boyfriend). My anxiety makes me super anxious when I am home alone for a period longer than a few days and my boyfriend had to go out of town for ten days. I was at home dogsitting our pup.  Sometime around him leaving, I started to get irritable for no reason and ""disappear"". It would feel like I would slip into being another person who was apathetic and distant every few hours. I would snap at him for no reason, and get pleasure from being cruel. I was horrified with my behavior but it didn't feel possible to stop. He would have to snap me out of it somehow. Three or so days before my boyfriend returned, I got sick with the worst flu of my life where I felt like I could barely move. This threw me into a panic because I was alone and could hardly eat, and felt extremely ill (Also I have a phobia of vomiting which can cause panic attacks because apparently I can't get a break lol). I felt like I couldn't breathe well or move and I felt feverish. It is hard to remember now, but the point is, I called 911 and they took me away in an ambulance. Yikesss. I woke up confused and kinda hazy and curious about how I got home. 

 When my boyfriend came home after the ten days, these anxious and apathetic fluctuations lasted for another couple days, and then the constant anxiety and waves of apathy gradually decreased. 

Things felt like they might be going back to my normal state of anxiousness. 

A few days ago, I started to lose my marbles for some reason. But this time it is different.
I have energy ALL THE TIME. I have ideas constantly and I suddenly have confidence to feel like I can finish projects, because I feel like the end project will be exciting and worth it. I am getting more into screenwriting, drawing, idea creating. I feel useful and productive for the first time outside of being in college. I don't even want to sleep, I am so excited about my ideas and writing them down. Hell, I made two powerpoint presentations for my boyfriend over the duration of several hours that were proposing new living room furniture. Why?? Who does that? Who has the time? Who has the energy?

However, I googled how I feel and it turns out it's hypomania. Apparently it feels great, but then gives way to either full on mania which doesn't feel good, or a depressive episode, which is... depressing.

528,"Just to let you all know, this is gonna be a long post explaining a lot of things for you to fully understand my situation.

Ill include a TLDR at the bottom for those of you who are only here for a quick response.


Okay so. I’m 17, average looking in my opinion and have a personality that isn’t too great but also isn’t bad. I want you to understand the whole entire situation so I’ll explain to you how I got to this point in my life.

Around 10 months ago, I started to talk to this girl from overseas who I had thought was pretty and had a funny personality. I had spoken to her before but it had just been as kinda friends. I flirted with her back then and she flirted back. During the time I had spoken to her I asked if she would be mine, but she had a boyfriend, but that was something that had happened during the time we hadn’t been speaking. 

After 10 months I message her again for the first time in a while. I start flirting with her and she’s flirting back again. It started to get to the stage, I think even before 10 months ago - maybe 11, we were taking. Anyway, things started to go really well between the too of us. She was calling me baby, and I was calling her it too. I just seemed like true love. I must mention, around 7-8 months prior to this I had broken up with my ex girlfriend. 
The idea of having someone I could call my own again seemed so perfect and I wanted it to be her. I told her I loved her, and she said she loved me too. We were saying “I love you” to each other before we even dated. 
After a month or so of flirting and talking to her, I asked her what we were. I can’t remember the exact conversation but I know I asked “what do you say when people look at who you’re texting or posting on your story about” and she said “i just say you’re my boyfriend”

This was something that made me realise she wanted me just like I wanted her. And of course I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, she said yes and we started dating. 

It’s been about 9 months (a week from now is our 9 month anniversary) and things have been weird throughout. 
Ill discuss this later,

But anyway, things went good for the first month, I couldn’t believe she was mine and I was actually happy for the first time in a while.
Second month comes and we’re going strong.

I must mention here that she does post pictures of her body a lot on her snapchat, which is something I don’t like tbh but I know if I confront her she’ll switch it so it’s my fault.

Anyway, I’ll try keeping on topic.

Around the 3 or 4 month mark she started to work at a fast food pizza place where she lives. Me and her were going very good for these months and everything seemed normal.

After what I remember as her first shift she told me she thought her manager was attractive. Now, she told me before about what I can and can’t say about people.
She told me I strictly can call other people “hot or attractive” but I can say they’re “not ugly”. Her doing this made me upset. Very upset. 

She used to tell me about how he would grab on her or push himself against her. She didn’t seem to mind it which is something that worried me. 
She later mentioned about how she wanted to take a trip to a camp (i think)  with her manager and one of the other employees.
This was a huge red flag and I started to show I was mad and upset. She said, and I remember this perfectly, “I know why he wants to go but I don’t want to say because it will make you mad”. my thoughts: then why go if it’ll make me mad? makes 0 sense to me.

Anyway, she ended up having an argument with the coworker and the manager and she didn’t go. she also quit a few weeks ago and the manager had left a while before.

During the time she worked there she got a lot of shit for being in a relationship with me. 


Next point in the story is this kid that is/was friends with. I don’t know when this was but I know it was after the whole work incident. 

Some kid at school she said she was comfortable with and he would touch on her.
She said he made her upset and that he wanted to say sorry by taking her out for food. I wasn’t too impressed by this and all i could think was “don’t let him treat it as a date”.
Sure enough, they went for food together. The kid ended up having to leave early and she paid for her food.
She also posted “take out date was worth getting out of bed for”
which i guess is a joke but by the way she spoke about him it didn’t seem like it.
she would mention how she, once had a dream about her and him having sex. it obviously made me upset, but i wasn’t too mad. she also mentioned how he made her confused because she wants the physical aspect of the relationship and the emotional with me but he was giving her the physical. 

More time passed after this and things were going back to normal. more recently there has been other issues happening with our relationship (see my other posts here) which have destroyed me mentally.


At the moment, there’s about 4 or 5 boys she speaks to regularly and maybe more since there’s apparently a group chat. 

during the past week or two she’s been spending more time talking to them and an increasingly less amount of time with me. this stresses me out and makes me anxious because of what’s happened in the past. she expects me to trust her but with what’s happened idk if i can.


something is also like to cover is how i’m usually putting all the effort in. 


Something that truly confused me was her post about these boys not understanding she isn’t single and she only wants me. this post was deleted after i saw it. which confuses me because she mentioned me in the post multiple times. 

She said she removed it because she didn’t want to make the people it was aimed at cry.

At the moment i’ve only spoken to her for around 30 mins over the past 2 days maybe even less

this hurts me a lot because i rely on her for company

it feels like i have nothing and nobody to talk to. my life feels like it’s falling apart and i’ve had 2 mental breakdowns this weekend which is something that’s never happened to me before. i also have been suffering some panic attacks which have been scary to say the least. whenever i call or text her she seems to be busy or about to go to sleep. i see this as a red flag for sure but i’m always hopeful that she’ll come back. 



please help. as you can see my life has been a mess for a while now (see previous posts)



TLDR: my girlfriend of 9 months is acting strange and it’s confusing why. she hardly speaks to me and when she does it seems like she’s busy or about to sleep, she speaks to other people but she has never spoken to them as much as now.
I feel lost because I don’t really have anyone to turn to, and those who i do have to turn to don’t like or know her.

532,"My boyfriend and I have been dating since I was 15 (I’m now 20 he’s 21) he is my world. I love him to death he’s my equal and my partner in crime. This year I moved in with him and his family. I’m considered part of his family and I love them as much as I love him. We are saving for a house, we plan to get married we own pets together the whole shebang. 

However my boyfriend has some poor lifestyle habits that are starting to concern me. Firstly his diet is extremely poor, cereal snacker, chip addict, take out 5+ times a week. I don’t share his diet we eat separate most of the time now. 

He’s overweight as a result. I recently lost plenty of weight myself so I know how hard it is but I can’t sugar coat it... he’s obese, and his body dosent disgust me I love him I still think he’s sexy and I’m still intimate BUT he can have shortness of breath, he coughs a lot (smoking probbably dosent help) and he looks sickly most days. 

We’ve had plenty of open discussions and every time he swears he will fix up his act and take better care of himself and it lasts a few days and then he’s back to normal.  

I love him more than anything but I’m scared of being in a relationship for the rest of my life with somebody who takes such poor care of themselves. He never used to be like this, it’s like he turned 18 and it all went downhill from there. 

Another thing that scared me is children. I’ve already decided I don’t want to give birth, I want to adopt and he agrees, we’ve had many discussions about it. Even so, what kind of an example does it set if he’s like this? 

My father died of a heart attack, and now to my horror the man I love the most seems determined to go down the same path, I’m almost in tears while writing this because I fear he may drop dead at 50 like my father did! 

I won’t leave him. He’s the love of my life, he wants help and I want to help him. I just don’t know what to do. Please! I need help so desperately.

Summary: 
My long term partners lifestyle choices are so poor that he’s obese and sick all the time. I fear he will die of a heart attack in his 50s. I won’t leave him he’s the love of my life, he wants help what should I do?",30Jun2019,2

538," I have a friend who tore his hamstring about two years ago, and he hasn’t yet fully recovered. While his hamstring is no longer torn, he has faced many complicating injuries until now and his muscles have become very weak, and as a result is basically bedridden. He can still walk in short bursts, sometimes needing the aid of crutches, so he’s been going to physical therapy for a long time now to basically learn how to walk again. He, his mom and grandma currently stay with his aunt here in a city in the southern portion of the US, and his mom and grandma are his caregivers. But his aunt recently got married and informed him that they (he, his mom and grandma) have to vacate the house by October. He’s going to get an apartment with his mom and grandma in our current city.

&amp;#x200B;

When he told me over the phone that his aunt was kicking them out, he told me that he felt really betrayed and at one point he broke into tears, saying, “Who’s going to leave me next?” I felt really guilty upon hearing that, because I’ll be finishing college in December and have been thinking about moving to a different part of the country once I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not sure if he has any other friends in the area - he’s told me how he feels like most of his friends have fallen away since he got injured. I’m the only friend of his I know of who still hangs out with him. (He has friends outside of our city, but he can only text, Facetime, etc. them.)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, as a result of this prolonged recovery he’s been going through, he attempted suicide in the recent past. The last time we talked about his mental health, he tried to assure me that he was OK by telling me he’s been getting therapy and that he’s been feeling better - but I fear that he might attempt suicide again. I tried to encourage him to talk with his mom and aunt, but I'm not sure if they know about his attempt. I’m worried that my leaving could contribute to him having suicidal ideation again.

&amp;#x200B;

So now as I’m looking for jobs for after graduation, I’m basically wondering: would I be doing the wrong thing by moving away? Considering his struggles, I wonder if I should stay in the area so I can support him until he’s recovered.

I love every aspect of my life outside of work. I have new hobbies in painting, hiking, and gardening. I have plenty of friends I see often, my family lives a few hours away and I enjoy spending time with them, and I am engaged to my partner and love him very much. My life is rich and interesting filled with healthy relationships.

However, for forty hours a week I feel completely bored out of my mind like I’m being sucked into the void. I work at a credit union in payment services looking at checks all day to check for risk factors (I.e. there are no mistakes on the check and people aren’t committing fraud). I stare at check after check and push them through for eight hours every day. We aren’t allowed to have headphones and it’s completely miserable.

I have a four year degree in English (yes, I do regret that now). I’m trying to break into technical writing but keep getting stuck in low paying data entry or administrative assistant jobs through various temp agencies. I’ve tried staying on to see if I can apply for something better, but I haven’t had any luck looking for other opportunities. I’m currently working with a recruiter to help me get into the tech writing field but it all seems hopeless. I feel stuck in this dead end pattern of working tedious and repetitive jobs with no way out.

Maybe I just need some outside perspective. Should I stay with my current job and wait to apply to other internal positions and work my way up? Should I go back to school? Try another temp job and see what happens? Your advice is much appreciated.

548,"I’m a 34F. TLDR: I got an ordinance violation for fighting in public and I’m innocent. 


Last night I was at a music concert. Where we standing there was a sewer drain with a couple inches of water near it. I was using my selfie stick and it was annoying the woman behind me. Out of nowhere I get drenched with an entire cup of water that smelled horrendous that she filled with the puddle near our feet. It honestly smelled like vomit. I turned around and was in shock. My husband grabbed my face and said “babe it’s OK. Just ignore it and let’s have fun and  listen to the music”. I was yeah,. You’re right. As hard as that was bc I was so disgusted and smelled really bad. Not to mention I’m a germaphobe. A minute goes by and she does it again!!!  Just dumps it straight on top of my head. As I turn around she’s filling her cup again with the ground water (about to dump a third cup on me) so I put my hands up in defense to stop her and she attacked me. Security came and threw her out of the concert. It was evident that I had done nothing wrong. 20 minutes go by and security comes and gets me and tells me I need to come with them. I follow them and sure enough the girl is filing a complaint against me. In the end, the police issue me an ordinance violation for fighting in public?  I’m so upset. I can’t accept this.

I’m 17 and I’m always expected to keep the house clean while my brother doesn’t have to worry about cleaning a single plate even though he’s a legal adult and should bear more responsibility! My mom’s bf is worse and out of the two years they’ve been together, I’ve never ever seen him carry his dishes to the sink. He just leaves them on the table like a dirty pig. I despise him so much because he’s also an alcoholic and drinks everyday like it’s water even if he’s not drunk. Usually, if my mom cooks, it’s always for her boyfriend; she only asks what he wants to eat. I only eat seafood and chicken so if she does bring or make food, it usually has some sort of meat that’s specifically targeted for her bf and my brother. She’ll always call my brother when there’s food, serve him his plate, ask for seconds, etc (same with her bf.)

550,"Details about my cat and how she died (you can skip if it's too sad and grody): 

Had not seen my 12-year-old cat for a couple days. Thought nothing of it because she did that from time to time. She was one tough kitty. She was blind, cross-eyed, fat and old, but could still kick rodent butt. No strays dared to mess with her, not even big dogs. She was a real tough, sweet cat and I miss her dearly. 

This morning, something didn't feel right. Woke up to the neighborhood dogs barking outside my door. I think they were telling me where she was. I found her under the porch area. It probably hadn't been very long but she looked so decomposed. I looked closer around the porch area and found blood smears and tufts of familiar fur. There had definitely been a tussle of some kind, and no doubt my grandma kitty put up a fight. Sorry if I am harping on the details, still processing her death. I don't really have any friends but I know not saying anything wouldn't be good for me. 

It was hard burying her while crying. I've never had to bury a pet before. I'm young, so I haven't experienced a whole lot of loss. I didn't know how hard this would be. While I was really torn up a couple hours ago, I feel calm now knowing I gave her a nice grave plotted between two trees and said my goodbyes as best as I could. Intermittent the digging and sobbing, I was talking to her the whole time like she was still there. Every time I look outside I'm expecting to see her. Is this what grief is? 

The dilemma concerning my mom:

My main dilemma right now is deciding whether or not it's good time to tell my mom that her cat died right before we organized to go on a fun Fourth of July family trip with just us girls. We're going to be leaving for the trip in a couple days and we're going to be vacationing for an extended period of time. I don't know whether I should tell her before, during, or after the trip. 

My reason for suggesting that I don't tell her anything until after the trip is that my mom does not handle death very well and would be incredibly devastated, moreso than I was finding poor kitty. I know that no one ""handles death well"" and that everyone experiences grief differently, but her reactions to dealing with past loss makes me want to hold this news from her. My mom's mother passed away about four years ago and hasn't really been the same since. She thinks my grandma communicates to her through pennies she finds on the ground. I don't know why it has to be pennies. The pennies also have to be from a certain era (the 70s, I believe) for it to qualify as a penny from grandma. There are other delusions she indulges but I am too afraid to get more specific than that in case someone happens to know her. (My mom's job requires her to travel everywhere and know a LOT of people, trying to protect her identity to the best of my abilities.)

My mom loves old kitty. She'd be heart-broken to hear from me that she's no longer with us, especially right before a family trip. I don't know what to do. I also fear that my mom might blame me for my cat's death. I know I certainly blame myself. Any advice on how to deal with the passing of a beloved family pet and/or relaying tragic news to close family members would be greatly appreciated. 


TL;DR: My cat died and now I have to tell my mom but don't know the best time to tell her as we are about to go on a family trip and I fear ruining everything by telling her the news. I also haven't experienced loss, but my mom has, and does not react well to it.",30Jun2019,2

556,My girlfriend is from a small island and had been away for almost 20 years. Recently visited the island together where her parents still live and run multiple businesses. Upon returning to the chaos of living in a bigger city in Texas and dealing with our jobs and the stress provided by them we have started thinking about moving to the islands where her parents will provide us with housing and teach us to take over many of their businesses on the island so they are able to retire. It seems like a win win to live on a slow paced island and to already have housing and source of income provided to us. It will be very expensive to transport our belongings and ourselves so I want to hear from others about their opinions or experience in the matter.

563,"Apologies since I'm on my mobile

There was this one girl I was crushing on pretty heavily, from 6th to 8th grade. She was interested in talking to me I guess but I was a kid back then and didn't actually notice any of it. 

I'm 19 and I've been in a relationship for about 4 years with this absolutely amazing woman. I know I may sound like I one of those high school sweethearts but I really love her. 

Now I do follow my old crush on Instagram and recently she posted a few pictures. I liked it at that moment and that's it, didn't feel any different. But for some reason, for the past few days I've been constantly having thoughts about her and what could have been, about what she does, etc.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",30Jun2019,0

569,"I'll keep it ""short"", since I already wrote a whole rant and then closed the app because it was stupid. Well, I'm stupid...

Anyways. You see, I have a deadly fear of losing my grandma &amp; the end of the world.(I'm not kidding, I don't care that it seems like a childish fear but it's there and...it's taking over my life.)

I found out TOO much stuff about my grandma's diabetes and apocalyptic scenarios...

Well, you see, about my apocalyptic fear...I've lost a lot of time to an endless cycle:

•Forget about it for a while
•Article pops up: ""We're doomed...---""
•Hours upon hours of searching and trying to find information to calm me down.
•Restart

Whenever I'm in the stage of searching...Well, It took up to month to forget once. I feel so powerless. I done everything I could.

And about my fear of losing my grandma...I can't accept her time on Earth is limited, and so is mine. She's 66 and diabetic. I can't lose her. I don't want to. That's what I feel...but I know that she'll have to go one day, and I live with fear since thar day comes.

You see, I've been searching about pesticides/insecticide whatever. My uncle was supposed to come help her with spraying it on her potatoes...he never came. I'm not even sure if it got on her skin but I'm scared something will happen. It's been 2 weeks since she sprayed it and she seems fine but I'm scared.... Tho I think she's fine. She also has some white in her eye that scared me but ""she takes drops"" which I never ever saw her take...but.. I know she cares about her health unlike my grandpa...she goes to the doctor, takes pills etc... 

But it all feels too much. It's taking over. I use incognito so whenever I open up Google I do not see my hundreds of searches.

Should I try to convince my parents to let me go to at least the school's counselor or whatever? A classmate of mine went and he seems much more friendly &amp;...happy.

I went to a therapist(for an eye blinking tic)and...She said ""Stop eating chocolate."" and sent me on my merry way.


If I should go to see a psychologist... How should I approach them?

I'll also most possibly delete this later but I really needed a place to rant and to see if I'm just childish...

About a year ago, my long time girlfriend became my fiancee and we decided to move in together. We are pretty much married at this point while we wait for September to make it official with a small ceremony involving both mothers and all. 

In the meantime, we both work and live together, share a joint account, and I've even bought her a car. But ever since she moved in, shes practically refused to do house work. I dont guilt her into doing anything or ask more than once and not often at all. But every time I do ask, she gets pissy and half does it. I do everything I can- but with three cats, a dog, and a full time job, I'm only able to do so much. So I need help. But i get none. 

I've tried talking to her about it, tried to work out a system, and just asked her to do one thing while I'm doing stuff. I never just sit down and ask her to do it. But she just gets defensive and pissy.

573,"So today June 30th at around 12:02 I made a mistake that will ruin me if I can't fix it. I know this might seem like a small problem to some and compared to other problems people have this is really minor. So basically I have been talking to this girl for about six months (well the very beginning of this year so almost 7) we obviously had ups and downs throughout that period. A little back story on her is that before I started talking to her she was in a bad relationship with this guy that used her and made her feel like an object more than an actual person. My little back ground is that I'm deppresed and have many mental issues including severe anxiety and a few other things that essentially make it hard or harder to express my emotions properly. We had been talking about not ""together"" as she wasn't ready to get into one and I was as well since I had just gotten out of a bad relationship as well.(I'm done with the background information now). Last night was her best friends birthday (this friend of hers killed himself a few years back) and she called me at around 11 we talked for a little bit and then she asked me if I had ever lost anyone important as well. This was my first mistake I said yes I had. She asked me to explain it and basically a rough outline of what I said was ""she was a girl that I had known since I was a kid and I really liked her and she was very important to me"". She then went on to say other things that are not related to this. But today I woke up at 9ish and she called me around then as well. On the phone I for some reason decided to send her some screenshots between me and the girl I had mentioned the night before. Yeah that is my second mistake. She didn't see them right away and at around 12 she started saying "" if it wasn't me then it would have been another"" to make a long conversation short she took the screenshots I had sent and basically said oh you treat me just like her and said that means I can be easily replaced. Now I basically lost the one person who actually listened to me and cared about me over a fucking dead girl. I feel really bad and she is making me feel even worse. Now some of her friends are getting on to me and I really can't handle this. I've been under a lot of stress and I just want to make it right. I don't know what else to do I just can keep going on like this.

574,"Preface:
My family on my mother’s side has had a history of mental illnesses running rampant throughout it. Growing up, my mother would constantly put me down, call me names, tell me I’m worthless, etc. She also would make up stories to my father who was the only one who worked in the household about the bad things I did as a child (my older sister would often help come up with these), and that would lead to my father coming home stressed out from work and he would physically abuse me to the point of beating with a belt (which, in my opinion isn’t a big deal) to throwing things at me (my poor Nintendo Wii 😞). My older sister was also the “prized child” and would get anything she ever wanted whenever she wanted. My father always spoiled her and my mother did too until the sister started to get older. My father also gave a lot of attention to my younger sister (not nearly as much as to my older sister though), so I was kind of stuck in the middle. There were many times my younger sister can recall crying herself to sleep because she heard me getting beat for things I didn’t do. My mother also as a heavy alcoholic and with her family’s history would often pretend to faint or get sick or fall, for attention. To the point that I’ve called an ambulance for her and she would suddenly get up “perfectly fine”. This later became a concern for my younger sister and I where every day we would come home, scared we would find my mother dead.

Since 2010, there has been a college that my heart has been set on and I wanted nothing more than to go to it. 

In 2011, my dad passed away at the age of 53, due to malpractice. Being a 15 year old Male with no father, an alcoholic mother, a 23 month older sister, and a 4 year younger sister, I deemed it my responsibility to take care of everyone. My relatives (father included) played into that a bit as well by telling me that without my father, I’d be “man of the house” and it’s my responsibility to take care of them. My mother filed a lawsuit against the hospital, and due to the way court proceedings apparently work, my mom and her lawyer are the only ones who can know how he died, until the case is settled.

2012 comes by and my older sister abandoned my family without giving us any warning (and since then, very sporadic contact) and went to live with an estranged cousin that was at odds with my mother. This sent my mother into an even worse downward spiral consisting of more and more alcohol.

2013 comes around (my supposed to be senior year of high school) and my second cousin’s wife dies of cancer. He begins to date my mother and do... things... with her. (Yes they’re first cousins to each other. Yes it’s ew.) He also drinks quite a lot and further enables my mother. I also failed to graduate this year.

2014 comes around and my mother has a brain aneurysm. Being that my older sister was MIA and I was the oldest at the time, I had to be the one to call the shots and take charge on any decisions for my mother’s aneurysm. Wound up having to confirm whether or not a spinal tap procedure should occur and sign a DNR, in case she doesn’t survive the procedure. She does wind up surviving the procedure with almost no side effects. Only thing notable to this day is she’s significantly weaker. I also start my second job (first real job, excluding newspaper delivery) with a supermarket. I also try to apply for the college I dreamed of, but gave up when the aneurysm happened because I told myself I needed to stay and take care of my family.

2015 comes, I get a new job at a place that I told myself I’d be at for life and my mother starts hearing voices. She claims to hear my downstairs tenants threatening to blow up the house or kill each other, etc. This culminates to my sister and I telling ourselves she’ll get better, warning my first cousin about her erratic behaviour, and while my younger sister and I are on vacation a state away with mutual friends, her then boyfriend tells her that there’s a fire truck and ambulance outside our house. Cue us rushing back from vacation to find out that she called the fire department because the tenant supposedly threatened to set fire to the house. A few days later I came home from work.she was trying to use a sledgehammer to break down the tenant’s door. (She’s still incredibly weak, so I find a police car in front of our house and I ask the officer what’s wrong, stating she was my mother, and he says “oh it’s nothing to worry about, she just needs to get some sleep.” So the officer leaves, and I notify my cousin of the past antics and we formulate a plan to get her to the hospital for a psych evaluation. After 3 days in the psych ward, she’s released after being treated for a UTI, which can cause those auditory hallucinations.

2016 comes and I’ve moved to the highest spot before leadership at my job in under a year. Mother keeps drinking to the point that she comes home drunk off her ass and falls up the stairs, a lot. Also falls down the stairs and injured herself, but doesn’t tell anyone because she’s stubborn.

2017 and she’s hearing voices again. She’s drinking heavily still. She’s regained her strength from the aneurysm, for the most part.

2018 and her father passes away. Cue more drinking (near 18 cans per day). Doesn’t eat anymore unless us kids force her to eat by making her food. I get into a relationship with a very abusive girl. Push all my friends away, because I thought it was the smart thing to do for this girl. Lose a lot of money spending/wasting it on the girl. Go into thousands of dollars in debt. Culminating in gf cheating on me on my birthday, and her subsequently causing me to lose my job three days later. I go into a deep depression. Have to pull out my 401k to recover (of which I only saw about 2800 of). Only myself to blame for that stuff though. Fell into depression.

2019 is here and I’ve recovered my debts completely, with help from my tax returns as well. I had a job from January to March, but they laid off my entire team and I’ve been looking for a new one since. Unfortunately, my first cousin’s health has diminished a bit and he was going into heart failure. Seems to be recovering now though. Upon reflection of my past 8 years, I’ve realised that I need to do what’s absolutely best for me and I need to follow my dreams and not let anything hold me back anymore. Enrolled in dream college. Worked hard to get things figured out for college. Comes to the time when we’re talking about the finances situation. I filled out my FAFSA and got x amount from that. But the college is in another state and I need approximately 150k (total for my degree) to attend the college, as well as pay for living and all that. One semester is approximately 53k, 45k after fafsa. I’ve tried every single loan provider I could find and I’m unable to get any loans on my own. I don’t have anyone to use as a co-signer either. I need to free myself of this place and my past once and for all, and the only way I see that is by attending this college, but I have no idea on how to go about financing it. The lawsuit for my father is still going on, and it’s at the settlement stage, but my mother’s lawyer believes it’s going to go to trial in July. Which supposedly is a quick trial. (Or quick by however trial standards are). My mother already promised myself and my younger sister that we would get substantial chunks of the settlement. If that comes any time soon, I could use that for college definitely and save the rest. But I can’t rely on that. I’ve applied for grants and scholarships as well.
I’m so certain of myself that I know what degree I’ll get, I know what masters I’ll get, I know what I’ll do with the degree and knowledge, and I know what I will be doing ten years from now and how I will be giving back to the world. It’s all in my mind. The college has also apparently gotten to the point of being a dream college where I’ve actually physically dreamed of getting the funds together for it and dreamed of my attending it as of late.

Does anyone have any advice of how I can get the funds for this venture? I’ve heard plenty of miracle stories and stuff for people going after their dreams, and I need some kind of miracle at this point.

My family and friends all call me beautiful and all that but i really don’t believe them. I got braces on recently and i have quite bad acne so that doesn’t help lol. I also have trouble with my hair and hate it so much i’m contemplating shaving my head just because it would get rid of the problem.

I always pick my head up and look at him funny and he knows I'm looking but avoids eye contact. Does he have some sort of mental illness? It looks like he's doing some sort of advanced comp sci stuff...

Anyways... he then puts his fingers in his mouth and bites his nails for about 60 seconds and then with the other hand he starts to pick his nose and then he begins typing on his computer for a little. Then he takes the mouth finger and pulls his sleeve up to scratch his armpit for what seems to be 30 seconds... AND THEN BACK TO THE MOUTH. Almost threw up, but started cracking up. Then back to the nose with both hands and then once back to the computer he will sometimes say ""I love you"" again.

584,"I feel really weird making this post. I’m not sure what answer or advice I’m really looking for here.

I have an online friend I play video games with. Known him for roughly 2-3 months. He’s 23 and I’m 19. He has a girlfriend. I’m single and HAPPY.

He’s quite overprotective of me and in the beginning we flirted (completely friendly from my side, it’s kinda my humor). It was just things like saying “damn hottie 👅💦” kind of thing. Nothing serious. Just compliments and jokes. One day he says:

“Sorry for leading you on, but I can’t do this anymore. You know how much I love my girlfriend.” I was very confused, because I meant nothing by it. We stopped the flirty humor though, no problem here. I began seeing him more like an older brother at this point because he got really protective and supportive etc. just a nice guy in general.

The past 2 weeks he’s been really absent. We would usually play a couple of hours before bed. I’m busy during the day, so I kinda notice when I get home and now it just seems a little quiet. You know? I know he’s busy and I’m not mad about it. What made this whole thing weird was the last time we talked.

We were both drunk, and talked for maybe 2 hours. He keeps saying “you can ask me aaanyyything. Isn’t there something you want to ask me?” I really didn’t have any questions. Which would I even have? When I asked him why he wanted me to he just said “...idk...” 

Then he joked about having a boner for an hour after I asked “what’s up?”

I was honestly a little uncomfortable. I said kind of quietly that I saw him as a brother, so knowing about private parts wasn’t really in my interest. Eventually I told he could log off, get rid of it and return to the call if he wanted. He didn’t. Later before we ended the call, he told me it was just a joke. 

I’m really confused about this friendship now? I don’t want to be more than friends and I mean he has his girlfriend and sometimes he thinks it’s fun to fake flirt and other times he can’t do it because “oh my girlfriend is amazing.” 

Should I say something? I’ve been thinking about deleting him, honestly. This friendship kind of hurts. No responds, him being very weird and I mean he’s online, but he plays with a group I can’t be a part of. He always apologizes profusely. I’m not mad though. Just kind of sad. What do I do in this situation? I’ve been thinking about not texting him and seeing if he takes contact again. I think he will... I’m just confused. 

I’m not good at talking about feelings either. It’s hard for me to tell him I missed him, even if he said it first. I force it out though because I do miss him. The last time I tried to say it’s a little sad I have to text him multiple times to play, he almost took it as a break up. 

I don’t wanna lose him??? Advice??",30Jun2019,1

589,"Ask since pretty much everyone I know has a different take. I'll give mine after, but I want to hear what you guys think too.

I met this girl about 3 weeks and we've hit it off insanely hard. Like I've never clicked with anyone so fast.

We've chilled 4 times since we met, 2 of which weren't dates since we met from mutual friends and were just chilling. On the 3rd time it turns out we both felt ways about each other so it turned into a mini date. Date 2 we both knew what was going on. Had an amazing night together. 

Later on in the night we were sitting by the water and making out. She broke the kiss at one point and says she really wish she met me at a different time. I asked why and she said she just got out of a 2 year relationship a few days before the 3rd time we hung out and she doesn't want me to only be a rebound. She asked me what I thought. I told her I'm going along with whatever might happen and we shouldn't force anything, be it towards a relationship or away from each other out of fear. Said we should just let things happen naturally and we'll know what's right for us as we see each other more. She agreed and the mood went back to how it was beforehand. Rest of the night went great, she fed me a shitload of compliments and said we absolutely have to hang out again.

So, I'm not 100% sure how to take the rebound comment. I'm taking it as she was dropping hints she may want a relationship and wants to chill until she feels ready for something and not rush into it. A few of my friends feel she's trying to say she's not interested. Some others are saying she was just shit testing me to see how I'd react to the thought of her just wanting sex from me.

Thoughts? 

**TL:DR; went on a couple dates with a girl. She said she wish she had met me at a different time since she recently got out of a long relationship. Asked me how I felt. Told her we should just let things happen as they happen. Not sure how to take her comment. I'm taking it as her hinting she wants more but isn't ready yet. Thoughts?**",30Jun2019,1

595,"Hi all, I'm looking for some outside advise.

I work in a job that is not very specialist. We hire many agency staff on a temp to perm basis, you don't need much experience except knowing how to use a pc (it's an office job).

To start, there are many issues with our side of the company. One major issue is the system we use, it is flawed in so many ways but its not the whole company that uses it, just us few departments who deal with customers. The bosses know its flawed but they truly don't understand how much hassle it causes for the customers and staff.

But the major issue, and the one I want to approach someone about, is the emotional and thus physical well being of the staff. This place is making us sick.
It's not even the job, it's the way they do things. You have little rules like you do in most jobs but people get pulled up for the most ridiculous things and it's given everyone a major complex. We have people not wanting to drink too much water because they are scared of taking what may be deemed as 'too many' or 'too long' toilet breaks. Now they may have only been mentioned once or twice but it's more about how the staff have been made to feel.

There is a lot of sickness and work plays a huge part. A lot of people who are sick for a day or two always end up with a whole week off as the stress and anxiety of returning and possible getting in trouble for it. Many staff have left, I've spoke to a few who have said they ""couldn't cope anymore"". 

It's really hard to put into words without giving away details of the company, but long story short we are hired for a minimum wage job but then ran into the ground with little care for our wellbeing. This is a very big company with very big offices around the world and even our site is huge.

I really want to write this up and give it to someone. I want to take anonymous quotes from people who work here and those who have quit/been fired about how this job affected their mental wellbeing. There are a few people with illnesses that flare up with stress and they are really suffering. Everyone wants to quit. It's an epidemic and it's really quite scary. I genuinely believe someone may get very hurt, especially with the young people who may not know this is not how you are supposed to be treated at work, I don't want the stress to take anyone too far. People are leaving all the time and the usual response from others is that they are jealous or well done for getting out. Even people who have been there for years are joking about defacing any recruitment material to tell people to save themselves by not applying. 

The reason I want to do this is because I do not think the bigger bosses are aware. Its funny because our stats aren't great as a company and I just want to scream at them that if they treated us better it would make your company stats better!!! I want to put something in writing, maybe even present stats etc to try and get this seriously addressed. I will not put the company name anywhere in the document so I shouldn't get into any trouble for slander/libel, I will also use a new email address etc to cover myself.

I just want to know whether other people think I should consider doing this? I'm not trying to start a fight, but I desperately want someone to help everyone. We all need it. They put on loads of events about helping mental wellbeing and try to think of iniatives so I'm hoping that the only reason they haven't addressed this is because they aren't aware?

Also, should I mention about issues with the company and how they would be improved with staffing improvements, or only refer to the issue with staff treatment?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Ps I am experienced in research methods and ethics and I would obviously adhere to all of that with the staff and everything will be anonymous in the write up and notes etc",30Jun2019,1
596,"Tl:Dr : any tips on getting dreams and sleeping better ?

For the past six months I haven't been able to get quality sleep and falling asleep takes about half an hour on some of my best nights.

I wonder if it has to do with the fact that I always wish to engage in conversations with people, but I always that what I'm sayong woild even make sense. I usually  don't think about these during the day, but, when I plan on going to bed, I always think of how the conversation would have panned out.

I felt so bad during midle-school whenever I explained one of my strangely specific and usless hypothetical scenarios to my classmates ( mostly my best friends ) and they flat-out called me stupid. 

I just feel a desire to know how everything would've turned out if I just knew how to consistently and clearly explain my incredibly pointless and obtuse ideas that make me think reconsidering and questioning my own sanity ( when reevaluating them ).

Furthermore, Does anyone know a subreddit (or a forum where I could share my ""alternate realities"" or most questionable ideas where (in example ) everyone would be asinged a different elemnt or different elements based on their personalities (mine were fire and air, because my sign is leo and I've never met anyone that didn't think my sign was anything but leo).

A note on the ""alternate reality"": I also thought that fire and air would be fitting because I saw a character in the Naruto manga that used scorch style and I, being edgy, thought it was the coolest ninjutsu.

Anyways, any advice on sleeping better (or dealing with anxiety ) ? Could this be considered a rant ? Why do I find falling asleep so unfulfilling and miles harder than it should be?",30Jun2019,0

So weekends are very special to me because we are both off and I want to spend time together.

His family annoys me too, because I know they don’t respect our time together. Also his brother is 30 years old and wants to hang out every single day. He has no life and every time we try to set him up with a girl or friends he gets anxiety.

612,"I'm 25(F) and in a complicated situation in my relationship. The first time I wrote this it became a novel so I'm going to try my best to just hit you with key facts:

\- I have been with my bf for 7 years. We were each others 'first' everything and our lives are completely entangled. We planned to eventually get married and have a future together. (this is not cute or mushy just wait)

\- From the beginning of our relationship, we both had set VERY specific boundaries on what was considered cheating. HE was the one who's boundaries were more prude than mine.

\- Last month he made some HUGE confessions to me about things I had 0 idea about and would have never known without him telling me.

\- Basically he told me that within the past 3 years: he has paid for private dances at strip-clubs, visited a rub-and-tug TWICE, and he also confessed that this past summer he was grinding and flirting with some girl at a club. He didn't follow through with intercourse in any of these situations.

\- The club/strip-club things I would more easily get over the only reason it bothers me is because he was always the one who said that stuff wasn't acceptable. The rub and tug situation is what has me f\*cked up (our sex life is vigorous so I can't imagine why this guy paid for bad handjobs TWICE)

\- The times he did these things he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and he says in this time he was pushing everyone away and felt lonely and is aware his actions only worsened everything and it became a negative feedback loop. He has been totally sober for 6 months. He says he loves me and the reason he came clean is because he wants to have a life with me but can't until he's honest because, ""he loves me too much let me have a future with that version of him and I deserve better whether that is with or without him.""

\- I knew he was depressed and suicidal the past few years and apparently it was over the guilt of all of this. He swears up and down that he would never cheat again because it messed him up that he was doing this  to me and he never wants to live with that pain again. He was ready for me to break up with him but I'm trying to stay and work things out. I really have seen his life and mental health turn around for the better these past few months.

\- I always thought if someone cheated it meant they didn't love you enough and it was time to throw the whole relationship away. I was ready to spend my life with this kid and really believe he wont do it again. I want to stay in the relationship but that being said, I can't really get over everything that he did and feel so much resentment and sadness. Every time things start to feel normal it almost makes me more sad that we had this beautiful 1 in a million relationship and he could do something like this. I really love him and think this is a mistake he made and has grown up from and won't do again but I also am resentful that he did something so messed up and just gets to stay with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of you will say to just leave but as a friend of mine said ""even if you start a brand new relationship, that person could cheat on you too and you'd never know. At least this person came forward on his own."" I really want to stay but how do I move forward in this relationship and deal with these resentful feelings?  How have you guys gotten over cheating (even if you ended the relationship how do you deal with those feelings and depression that it incites)?",30Jun2019,2
615,"I dont know why, but it is happening for a few months now. I have dreams about stabbing people, I feel emotionally unstable and often find myself contemplating about putting a knife in someone's kidney. The worst part is, I enjoy it. I like the feeling. Since I am financially unable to afford special help, I came here, maybe one of you can help me.

I do not think about ""huh, I should murder this guy"" or a specific person, I just like the idea of stabbing someone. I have not done it before, and every since I was little I had a passion for swords and knifes. When playing outside, I loved to bring a plastic/wooden sword and battle with my friends. No one could move that sword like me, I had difderent tactics and for a young age I was able to do different moves and thinking about new things to try. No kid ever could beat me.

Even when we fought with sticks, which are a lot heavier, I still won.

At fourteen, I beat the shit out of a creep until he bled.

I have rage issues, i am probably bipolar, and I can be easily triggered, by even the smallest things. Of course, being easily triggered didnt happen in a couple of years, since the last time I did my best to control my feelings.

But rages still happened. I would scream, or hit everyone who made me angry. Usually I cant control what I was doing.

I wasnt bullied or abused, my parents treated me fine most of the time, but my father has the raging problem too. It happens rarely, but I know it is there, and he told me that when we were having a discussion about how it is not right to just scream when something isnt the way I wanted.

Happily, there is no one I can really hurt, as I still live with my parents and I am still pretty young. I was an alcoholic, i quit, then relapsed, then quit again and relapsed again, and now I am here, where I decided quitting forever is not possible, I can just delay until my next drink, so I decided to do it moderately every couple of days, so I wouldnt have the need to go and drink till I fall under the table. (my dad is/was also an alcoholic, he didnt drink much in the last couple of months so thats why i put the ""/"") 


I am not socially rejected, but I do have anxiety.

I am afraid of becoming this monster with no control, I am afraid of becoming a killer,because I am good at manipulating people, I can read people and often they turn to me when they need to talk to someone. I am a pretty smart person, and can always find ways to do something I usually cant. For example, I used to sneak in places I shouldnt be, and guards never caught me. 

When did this all started? I guess it started with a depressed phase, 2 years back, when a girl rejected me, I moved on, she then gave me hints and made me think she was interesed in me, only in the night when we were hitting on each other at a party, she kissed another guy. I had enough of that stupid ""I dont like you, now I love you, now I dont"". 

Of course it wasnt just the girl that brought me to this state, but I guess she was a starting point, since then I turned down a couple of girls who were interesed in me and my last girlfriend  was a few years ago. 

A lot of things happened, not really traumatizing or something, but all of them added up just made a mess. 

I am currently sure I should to something to prevent losing control, and I considered either finding a way without killing somebody to lifetime prison  or taking my life before I take somebody's else. 

I hate myself for enjoying these things. 

Also, I should mention, talking to somebody cant be done. I dont want them to think I am crazy or something, even if I am. I hope if I snap, whatever  plan my sick ass does, to fail and get caught. 

I do not want to snap. I literally do not know what to do. I am confused. I am not depressed,and during the day I am a pretty chill person, sometimes funny, sometimes quiet. I do get these bad feelings from time to time. It usually starts either with these kinds of dreams or an unsignificant thing that happened during the day, like sharing something I wasnt ready to share (which pretty much made me make this post), hearing something about someone, listening to someone's else's depression etc etc.

So - if you read through my post history, you’ll be able to gather a wee bit more info on what I’m on about :)

So, I used to (as the title states) be in a relationship with this girl. We both liked each other (or at least I hope we did) and both had a great time doing things together. She really was perfect - I’m not gonna go into details because she is a Redditor and I don’t really want her to know it’s her I’m on about :).
A while into our relationship, you know the time where you start to open up to them about things, and tell ‘em everything? We broke up. Thankfully, it was nothing to do with me; and I know that a lot of other things are going on in her life that (by the sounds of things) seem a lot more important than a relationship at this point. 
I really appreciate that she told me this, and I can’t help but feel that I didn’t do enough to help her through whatever it is that is occurring. 
Now, hence the title, I am gonna continue on to explain how I’d love to get back together with her.
As previously stated, things were going on. We’ve all been through something in our lives that’s affected us in one way or another, and that’s why I sympathise with her so much.
Now, I don’t know whether to just speak to her one day, or even to leave it completely - and that’s why I’ve taken to you, fellow advice-givers .
I don’t want to do anything she doesn’t want to do, and I’d like whatever she wants over what I’d like. Even if that means not really doing much for the next few years while we sort things out together. I don’t mind doing that, as she really is perfect. 
What is the best way to go with this? I really like her (love, maybe) but am I going too fast, am I wasting my time, or is this a great idea and I should do it instantly?

Feel free to give some advice in the comments, I’d appreciate it.
Also please upvote for more people to see this &amp; give more advice :)

tl;dr: I used to be in this relationship with a girl and we broke up due to external issues on her behalf. I love her, and would do anything to get back together with her - what is the best course of action?

622,"In a month I'm supposed to be meeting a girl he knows who is like a 10/10 BEAUTIFUL Russian girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

He showed her a picture of me and asked her if she'd ""make me a man"" but she's like 1,000 leagues above me and is new here from Russia. So in a month I'm supposed to meet with them at his house and she would presumably take me to the bedroom while he's in the living room.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly terrified. My first experience with a gorgeous woman and I have no clue what I'm doing, and I'm not even sure she wants to do it even though she's seen me and agreed. I know if it does happen I'll finish before PIV because she's that good looking. I also don't want to make her uncomfortable. I'm a short chubby guy with a decently attractive face, but she's still way beyond me and we haven't met yet.

624,"I don't want to make this a long post, I'll do my best to keep it short. But I've got a lot to tell, ik very grateful if you bare with me. 

So to start me and my boyfriend have been together for two years this summer and it has been nothing but great. His parents like me, I even sleep at his parents house occasionally and it's all been great. (We're both 24, he still lives with his parents I live on my own).

The problem is my family, my parents don't really seem to care to meet him. My mom asks a question or two once in a while my dad however doesnt seem to be interested at all. Even tough I thought that dads would be over protective of their daughters. 
I used to have a great bond with my mom, I thought. Which is basically doing everything together. When I'm with my mom there really isn't a time I'm on my own. We are either together outside or together in the living room. I still have my own room at my parents where I stay on a weekly basis. (Im sorry this is such a slur of things). 

Anyways because I'm spending time with my inlaws, I'm feeling more and more sad and anxious because my boyfriend still hasn't met my parents. I don't think talking to my parents will help, cause it will result in my parents telling me that I know I can't let anyone in the house cause it's messy and not really clean (which is true but is still something they can do something about, they literally have no reason not to, mom doesnt work). 

I've been feeling terrible on a daily basis because of this. My boyfriend wants to just visit unannounced, but I'm not really for a fight. I know I will hurt my parents and they will see me as a trader and even though this also breaks me, they are still my parents. And I understand they don't want him over because of the house, but they also don't want to meet anywhere else. Also my boyfriend insist on seeing the house I grew up in. He is also born in a fairly rich environment, whereas I'm born pretty poor, on a level of not having anything to eat but dry bread or macaroni cheese. 

I feel like I'm walking on eggshells trying to keep everyone happy. And I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. I can't talk to my parent, I don't know what to tell my boyfriend. And I'm so far gone in my miserable state that I'm actually thinking of breaking up, because he is the greatest guy ever and he deserves a girlfriend that gives him everything he needs (a welcoming inlaw family for example). 

I need advice, I don't know how to keep going.",30Jun2019,1
625,"NEED YOUR OPINION:

I don’t drive, I catch a ride with my boyfriend to work (We live together and work in the same mall, our shifts normally coincide. We have one car which we split payments, insurance, gas for due to financial reasons). He constantly stays up late on his computer playing games, watching YouTube, etc with his gamer friends as a result he almost ALWAYS makes me late for work because he has a hard time waking up. It makes me mad that I am basically forced to pay up for the car but when it comes down to it he still makes me late/doesn’t care. He knows that if I lose my job, we’re BOTH going to suffer from it. 
With the money that I put towards the car, I could be using to pay for my Lyft/Uber rides but because of that I don’t have the financial freedom to do so like I used to be able to. 
I feel like it should be 50/50, I help pay for the car, he drives and doesn’t make me late for work. Your thoughts? Do I have every right to be mad??",30Jun2019,0
626,"I’m 23 &amp; don’t have much experience with the bar scene so I’ve started to go out a few weekends. But lately I have been acting so stupid and then regret it all the next day. I haven’t cheated or anything but the stuff I have done is so cringy.

Last night me &amp; some friends met a group of guys &amp; there was this one guy who was incredibly good looking and acted flirty towards me. We kept exchanging eye contact and the way he was looking at me, seemed like he was really into me. He heard I was in a relationship but at the time I didn’t know he was too. So we all go to a bar and he bought me and my friends drinks which was really nice. I thought they would all dance with us but just stood by the dance floor instead. I asked the guy if he wanted to dance and started grinding on him and he seemed ok with it but I was getting really intimate by wrapping his arms around me &amp; after a few mins he walks away and his friends leave. 

I just feel so bad now that I’m sober because I have a bf and later found out he has a gf too. I’m in a ldr &amp; never see my bf &amp; he’s always too busy to talk, so I’ve also been incredibly lonely lately.

This behavior is just so unlike me. I feel like I have just been acting so reckless lately and don’t know why. I love my bf but I was into that guy in the moment for some reason &amp; just wanted to dance with him since he bought us all drinks. Looking back, I am so f&amp;cking embarrassed because I feel like I made them uncomfortable &amp; they probably thought I was just a sloppy hoe. It makes me feel like what I did was basically spitting in their faces and my bfs.

I've always had trouble going to sleep early (before 11pm). My usual is about 12pm - 8/9am. It takes me anywhere between 30-60 min to fall asleep.

629,"The charge is check fraud and it is a seven month sentence .  I was thinking of allowing my daughter to visit her. But I am not sure if I should because I don't think my daughter to be exposed to a prison environment. It is nothing to do with the mother is solely the environment. Also I hear it is a hassle to get in and you don't even get much time to speak. Seeing her mom there might be a bad image. Her mom will be dressed in a jail uniform and is of course rightfully being treated like any other inmate but that might send a ""normalizing"" message to my daughter . My daughter seems to be taking it fine , she also said it is kind of funny that her mother is locked up and is now the one being ordered around by others. This is weird because she never had a bad relationship with her mother. I asked what she meant and she said she was just joking. I think that is OK to try to crack a joke to make the situation feel less bad and that a better way of handing the situation instead of being hysterical about it If I do allow her what should I tell her in advance to prepare her? Is it a good idea for her to ask her mother questions about all this? also, I am willing to still let her be involved with her daughter and other things going on by telling her everything when she calls and asking about them. Is this alright? I managed to talk to one of the main guards that works at that jail. She said that since my daughter is a teenagers it is perfectly fine to take her.

633,"The area my parents live in has a localized neighborhood watch. The neighborhood they live in is a pretty nice and up-scale place, not gated or anything but it's nice. Two weekends ago I went to visit them. I left that evening and thought nothing of it.

Well this morning I went to breakfast with them and my sister for my Mom's birthday. It was then that they told me that I had been reported to the neighborhood watch website a few weeks ago by a woman that lived near them. She put my description on there, what car I drove, she even told people to be on the lookout for me. WTF??

I can't think of anything I did to warrant that from this woman. I mean, I've been told that I am a pretty scary looking and intimidating guy due to my beard and build, and that's what my parents chocked it up to, but that explanation just makes me even more angry. I was just driving down the street in the middle of the day minding my own business; I know that the sole reason for it is the way I look. When I pressed my parents about it they told me to calm down and forget it. They even think it's kind of funny.

I've been stewing about it all day. All I can think about is this rich entitled judgmental white bitch (I'm white too BTW) that profiled me. You know, your typical ""Karen"" is how I imagine her in my head. I wish I knew who she was so I could have some choice words with her., but my parents won't tell me who she is.

636,"So I interviewed for an amazing job opportunity, amazing company, actual proper wage going up to an amazing wage I never dreamed of after 2 years training, its incredible.

The man in charge of everyone in the program took a liking to me and as I was unsuccessful getting one of their other programs, he put me in straight for an interview with this one rather than doing the initial group interview as well.

It's an industry where I studied a lot of in school 6 years ago but my whole career since starting work 7 years ago has been in a completely different field and industry.

At the start of the year, I started getting back into it because I was interested in doing a side project for the current job I have to get them an online presence and online ordering as that's the biggest complaint our customers have.

It's in IT and all my fascination in tech has always been in old tech, mainly old computers, old video games, that's what's always fascinated me but since learning about what's going on in technology now, I am amazed. Its so incredible, I have other projects I want to do once I've learnt more skills but I'm still very new to it all.

I believe I made a good impression, I was turned down for the other job because others had stronger leader skills than I did and there was only 2 places. After being turned down I knew there'd be other programs I'd be interested in so I asked everyone I could at the company what I could be doing to improve which the advice was improve my skills. 

It hasn't been much time since being turned down and this interview and I have been studying hard but I'm still lacking knowledge.

As the point of the program is to learn, they aren't looking for people with fluent skills but for people who are passionate.

Normally I'm an incredibly passionate person, I list it as one of my top skills and believe if people aren't passionate and dedicated to the businesses success, well you won't ever do well in that company.

I pride myself in my communication, my job and career has required excellent communication with many different people. I've lead teams of up to 12 people, I've been told by many people, including customers and coworkers (coworkers who didn't have faith in me) that love how personable I am and how much I help them.

Well so far so good, right?

I feel like I completely choked in the phone interview. 90% of my current job is on the phone, I am so confident on the phone, I had so much prepared for the interview. I researched the company, who was interviewing me, success stories to do with the company, questions, answers for potential questions, I founf the job description and wrote reasons why I'd fit everything they're looking for in the perfect candidate.

I had never felt so ready for an interview but I just fell apart on the phone. He was a very very kind man, easy to get along with but it was such a short interview,i didn't have many opportunities to explain myself, ask about things I found (nothing about himself, I used his LinkedIn to just get an idea of his place in the company), everytime I was answering he cut me off to continue. He was only interested in my skills, he kept stating they didn't need someone with skills but that's all he wanted to know about me. It made me nervous.

I was still incredibly polite, I felt like I asked him good questions. I said how I'm studying one set of skills but is there anything else I should be learning and he offered to send me some resources.

When he sent me the resources he also stated in the email they didn't need someone with professional level of these skills but able to find solutions very well.

I followed up by saying thank you again and leaving a short description of ways I solve problems in my work life, personal life and how much I'm enjoying finding solutions when I'm studying. Then wished him a good weekend.

If I don't get this... I really don't know what I'll do with my life. I know I'll find something, I suffer from anxiety and I'm working so hard to rationalise it all, distract myself etc

I want to be prepared to hear I didn't get it but whenever I try, and I have a lot skills to help me rationalise but everytime I think about it, I feel my heart racing, I'm feeling panicky. I hate not having control of feelings like this.

I know it really won't be the end of the world if I don't get it but I wondered if any of you had advice to help me prepare in case of dissapointment

638,"Aight, first post on Reddit, here goes nothing;

&amp;#x200B;

So, first off; I'm 16, in HS and there's this smallish, kinda chubby, blonde girl which is technically a childhood friend of mine which I have some vague memories of, we've got a lot of things in common, such as videogames, memes, anime (Tho, I'm less experienced in that topic) and we're both socially awkward, absolutely airheaded and easily distracted teenagers, we've known each other for around... one and a half years and we're pretty good friends and I have a few months before school ends and we maybe end up getting separated before I can confess because of the fact that in our school, you can only go as far as 4th grade (We're from another continent, btw. School system here is drastically different from what a lot of you are used to) before you have to go to another place to do 5th and 6th grade.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's certain signs one can show when they're interested in someone else and I've been thinking of wether she's shown any or not. As far as I know, she's shown a few things that could or could not be signs;

1- She always listens when I call her attention to talk about something

2- She laughs very easily and for quite a while with some of my dumb jokes

3- She always seems happy to see me

4(ish)- One time, when there was a bit of a situation going on outside our school (Some students said they didn't wanna go in because the security service changed, yada yada yada) and she said that if I went in the school, she'd go in, so she seems to trust me quite a bit

&amp;#x200B;

Now, with all that said... There's a big catch. She mentioned once that she had a boyfriend, however, they haven't seen each other nor talked to each other in any way for what I think is like a year or more, her BF studies on a school far from ours, plus, she said she isn't how she used to be so she doesn't even know wether he'd still like her. Also; not too long ago, I asked her about her BF and she responded with something along the lines of:

""Boyfriend? I don't even remember having a boyfriend."" in a bit of a confused tone. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, now I'm wondering wether I should wait for her to bring up her relationship with her BF to see if they have broken up or not, be straight forward with her or just wait and see if she herself tries to make a move. I don't wanna get in the middle of a pre-existing relationship if they still consider themselves BF and GF. Besides, if she does reject me, hopefully we can still atleast remain as good friends.

...

Okay, there's something I still should mention. There's a second big catch. She's got another friend who's also into her and has been proposing to her for the last 2 years and is still trying. Now, he's in no way a bad person or anything and I don't wanna get too in depth in this for the sake of not shaming him but not too long ago, he proposed once more, in Japanese. She talked about it with me and by how she sounded about it, it was pretty clear she was gonna reject  him once more- And yes, she's already rejected him before, she even said she did it in such a way that he couldn't misunderstand it for something else and he's STILL trying. So I'm kind of worried that even if this does work out for me, that he might get jealous in a bad way. I haven't said anything to the guy about her rejecting him or me being interested in her.

&amp;#x200B;

So..... Should I try to make a move or not?

So far I'm telling myself to just wait and see how things unfold but not wait too much to the point that it's too late.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and; Thanks in advance to all who wasted their time to read this wall of text and gave me advice on what to do.

642,"So I'm in Year 9, going into Year 10 and really want a girlfriend.

 I have liked this one girl for about 3 years now, even asking her out once, and today we went to the cinema together with some other friends (two male, two female including the girl I like). We all meet up at Subway, order, then leave. The two guys go to the cinema to get the tickets, while the two girls go to a shop to get snacks because it is cheaper than going to the cinema to get them. The whole walk there (about 10 mins) they are talking about this guy and essentially how they want to date/bang him. Then the girl I like turns to me and says ""I wish you had just gone with (the guys)"". I simply said back ""I really needed a drink so I walked with you, is that a problem"" and she jokingly replies ""Yes!"" (We are good friends as we get the bus after school together). For the rest of the walk I remain in silence. We get there, get our stuff, then the guys arrive saying they got the tickets. They also get their stuff and queue up. The girls were at the front of the queue and so I assumed they would wait around for us. Apparently not as they just sped ahead of us. I paid and waited for the guys, and we walk out the shop. They are standing outside the shop, still talking about this guy. One of the guys says to me ""Oh yeah, they are talking about (the guy they like). I thought I would tell you so that you didn't get your hopes up (jokingly). Yeah, (girl that I like) really wants to bang (guy they like)"". I didn't really think much of it, maybe a little disheartened but I just shrugged it off and we walked to the cinema. The girls go into the toilets before the movie starts, but they are in there for quite a while. They walk up to our seats, and they sit the furthest away from me. No worries, it just means more time with the lads, right?

Anyway, movie is over, we all leave and two of us get picked up (one of the guys and the other girl). The girl I like wants to get the bus, but it is a short walk and neither of us guys have any money for the bus or our bus tickets. We convince her to walk, but she keeps complaining that she wouldn't have to be around us for as long if she just got the bus. I think the other guy takes it as a joke, but I don't really think it was intended to be like that. We get to the bus station, but her bus is ages away, so we all walk to the next bus stop, which is kinda out of my way but closer to their homes so I go along with them. I'm thinking, ""Sweet, more time with (girl I like)"". At the bus stop she just sits there on here phone, not going past one word or one sentence answers to everything. Think nothing of it again.

Skip forward a couple of hours, just before I started writing this and I look back and realise she really has no interest in me. I kind of feel like I've wasted my time a bit. Not suicidal, never, but just kinda, well, cheated out of time.

Meanwhile, there is this girl at school. I used to sit next to her in biology, and she is quite cute, she is smart and funny. I like her as well. Every time I bump into her we always do this kind of high five thing. She seems to get kinda nervous around me and I think she might like me back. Problem is, I barely know her. I have got not much evidence to prove she likes me. I'm worried if I ask her out and she says no. I don't want that to be the end of our friendship there and then. What do I do? Do I ask her out? What should I do if she asks me out? I really want a girlfriend, but have no clue what I am supposed to do as a boyfriend. Please help (sorry for the long post)!",30Jun2019,2
643,"PREFACE: So a few years back, I had a falling out with an old friend of mine. For discrepancy purposes, let’s call him Mark. I get a text from Mark saying that he feels bad and wants to apologize for doing such, and that they’re sorry. 

I’ve moved on since then but it was a very stressful experience for a good while, due to the fact that we were such great friends even since high school, and he kept avoiding me. 
Now he’s reaching out to me after several years and wants to catch up after such a long time. 

We’re both introverts so, naturally, there’s going to be a lot of awkward silences. 

I was never really good at awkward social interactions, so how can I address this massive Elephant in the room, w/out bumming Mark out or appearing as a huge downer?

 
TLDR: I hate prolonged periods of awkward silence. Does anyone know any easy, social tricks or ideas to avoid or move past these uncomfortable situations ? Any help is appreciated thx.",30Jun2019,0
644,"Hi, I’m a 15 year old F and I can stand being around my mother. A lot has happened that has made me grow to hate to be around her.  3 years ago my parents divorced (my parents were a lesbian couple, the problem I have is with my birth mother, who we will call BM for birth mom). My other mom cheated on her while they were engaged causing them to get divorced. Since they were no longer together it’s was just my BM and I in the house. She had no one but me to take her anger out on. It started with her yelling at me saying that it was my fault they divorced and more. Then it got worse when I would argue back and defend myself. She would throw stuff, grab my arm hard, and tell me how unlucky she was to end up with such an ungrateful daughter. She once threw a computer against the wall when I refused to give up my seat to her (stupid reason on both our parts ik). It caused me to think lowly of myself and become suicidal. It took me a long time but I got myself out of depression and am happy with myself now. She no longer gets physical (besides throw small objects down or slamming the door) but the fighting still hasn’t stopped. I’ve tried to make her happy with my academics but she makes it seem like my work is never enough even with my perfect grades, GPA, and awards. I’ve tried talking with a therapist before with no luck. My family won’t listen to my side so some now think lowly of me.  I’ve tried so hard to fix our relationship but I’m not going to continue to deal with her if she isn’t willing to try as well. Thank you for reading ❤️

647,"So it’s that time of my life where I’m being shipped of to college. Honestly I’ve been waiting all my life to be finally independent(I’m 17 so for like the past 5years) but now that my time has come I have been feeling a bit uneasy. Basically my college is like 1200km away from my home town and is like a completely new a place for me. At first I had a friend who was supposed to be attending the same college and I was looking forward to it but he unfortunately got into a different college and now I’m all alone going to a place where I’m like an outsider. I’ve also started to feel regret as if I’m doing something wrong. The thought of going to an unknown place for the next 4 years of my life scares me. I also don’t want to reject my offer just because I don’t have any friends who will be going with me. I keep telling my self that I have to fight my fear and tough it out but it does not work. I’m a bit of an introvert when it comes to meeting new people and honestly the only reason I have friends is because I been in the same school for my entire life( 14 years, basically there is not middle school or high school. It’s just a school). I don’t know how to start conversation with strangers or new classmates it just happens. You may be wondering how different can this new place be from my place, so I’m from India and in India there are like 29 states and 19 “official” languages and you might have guessed it I’m going to a place where I’m not good at speaking their language. Also to add to this mess I lived these past 17 years in Dubai (my father works there), my home town refers to where my grand parents live. So India itself is kind off a new place for me, even though I used to visit every year. Because my father insisted that I study in India I had to comply, he says i should look at it as a learning experience and understand how to live alone in a new place. So I’m just looking for some advice here on how to react. This feeling unease has been eating me up and it does not help that I had 3months of free time(I’ll start my college next month). It does not matter where you might be from I just want some advice on college, like how to make new friends and you know enjoy my college life to the fullest.

Even though you might not be a college student yourself you might be a person who moved to a new place unlike me and had to make friends, so literally any Advice would help me.",30Jun2019,1

Note: Very new to redit and this is my second post. Sorry for poor grammar and spelling. I have accepted my fate with having poor skills in my native language

Background:
When I was in high school I had this really good friend that was gay. She was awesome and I always had a blast when she had parties with her gf. After the relationship (a good 3 months later) she asked me out. She said she never felt this way about a guy before. We dated for a while and I loved her. But as we were dating I realized that we had different expectations of what we wanted in a relationship. I initiated the break up but it was mutual and we were good friends. 
Before I went off to college I asked to get back together and she said no because she liked women, and I respect that, so we still stayed friends. We and a few friends talked in a group chat. Some info about me: I have terrible ocd and low self esteem. So sometimes I’ll ask if I am talking too much or about myself to often, which in hindsight, I only asked that often rather than what I thought. 
Note: I should also say that this group was big into caring for each others mental health. I never really talked about mine because I thought they had enough on their plate.

So in chat one day (they usually steam roll my comments not involving “am I talking to much about me”. But I asked it one day and 2 of the four people in my group said some very hurtful things. 
After talking to the other people in the chat one on one and to some family irl, they said that they have been treating me poorly, especially my ex. I never saw it as that, and since you folks were not there, you can’t really get the entire situation, so maybe I’m wrong. But I have asked other people for outside perspectives and they said I wasn’t being treated fairly. After that I cut contact from them and her. I talked to her and she said that “I need tough love” and that I was too nice to be true.
Note: by all means am I not perfect. I try to be as respectful as possible but I know I’m not a “nice guy”. Then again it is my word for your interpretation, so I will let you decide that for yourself. 

Note: in our relationship I was always agreeing and never yelled at her or swore at her.

I broke off all contact and don’t talk to her.

Bit more background info:
I came home for winter break and went out to hang with some friends. I returned home to see that my mother had a blank look on her face. My ex had made cookies that followed my dietary restrictions and put them on a plate that had my favorite tv characters. I don’t remember if I sent a thank you message but still silence after that.


Story: 
I’m home for the summer and I happened to look at my ex’s profile on social media and it said she was single. Thought nothing of it and went on my merry way. Then, a month later, she texts me and says I’m a good person. She says that out of the people she’s dated that I was the best and that I deserve to find someone that treats me well. I thanked her (I do t like ignoring people, it’s just a mean thing to do). But now I’m stunned and confused.

Q1: what could that mean? She said she was just thinking about it but idk

Q2: I have always missed her, but now I feel strained and confused of what to do. I kinda want to ask her back but she never apologized and she’s still not into men that I know of (I still respect what she wants as every person should do). The thing is, I just started talking to a girl I met on a dating app and I haven’t been in a relationship in 2 1/2 years. I do t know what to do. I know we had different ideas in what we wanted out of a relationship. But time has passed. But am I just making excuses to get back with her if she will even take me?

Sorry for the long post:
TL:DR: 
I girl I dated that was gay but liked me split because we didn’t see eye to eye and she became mean to me so I stopped talking to her. Two years later she texts me saying very nice things and now I’m confused.

I did post this in dating advice, but figured it would be ok here. Thank you!",30Jun2019,1

653,"I [22F] recently discovered my dad had an affair when my brother and I were young. This lead to my mother and his divorce and two months after the divorce was filed, he marries his new love affair. I’m personally very against cheating on your s/o and have had to rethink of how I view my dad.

He’s a trump supporter and condones his misogynistic sayings by saying “guys say that stuff in the gym all the time.” As if “grab her by the pussy” is ever ok. I’m fairly democratic so I guess you could say we also have clashing ideologies.

Growing up he was pretty uninvolved from my brother and I’s lives, and hardly made any of our events (we were both in band and other activities growing up). I didn’t know if he’d be at my college graduation or not because he hadn’t talked to me at all.

He loves to try and win us over with saying how much money he’s spent on childcare support, and says that now childcare is done (my brother and I are both 18+ now), he can support us on his own terms. He just told my mom he wouldn’t be helping my brother through college despite having previously told my brother that he would.    He lies often and never carries through with what he says.

Every time we talk he guilts me on how I haven’t seen him. It’s never, “i’m so glad to see you” it’s always “i wish you would see me more.” It’s stressful and frustrating to talk to him. I’m a recent college graduate working over full time and I don’t have time to visit my parents on the weekends when I can hardly even get time to relax by myself. (My mother doesn’t do this btw, I have a very good relationship with her)

TLDR; I wrote out a long text kind of outlining all of this stuff (besides the cheating, will probably talk to him about that later...) because he’s been calling me lately, and after so many times of me ignoring them, my stepmom texted me telling me to tell him if there’s something wrong (funny the text still didn’t come from him). I included that I do love him and hope to have a good relationship eventually, but that the current relationship would have to change.

657,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. So my friend in middle school is being abused by his family. (physically) It's mainly just when they spank him they do it in an illegal way. They whip him with a belt all over his body (anywhere besides the ass is abuse- I'm 95% Sure of) like his head, his arms, his back and I really want to help him out. He's sent me pictures of the marks but only through snapchat do they're not saved and they go away after a while.
         Sometimes when he brings it up he makes it clear that he hates it, he's even contemplating suicide but he also says that he doesn't want me to do anything about it. I understand that becuase I wouldn't either, my family has a had a history with child services and honestly I hate CPS and DCF becuase they go overboard with everything. Plus his family has 13 or 14 members ranging from 20s to babies and I don't want to mess their lives up by taking them away from his parents. I'm thinking I should put an anonymous report but all of the consequences would still occur.  Plus his family is poor so that could cause problems and I really don't want to do this. 
           Now I understand children need discipline, I used to get spanked on the ass and at first I completely hated it, but now I understand why parents do it. HOWEVER, I am not okay when my friend contemplates suicide (obviously) over stuff that the parents are doing unnecessary.
Please give advice as whether I should leave an anonymous report, do nothing or anything else I could do that could possibly save the family members' relationships with eachother. Thank you.

Ps. I'm gonna talk with him too over whether or not if I should actually do it however even if he says no I still want to report it.",30Jun2019,1

Hey everyone. My name is Erin, I'm a teen and I think I was diagnosed with anxiety. The doctor never explicitly said it and neither did my Councillor but they have said phrases about how I have the symptoms of it and my frequent anxiety attacks kinda clue me in on this. This is going to be a wild ride of a post. 

I get a message from a friend. I read it but I'm just bored. I get another text and I get bored with them too and think of an excuse so I don't have to text back all the time. Some friends I love texting but others I just can't. I can't be bothered to be Frank. I like them but I just can't do it. I've researched online and I have no clue what's wrong with me.

Then we have the main issue. I'm lesbian and I know it. I have have so many issues with it. All my friends coming out stories they say they knew at 12 or even 10. I came out as bisexual at 12/13 and I then came out as lesbian at 15. I feel as though I was a late bloomer and why did others know before me. Was I too late? Did I know but not really?

One friend was so cruel. He knew the struggle it took me to try and work through my issues with my sexuality and I knew I was lesbian. He then tried convincing me that I was bisexual. I sobbed on the bus that night because of what he said. I know I'm lesbian but he has sowed seeds of doubt in me that tell me I'm not. I'm trying so hard but he has taken me back to my place of uncertainty.

Mum thinks my anxiety has gotten better after Jason {name changed} ( Jason is my friend who killed himself) because she thinks I don't have attacks. I have them upstairs in my room or out and I don't tell her. I can't do it. She doesn't believe me. She didn't want me talking to anyone cause I can just talk to her. I know I need help but I cant get it. I'm going to college in a few months so I'm going to ask for help there becuase they can't tell mum I asked.

My life seems to be breaking down bit by bit and I didn't even notice. Its so sudden to me but I have realised how slow it has really been. I thought I was okay. I convinced myself I was. But I haven't been for a while. Im not okay.

660,"Hello, everyone

This my first post on this sub! I thought you guys could give me advice on my sleep habits and problems.

I’m currently in my late teenage years. I have always slept around 12 am and wake up around 9-10 am. That has been my schedule for many years (at least for summer time), sometime I sleep earlier sometime later.

But these last 2 months my sleep schedule has flipped and I hate it. I’m a muslim, so last month was Ramadan and I have to wake up everyday for meal midnight so I can fast the next day. So because of Ramadan I started to sleep around 4 and 5 am, and waking up later in the day. It was fine because it was Ramadan.

Now Ramadan has ended, I’m trying to flip my schedule and it has been very hard to do so. After some work I made myself sleep at 2 am. And waking up around 10-11 am. Still pretty late for me, and I don’t feel healthy when I wake up

After all of this, I decided to make a huge decision and absolutely flip my sleep schedule to a MUCH better and healthier option, which is sleeping at 9 pm and waking up at 4:30 am. 

I know it is a HUGE shift but I genuinely want execute that option. I think I will have a much healthier day and life. 

So I need so advice and tips of how to make this shift work in the best and fastest way possible? Any tips would be great!

And so far its worked, in the outside. I don't get angry at all anymore, rarely even get annoyed, don't yell, I'm not pretty.

I denied it at first and told myself that I don’t actually like him I just like the idea of him. I did this to myself because when we first started talking he told me he was moving, not like to a different town but like a different country. So when I started realizing I had these feelings I didn’t want to believe it. I eventually went to my friends for advice and they said just go for it he’s going to be here for a few months so take your shot now while I have a couple of months with him. So I ended flirting with him a lot and he would flirt back and I could tell he started to like me back, we would always make fun of each other and then have deep conversations five minutes after. He was just one of those people I felt comfortable telling anything to. We have the same group of friends and I guess he’s told our mutual friends that he doesn’t want to lose me when he moves and stuff like that. I thought it was strange cause I thought we were just gonna keep in touch and stay friends. So now it’s at the point where he’s moving in less than a month, and one of my friends just recently told me that he was planning on asking me out the next time we hung out. My friends told me to try a long distance relationship and if it doesn’t work it doesn’t work. I’m afraid that if it doesn’t work i’m going to lose him for good and now i’m putting a pressure on myself that it has to work out. I’ve also thought of just telling him how I feel and how I don’t know if im ready for a long distance relationship, we’re still young so we still have our lives ahead of us. I’ve seen what long distance relationships can do to people and I really don’t want that to happen to me but at the same time this guy has made my life 100x better in the past few months. He’s honestly an amazing person and if he wasn’t moving I would say yes in a heartbeat, like he makes me feel so special and anytime I think about him I get major butterflies in my stomach. He’s also a very touchy person and always makes physical contact and every time he touches me wether it’s playfully hitting my arm or trying to throw me in a pool my heart skips a beat every time. I’ve never been in love before and so I don’t really know what it feels like exactly but this is the closest I have been to love and I don’t want to throw it away.

I went to college to study subjects I love (history and philosophy). While in college, I was lucky enough to: study abroad, form strong relationships with my professors, work two great internships, win a research grant, become a TA, and be something of a leader in my departments. I was also lucky enough to get a job as a case manager at a local law firm as soon as I graduated in December.

&amp;#x200B;

The catch? I hate my job. The work itself is monotonous and comes in unmanageable quantities. The work environment is gossipy and cliquey to the point of feeling like high school, and management isn't in a position to fix either of those problems at the moment. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/besx22/my_first_real_job_is_turning_out_to_be_a_bit_of_a/el9dgig/?context=3) if you want more detail.

According to the rulebook, soldier can have a short mustache, but he didn't give a fuck about this.

The problem is that I don't have any mustache, and what he considered as ""mustache"" was just a shaving residue. I have a very dark facial hair, so even after the cleanest shave, I still have some tiny single hairs visible. 

So, after this I ended with cutted face, because I tried do hard to shave this single hairs.

But it isn't the whole story - this same corporal ordered me to do 30 pushups on the pavement because I told ""yes"" instead of ""yes,sir"".  So I cutted my hands as well.


In addition, he tries to make fun of me in the front of whole companion.

I'm one step away from beating the shit out of this guy.

It's a mobbing, or I'm just too delicate?


The exercises themselves (by far) are also terrible - I live with 10 other people in one small room, and the beds are so shaky, that nobody could sleep.

The only thing that I learned today was a making bed on the time in three different variants, and making a room perfectly clean. 

Oh, we also have only two T-shirts, two pairs and boxers, and three pairs of socks - good look with daily washing.

We had a ten minutes to shower today, and there is only three cabines for something like 23 folks here.

I expected that I would learn useful skills here, and not some Prussian discipline, because it's a course directly dedicated to become cybersecurity NGO, and not some fuckin trooper.",30Jun2019,1
676,"Sorry if my rambling is messy/poorly worded. Haven’t gotten a good sleep/meal in a while and my brain is fried. 

I am planning on moving back to my parent’s house because my current living situation has become toxic. I cannot move in right away because I have one more semester left of school. The college is about an hour + away from my parent’s and there’s only a month left so i figured might as well save some cash and sleep out of my car. 

I’ve never done this before and I’m nervous. I have a pass to a 24 hour gym so I don’t have to worry about showers or the restroom. I have a knife and pepper spray on hand if things were to go down. 

I watched some cool videos on YouTube giving advice on how to live out of your car. I heard you could find someone to rent their driveway space to park. That sounds awesome but I don’t know how I’d go about finding someone to do that? Is there a subreddit I could request such a thing? Or is Craigslist my best bet?

My BF has never been a fan of phone calls and/or video chats since he feels anxious over the phone etc, so we never call. In the past month I think I’ve spoken to him on the phone 4 times (2 of which he was drunk with friends) and we’ve video chatted twice. 

I’ve kept asking if he wants to try to work on the anxiety and try to call but he’s reluctant. 

I really miss him and it sucks that it can go weeks without me hearing his voice/seeing him (snaps/insta not included). I wish we Would call more. 

Am I overreacting? Should I continue to Push for more calls? If so how without upsetting him?

681,"So to preface, my family (parents, aunt, uncle, kids), my boyfriend and I were out at a brewery yesterday, eating lunch and shooting the shit. I was only half paying attention to the conversation when I overheard my mom saying that one of her coworkers has a newly three year old son that she is trying to potty train. The coworker had said she was having trouble with him and that he had peed on the floor and so she grabbed him and rubbed his face in it. My boyfriend and I had a bit of a double take moment and clarified that that was what her coworker had said--it was. While the general consensus at the table was that what the coworker had did was bad, my boyfriend and I were the only ones who thought it was something worthy of reporting to CPS/proper authorities.

I kept asking my mom which of her coworkers it was so that we could report (boyfriend had CPS website open on his phone) but everyone at the table shut it down and seemed to act like wanting to report it seemed crazy. I don't know but I'm pretty sure that rubbing your barely three year old child in his urine is abusive and fucked up. And while I can only hazard a guess that this type of behavior is likely only the tip of the iceberg if the coworker was willing to share it with my mom I worry about his safety if this is the home environment he is in. The conversation was shut down fairly adamantly and we left soon after but it's been nagging in the back of my mind ever since.

I guess my main issue is that I didn't catch the coworkers name so there's no way for me to report this without continuing to pester my mom about it. Based off of how the lunch conversation went , however, I doubt she'll be any help. Is there any way for me to report someone without a name, or will I have to continue to ask my mom to give me the coworkers name/report it herself?",30Jun2019,1

i’m currently having a major dilemma. I just graduated high school 2 weeks ago and turn 18 in september. My family is very abusive and i’m ready to get out of dodge for my mental healths sake. I have a plan but it’s no where close to even working I think.

I’m currently in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend who lives in Gerogia. She used to live here in VA but she moved away. My original plan was to move in with her after I turned 18 and pay her mom rent, but that plan fell through. I still want to move to georgia to be near her, but i’d need to get my own place. 
So my plan would be to move to georgia, stay with my girlfriend for a month or so until I find a place to live, find another landscaping job, and make ends meet. I want to go to community college but i’m not sure how that would all work. 

I just need to get away from my family, i’m tired of being sad all the time. I feel if I just got an apartment here in my city i’d still be just as sad because i’d be around them. I just want to get up and leave. 

Please tell me if i’m being stupid. Sorry if any of this didn’t make sense.",30Jun2019,1

691,"I was born and raised in a small, Mormon town in Utah.

Everyone was the same. We all even look the same. I swear 90% of the population here could pass for my sibling. We all eat fry sauce and jello and have the same awkward mannerisms. 

I stopped believing in the church, but was surrounded by the same monotony and I still blended in perfectly with the culture I was sculpted by.

I finally found something I truly loved in high school: Debate. It was a place where creative, progressive ideas could finally be discussed and discovered. It’s the only hobby I’ve ever really, truly loved. I spent hours preparing. I was invigorated by being forced to look at issues from different perspectives.

I went to college in Salt Lake City, which is somewhat liberal. I loved college. I continued to study a bunch of topics that I have since realized have pretty much zero career potential, like Philosophy and Rhetoric. I was passionate about those topics and loved the actual classes, but I couldn’t seem to “get out there”.

I’m just so....awkward, and quite socially anxious. I made friends so easily in church, and I still immediately make friends with other Mormons, because I just share their culture. I might be a liberal, feminist, atheist, but Mormons still view me as “one of them”, and others see me as...Mormon.

I unfortunately didn’t join any clubs in college, or really make any friends. I just have no inertia. I don’t know how to pop out of my bubble.

I’m now 25, drifting from dead end job to dead end job nearby SLC.

The meaninglessness is crushing. I have very few friends. I actually love education and learning and would pursue a graduate degree, but my grades are too low.

I don’t know if I should just up and move somewhere else. I don’t know how I would. I have like $30 in my savings account.

I can’t find anything I even really enjoy since I’ve graduated, except for reading, but I need more. I need to engage with the real, physical world.

692,"My girlfriend's father passed, and she is trying to buy out her half siblings to own the house, and then move in while we build our home-on-wheels sitting in the driveway. We're renting an apartment with 2 roommates above the owners of the home and actively trying to settle a $12k water damage incident they're blaming us for. It's possible it was our fault but not actually known by either party, and the issue was guaranteed to happen eventually due to another leak they wont acknowledge. This on top of bad water pressure causing a non-functioning dishwasher and taking navy showers under a glorified drip, and no AC in this midwestern heat wave is causing us to want to bounce as soon as is possible. We have 12 months left on an 18 month lease. 

The lease states they need a 60 day notice of early termination and one months rent in early termination fees, and there's a clause in there that we have to pay rent until they/we find another tenant to move in. The house is in probate and being sold by the estate to the personal representative of the estate (my girlfriend).  The house can close in roughly 5 weeks and we're giving the 60 days notice in the next 48 hours. Buying the house is a non-issue as she's able to and willing to pay cash for the house if a mortgage was denied. Can we all move into the house in the next 2 weeks? Can we all move out of the apartment? We are able and willing to pay the rent and fees for the apartment, along with the mortgage on the house but are concerned that our actual occupancy will conflict with either the sale of the house or the status of our lease and don't want to be open to getting boned by the landlord, as we're not on the best terms as it stands now.

701,"Well this is probably going to sound really lame, but I’ve been dealing with this for a while and just want to get it off my chest.. maybe some can relate/give some advice. I’m just a bit lost with this situation, and just wanted to get some help since I can’t really share it IRL..

My ex and I broke up a few years ago, as I was not in love anymore. I thought I would easily find a new love, but have not fallen in lover ever since. 

I’ve always loved going to outdoor house/techno/disco festivals. Music, nice people, everyone dancing etc. I go to a festival every month or so throughout the summer. And this is the thing; I always thought I would find my new love at a festival. You know lots of good looking and fun girls. It’s kind of my dream/ideal situation to find a nice girl at a festival, both sharing the love for music and dancing and going home afterwards being all hyped. It’s been 3/4 years with lots of festivals, and it literally never happened. I did kiss with a girl at a festival, two times or so. But never the “ideal” situation.. it probably sounds stupid, but in my head it’s like the perfect place where it should totally be possible. 

Sometimes I take xtc, lots of other people do as well, and everyone is so loveable, yet I can’t seem to get close to a love connection (or even spend the day kissing etc) with a girl at a festival. This sounds lame, but I’m a really social, outgoing, ok looking guy. I’ve dated with quite some girls and pretty easily make a move in the club or even randomly. I have no problem talking with girls, I’m not insecure about my looks (of course everyone has its things, but no big insecurities). 

It’s just that I don’t get why it has not happened ever in 3/4 years.. Maybe this sounds like a really lame question but I’ve been coming home after a festival with a really shitty feeling lately (this evening as well). It basically comes down to me not being able to enjoy a festival so much anymore, since it’s becoming a “negative” thing in my head. As I’ve not been able to make it happen while I would really like it and it looks like a total possible situation in my head. 

And in general it has to do with me thinking I would easily find a new love after my ex, and nothing is just working while I’m really putting in work. Working, studying, festivals, asking out girls, doing social stuff in general. Idk maybe it sounds lame/desperate, like a typical love-need story, but it’s starting to hurt me more and more, with good and bad times of course, but it’s always there in the background..

I find it hard to type this down, as I’m not sure if I’m being clear.. But maybe some can relate or give me some advice. All advice, experiences and feelings are welcome.

My parents are way to nice/forgiving and won't even threaten to cut him off but he's a total mooch. He makes decent money at his job and recently bought a 20k used sports car but won't get off my parents insurance because it'd be too expensive for him.

Although I don't love her no more and i don't find her attractive .

 
(Some backstory now( keeping it really short ))
When I was 12 I had a crush on her and she got into a relationship with one of my good friends and then with me and after that I felt really bad.
I was kinda ""depressed"".
 the usual 13 year old thing .
And I had strong anxiety and self issues.(backstory finished )
Today I still have trust issues but that's another thing .



But now being by the end of 15 my life is kinda perfect I love myself how I am . Although I'd like to be a bit heavier. 
I am really confident in myself and don't have any other problems  except I don't know what to do with my future ( sometimes I do overthink that) 
Every once in a while late at night feel lonely and I wish I could cuddle with her and just be with her. Not with other people just with her .
And when I see her its nothing. (But only sometimes )

She changed a lot in a  good way . She found herself. And became a nicer person .

707,"I don’t want this to be too long, but certain details are important. 

Almost 2 years ago, I hooked up with this guy “James”. James was great when we began talking, then he ghosted me after we hooked up for a few weeks. I had become friends with his friends that he had introduced me to in the meantime, so I never truly left his radar. 
We resumed messing around for a little while, then he started talking to another girl, and I got back with an ex. Our rendezvous’ were few and far between after our flings ended, but nothing serious ever came of it. 

Last summer, I got hammered with friends and ended up and one of James’ best friends houses. We hooked up. It was nothing serious. I don’t remember actually consenting, and afterwards told his friends that it was nothing that i wanted or that i ever intended to happen. 

Well, it happened again when I was drunk again at his house for a party. The second time, I was blacked out and remember nothing. We stopped being friends afterwards because he clearly could not distinguish how friends behave when the other is drunk(he had developed feelings for me)

Almost a year ago, James and I rekindled and started talking exclusively. He knew about the hookups and it has bothered him ever since. He brings it up during arguments, especially when he gets drunk with his friend that I regretfully hooked up with. 

James and I have gone on a vacation alone this past March. I have met his parents and a majority of his extended family-even being invited to their “family weekend” up north. He has no trouble with affection and the sex life is incredible. 

I have fallen in love with this man. He has said he has feelings for me. He also says he does not want to be in a relationship with me because he doesn’t trust me. I don’t know what to do.

But even if I know what words to use and in what order, for some reason I just can't get them out there. And overall, I think my whole personality changes when I start speaking English instead of Finnish. I just become this extremely innocent and maybe a little bit of an airhead, which is almost a complete oppisite of the real me. For example, when I speak in Finnish with my Finnish friends I can say basically anything weird and dark and definitely dirty minded, but when I speak in English with my friends from around the world (who are as close friends to me as my Finnish friends) I don't say those things and when other say those kinds of things I ""act"" kind of awkward and uncomfortable. In reality I have never been uncomfortable of what they are saying, but I just can't stop ""acting"" this way. I don't even know if I can call that acting, because I'm not doing it on purpose.

This bothers me a lot and I think it could become a bigger issue in the future. There's a high chance that I'll be moving to an English speaking country in a few years and possibly stay there to live my life. And well, I don't think it would really be beneficial if I seem dumber and have problems voicing my ideas in English.

How could I make my character not change when I change the language I speak.. and how can I learn to explain my ideas and thoughts, when it seems almost impossible to me?

TL;DR I'm a bilingual teenager, whose personality does a 180° flip when I speak in English. I really don't like that it happens, but I can't stop it. I want to be able to act normally when speaking English.",30Jun2019,3

714,"I need some advice on what to do in this situation. To start off, I am 25 y/o. I've been living at home since I graduated from high school. I suffered from housebound agoraphobia on and off since I graduated. There was one time in these past 7 years where I got well enough to live out of state with a friend. Unfortunately, a year later, my panic attacks came back, and I became housebound again quickly after that. At that time, I was not on any medication. I experienced a mental breakdown in early 2018, which is when I decided to start taking medication, Lexapro specifically. It took about a year of medication and lots of exposure work to get to where I'm at currently. I am not housebound, and have not been for about a year now. That said, I am still currently struggling with depression, which is why I decided to begin tapering from my medication in May. I have been off of Lexapro for a little over a week now.  


Early this year, I got my first job in over 3 years. I stayed there for a little over 3 months before leaving due to unfair treatment from management. During the time I worked there, I was actually able to pay all of my bills, and also have some money to do things on the weekend, like see a band play, or maybe get some more recording equipment for my home studio. Things seemed okay during this time, and I really miss having that financial security, but it honestly wasn't worth what I went through there. Two months later, my mom decided to give me an ultimatum, which was basically her way of saying ""you have a week to find somewhere else to live"".  


Her reasoning is that living with her is too easy, and that at my age, I shouldn't be living with her anymore. She thinks that doing this will help me. While I understand her position, I 100% disagree with her. It's the whole ""pull yourself up by your boot straps"" mentality. Most of my family is like this, to be fair. I'm dealing with things internally that she never experienced in her life. It's not to say that I deserve special treatment, but I certainly don't need tough love. I didn't do anything to deserve being kicked out. I am not a troublemaker by any stretch of the word. It's all financially motivated. My mom's job sucks, and they don't pay her a living wage. She can't afford to keep me up. I have empathy in this regard, because I understand that money is tight. But I've been doing various (legal) odd jobs on the side to make up little bits of money in order to feed myself, and take care of my basic needs since I left my previous job.  


I stayed with a friend of mine for the past two weeks, but the living conditions there were too much to bear. I was constantly having to fight against a flea infestation that didn't seem to be going anywhere. I don't want to complain, because my friend was only trying to help me, and I respect them for that. But I just can't live that way, and not lose my head.  


I don't know what I'm supposed to do at this point. I have no car, and very little means to actually acquire one. The only thing I can think of now is to sell all of my recording studio gear in order to fund a car so that I can get a job, and live on my own. It's so disheartening to see that as my only option, considering the fact that none of my family will take me in. I feel unwanted, and misunderstood. I am angry, I am tired, and I am terrified of what the future looks like for me. I have so much potential, but I feel like the universe is working hard to keep me down.",30Jun2019,2

721,"For the first time ever I need to reach out for advice on a situation I've never encountered. 

&amp;#x200B;

I attended a backyard BBQ at a very close friend's house yesterday. He was my best man and friend for 20 years. He has a wife and 2 children, 7 year old girl and 11 year old son. I have 2 children as well, my eldest is also a 7 year old girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

On our way home after the BBQ (which my wife could not attend due to other plans already committed to) I was asking my daughter what she thought of my friend's daughter, let's call her ""Anna"". Everything was fine she said. She said was nice and polite and everything was great but then she said 'just one thing was a little weird' and I asked her what it was but she refused to tell me. I asked her a number of times and she still held back but eventually I forced it out of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

She said that it was really bad and I said again, what was it, and she replied that she kissed her brother. I said ""OH! that's not SO bad"" and she said ""no.. it wasn't on the lips""....... and I replied ""she kissed his pee-pee"" and she nodded. 

&amp;#x200B;

wow my mind is blown. For some other background info my wife and his wife, although they get along just fine when together, then are not friends. My  friend is from my area but now lives and works on the other side of the country and is here only for a week visiting and they're gone again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Should I tell him? Should I even tell my wife. She tends to take things to an extreme. I wouldn't be surprised if she said we should never spend time with them again. If I tell my friend and he starts questioning his kids, his daughter will surely know my daughter told on her. From what I understood, it was something his daughter initiated. She is already a bit of a wild child at 7 years old. The older brother is a little more quiet and shy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how he will react. I'm assuming he will be deeply embarrassed. As crazy as it sounds to me, could it maybe be just kids being stupid and silly???

730,"sorry if this is super long winded, i tend to ramble a lot and i’m a stickler for details do my stories are agonisingly long

my friend group consists of 4 people, all aged 16 (S, A, E and myself). we are not rebellious or wild by any means, we are all quite reserved and well behaved. the friend i am concerned about is E.  we don’t get to hang out as a group often as E’s parents have made her get a full time job for the summer so she is only free on weekends and her parents are very reluctant to let her do things. E is a parents dream child; she’s quiet but still very chatty and easy to talk to, she does very well in school, she’s extremely well behaved, helps around the house, and her favourite hobby is reading. her parents, however, treat her as if she is the worst child imaginable and can’t do anything right. they yell at her all the time for anything and everything. they take her phone away for most of the day and every night at 8pm. they complain that she reads too much but they also won’t allow her to be social. any time she goes anywhere, including short school trips that shouldn’t be of any concern to them, they constantly text and call her and yell at her for not answering their calls immediately even though it would be ridiculous for her to take a phone call during some of these situations.

any time we have been over at E’s house we have all noticed that her mother acts very strangely - she is very easily agitated, has pretty much no short term memory, and can’t hold a conversation at all. it’s hard to describe in words but if you met her in person you would instantly know what i mean, she just acts very strangely and it’s extremely obvious that she’s not all there. all of my friends and our parents believe that E’s mother has some sort of mental issues.

 a few weeks ago we sorted a plan to get her parents to allow her to sleep over at my house for the last day of term, which would be her first sleepover in her life. they inundated her with texts the entire evening, and the next day her mother called to ask her what time she should be collected at. E answered politely“I don’t mind, whatever time suits you to pick me up i’m happy to leave” and her mother pretty much screamed down the phone “well then you can stay there forever for all i care!” and hung up. her entire family then proceeded to ignore all of her calls and texts for hours. the poor girl was stuck at my house until 7pm, hours after S and A had left. her father then finally called her back and was very agitated with her as if she was in the wrong and said he would come and pick her up. she said multiple times on this phone call that she was at MY house and had texted him the directions in case he wasn’t sure how to get there. he said alright and hung up. he then proceeded to show up at A’s house and started asking A’s stepdad if E could come out. A’s stepdad told him that E was at my house, not A’s. E’s dad then called E furious asking why she hadn’t told him the right house. she went home and texted us later with some vague excuse about her mum having a headache so that’s why all of her calls were ignored.

after this disaster of an event, we ended up only hanging out once, by going to a restaurant. her parents very reluctantly allowed her to go but kept texting her the whole time. 

we then made plans last week to hang out this weekend, go to the cinema and then stay the night at my house. last minute E said she couldn’t stay the night anymore but would still come to the cinema. she told us while we were together that her parents have decided she is only allowed one sleepover per term, so she won’t be able to have another sleepover at all this summer because we had one a few weeks ago. this didn’t make much sense to any of us, as that was an ‘end of term’ celebration so surely that wouldn’t even count as her summer sleepover? 

writing this out makes it sound not as bad as it is irl, but it’s very apparent that this has a negative effect on E. she constantly has to make excuses for her parents behaviour outside of the events described above. they treat her like a child but get extremely upset if she doesn’t act like an adult. they’re not allowing her to be a teenager! the rest of our friend group and I aren’t sure what to do - are we overstepping if we bring it up? how would we even bring it up to her?

Things were not going well between us, so she decided to broke up. I didn’t like most of her behaviors anyways (always screaming during an argument and throwing things on the floor sometimes).

She left our house and made me promise I’ll see her often and that I’ll not disappear out of the blue. She asked me if I could come to her house sometimes and sleep with her. She kept asking all this stuff.

I was expecting a period of me and her staying apart, but still seeing each other often and see if we could fix it. After all, she made me promise it and I was okay with that.

After all the promises... she started to do the exact opposite of everything she made me promise. It’s been 4 months.

She stopped texting me almost completely. She never invited me to her apartment (not even to eat something). She never want me to see more than a couple of hours per week. She’s completely cold and distant in everything.

I’m guessing there’s another guy involved and I even know who he’s.

The thing that makes me angry is this: she made me promise all of this while she wasn’t sure on how things were going to turn out for her. As soon as she saw things were going well between her and the new guy, she simply left me alone.

Even now she texts me some sweet stuff sometimes, like “I miss you” or crap like that, just to keep me in the loop.

I’ve suffered so much because of this and still am. Mainly because I wasn’t expecting she was going to be completely out of my life like this.

744,"Long story short, she's my first love, but I hurt her by blaming her how she wasn't privy and empathetic towards my own emotional needs. In other words, I was being selfish in the relationship about my perception of her lack of empathy in general (of which she still chooses to handle it pretty well by being super patient with me) and she just couldn't bear with it anymore on that very night when I had broken her by just leaving her car without even saying nor doing anything. I was the emotional burden of the relationship because I ended up expecting more from her.  
Thought I should do the right thing (even when I do still want her back in my heart), I invited her to do a proper, mutual break-up, of which she was already planning to do as well. Things ended up surprisingly well for both of us, we hugged and say goodbyes and wished for the best of our futures while remaining as friends.  
Needless to say, we're still friends after that, with a bit of casual chat here and there, until she told me she needed time to recover from the break-up and asked me to not ask how she's feeling for a while. I agreed, no hard feelings there either.  
A few days passed, and I felt absolutely terrible during the nights. Not only I've lost the person whom I loved the most, but the thought of how everything was supposed to be doing fine while we're friends spooked me in a way that I know I am definitely gonna be devastated if I ever see how fast she moved on and how fast she'll probably end up with another guy again. She and I belonged roughly around the same circle of friends, so encountering her presence on social media such as Facebook is common, and she did appear to have moved on rather quickly, which was told to me that it's normal for those who initiate the break-ups first.  
I went on ahead to read a few articles here and there and found out how important to have an NC (no contact) for at least 30 days, just to give both of us space to recover. I thought it may work, so I texted her, and arranged one with her rather cordially (which was a front I put up because I didn't wanna screw it all by saying how I wanted her back). She agreed.  
5 days have passed after the NC agreement. I read something about how the reason why it's hard to recover from a break-up was that we kept idealising our ex to be the one and only, and one of the articles have said that I needed to reevaluate and understand the entire relationship without a biased point of view. Maybe it wasn't all that good, to begin with, and although I was the one who was selfish, she too, was selfish by not taking the effort to at least try to be empathetic towards my emotional problems (I had past childhood traumas that became present-day insecurities). Maybe the relationship was ended because we weren't all that compatible.  
That very morning, it was dreadful for me, and for once in my life, I actually entertained the idea of ending myself right there and then, just to stop the pain. It wasn't just about losing her, it's about also how devastated I would be if I ever know she's going to find someone new. Somehow that made me feel that I'm more worthless than I'll ever be. I was depressed as hell, suicidal, and just plain angry about how she broke up with me.  
Out of a fit of anger, I texted her how I don't care about how she feels, and how she had destroyed me with the break-up. I even said how I'll probably end myself just to go through it, and essentially I ended up blaming her, which effectively rendered our mutual break-up to a bad break-up. She didn't take that kindly either, and told me how I don't even deserve to say that she had destroyed me, because apparently ""it was all my own doing"", something I hated people saying very much because it's akin to victim-blaming and telling people they are responsible for the pain in their lives that they have no control over. It was here I told myself: ""See Ed...in the end, she doesn't care, and really, nobody would have cared about the losers. She moved on quickly, so she's the winner, and winners don't care about losers"". I see that...somehow, as the greatest betrayal in my life, despite knowing it was I who broken her in the relationship.  
It was then after that, I know it's really over. I think deep down, I rather choose to make her hate me just so I have good enough of a reason to not think about her. Because I was afraid of the alternative...that is, being friends and all, and had to go through the devastation I know I'll felt when I finally see her with another guy.  
In short, I made her hate me. because I know I couldn't live with the fact if she is going to be friendly with me while having moved on, and found a new guy and all. Something in me simply refused to play the ""mature, sensible, politically correct adult"" anymore. Because the truth has always been the same. I wanted her back, and I've been digging myself deeper holes as if to run away from the fact...that we'll probably never gonna be together again.  
But if you have read until here, please know this. I still blame myself more over the whole thing. In fact, I'm not sure if I'll ever recover. I suck, I'm not mature, I'm not good at this at all. Maybe it is easier to just end up my life, after all, that is, until I read about how some women had to go through PTSD with their ex killing themselves after the break-up. I don't want that to happen to her.  
So yeah. If any of you wish to criticise me of what I've done and thought of so far, please do. It can't be any more worse than the pain I'm still going through, and I sincerely think I'll never ever gonna recover, and I believed that she will recover and moved on faster despite her saying how she's deathly afraid of trusting anyone anymore in the future because of me.  
Now, I'm just struggling to not go into Facebook if I can, only to find her and her friends collectively agree about what an asshole I am. I...really just wanted to die sometimes. I can't go on like this. Maybe they're all right. I am a worthless asshole that doesn't deserve anyone's care at all.",30Jun2019,1
745,"Hi everyone. I am a little conflicted and didn't know where else to turn to so here it goes. I currently am a nanny, have been with this particular family for almost 2 years. For the past 6 months, my current hours have been  cut down. Primarily, one of the main reasons given to me by my boss as to why this was happening is because my boss's husband doesn't like me because I wasn't a ""disciplinarian"" with his kids. My boss has no problem with how I manage her kids, but because of him, she has been cutting down my hours to avoid conflict with him apparently. Shortly after she cut down my hours, I had to have a talk with her and let her know that I was in a really bad financial situation and that I needed more hours. She agreed, and even offered me an hourly raise, to compensate. However, that only lasted for a short period of time. Ever since the summer started, she has really been skimpy on the hours, to the point where Ill only work 5 hours a week. Not only that but she has been super inconsistent with my schedule and only let me know last Friday that the next 2-3 of weeks I will probably only work 2 days max. She has been a great boss to me and I have a great relationship with her kids, however I can't help but feel taken advantage of because I tend to be way too nice most of the time, and because of this, I am in a real shitty place financially. I don't want to quit because she has always been super accommodating with my school schedule or whenever I need days off, however I am so tired of the recent inconsistency. Any advice would be great. Thank you all.",30Jun2019,2
747,"I work for a small ice cream business where we have a small staff under 10 people. Most of the time we like to talk smack to each other, and we know not to cross any lines when it comes to our playful banter. However yesterday a coworker asked me if I could get something off a high shelf that required me to use the step ladder. As I was on the ladder ready to grab the box a coworker pulled my pants down and everyone started to laugh. I didn't think it was funny and texted my boss about what happened. After about 20 mins I started to feel super weird and uncomfortable about the whole situation, and I walked out of the store and went home. After working for close to two years I'm finally moving on from this job and I start a new job in two weeks. The boss called me and told me that he was going to give the employee a write up for the incident and that I should come back to work and ""since i'm leaving in two weeks to not screw him over because of someone's mistake"" I have work in an hour and I still don't know what to do.",30Jun2019,13
748,"I've been dating a guy for about a month and things are going great. I really like him but the sex is mediocre. He isn't in to foreplay which is shane because it's what I like the most about sex. He doesn't go down on me or finger me unless I ask. When he does, it's really good. It's just that he doesn't really seem to want to. Even once when I did ask, he said no. 







To initiate, he makes out with me and kinda rubs his body on me and dry humps me. It really seems like it's more about him and I'm not really there. He's kind of a selfish lover. 








I don't know how to talk to him about this without coming across as mean. So far I've tried: asking him for what I want in the moment, and when not in the moment, I've talked about what I want him to do (like saying I can't wait for him to finger me as soon as we get to my place). I also initiate blowjobs and handjobs with him almost everytime we have sex. Lastly, I am always freshly showered when we hang out so I don't think its a hygiene thing. 







I want to talk to him about it but need help with the words. How can I get my point across without hurting his feelings/ego? When is a good time to bring it up? Etc.

750,"Hi guys. I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years with a guy who I’m starting to lose hope with now. I like to think I’ve been patient and tolerant up to now where it’s really getting me down. 

The issue is, he very very rarely asks me any questions, even basic ones like “how are you ?”. I always ask how he is, and I always get a response like “I’m fine, yeah” . There won’t ever be a follow up asking how I am, he’ll just give a direct answer and cut any conversation off. It’s always been the same, no matter what it’s about . Fave movies, books, games, places he wants to visit, what he wants in life. He’ll always just give an answer and then cut the conversation. He won’t ever ask what my favourite x thing is or what I thought of x thing or which x place I’d like to visit. In 4 years, I can honesty say he’s asked me only a handful of questions. It’s so frustrating to keep trying to make conversation only to keep having them shut off almost instantly and I have to keep pulling things out the air to ask him while never getting any question back to me. Its draining and I find myself now talking to other people about my day, how I am, what I’m doing.. rather than him. 
I’ve spoke to him about it before and he says he’ll try harder. Things might slightly improve for a few days and then it’s back to normal again. 
It’s been 4 years like this.. will anything ever change ? What’s the issue with him ? Any advice please ? Thank you in advance.",30Jun2019,6
751,"Hi, I am a rising junior in my college and the upcoming year is said to be one of the most difficult ones for the major, which is smaller. I've struggled a little in the past, namely with one class, but managed to get through it and enjoy what could be in store for me if I continue to pursue the major and most of the people seem like very interesting people I could get along with. However I am concerned some of my actions in regards to a past relationship are driving people away from talking to and interacting from me.
I dated someone a year above me in the major and we ended off on not great terms, honestly due to some things I did - once the relationship was over I took it very hard and said and did things I regret, like taking back an old gift I had goven them and telling them (I'll call them Jordan) to pretend we don't know each other. For context Jordan thought we may be able to be friends after the relationship but I wasn't on the same page at the time as I really did care about the relationship but didn't express it, choosing to instead ignore them in person and take back gifts even though I had said I was fine being friends. We also kept in contact over text, which turned out to be a mistake since when I saw something that indicated they were dating again, I was upset at first since I thought we had an agreement to wait for a bit to date until I realized I can't control them anymore and should want what is best for them. This caused me to send Jordan a text that was supposed to have the intention of letting them know that it would be fine if they dated other people and not to worry about the previous thing I had asked (waiting to date) but they interpreted it as me accusing them of dating people from my class. Im now aware of how weird this all sounds, especially since it seems like I was trying to give them permission to move on, but at the time I supposed that it would be best to let them know what I was thinking. I also tried to return the gift but left it outside their car intead of meeting up with them in person, which I thought would be best at the time since I thought they were also avoiding me (turns out that was probably just because I was being so wierd and avoidant, funny how hindsight works).
After all of this I started to realize my mindsets were unhealthy and wanted to try to be friends again, at which point they were understandably done not willing to go through with friendship, citing how I avoided Jordan in person, took back a gift, and accused them of trying to date other people. Id also like to add that in general I am not good at social interactions (social anxiety) and didn't really know how to react to seeing them everyday while giving myself time to heal but I can now see how this sends the wrong message, not that it excuses past behavior.
So if you were wondering how the hell my classes and this relationship connect, get ready for the most daring crossover event ever.
Over the past summer Jordan helped teach people in my class for a mandatory summer class and threw parties that I was invited to and didn't attend for various reasons, such as lack of people to go with, just got out of a night class, etc. The problem is many of the students in my major attended and are now much closer because of it, and having good friends withing the major is important in order to pass classes. This may also be a contributing factor in Jordan thinking I was avoiding them. What I'm afraid of now is that because I didn't attend these events and Jordan has actively admitted they don't want to be friends, I'm worried people know about how I reacted to the breakup and now want nothing to do with me because of it. I have nothing against any of them and they all are interesting people that I know have some of my same interests, but its not like you can force people to be your friends or even like you, right? 
Essentially my question is: is it possible to show these people in my major that I'm interested in being a better person and talking to them? How can I get over this fear that they all hate me (overdramatic I know)? What are some steps I can take to try to show people I want to change? Should I just change and hope people notice?

Thanks for the help. I know theres a lot to unpack here.

Tldr; I dated someone in my major for some time, they broke up with me and I avoided them also due to other reasons, but now I may have distanced myself from people in my major which will make it hard to pass college. I want to win people over but am afraid if I see the person I dated or their friends I will shut down, as I tend to do in complex social situations.",30Jun2019,2
752,"I know it sounds like a trivial question, but hear me out.

I’m in college and have had a very tough time in the relationship area of life. I have never been asked out, on a date, kissed, etc. and I suspect it might have to do with the way people interpret my personality. I guess I can come off as cold, uncaring, emotionless, a little bold, etc. even though I try to show my emotions so people don’t think that.

For me, I take relationships very seriously and I don’t catch feelings often. I usually only start liking someone after I know them as a friend.

Anyway, I have this guy friend who I have known for several years. We are not in each other’s immediate friend groups but we do hang out and see each other around fairly often. I started developing feelings for him a few months ago. I was just finished getting over a very close friend of mine who hurt me terribly (admitted feelings for each other, it was really exciting, and then he backed out on it but continued leading me on for months). So I wasn’t exactly trying to do this all over again lol.

I could spend ages trying to figure out if this guy likes me back or not but I don’t think it’s worth it to ruminate. Basically, I’m considering just ripping off the band-aid and telling him I have feelings for him. I’m afraid that if I don’t, my feelings will get worse and I’ll end up hurting more than it would if we just talked about it. I’m aware that it might risk the friendship, but my past experience tells me that it won’t hurt the friendship if it’s one worth keeping.

He is the shy, overly polite type and even if he has feelings I think he’d be extremely cautious about mentioning it. He made a joke about asking me out once last year, I shut him down and he got really upset (it was stupid of me, i know, pls dont attack me). I think that because of the kind of person he is and the great relationship we have already, it’d be stupid to pass up an opportunity that neither of us might have expected.

Anyway, is it worth it to just say something?

(TL;DR: I get very stressed out about having feelings. Wondering if I should just tell my friend I like him, suspect he might feel the same but not trying to get caught up in figuring it out.)",30Jun2019,2

754,"You could say that, in recent days, I have become ""woke"" to the fact that the Earth is a veritable ticking time bomb of ecological disaster.  So, I have decided to join the CCL and go into Civil/Environmental Engineering in college to help combat the current climate change crisis.  However, I'm still worried that humanity is doomed.  In addition to what I normally read online, I keep reading predictions of how human civilization will collapse or we'll all go extinct in X years, too little too late to save the Earth, the IPCC reports are underestimating feedback loops, et cetera.  And a part of me is wondering ""What if they're right?""  What if, even if humanity does everything it can, humanity or its civilization comes to an end.  I know I should be and typically am hopeful/confident that humanity can pull itself out of this, but what if I'm wrong?  

To sum this up, I'm committing myself to fighting climate change and the negatives of the Anthropocene era, but I'm not sure if anything I or humanity does in the future will spare us from human extinction, and the fact that the future is uncertain when it comes to the potential apocalypse terrifies me.   Any advice on how to deal with this uncertainty?  Am I right for thinking humanity can survive to 2100 at least somewhat intact?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.",30Jun2019,1

As time passed, i noticed this guy looking at me very often, but he never talked to me. I also notice that he doesn't seem an extrovert, i find him very reserved and serious.

It's like we are in school, we just met a bunch of new people with the same interests and we all get along, and spend all day together.

This guy is around my age and he really makes me laugh, a lot. The more time I spend with him the more I see like I could easily fall for him. But I know since almost day one he has a girlfriend, therefore I try not to flirt with him and just talk normally. 

Today, another colleague told me he has been having problems with his girlfriend (of seven years fml) , he's thinking of dumping her because he's falling in love with someone at our job...

Idk, it's too much of a coincidence, I don't want be the reason a couple breaks up (I'm not saying I am... But there's a chance) but we've still got two more weeks of training and I can't just avoid him.

I don't know what to do... I'm seeing myself easily falling for him but having a relationship with someone I work with, is something I never wanted to do... And then there's also the current girlfriend situation.
