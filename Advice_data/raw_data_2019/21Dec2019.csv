0,I graduated like 5 months ago I’m gonna start college this January but I need a part time job but have no experience at all,21Dec2019,1
1,"I’ve been at my current job for almost 3 years now. It’s been a rocky road and business has started to kind of slow down, but we’ve also got a few big projects coming up. At the end of the year, my boss likes to take us out for a Christmas lunch. We’re a very small company so we don’t do Christmas parties or anything over the top. After lunch she usually gives me and my only coworker presents and an envelope with our yearly bonus. She also gives us our monthly paycheck before we leave for Christmas break. (Our office closes from Christmas until after New Years) She writes us personal checks every month; that’s how she pays us. Well I got home today excited to open the gift she got me this year. It was sweet and thoughtful but then it dawned on me that I didn’t get a bonus this year. I Looked around in the gift bag and the box she got me and I didn’t see an envelope. It also dawned on me that she’s going to be gone between today until January 7th. She didn’t give us our monthly paycheck today. On one hand I understand if she didn’t have the funds for the bonuses this year but I’m also pissed that she didn’t at least give us our monthly paychecks. I’ve thought about resigning from this position for the past 3 months and the only reason I stayed was because of the very generous bonus she gives at the end of the year. She never mentioned it to us that there will be no bonuses this year. I’m less angry about the bonus at this point and more angry that I didn’t get my paycheck. I’m not sure how to address this matter. 

TL;DR my boss got me a nice small gift but didn’t give me my monthly paycheck or a bonus. Don’t know how to approach the situation.",21Dec2019,1

 at the end of the appointment she leaned on the desk with her hands together  and  said 'well if I don't see you... Have a nice Christmas', and then smiled when I looked up at her.

5,"BASICALLY I have a crush on this girl, we’re close friends but she doesn’t see it as any more than that, but like we fake flirt a lot so ?? Idk ?? anyways my best friend also has a crush on her, however she has told our whole friendship group and I haven’t, so the whole group are like shipping them, and finding ways to get them together and stuff.

6,"It's really long, but I hope you'll take out the time to read it and give me some advice.

Childhood: Before college
I've been brought up in a scenario where I had to shut off my feelings for a considerable amount of time in my childhood. An instance of this would be blaming myself whenever my parents fighter for any random reason. I've been an introvert throughout my life and I've had difficulty making small talk, even though I was considered a talkative child when I was a kid.
The end part of my childhood consisted of dealing with my feelings towards my parents for not providing me with enough opportunities as a kid to socialize as they took the role of helicopter parents perfectly. Apart from this the fights between my parents grew, and I couldn't do anything but to show a calm face to my younger brother during those scenarios. My father had been caught a couple of times cheating on my mother, and I couldn't see myself being like him at any cost. This did emotionally break me down during standardized test preparation, and my results plummeted in important tests. 

College: About to graduate
I entered college with a sense of responsibility, with a desire to start everything from scratch and build a new me. Unsurprisingly I got burnt out and broke down a couple of times during the first fall sem. Failed two courses and got the lowest GPA(didn't get suspended for that, thankfully). 
Went back home, and by this time I had mentioned that I didn't want to continue that program. ""Nope, you're just overthinking"", damn right I was. 
I broke down again twice or thrice each in the next three semesters, and even requested my dad  to get me medical help. And of course, that didn't happen. After six semesters, I finally got an intern and paid for my treatment(diagnosed with anxiety and depression) with the money I got. 

The real story:
I met a girl in my college in the second semester, and we started talking for a couple of days. We started dating a few days after that, and broke up in the following summer: the reason being that she probably wasn't talking to me properly. I initiated the breakup. She had a thing of not talking over the phone, but when you connect with someone who understands you so well, you just can't argue with them, right? 
The reason came out to be that she wasn't into that relationship seriously, and later during the third semester we talk to each other and laugh about it. A couple of days later we start dating again, this time with a sense of what we really want from it. A month later, she decides to quit college because she wanted to change her major and that wasn't possible there. We decide to carry it forward as a long distance, and that we'll understand each other's requirements properly. 
We end up breaking up during the summer following the fourth semester, the reason being that she had to focus on her studies and that career was something that should be given more preference. I initiated the breakup, again. 
We talk again when she got admission in another college while I was in the fifth semester, and by that time my mood swings and decision making weren't at a stable level. My mental health was rapidly deteriorating and so was my relationship with my parents and friends. In the beginning of the sixth semester, I breakup up with her stating the reason that my mental health needed some help, and that I had to be selfish about it. 

Problem:
I started talking to her in the summer following the sixth semester, telling her about my status and had a general discussion with her. I probably should have taken more time because I blocked her right away after that (mood swings) from everywhere. At that time I thought that was the right thing to do, for having any connection with an ex ""isn't a good idea"". 

About three months ago, I received a message from her wishing me happy birthday, and I started sobbing for what I've done over these years. She knows everything about me, and even though I talk to her on an irregular basis and it feels as if we don't have any connection, I don't know if sharing my feelings for her would be a good idea after all this time. Could someone help me out?",21Dec2019,1

I said I'd help him build him a PC over Christmas break if he has the money for it. I don't have the best stomach so I'll probably end up throwing up or something if his room/house is as bad or worse. I don't know how I'm gonna bring this up without coming off as a dick",21Dec2019,1

9,"i'm 18, I'm on the verge of being homeless for a possibly up to a week or more in a city that I have family in, but haven't spoken to in years and it would feel awkward to intrude during the holidays while they're with their family. I am voluntarily wanting to leave where I am since its incredibly unhealthy for me, my father is aggressive at times. I dont want to go to a homeless shelter, saw pictures of homeless shelters and how crammed they are. I'm bringing expensive electronics that I dont want stolen. I have money saved up to purchase an airbnb but I dont have an 'government id' and somebody told me here on reddit it would take up to 10 days to make an ID official. My mom wants to fly me back to my home state after I get my high school diploma which I will have soon. Im was planning on staying at an airbnb until the flight, but I cant because I dont have the government ID, only a school one. If I go to the DMV and get it, will I get it right away? My mom said she would let me use hers but I dont know if thats allowed or not so im not going to do that. Is this legal? Are there any house sharing sites out there that will not ask for ID? Should I just go get a hotel or something? ( They're more expensive )",21Dec2019,1
10,"Hello, everybody, 

&amp;#x200B;

first of all, it should be said that the post is not intended as self-promotion.

&amp;#x200B;

It is about my current web-dev project: qmeta, an online ""gaming business card"".

The point is that someone has a profile where all his social networks and gaming accounts are listed.

&amp;#x200B;

Why all this?

Very simple: I'm from Germany and stream frequently on Twitch. I'm a web developer by profession, so I thought I'd develop my own website for my viewers. But thanks to the GDPR and imprint obligation I am forced to prove a complete imprint. Of course, as a streamer, you don't want to publish your contact data, such as place of residence or phone number, to viewers.

So.. the first idea was to develop a platform for streamers. From this idea we expanded to ""all gamers"" who are interested in having all contact data on one platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a short overview of the functions:

\- No registration is necessary. A simple login via Steam is enough.

\- If you know your Steam-ID, you practically already have a profile, just add it in the following pattern: [https://www.qmeta.net/user/](https://www.qmeta.net/user/)&lt;STEAMID&gt;/

\- The following services are currently supported: Steam, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, Youtube, discord

\- Selectable profile designs

\- Fully Responsive

\- HTML widget to embed your profile on your own website

\- Fully GDPR conform

\- No Google services

\- Multilingual (Sorry if the English is partly not correct. Was translated from German via Deepl)

\- If the cookie banner has not been accepted, no cookies are set at all, not even the system cookies

\- Spotlight for new friend suggestions

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What is planned for the future?

\- Integration of the following services: PSN, Xbox, Ubisoft Launcher, GOG Launcher, Epic Launcher (FU Epic)

&amp;#x200B;

What do I want from you?

I am a perfectionist and would like to hear your critical opinion about the project.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats the URL: [https://www.qmeta.net](https://www.qmeta.net) (q = quick, meta = metadata) .net = network

&amp;#x200B;

Thats it. Thank you!",21Dec2019,1

13,"I'm in high school, and when I got on the bus today I was ready to do the usual listen to music stuff, then I look up because I saw a shadow block the light from the window and this guy I've known since first grade is just staring at me. I don't know him that well, have talked to him like 2 or 3 times, and he started talking to me, asking me weird stuff like do I masturbate, have I ever fingered myself, what do I do when I'm horny, what kind of porn do I watch, if I've ever dated someone, etc. I was kind of confused so I answered no to all of them (even if I did I wouldn't tell him) and put my headphones in thinking he'd get the message.

He keeps talking to me and I try to push the conversation towards anime, which apparently we both like and now I feel disgusted that I even tried to talk about it with him. Every time I try to talk about mangas or stuff he turns things towards something like ""So would you give a guy top if he was cute/would you at least give him a handjob"" when I said no, and then he tells me he thinks I'm cute, to which I just mmhm. 

A few seconds before the bus is about to roll up to his stop, he asks,""Can I squeeze/grab/touch your titty?"" (Don't remember which he used anymore, think it was touch). I told him no, and he replied with,""Come on, I'm about to get off (the bus)."" I said no again and he kept insisting, at one point claiming that ""you know you want me to"". I refused and when the bus stopped he said ""alright"".

It didn't really sink in until a few hours later (I have previous trauma from when I was seven years old with sexual abuse). He had put his number in before he'd said anything about grabbing my chest and I blocked him immediately as soon as I got home. 

I have to see him whether I want to or not after the two week winter break is over, so I unblocked temporarily to basically tell him to fuck off. Can I please have some advice on how to do this?",21Dec2019,1
14,"This has annoyingly been something I can’t stop ruminating over. 

I met this person 5 months ago and turned down three others to pursue them romantically. And ah. They’ve not really seemed all that interested...  I initiate %90 of the time and they barely respond. The only reason I’m hanging on here is because they seem to value the time when we do hangout. When they make a promise they always follow through. 

Realistically they don’t like me. if they did they would make the effort. One of my best friends tells me I’m wasting my time.  I just feel like I should tell them something just in case they’re that fucking oblivious. I don’t know how to communicate well in situations like this.

15,I'm really anxious about my in laws visiting. Their last visit for our son's 2nd birthday was really bad. Lots of yelling between my wife and her mother. Her father called me a ditch digger in front of my wife and kids because I'm in the military. And they really dislike the fact that we had a second child (I.e. he wasn't supposed to be born). They're verbally abusive and I'm just not ready for this. I told my wife I'm asking them to leave at the first instance of verbal abuse this time and that didn't go over well. I have no idea what to do.,21Dec2019,1
16,"A girl I was friends with in work recently fell out with me because I was friends with her boyfriend. I'm gay, so this should not matter at all, but she's possessive and I think genuinely crazy. She has told multiple people in work I tried to sleep with him (currently in the closet and she knows I'm unable to tell anyone for certain reasons so can't defend myself), that I'm a home wrecker, that they should stay away from me and not be my friend etc, luckily they know what she's like and didn't believe her. She's my boss, kind of like assistant manager, so she has a lot of control over my work life. 

She regularly tries to make my life hell in work, giving me all the jobs I hate, sending me to different floors for no reason apart from taking me away from my friends, being rude and very short with me when I ask questions, even in front of customers(she's my upper line so I have to ask her things).

I don't know whether this is something I can bring up with my manager, I'm mostly scared that telling her will only make this girl act even worse towards me. Right now people in work are being supportive of me in this situation, but as she's technically my boss she can send me away from them and give me even more jobs I hate etc. I don't know whether to just suck it up and ignore her attempts to upset me, or whether to tell my manager what's happening. I don't want to spite her even more so she tries to spread more rumours, but I also don't want her to keep treating me like this.",21Dec2019,1
17,"For the past four to five years, I have been dealing with emotional numbness (depersonalization), sexual problems, among other side effects and symptoms. I have tried psychotherapy, sex therapy, 26 psychiatric medications, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, electro convulsive therapy, exercise, diet, attempts at positive thinking, and despite how hard I try, hardly anything budges. I haven't laughed, cried, or been aroused (among other things) for years and its really bugging me. I feel stable but also like a robot as if I cannot fully participate in society due to something holding me back.

So it started in 2014 when I was dealing with overwhelming anxiety about finances that made it hard for me to fall asleep. I remember the anxiety being so intense that I couldn't fall asleep until that intense anxiety faded away into oblivion and was substituted with numbness (anhedonia). This feeling would persist for a long time and after feeling numb for so long, in 2015 I started therapy. Due to my therapist not meshing well with me, and that I was spending buckoo bucks (a lot of money), I decided to try medication to deal with my problems. It was a rough nightmare. My prescribers were constantly titrating and tapering me off many psychiatric medications like SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, MAOI antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, lithium, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, esketamine, and antihistamines. In addition to that, I tried electroconvulsive therapy and trans-cranial magnet stimulation and while I didn't sad, hopless, suicidal, or bed-ridden, I still don't feel like what I used to be when I was a kid or a teen. My attraction (romantic and sexual) towards women has vanished years ago. No happiness, no ecstasy, no anger, no sadness, no confusion, no affection, nada.

I talked to several medical professionals and they told me that I am a unique treatment-resistant patient and that they have never met a patient who has been resistant to so many treatments. One day, when browsing through Reddit, I saw a thread of a woman complaining that her boyfriend's low libido is negatively affecting her quality of life. I then saw someone posted a comment that just made me heartbroken.

&gt; *If intimacy and sex are that important to you, you shouldn't settle since it is a crucial component in your quality of life in a relationship and you shouldn't have to suffer. Yes, it sucks that your boyfriend has a low libido due to reasons outside of his control, but you don't owe him your time if you don't feel like he can satisfy you.*

It made me feel hopeless and even suicidal because if sexual relations and romantic bonding are so important in a relationship, and if I cannot preform well romantically and sexually in a relationship, then I might be doomed to spend the rest of my life numb and alone. Recently, these suicidal thoughts have been becoming persistent and it is a weird experience. I don't feel the sadness and emotional pain that many suicidal people would feel, all I have are thoughts compelling me to end it all just to find relief from this horrible case of depersonalization that medical professionals failed to find an adequate solution to my problem. Being on a slew of medications made me gain so much weight, killed my libido, gave me ED, made my ejaculation weak, developed strechmarks, and gynaecomastia.

I feel that my life is ruined beyond repair. I never imagined that I could go through so many treatments only to be royally screwed over by side effects, some are permanent like diabetes. If I even can get to lose the weight and restore feeling, I worry that certain things like strechmarks, diabetes, and sexual problems will follow me for the rest of my life with no viable solution. I don't want to start a pity party, nor am I having any plans on acting on my suicidal thoughts. However, I feel like my situation is hopless and while suicide sounds appealing on first glance, part of me is thinking that a crappy life is still better than a premature death.

I don't want to die, I just want my good quality of life to come back.",21Dec2019,1

I haven’t thrown up in at least 8 or 9 years. I know everyone hates throwing up but I REALLY hate it, been like this since I was a child. When I was 8 I ate an entire package of Oreos and got sick. It was a bad idea on my behalf, but I haven’t eaten an Oreo since, and I’m 30!

My problem is I have completely lost the desire to eat and I’m starting to get worried. I take a few bites of anything and I just cannot go on.  I’m starting to feel tired and weak. I’m a teacher and student were asking me if I was ok today. One said I just looked “off”. I’ve only had water, cracker and some fruits but not much of those.

24,"This is how I've felt for as long as I can remember. I have like the lowest standards regarding everything. Whether it's shopping, music, or friends/relationships, I always will accept things even if I know I don't love it/them. For instance, my main group of friends in high-school I never really felt like I 100% fit in with them, but I still hung out with them and spent most of my time with them because we got along, and I just accepted that. The same goes for pretty much everything. The crazy thing is when I find something/someone I REALLY like, I immediately can tell the difference and it seems so obvious at that time, but even so I still go on accepting things that don't give me that feeling. 

I hope this post makes some sense, I'm having a difficult time explaining it but it's something that's really been bothering me lately.

Right now, it's a feeling I haven't had in a long time. I'm afraid of getting closer to them if I open up too much (similar to that feeling, I think). I'm honestly not sure if I'm overwhelmed by this feeling of happiness. I guess it's also that feeling where I'm happy at the moment that I don't want this to fade away and turn into a disaster (or at least something bad). It's like when you're genuinely happy with people you care about and you worry about it because you fear you'll lose those people that mean the most to you. I know life sometimes throws shitty situations at you but still. I told my friend about this but he said it's a shitty gut feeling and I shouldn't be thinking about it. As much as I don't want to think about it, it's something that's bothering me for quite some time when Christmas break started. Yes, it's a good feeling but at the same time, it's concerning since I haven't felt this way in a while. I honestly don't know what to do.

(Also, I'm sorry if I'm beating the bush around this situation, it's hard for me to explain what I'm feeling)",21Dec2019,1
33,"My ex found me on Instagram and started talking to me. We were together for 6 years, I was also pregnant with his child, didn't carry to term. We have been apart since February 2015. He has been dating my younger sister since October 2016. 

I was very angry when they first got together but I've come to terms with it. My younger sister cant even be in the same room as me now.  

He started messaging me on Instagram saying things that I find questionable.  Should I share this information with my sister? 

Also, soap making was a hobby that I wanted to start with him, but we never got around to it. 

I'd be happy to prove more info if needed.

36," This is a short story and probably is dumb but is worth a shot. I got the note from my friend who said it was from sarah (This isn’t her real name) so I had asked what did she say when she gave it to him and he said that she had told him to give it to me. I was really confused and curious so I had opened it and it didn’t have any sentences or anything it just had words. On one page it had her full name and it had solid to liq (at the time she had probably wrote it while we were going over the states of matter and all that stuff) underneath her name and her and solid to liq was written in calligraphy. On the other page it had the colors yellow, green, pink, purple, blue, red and orange written in words. The first letter of the words were bigger than the other words by like 2 lines. So if you think this means anything I would love to know.

46,"I M(23) and my gf have recently broken up after 6 years of dating. I'm hurt, but I dont seem broken by it. I have some sad thoughts about her, sure, but my negative thoughts tend to veer toward hatred of my own life now and being  frustrated with dating, my self confidence, being bored, lacking focus, general self loathing and negativity etc. I've always been incredibly confident, to the point of having perhaps too big of an ego so this is a weird switch to flip for me.

In any case, I have recently picked up this job which is perhaps the best opportunity I have ever gotten. I'll spare the details, but the pay is decent, the perks are great (my boss bought me a gaming PC as a sign on bonus) and it's for a non profit for a good cause. Furthermore the kind of  experience I have been promised if I stick around and do well is absolutely  golden in this day and age. The job isnt even that hard, I've just gotten behind.

Half of my working days I spend redditing cuz I cant focus/begin self loathing/negativity. The thoughts arent even of her, like I said, they just are negative. I am starting to miss assignments for this reason. The cause deserves better work than this. 

I worry that if I make the decision to leave and go ""find myself"" again moving to a different city, get my own place to live without my parents. etc. (which frankly, I do not know will be any better) I will have blown what could be my big break. 
On the other hand, in moving I could be forced to do some growing up and get back to the greatness I feel I was before. 

I also dont want to disappoint my family, or look unstable, or harm my dating life in the sense that I am giving up such a great job. They say having a good job for a non profit should help me in this aspect, but this is the longest I've ever gone without a date in my life - 3 months now.

47,"The title says it all, my mom found a used condom in the bathroom's bin and now she's convinced that there are only two possibilities. the first one is that I'm gay cause my friend has been coming to the house frequently, or that I'm bringing girls without her knowing or I have a girlfriend or something like that. First off, No, I am not gay, I'm 100% percent sure of my heterosexuality, so is my friend. Second, I wish I had any type of game, but sadly I don't. 

What happened was that I used a condom to fap (Less messy and I can practice putting it on efficiently) I disposed of it and somehow my mom found it. I don't know how to tell her that, so my excuse was that it was with ""someone who no longer is relevant"".

48,"This is poorly written and all over the place so I’m sorry in advance. I’m not the best writer. (Also this is a throwaway account because I don’t want anyone knowing about this)

Long story short I think my cousin did something to me while I was a child (he was in his 20’s and I was 9), while I stayed at my grandparent’s house. I have no memory of him actually doing anything but I do remember him being kinda weird during my stay. I could be overreacting, I have anxiety, depression etc. so little things upset me and idk if my mental illness is causing me to blow things out of proportion. I want a second opinion to know if I’m being dramatic or not and what to do about it because I’ve never really told anyone. 

I live in the U.S but my parents are from another country. One summer vacation they sent us by ourselves, by plane, to visit our family who lives in said country. We stayed there the whole summer with my grandparents. Honestly I remember very little from that trip but I was only 9 so maybe that’s why. Anyways, I had a cousin who lived with my grandparents at the time. He’s an asshole who abandoned his kid, takes money from my grandparents and over all is a guy who likes to use people. But when I was little I didn’t know all that so I really cared about him and as fucked up as this sounds, at that time I had this mini crush on him. I guess it was because he was in college and I thought he was so cool and “grown up.”  Anyways, he was really affectionate with me (while he mostly ignored my little brother). I distinctly remember that he’d often watch tv with me on the bed of one of the guest rooms of my grandparent’s place and we’d always be under a blanket and we’d cuddle and he’d tickle me and stuff like that. 

During my stay I had gotten an infection in my “private parts” and I had never gotten one in my life and actually never had one again since that trip which I think is odd. Also during this whole stay I’d cry to my grandma almost every night because I missed my parents and just wanted to go back home. My grandma pretty much told me to stop complaining which looking back at it, is fucked up to say to a kid. 

Ever since that last trip I never went back to visit any of my family in that country until just last year. On the first night staying at a family member’s house I had a dream that I got molested and when I woke up my heart was racing and I was sweating like crazy. I had never had a dream like that in my life. 

Eventually I met my cousin (the one who had been staying at my grandparent’s house) and he completely ignored my brother and started talking to me, but he talked to me in this weird baby voice and it made me feel kind of uncomfortable. 

My parents and brother think he’s a weirdo and so do I, he just gives off this unsettling vibe, I’m not sure how to explain it. I never see him because I live in the U.S. and we don’t text or anything so that was my last encounter with him. 

 I’ve only told one person about this and it wasn’t even in detail, this is the first time I’ve ever talked/wrote about this situation. Am I being paranoid or is there something that I may not remember?",21Dec2019,1
49,"Hello. I'm an 18 year old dude. I was in a relationship for a while and it made me happy, but recently it became super hard for me and so I don't talk to her anymore. I've found it really hard to find anyone else. I got tinder and any girl that I liked the way they look I didn't like anything about their personality or they didn't like me. I wouldn't consider myself bi, I lean more towards asexual I guess because I don't really like sex I just like to be physically close to people. However I put bi down on my tinder and said to show me everyone and I went from like 20 likes and a revolving door of matches that either I or they unmatched to like 200-300 likes and several matches with people who I actually enjoy talking to.

The catch is I don't really like other guys. I like girls body types because they're softer and smaller and all that. That sounds weird but it's how I feel. I also don't find myself often having any sort of romantic vision towards guys. But im so lonely. I recently tried to stab myself in the eye after talking to someone who bored the shit out of me because I'm mentally unwell from social isolation. I miss the way it felt to be cared about. I would do anything for that feeling right now. I don't know if I'll ever find someone who feels the same way as I do about them.",21Dec2019,1

She always wants me to “bend her in any position and just take her without asking for permission” but I just literally can’t do it. I can’t randomly put her in a new position because I’m so scared that I’ll hurt her.

52,"I’m a third year double majoring in Economics &amp; Philosophy. I declared my major in Spring semester of my second year, so I barely started taking major specific courses then. 

I chose Economics because I love learning about the relationships and patterns of the economy and I’m great at statistics and calculus. Also, I wanted to learn about business in a more data and detailed oriented way. I love learning about law and international economics. Philosophy is just a beautiful subject that I fell in love with and I couldn’t stay away from taking it on as my second major. 

I divide my studying time into about 60/40 with more time for Economics. I think that I have grasped the concepts but it does not translate to my test scores. I have tried buying helper/reference books, making flash cards, study groups to help my grade but my tests scores are still not improving.

53,"I’ve been curious for a while why I’ve always been so anxious about things. (Sorry this is going to be a tad long) 

I never realized how much I apologized for things until my best friend would stop me for a moment and say, “it’s okay, there’s no need for you to apologize”. And that’s when it hit me that I had this problem. 

However, I feel like my parents mistake my anxious behavior for being humble because I don’t recall them ever sitting me down or taking a moment to say to me what my best friend said. Because for a long time I would apologize for EVERYTHING. And about 90% if the time it wasn’t my fault. Just a simple mistake. 

Besides that, I’ve noticed how my parents have never addressed this problem my sister has. She jumps on my constantly. She’s younger than me, but it’s exhausting to have to put up with her sometimes. Instead it’s like they want me to man up and defend myself. But with her it’s pointless because she CANNOT tell if she’s lost an argument. Instead she will just leave the room claiming that either I’m crazy or someone else is. Also I don’t want to fight with her. I just want to be sisters. So sometimes I feel like they pin us against each other unknowingly. 

And lastly, their words and habits. 

I swear by now that my Mom has OCD because the first thing she’ll do when she comes home is complain that the counter always has water marks even if I didn’t set anything on it. And today after she was done cleaning it, she asked if I wanted to come to an event with them to which I said I had nothing to wear (because I needed to do laundry). To which SHE said that I would of had clothes if I went shopping the other day like she suggested. To which I said, “except I didn’t”. This didn’t happen also because I can out of time the other day. But of course she didn’t know that. 

And then a while later I simply asked her what time we were leaving in the morning to go somewhere. To which she said, “don’t you remember? I told you yesterday?” To which I said, “no, obviously”. 

And then if it’s not my mom, it’s my dad. 
So I asked him how to word something the other day and instead he wanted to get nosy about something I wanted to keep private. So instead of answering my simple question, I end up telling him to forget it, and get yelled at by him because of his inability to focus on my simple question. 

Sorry this was so long, but now I can’t help but question what made me grow up this way. 

I hate being this anxious and sensitive all the time because then I get normal people coming up to me saying, “you know, I’ve noticed that you are so hard on yourself when you don’t have to be” and stuff like that and I hate it because not once have my parents tried correcting me on it which lead me to believe that they’re apart of the problem.",21Dec2019,1
54,"A little background info: I’ve been separated for about a year and a half from my ex-husband—no chance of us reuniting as he cheated and then started another family with his mistress, I’m just waiting until I have the money to file for divorce. We have two sons together, who are 5 and 6. 

The only reason I keep things civil with my ex are for our sons’ sake, but suffice it to say I’m not his biggest fan. However, I AM still on good terms with my in-laws, who themselves are unhappy with my ex’s behavior as of late. 

My MIL is a sweet woman, and is always offering to help with stuff when she can. There’s just one problem: her home is infested with roaches. I allow my sons to visit occasionally but am deeply uncomfortable with allowing them to stay overnight for that reason. She’s not a hoarder, but her house is cluttered, and she seems to have a lot of trouble just keeping it clean and tidy. 

I’m far from being a freak about cleanliness, but I try to keep my home fairly clean and bugs ABSOLUTELY freak me out! I’m terrified that they’re going to hitch a ride over on one of the gifts she gives the boys.

So, the problem is that honestly my mother is a difficult woman to talk too. She asks silly questions, beats around the bush, has a hard time following other people's points and gets easily offended. She also cannot cut to the chase of her own points and tends to drag out conversations that take up a lot of energy. 

I have a bit of a short fuse and get very irritable when she falls back to these communication habits. At any sign of irritation, my boyfriend feels it's appropriate for him to step in and talk FOR me, despite him not even knowing what I plan to say or what I'm trying to get at. It's f**king infuriating to be honest. 

What the actual heck do you do about a boyfriend who INSISTS on interrupting you to your own mother to speak on what he thinks you should be saying? Honestly, I've tried telling him to just stay out of it and he never does, and infact gets angry with me if I try to draw a boundary with this. 

He feels the need to step in to keep the ""peace"" but he is really just fueling the fire inside me and we've gotten into some nasty fights over me trying to explain this to him.

58,"When I was about 13 I stumbled across a horrible, horrible Monsters Inc fanfic which turned out to be smut (yes really) and years later I still wish I could erase the memory. I don't remember why I read it, probably morbid curiosity or because I thought it would be funny (I always found weird fanfics like my immortal hilarious) but I was appalled at how graphic it was. I've seen some weird shit but nothing comparable to this. It's a distant memory because I've been trying to banish it from my mind ever since, but I feel sick whenever I think of it. 

I've considered rewatching the film to kind of overwrite the memory with something positive but I don't know if that would make it worse. I liked that film as a little kid which makes it worse somehow. Any advice on how to forget/stop caring about it? It's not ruining my life or anything but reading it is probably my biggest regret.

61,"I (21m) am in my last year at uni. Been living with one of my housemates (20f) since first year in student halls. We live in a house with a couple of other guys and a couple of other girls.

When we met, I found her reasonably attractive, and we get on very well. Over the last few years, she's ended up becoming one of my best friends.

Over the course of the last year or so (increasingly over the last couple of months), I've started to realise that I have very strong feelings for her. She's such an integral part of my life at this point, a great friend, I'm finding her more and more attractive, we're a great team. We've ""clicked"", one way or another. Neither of us is perfect. I can be a narcissistic, overconfident asshole sometimes. She can be messy, selfish and disorganised. And yet, we have always worked past our flaws when it came to each other. We work great. If we were to ge together, I think it would be a very healthy relationship. 

I feel as though in the past, I've been infatuated with idealised versions of the girls I've dated. The way I feel at the moment is different. She sees me and I see her, and I'm falling in love with her nonetheless. Maybe it's a consequence of living together. I don't know. This is new. 

Right now, I'm pretty stressed out. We finish uni in 6 months, and will be going back to our home towns (hundreds of miles apart) when we do so. 

My question (the question that's been plaguing me for weeks) is this - do I tell her? 

I don't mean from an entirely self-serving view - I mean, what is the moral thing to do here? I'm usually a proponent of absolute honesty, but is there any point when we're moving apart in a few months? Is she likely to feel the same anyway? Sometimes I feel as though she has some feelings for me - sometimes I don't think she does. My emotions may be clouding my judgement. I don't usually give a shit whether or not a girl likes me back, so I just shoot my shot. Plenty more fish in the sea and all that. But she's got me nervous. 

Would it be disrespectful to our friendship? Whatever happened, I feel a duty to her as a trusted friend above all else. Would telling her how I feel be unfair? Would it undermine this duty? Or do I have a duty to be honest and upfront about how I feel?

Say she didn't feel the same - would it be right for me to make her living situation awkward in a time when we have the most important exams of our lives?

Say she did feel the same - would it be healthy to hash out a relationship whilst living together? Would it be right to place that burden on her, knowing we were going to be separated in a few months? What if we started something, and then realised it wasn't going to work. Good luck living with an ex over exam season.

Lately I feel so empty and lonely.  I want some attention from somewhere, but I don't know how or where to get it. 

Really I just want a hug or someone to just genuinely ask me how I am or want to do something for or with me, not just for the sake of it but to just make me happy because they want to.

But obviously I can't ask people to do that. That's rude, and not the same as someone doing something because they want to.

71,"Customer threatening to take me to court over price change

I have recently launched an events planning company in Australia where I hold markets and festivals. For our first market, we had to pay a premium venue $4k upfront for use of the site so we priced this accordingly with stall fares varying between $300-550. This was very reasonable compared to other markets held here who charge around $900 plus for a stall. It is smack bang in the middle of a major city and around Christmas time, very packed, which justified our rental of the space. 

5 months out from the market and only 3 stallholders had even applied and made payment, meaning that we were very behind and despite paid advertisement for stallholders, it didn’t look like we were going to meet the minimum amount of stallholders therefore we lowered the prices. While not drastic, the price change per size of stall (as different sizes are priced differently) dropped down around $100 each. 

Fast forward five months and we’ve basically filled the space up with over 30 stalls and we had just broken even with the profit. It wasn’t so much about profit at this point, more like putting on a successful event to build reputation and following. 

On the day, we had an unprecedented heat-wave reaching up to 45 degrees so there was barely any foot traffic around, despite us paying big for Instagram and Facebook advertisements. There was nothing we could do to get people to come in - it is Australia the weather is unpredictable. 

Without many people walking through, I had one stallholder pack-up and leave in the middle of the event which triggered the stallholders around them to talk about the slow day of the market. One woman, who was one of the first people to pay and sign up, had gone around to each stall asking what they paid when she realised she had paid a larger amount (approximately $375.) She got them all to write down the price on a notebook and presented it to me during the event. 

She then demanded that I give her a refund for the entire price and I said I will sort it out after the event has concluded. Another woman who realised that they had also paid more had joined in on criticising the event. Myself and my team handled it graciously and made sure that they left with reassurance that we would handle it. 

After the event, which was an unsuccessful day due to the heat, I received an email from both women who had paid earlier that they demanded a refund or else they will take me to court and pursue a consumer affairs case. I denied them a full refund as I believe that as a business owner, I am obligated to change prices as I please. The price changes were made public knowledge anyway with paid advertisements including the dollar figure change for each stall and I had posted a pic of the price changes on a stallholder Facebook page (where 90% of my stallholders were on.) The other person who had left early, also emailed me saying she wants a full refund as the event was horrible and nobody had bought anything from them. I advised her that I can’t give her a refund for that and she is asking for personal details such as all of my contacts at the event place it was held and receipts of payment made to Facebook and Instagram for their advertisements. 

All three had mentioned that they will band together and take me down in court if I do not pay them all back a refund and I am very stumped at what to do in this situation. Any thoughts on what I can do to solve this?",21Dec2019,1

Have a nice Christmas', and then smiled when I looked up at her then o looked down to the floor and  avoided eye contact because I’m shy and very nervously said 'oh...ok thanks....an...and yourself' trying to be polite, and she just laughed while turning to her computer again. was she laughing at me? :- im a guy by the way",21Dec2019,1
73,"So... my situation is really complex but i'll try to sum it up. I'm 18, Im currently living at my fathers house but im planning on leaving due to my overall wellbeing here. My parents have been divorced for years and I've always been staying with either one. I came out here to finish high school, and the plan was to return after i'd completed and recieved my diploma. Well I got my diploma, and my mom is planning on buying a ticket back on a specific date. Well, due to reasons I dont want to stay with my father anymore. Well, heres where there is a problem. I dont have any place go here, no friends or family except to a homeless shelter but I would not want to stay there. Alot of other people have said I should stay with family, yet you have to remember im not very close to my family here. My other option, I have enough money to stay at an airbnb until the flight, but the problem is Airbnb requires a goverment issued ID in order to allow people to book. I dont have a government issued ID, only a school one. My mom suggested me to use hers to get the airbnb, but I dont know if thats legal or not. Is this legal? I can of course just go get one at the DMV, but someone said that would take way too long if I needed it on that same day to book a quick airbnb. I really want to know if getting an ID is possible on the same day as I go to the DMV, that way I can get an airbnb instead of risking homelessness, and staying with distant relatives.",21Dec2019,1
74,"I’m 15 years old and I am a lesbian. My parents are SUPER conservative.

76,"Alright, so I’m going to be really ‘first world problem’ with you guys for a second. Basically, I went to the hair salon 2 days ago and my usual hairdresser wasn’t there. I didn’t want to come back another time, because it honestly was just a little clean up trim on the sides, so I let someone else do it.

I was being very clear on what needed to happen, which was almost nothing; the top didn’t really need anything, maybe a little clean up and the sides only needed a trim. Now, I went because I have a big date coming up, holiday events with people I haven’t seen in a long time and a New Years party I organized with a bunch of friends that has a whole photoshoot thing (yes, we’re that annoying).

Anyways, I think you already know what’s coming up, but the man did NOT listen. He pretty much chopped all my hair off on the top and now I look like a 14-year-old pineapple (I’m 22, not hating on 14-year-olds dw haha)

I seriously want to cry lmao, I’ve even tried those stupid essential oil things that would supposedly quicken the process of hair growth... 

I feel and look stupid and I just do not look good with hats or cap (I’ve heard it many times haha), so now I’m stuck with this horrendous haircut... what should I do for the upcoming events and just in general?

79,"I'm a 22 y/o college graduate (Linguistics and Classics double major). I've been planning on getting certified as a Latin language teacher for High School students. After speaking with someone at the University, they encouraged me to pursue an MA in Latin teaching alongside getting certified. This option would take probably about 3 years or so to complete. Just getting certified would probably take me only about 1 year. 

My fear is that I'm not even sure this is what I want do with my life. I enjoy learning and my Latin and Greek are good, but I'm afraid to tie myself down to school for another three years. I want to travel, learn new languages, write stories. I like to teach people things, but I don't know if I went to spend my whole life doing it. At the same time, if I delay the certification and the MA now, I fear I may lose the opportunity. 

I'm not great at making decisions; I get stuck between choices a lot, and it's hard for me to know now which concerns are just decision-making anxiety and which are genuine. Would going with just certification and pursuing other options be spreading myself to thin?

81,"Going to stay non-specific just cause. I work for a very small company. It’s just me and my boss. At the moment I’m paid $12 an hour. Most days I work on my own. Other days I work with my boss on projects. I’ve been there for coming up on two years. I learned how to do the work for a while then he sent me out. For a bit I kinda thought I could learn the business and take over it. He’s sorta groomed me to do so and has said things implying it. “He’s going to be fixing this in 30 years” “he’s my retirement plan”. 

Then I got to know my boss better. He’s just a miserable person. I’ve heard hard r’s almost on a daily basis, makes me work beyond my schedule without asking, makes me do difficult manual labor around his house and occasionally his personal property in which I always get off late(like mowing his lawn, in which I have to mow with a push mower around his commercial lawn mower)once made me help his friend move out of town, staying there overnight, and I’m basically salary, so didn’t get paid more), making me work on his farm, making sexist comments, xenophobic comments, breaking osha often putting myself in dangerous situations, belittling me (called me retarded amount other things). Once he made me drive out in snow even tho I told him it was starting to stick and I got stuck out in it for hours and he later told a customer that I insisted on staying out. It’s just generally a really shitty work environment, but he thinks I like it. I know could have done better at communicating the whole time, but every time I need to, I get super anxious because I know he can be very difficult and rude.  I get paid 12 dollars an hour and regularly do 700 dollars of work for him a day. I know cost of businesses is a thing. But that’s like my whole paycheck. 

I’m totally miserable there. I’m planning on going into my vocation later next year, I’m just not ready yet. I applied to another job in the field I want to be in on the whim and got it. 

I work Monday-Friday at this current job. Monday the town was shut down due to snow and he said “we are working Saturday” even though I told him I had plans. I get in this morning and he tells me I’m working tomorrow (oh and he’s not working much cause he had plans and just wanted me to call him when I got in)

I learned an hour after he told me that, that I got the job. I immediately planned to tell him during that call that I was putting my two weeks in. 

Me telling him that has been such a source of anxiety for me. I know it’s a job, but I also know he’s going to make me feel like garbage for doing it. 95% of me is thankful to tell him on the phone just cause I’m scared and the other 5% I’m actually worried he’d get physical. Our relationship is that bad. He’s told me in the past if someone puts their two weeks in he just has them leave because they won’t put in good work after. I’m not sure if he’d do that because we are so busy at the moment. 


I just need some hyping up and maybe advice on how to do it. I’ll see him in the morning for like 10 minutes before heading out, so maybe I could tell him then, but also idk about the start of a day. It would be better if he was actually in town when I got in. But he’s not so I was leaning towards over the phone and it’s a tad less scary to me. I just don’t know how to do this and what to say. He’s not all bad and has done some good for me. I’m just really scared. Sorry this is so all over the place and incoherent. Thanks in advance for any thoughtful replies.",21Dec2019,1

83,"So I might be in the beginning of a fight with my nr. 1 best friend that I´ve had for 18 years. We recently both started working at the same place. Her friendship is something I value dearly so I would really like to know if I´m in the wrong before I confront her. 

I´ve felt unfairly treated by our boss because of her (the boss's) unclear information, poor planning and broken promises and to rid of my frustration I have complained about our boss to my best friend. Every time she has defended her and given me excuses on our boss' behalf. *It might be because of (blank)* or *maybe she´s busy with her family or the business.*  Today I was especially agitated and ended my rant with ""I don´t understand how you can defend her"". My friends answer really threw me for a loop.

(as closely translated as I could) ""I´m going to treat her kindly since she has done absolutely nothing for me to dislike her. I understand if you might be a bit grumpy with her but if she hasn´t done anything to deserve my wraith then that's why I am defending her."" 

I would think that being unfair to me and other coworkers would be reason enough to feel at least a bit of contempt. I feel hurt by her words since I thought she would feel more loyalty towards me. Then I also might have gone a bit overboard since nothing our boss has done has been quite *that awful.*",21Dec2019,1

85,"I’m in USA and I want to immigrate somewhere else. Things aren’t doing so well in the states right now as many know. My British friends say things aren’t looking too good their either right now. I want to ask anyone who feels they live in a good area of the world to recommend their suggestions. 

I don’t want to sound entitled so if I am please call me out. I just want to add a list of things that are more suited to my beliefs. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and opinions, so I hope I’m not offending anyone. 

I’m a woman so I’m hoping • for a place that treats women like people (not objects or second class citizens) 

• a good diverse setting (I’m very big in wanting to learn as much about as many cultures as I can. Currently studying the Quran and learning French. I’m also planning on joining the peace corps to help abroad) so many different languages (I love learning so this would just be a treat), different ethnicities (For 9 on my school years I was in a school with literally one person of color. He was my friend and pretty awesome. I’d always wanted more diversity around me. 

• being allowed to build (I’m pretty crafty with my hands and am starting a small business and want to be able to build real estate without super strict laws) more whacky design kinda thing 

• Kind people (I didn’t grow up in the best place. I have permanent damage to my stomach from suffering Celiac Disease and Gastroparesis that my Doctor said “just send her to school vomiting with a fever. If you ignore it, it’ll go away”) I was want to be able to build close friendships with people. 

• As stated above I have celiac and Gastroparesis (paralysis of the vagus nerve) so a place that has decent/good healthcare would mean a lot. 

•Preferably not too cold or too hot (I left NY after a basic 2/3 of a year with snow) I’m good with 90 F summers. 

•Great Schools (my school was a very shitty school and I literally have PTSD from school so if I’m not homeschooling my *future kids which is like to be able to do at least as an option) Is like to know they’re going into the most advanced style of education (suited to their needs directly. Not like ‘mY aNGeLs aRE mORe iMpOrtANt’ but more ‘Individualized Education Plan’ that can be custom to each kid as long as it’s not defying school rules. Rules exist for a reason. Montessori type schools maybe. 

•LGBTQ rights if possible. Or at least not illegal to be LBGT

Anyways. My family is doing secret santa this year. I got my brother. We workout together, so I thought I would get him a blender for his protein shakes, and some meal prep containers because we were talking about doing meal prep together. I should clarify I ordered them off Amazon because I've been busy lately. That's where I made my mistake. 

The delivery was supposed to come on a day when he was working. But it came early, and my brother was the one to receive the package. And the worst part? It was not even in the usual Amazon box. It was retail packaging, so he could clearly see it is a fucking blender. I've never had that happen to me before with Amazon. Not even the box flap was taped over. I didn't want to do ""gift options"" because I like to leave lil personal notes and I like to wrap it myself. 

But yeah. He probably knows I didn't order it for myself, because I already have a blender. I don't know what to do. I've already had a full on panic attack because of this whole situation. I feel like a failure. No matter how much I over think these things, I still manage to find a way to fuck it up. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to ruin his Christmas.

93,"I’m a 19F with a 15 year old little brother. I apologize in advance for this being a bit long, but I feel like the information is necessary. 

Little background: 
We don’t have the ideal family. Our parents had a messy divorce while we were both in elementary school. We had a very unusual and inconsistent schedule going back and forth between houses. 

Our dad works third shift as a truck driver which leaves him little energy to do much when he gets home. 

Our mom is very toxic. I stopped seeing and speaking to her about 2 years ago because I couldn’t handle the relationship anymore. Since I’ve stopped going there, she has been very neglectful. Such as not cooking dinner or having food in the kitchen, not being home and staying out until late hours of the night, etc. 

Needless to say, we didn’t have the most attention or best guidance growing up. 

My mother started giving me pot brownies when i was 13, I turned into a pot head when I was about 16, even though she didn’t agree with me doing it so often. 
I was your typical high school pot head, but I would never get in trouble. I always did my work during class and got good grades. 

Issues:
The same thing is happening with my brother, he’s a daily smoker, except now he’s failing all classes, he is only in 9th grade and has been suspended (out of school) 2-3 times in the past 4 months. The most recent time was for having weed on campus. 

He does nothing around the house, leaving his clothes everywhere, ignoring trash, not washing his dishes (we don’t even have a dish washer...), cleaning literally anything or doing a task as simple as taking the dog outside. This leaves me, a full time student and full-time worker, to do these things after I’ve been busy busting my ass. 

When he’s not at school, all he does is hang out with kids his age that have face tattoos, goes to their house to smoke and shares videos of him playing with guns/bullets, other drugs, etc.

He takes the car (without a license) outside of the neighborhood to see his friends. 

Both of my parents have completely given up on trying to “stop” him because they know he will do what he wants however he can find a way. 
I would’ve never gotten away with this bullshit, and I feel like they don’t even care. 

He looks up to my boyfriend. My bf tries to have serious talks with him about being smart and staying out of trouble but he just thinks “you’re just being lame”

He most certainly doesn’t listen to me, never has about anything, but mostly because he thinks I’m just a hypocrite. Our situation was different though, as I NEVER got into any trouble. 

I would beat his ass if I still could, I’m so fed up. If he continues doing this shit he could get into serious trouble. 

What can I do to change his “idgaf” attitude?",21Dec2019,1
94,"Hello everyone.

As you most likely assumed from the title, I need some help dealing with and hopefully reducing the amount I procrastinate. 

I don't have a very ideal sleep schedule (if at all) and I'm not someone who's able to fall asleep as soon as their head hits the pillow. It doesn't help that I'm very sensitive to and easily disturbed by the slightest sound of snoring. Some nights I'll be laying awake until the early hours of the next day or I just won't sleep at all. As I don't normally sleep well, I'm always extremely unmotivated. I waste days and time by either catching up on sleep or just doing nothing. I never feel good about getting out of bed at three, five or even seven in the evening but it's starting to become an unhealthy cycle I can't but really want to break. I make promises to myself that I'll start my work the next day, which the rolls over onto the next day, then the next and so on but of course I never get a single thing even started.

95,"I'm a college student who lives in an independently owned student housing place that used to be a hotel. At least one of my neighbors is loud as fuck. 

One guy coughs a lot. It's the kind of cough that sounds like he's choking to death, it's loud and mucus-y. I've learned to tolerate him because I suspect he has a medical condition (been hearing it every day for months now). I hear this pretty much only in the early afternoon.

The other guy (not sure whether or not he's the same as the first) yells really loudly in a way that sounds like he's watching sports with headphones on. I'll randomly hear ""OOHHHHHHHHH"" and ""WOOOOOOOOOOOO"" anywhere from 10 am to 10 pm.

I'm not officially diagnosed, but I have high audio-sensitivity. I have a 504 plan (Colorado) for ADD and other mental health issues but I highly doubt it would be relevant in this situation. The 504 plan is for educational settings, but the housing isn't owned by my college. Then again, someone wouldn't need to have a disability to want to be pissed the fuck off about this noise.

I've complained to the front desk twice. Nothing happened the first time. The second time, which was yesterday, the yeller was playing music really loudly. I thought if staff caught him in the act, something would happen. But by the time they came up to knock on his door, the music was turned off and he didn't answer. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do. Both the yelling and the coughing are intermittent, so I can only think of getting staff to do a stake-out with me to prove the loud noises are a legitimate issue that need to be dealt with.

She got here 2 months before me and is pretty well established already; job, friends, etc. This is the first time I've lived in a new city without any friends or family near and it's been a hard transition. Especially because I was leaving a bad situation, bad enough for me to leave state.  Before I moved in with her, we talked and I told her I would rely on her a lot at first until I get situated and she was happy to help. 

Now that I'm here we hardly talk or hang out and I haven't found a job yet so I spend a lot of time sitting around bored and lonely. She's basically got it in her head that roommates have to have mostly separate lives and only hang out occasionally. I asked her about this and she thinks it'll cause issues if we're around each other too much. Which I agree with but I told her it doesn't mean we have to ignore each other. She agreed but hasn't done anything different. She'll act secretively for no reason then tell me about what she was doing later. It's almost as if she wants me to ask ""where are you going"" so that she can say something like ""nowhere"". 

I've had roommates in the past and lived with friends and I'm used to telling a roommate ""hey I'm going to (friend name)'s house. Be back later"". Or ""hey me and (friend) are going to lunch, wanna come with?"". Not every time of course but sometimes but she will make a conscious effort to keep what she's doing secret until after it's done. Obviously I don't need or what to know everything she's doing but if I ask she'll be vague and sometimes rude but tell me about it later if I don't ask.

We haven't had any real issues, we haven't stepped on each other's toes or anything. If she were some stranger she would be the perfect roommate but we're friends, best friends, so it's kinda hard to deal with for me. I know that once I have a job I'll friend other friends and have something to spend time doing but until idk how to handle things right now.

What can I do to better things? I've expressed my feelings on all this with her but haven't made any progress.

I’m 17 and I just finished my first semester of college. I’m a history secondary education major and the first day I had history 103 (American history) with the professor I’m talking about and we’ll call him Erick. Erick is literally my dream man. He is attractive, tall, funny, intelligent, has a good amount of money bc he used to work on Wall Street and still lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He has also traveled to numerous countries and is everything anyone would want. Obviously since he is such a catch there is no surprise that someone else snagged him up. I always made ways to ask him questions after class that would turn into 30 minute to an hour conversations and I love talking to him since I’m very bad at socializing with people my age and don’t have much friends. But the thing is this isn’t just an innocent crush that a young girl would have for an older hot male teacher. I think about him constantly, googled him, found his address, and all of his social media. I was searching high and low for his wife and my teenage hormonal side was like, “fuck her I bet she’s an ugly cunt bitch” but my rational side was “shes most likely a great person im just hating.” But I finally found her because when we were talking he told me she didn’t take his last name and it was McDonald so I looked her up from his FB friends and there she was. I was expecting her to be ugly but she was actually pretty and they look happy together. A part of me wish he was in a loveless marriage with an ugly woman so he could cheat on her with me. But then again the reason I love him so much is because I know he’s a good guy. If he had sex with me that would make him a cheater and a pedophile and those are obviously not good qualities in a man. Yesterday I took the final for his class and he high fived me goodbye and since we got close over this semester he said to continue to email him (in a platonic way of course). I’m so sad because I am going to miss him so much and I’m scared I’m never gonna get over him. I’m also scared that I’m never gonna meet someone as good as him because I’m ugly and awkward and poor.

It's like all of the sudden I am thinking and ""seeing"" things outside of my body. It's hard to explain, but it's like I suddenly can 'see' and 'feel' things in a different way. I see my loved ones like an 'outsider' would.                   

I can lean into it and have this experience go longer or fight it and have it end almost immediately. I guess my main concern is is this is something to worry about.",21Dec2019,1

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me pon there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",21Dec2019,1
106,"Here’s some history: I (23F) had severe cystic acne as a teenager and now have extreme anxiety/phobias related to my skin. I have a very low self-esteem, and feel very embarrassed about my appearance in general. 

I live in a different state from my family, and I only visit them once a year for two weeks in December. It’s somewhat stressful because between my family and my husband’s family, there’s always some type of drama. 

I knew this year was going to be particularly difficult because my brother was getting married the day after we arrived. My wedding was awful and because of that, I usually dread family weddings. Fortunately, I got through it, but the stress from the wedding led to a severe breakout. I am both embarrassed and terrified of scarring (which I already have in some places).

I am trying not to panic, but all I want to do is pack up my things and fly home. I can’t stop crying, and I feel like I can’t show my face. My husband’s siblings make me extremely self-conscious and the thought of them looking at me makes me shrink up inside.

I can’t leave, though, because my husband’s mother would never forgive me. All of her children are going to be home for Christmas (which is a rarity), so she hired a photographer to take family pictures. If I missed the pictures, she would be livid, and I don’t want to ruin our relationship which is otherwise good. However, the thought of having pictures (and then inevitably posted on Facebook) taken makes me feel physically sick.

For the past few hours, I’ve been hyperventilating and panicking in waves. I know this issue probably seems stupid to anyone else, but like I mentioned, I have a lot of anxiety related to my skin. I just need some help, or kind words, or anything at all.",21Dec2019,1
107,"So I am a freshman boy in high school. Today someone who I considered one of my closest friends up until kinda (let’s call her G) told me she didn’t want to be friends anymore. I just wanted to know if what I’m feeling is wrong and what I should and shouldn’t do from now on.

I moved here so everyone i meet is new. I become friends with a girl who we’ll call K. We eventually started dating. She introduced me to some other friends because the original ones I had met were a little to rowdy for me. Through K, I met G. So now we have a kind of triangle of friendship. Well things didn’t work out so well between K and I and we broke up (obvi we’re a high school relationship). She was my first relationship ever though, so I took it pretty hard. I had so many thoughts rushing through my head like “Does she regret it like I do?” “Is she suffering like I am?” At school, however, she seemed completely fine. Even though I expected that because she gets over things really quick, it still hurt so much to see that. So i vented out my thoughts to G. I basically had said how I was in so much confusion and I don’t know what to do anymore. I was so caught up in my emotions that I had said that I wanted to emotionally hurt someone, specifically K. I had just wanted to know she had the smallest ounce of regret over what happened. Because of all this and other factors, like me relying on G a lot, she had decided it’s best to cut it off here.

Personally I can see from her perspective because she also had other things to deal with ofc and it’s not her fault at all. High school is already rough by itself but me dumping problems onto her didn’t help at all. I realize after all this that I hadn’t really been there or let her open up because I was always complaining. Thing is our friendship mostly happened after the break up so a large potion of it was me complaining. Recently I felt like I was improving but ig it was too late.

Now I just want to know what else I should do to move on from here. I’m pretty introverted and I don’t have many friends to begin with. Most of friends are closer with G and K than me, seeing as I am new. What should I do to not pressure people like this. I already have a hint of what is necessary, like basically stop complaining, not as much physical contact (another problem when you’re the only guy in a group of girls, because understandably hugs from someone like me will scare them), and not being as negative like with self-deprecating jokes, which I make a fair amount of. Also me complaining so much was another factor for the break up so I’m almost 100% sure that that needs to stop. What I was complaining about was mostly how tired, stressed, or lonely I felt in certain classes. This drove me both away and now I’m here. That’s another problem I think... I rely heavily on the people I think that I’m close with.

112,"I should say, I'm pretty sure he's autistic, but I can't confirm it. It's never been mentioned, and we're both adults so it's too late for me to really ask, but I only realized in the last couple of years that keeping his autism a secret from his siblings is something my parents would definitely do. Regardless, I just need to know how to communicate with him and not get frustrated with him.

We've butted heads our whole lives because I use sarcasm, slang, turns of phrase, cultural references, and jokes with deadpan delivery, and it's always been like he doesn't understand my sense of humor or speak the same language at all. He takes everything literally and seriously, and most importantly, he takes everything personally.

He also constantly makes noise, like he just can't be alone with his thoughts in silence, and I need silence sometimes. Being around his constant humming, whistling, talking to himself, scatting, whatever, gets me so on edge, and he's sometimes so loud it's hard to get away from it. He's very sensitive to perceived criticism and reacts defiantly to anything I say, so if I ask him nicely to quiet down, he just does it twice as much. We always end up fighting and I get in trouble with my parents (I figured I was just the scapegoat child, but lately I've wondered if it's because he's autistic and they think me getting annoyed and angry at him is me punching down - like I said, I didn't even know.) There's not good energy between us, we don't chat and we rarely interact directly and it's sad to me.

What can I do to keep my cool, and communicate with him in a way he understands? What are some general tips and rules for communicating with someone with autism, or at least someone like I've described my brother to be? I feel I can't be myself around him because it always leads to unintentional offense, we don't have the relationship needed to communicate directly through this issue, and it's like we're just completely incompatible as people. Or is that okay? Should I just accept that my brother and I will never be close? Any advice appreciated.",21Dec2019,1
113,"So due to personal reasons my parents couldn’t support me rent wise for the past few months. Because of this I thoughT I had the rent thing covered but payments came up that needed to be paid ASAP, so I just decided that I would go to work and income and pay my money owed as a lump sum at the end of the tenancy.

I’ve made an appointment and the money is being transferred in a few days

I’ve told the landlord this but this has not stopped her from telling all of my flatmates that I could be a thief and insinuating that I have used their money for my own personal use. She stated that it is a crime and they should all go to the police. When I heard I was so shocked and instantly forwarded the recent bank statement to them. It clearly showed that the only withdrawals were to the previous landlord, the current landlord and the electricity company; not to my own personal bank account. 

I’m just really angry that she would even suggest that! I completely understand why she would be frustrated about the late payments and I understand that part is completely my fault and is being fixed, but for her to say all of that to my flatmates makes me upset. In my opinion it is completely unprofessional, uncalled for and very very rude. All of their money has been going through to the landlord but it’s just I haven’t been depositing my correct share in so theeefore all the money owing is mine and I have not stolen ANYTHING.

Am I overreacting or am I right to be frustrated/upset?

114,"Basically, like anyone in the world my friends are more or less interested in me telling them positive things.

I see a therapist, but my therapist is 1 of 2 people I can talk to when I'm feeling like shit, which is always. And I only see him for an hour a week. The rest of the time I just feel horribly alone in my struggle. 

My friends used to live closer to me and it felt like I could go to their house and cry with them so easily, but recently it has been far from that. One of my friends who I am closest to has basically ghosted me. And my other friend is having a really hard time so she can only take my struggle in small doses, so she needs a break from me. 

My mom by far makes me feel the most like shit because her positivity is the most invalidating bullshit I've ever experienced. ""You have your whole life ahead of you. Just think positively about your situation. It could be so much worse.""

121,"this is a long post, please read the whole thing before aspiring to have any opinion.

Did anyone else grow up in condition like this in a first world country, and did life ever get better?

(This is a long post, please read the whole thing before aspiring to have any opinion).

Twos decades and 9 years in the past, I was born unto this world, I grew up in a first world country, but into a third-rate life. I was not born into such poverty that starving was likely, although sometimes I might have had to go a day or two without a meal, or live on dry toast and porridge for a month or 4. Accommodation was constant, and In my childhood I was only homeless a few weeks in total.

But just because I had a roof over my head doesn’t mean I lived in post Victorian conditions, the house were universally decrepit, they were to small to provide the inhabitants with privacy other than the bathroom, and I did not have a room to myself until my mid 20s; cold, leaky and filled with vermin, not for more that a year before I became and adult did I live in a house with hot running water and electricity, to me, a house that had heating provided by a grotty blanket was the height of the modern decadence.

I had not the time thought it terrible to live in these conditions, throughout history many children have lived in rat and insect infested hovels, and if them then why not me? But it seems like the life I was born into was wrecked all chance of a future that would be meaningfully better.

I never went to school, and this day I don’t see people as truly disadvantaged if they were presented with the grand educational opportunities that seemed so common on the outside world. And it seems that now I am forever condemned to work as a minimum wageslave with a job that slowly kills me.

In my life I would only leave the house a few times a year, and I have never had a friend from the outside world , for my parents did not care to let others see their unwashed children clothed in rags(young children hardly take the time needed to heat bathwater on the stove).

I had one thing to be thankful for it is have I have developed a high threshold for pain and suffering, my parents were not physically abusive, but I was born with a condition which made walking normally very painful but I walked anyway, even as a child I knew that sort of being gravely wounded I would never receive any medical care, for this or any other pain, I was much too young to remember the last and only time I have been to a hospital or dentist.

my youth may have been like a Victorian orphanage, without the *olde worlde* charm those institutions inspire, but children will allays find a way to play, and mine did not reach the level of Victorian orphans, they didn't even reach the level of *homo sapiens,* I had a few toys, but nothing brought 6 year old me more happiness that smashing rocks with other rocks, so I could examine the inside,. later in live my and my siblings would play a game which was basically rock conkers, we would each pick a rock and base them into each other, whoever rock broke first lost. I generally most of out play time involved sticks and rocks, and piece of animal bone from the beach. I wonder if poverty is induced cavemanhood is a really condition?

I don’t have so much faith in the education system of my country that I believe being absent affected my intelligence in any meaningful way, and I think as a child I was smarter that many like when 12 year old me consider the possibly that all our actions were derived from electrical brain impulses in response to externally stimuli, both of which merely cause by a long series of chain reactions; this neuron fires because that one fires, this neuron retain that piece of information because a series of event both a large scale and a molecular one so caused the externally stimulus needed, which made me feel like my free will was merely the product of random chance and we had no more control out actions that electrons in a circuit board. I always had an interest in science, and if I ever studied atoms, I would just be atoms learning about themselves.

I taught myself to read because clearly that was the only way I ever would learn to do so. I would have asked my parents, but I stopped asking them for anything before my age entered double digits.

Did any of you live a life like this? In a house of many, in a city of millions, be virtually alone all the same. Do you feel like you are doomed to spend your days working minimum wage jobs, and living a minimum life until the day you are returned to the cold earth by colder people? do you feel like you were born to live and die in poverty? and is their anyway out?",21Dec2019,1

133,"Around December of last year, I became online friends with a 28 year old guy who claimed to be asexual and aromantic. I am under the age of consent. I broke it off during May after realizing that he might be a pedo, as our conversations were slowly turning more and more sexual. The conversations were not about sexual activities between us, but instead about sharing sexual information about the both of us - shit like masturbation habits, sexual fantasies, and porn. This was all under the guise of him learning about sexual things, as he was a clueless asexual with a high libido. He said that he never intended for anything to happen between us on numerous occasions, though, and always made sure that I felt comfortable. I’m fully aware that it sounds like I’m making excuses for him and I probably am, but I can’t just not mention it.

Clearly this is at least a little fucked up, and I’m 90% sure it was grooming and would like to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anyone else. However, the 10% of doubt comes from the fact that he might be socially oblivious and unaware of normal boundaries. And if that’s the case, reporting him could do a lot of damage that he doesn’t deserve to deal with. 


A friend told me to not do anything a few months ago but I’m really starting to wonder if this is the best course of action. What if this happens to someone else and it goes further? It would be my fault to an extent. I have more than enough evidence to incriminate him, so I could prevent anyone else from being hurt very easily. I’m also planning on asking a therapist about all of this so don’t worry about telling me to go find one. 

There are a lot of details I didn't write so feel free to ask for more, I'll freely give them. 

So should I report him? And if yes, how do I go about doing that?",21Dec2019,1

135,"Ok long story and I know the first thing everyone will think is no don't talk to your ex but hear me out first...  


Story starts at age 17 I met a guy who I will refer to as X and thought he's hot but he was sort of with someone, then i saw him around with friends. Months later at a party we kissed and that sparked a close friendship and then I was off to university. I invited him to my birthday at university and he came and we spoke a lot on the phone and via text and we stayed close friends. We both had boy/girlfriends over the years and remained quite close, always seemed to fancy each other but it was never the right time or one of us wasn't single so it just never happened. Then move on to age 23 the time finally came and we started a relationship, which lasted 3 years. We broke up because we were both unhappy for various reasons but no one did anything wrong as such. We tried to stay friends but it fizzled.   
Ok so cut to now I'm 29 and I've been thinking about him a lot and he viewed my status story on WhatsApp, ok so I can't figure out if I have genuine feelings for him still and theres a reason why we have always been so connected and felt the same about each other for all those years or if it's just because I'm lonely and my biological clock is saying he'll do go back to him. Help...   
How do I figure it out? Please don't just say he's an ex for a reason blah blah blah, yes I know that. He's wasn't my first love so it's not some crazy infatuation. I feel like we have always had a connection and a weird pull towards each other. No judgement please but we also had an abortion, he was very supportive but I think it led us closer to our breakup and I just feel like even though it's been a few years some things are unresolved.   
We haven't spoken in around 2 years now but I can't seem to stop thinking about him and things keep popping up to do with him and I know it may be naive or corny but I can't decide if it is happening for a reason.",21Dec2019,1
136," It's been 4 years since we saw each other on a regular basis, I've only seen him 2-3 times since and all I did was avoid making eye contact, but for some reason I can't stop thinking about them. He constantly told me how smart/talented I was, and was always very concerned about me, if I was ever absent or late he would stick his head in or wave hi to me in class. When I tried not talking to him for 3 months he stopped me in the hallway to talk.

I never ""went for it"" because A. he's literally always in a relationship (he's been in 7 in the 8 years I've known him) and B. I've always thought he was so far out my league. C. I actually did ask for his # once because we talked almost everyday and i considered us friends but he made up some thinly veiled excuse. And I followed him on IG two times and he accepted it but never followed back.

I guess I just need advice on how to get over something I know is not gonna happen.",21Dec2019,1
137,"Hey, so I just moved here to the USA all the way from the Philippines so I could study college. I’ve always been close with my family and for all my life, I’ve never been far away from them for at least more than a month. I was lucky enough to have my parents accompany me here for three months to help get me adjusted with my aunt and her family. So far, it has been two months since I decided to leave my comfort zone and I have to admit, there are some points where I feel homesick and lost and just nostalgic. So yeah, I stumbled upon cheap airfare tickets home and I’ve got to thinking if I should get one. I just don’t know if it’s practical... but since I work, and have lots of free time before I start college next August, I was wondering if I could go home for at least two months next year. What do you guys think? Is it too early for me to go home in April or is seeing my family //and// my dog (that I miss a whole lot 😢) a legitimate reason to spend $650 on airfare? Lol I think I’m just really in need of someone to talk to right now and sometimes I make really impulsive decisions too so yeah. Thanks if anyone decides to read this",21Dec2019,1
138,So my friend and I met about 3 months ago at work and we’ve gotten close since then. We spend time outside of work and his wife hangs out with us sometimes too. I really like both of them a lot. Last night him and I got drinks and when I drink I give my friends lots of compliments and he and I were getting emotional and he told me he is attracted to me and that five years ago he would have been the guy to try and sleep with me but he is happy he isn’t like that anymore because he really likes me as a friend and I told him that i am happy we are friends and all this other sappy shit but I’m afraid now of what this means. I don’t want to ruin our friendship but I don’t want to ruin someone’s marriage cuz they have a crush on me and I kind of do on him but like I know it’s cuz of my own commitment issues and it’s not real feelings so I dont plan on acting on anything and nor would I ever.

141,"My sister in law moved in with us several months ago with her 4 year old son, and dog while she gets in her feet.

She doesn’t pay rent.

In exchange for rent she was supposed to keep the common areas clean, and her bathroom.  We also wanted her to get a part time job.

We watch her kid for her while she works.  I also give her money for food and to go grocery shopping.  Up until this month she also got extra money to pay bills while she started her job.

The thing is... she doesn’t help with cleaning much.  We come home and do the dishes, wipe down the sticky counters, clean up the living room, then get ourselves dinner.  She doesn’t clean up after herself or her son.  I don’t think she’s cleaned her bathroom at all.  And her room has barely any clear floor space.

We’ve tried to help her a lot.  She’s going through a divorce and is very depressed.  But she keeps asking for things.  Before she moved in, she wanted us to install a new bathroom for her in the basement.  And pay for it.  Our house has several bathrooms already.  

We aren’t parents and we try our best while watching our nephew.  We follow the routine she has set, which includes spending 20+ min trying to FaceTime with the kids parents before bed.

When we’ve brought up her doing more before, she lashed out and criticized our babysitting, and cited how hard it was to work when she was so stressed out.

We’re not her, so we can’t “parent” the same way she does.  She didn’t like when I told her kid not to do something because it would hurt his moms feelings.  She also doesn’t like that I’d like to bath him before bed as part of the routine. Or that we want to try and teach her son inside voice, staying at a table while he eats, etc.  

She exploded because she didn’t feel like she had any control.  

She doesn’t have many choices on where to stay, but she does have other options.  

Any advise on the best way for my husband and I to talk to her?  Or should we grin and bear it for a few months more while she gets herself together?",21Dec2019,1
142,"So I am in the middle of the aftereffects of discontinuing my antidepressant fluoxetine after being on it for four years. I am considering on pursuing hormone restoration therapy for the past few months due to wanting to help restore my vitality to before I was on the antidepressant. I talked to my primary care physician about the possibility of pursuing HRT and he was very hesitant about it. He stated things like...

&gt; ""HRT in young cis men can cause testicular atrophy and fertility issues.""

&gt; ""Once on HRT, you may be on it for the rest of you life.""

&gt; ""HRT in young men can increase the risk of prostate cancer and heart attacks.""

&gt; ""Dr. Google is a bad doctor. Many of my patients get royally screwed over by him.""

Now, I don't know if my doctor is actually trying to protect me from being too open about what I read online about medical treatments. But I just want a shot at feeling better physically and mentally. I think my PCP is afraid that once I get prescribed the HRT medication, that I might sell it on the black market for money or abuse it recreationally. It's so weird, because six months ago in June, my therapist said this to me about my medication. Also, based on my doctor's tone and diction, he seems very against the idea of me using the Internet to be more informed about any medical procedures I partake in.
For instance I read this study online that stated when 200 urologists are tasked to help a patient who is dealing with testosterone deficiency and fertility issues, a whopping 52% would prescribe topical testosterone gels, a contraceptive, which means that medication at best would have no effects on the male patient's fertility, and at worse can exacerbate the patient's fertility issues. **52%** of medical school educated urologists making a rookie mistake despite having the skills and experience. If that's the case, then I am not sure if I should trust my primary care physician and continue to consult Dr. Google or if I should be completely ignorant and aloof towards the pros and cons of treatment.

&gt; ""Your entire life can deteriorate if your mental health falls behind. Your professional life can be ruined, your relationships can be compromised, in some cases, you can lose your life to suicide. If being stable for the long run means being on a psychiatric medication or two, in order to remain stable and stay out of the psych ward, then I think its something to consider.""

Yeah, I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation back in November 2017. It has been a couple if years since then and I am doing fine. Just wanted to add that. However, if I stay on the medication for a longer term, (4 years or longer), then I would have to put up with the emotional and physical side effects of my medication, not my prescribe. I completely understand that preventing a relapse of original symptoms is crucial and I get why he was being cautious. However, it seems kinda weird that physicians and therapists are more than eager to support someone going on an antidepressant medication while many of these same health professionals scorn and cringe whenever a cisgender male patient wants to try HRT out of the fear that he may sell his meds on the black market, or administer more than what is prescribed fore recreational purposes. I'm not anti-psychiatry by no means. I see how some of these meds can be very helpful for so many people.
Now onto my questions.

1. Do you think its a good idea for me to consult ""Dr. Google"" despite the risk that I may encounter inaccurate, misleading, or outdated information? On one hand, the web makes it easy to be informed. On the other hand, fearmongering, misinformation, and just outright BS patient experiences can screw me over. How can avoid getting screwed over by medical and health misinformation online in the future?

2. While coming off my antidepressant medication, I had a weir habit of researching the web of other patient's experiences coming off psychiatric medications, and the response was a mixed bag. I saw some horror stories that scared the crap out of me, while I saw success stories that instilled a message of hope and reassurance for the future. However, I realized that everyone's experience with medication, psychiatric or not, would vary and that I should use patient experiences as a way of realizing that I am not alone, and while their experiences are valid (assuming if they are telling the truth), it is still anecdotal evidence and may not apply to my situation. What are your advice and suggestions on reading patient testominals or experiences?

3. During my 11 appointments with my male therapist, he has asked me if I was having suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts 6 times. Not joking. He also asked me how I was doing in terms of symptoms as I tapered off my medication, every beginning of every appointment. None of my previous therapists have asked these safety questions as much as him. Either he is a very compassionate and caring therapist, or he is so scared about my stability, that he feels the need to protect his license and criminal record by asking me these questions frequently. What do you think of this?

4. I got a blood work for my hormones in May of 2019 and my T levels were below normal levels. Normal levels vary between (300 ng/dl to 1100 ng/dl). My total testosterone level was 240 ng/dl. The endocrinologist said ""it's the medication, don't be alarmed."" I gave her a free pass because there was a confounding factor in play. I am going to do another blood test in February of 2020 (I would be off the antidepressant for 2 ½ months by then). Was it a good idea to make occasional checks for testosterone levels in my case, even though my primary care physician didn't suggest it? Explain why.

5. Do you think there is hope for things to get back to normal for me in the coming months? I've been off the antidepressant for about 2 weeks and so far, nothing much has changed. Keep in mind, I've been on the antidepressant for four years.",21Dec2019,1

146,"Since I was born the court ruling has been that I must spend time with my dad, I must have a relationship with him until I became a legal adult. I’m over 18 now, I broke things off with my dad.

147,"Yesterday I ate a piece of warmed french bread. I always eat it for breakfast. Been fine thus far.

Later in the day I felt fuller than usual, way fuller. Started feeling a little queezy but I thought nothing of it. Later that day I order chinese food, ate but made sure not as much as I usually do incase that feeling comes back.

It came back. Worse. I felt like I needed to vomit but couldnt. The nausea sent me into an anxiety or panic attack? Im not sure what it was. All I know is I was scared of vomiting, I felt bad in general, and my stomach felt like it just wanted to push everything out.

I took a pill of lorazepam to calm down incase it was my anxiety causing me to want to vomit or I dont know. After awhile I ended up going to the bathroom 4 times, bowel movements, not big ones but small ones. It was like if I wasnt gonna vomit it out, I was gonna crap it out.

After an hour of that, generally feeling dizzy, out of it, possibly due to lorazepam. I noticed I felt better. It was like a wave of better-ness came over me. No nausea, no stomach ache. Just out of it due to the whole ordeal.

\--------

The next day (today). I sleep in, wake up feeling okay. Little tired but nothing out of the ordinary. I turn to drink some water, nothing else but water. I notice my stomach get kind of full again. Start to feel a little anxious about it but keeping it under control.

Now I feel my mouth and throat dry. I have this weird feeling in the back of my throat thats slightly triggering my gag reflex. I DO NOT feel as bad as yesterday, im not in full panic. 

However Im scared to eat. It was hard to eat two crackers without feeling slightly nauseated over it. Been sipping water since. Debating wether to go to ER or not. 

\---------

Similar full / vomit feeling happened after I ate a biscuit like a week ago. Ate a meal like normal, nothing different, ate a biscuit and felt it expand. I got more full to the point where I was like ""crap im gonna vomit"". I took some bepto and waited. I have some cannabis that was recommended by my doc for anxiety attacks. I took a hit of that after the biscuit when the feeling came.

I dont know if thats related to this. All I know is im trying not to panic, I think im doing okay. I have a constant slight gag reflex feeling in back of my throat. My stomach feels bloated. I get tiny lil waves of stomach ache, nothing to crazy.

148,"I know this will sound crazy, and I completely understand. 

However, ever since I can remember, I have this gnawing feeling that I had another sibling somewhere along the line that I just am not in touch with. It is some weird instinct like there's a part of my family missing. Maybe it's because of the deep, dangerous abuse and neglect I experienced as a child. Maybe it's because twins run in my family. It may also stem from the fact that my parents kept many secrets from us growing up. They would be confronted with proof and still lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I was just an occasional smoker not an addicted one. I just felt cool smoking after school with the cool guys and girls. I even once smoked two cigarettes at once just to get some praise.

152," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I want to mean it but everything feels off. She’s had a couple of red flags, such as not talking to me for almost 2 weeks after a small argument. She’s also failed to initiate conversations, leading me to feel like I’m the only one who cares. Furthermore, a mutual friend told me that she had bragged about giving her number to a couple of guys. I let her know about all of this and she said we’d work on things. Since then, I’ve had mixed results. I’ll add that I had a terrible experience earlier in the year with a different partner and I haven’t been the same. 

I want to do things right with my current “partner”. I don’t want to hurt her and I don’t want to be hurt again. I feel like telling her we should just be friends but we aren’t even together. There is no relationship to keep us together yet I still feel guilt, some kind of pain I can’t understand. I stay committed to whatever we have, but I don’t know if she does. I try to love, but I can’t. And she says that she loves me, but I don’t feel that. 

I don’t know where we are or what she wants. I only know that while I once wanted to make something work, it feels like it can’t. I want peace. It feels like I can’t keep her, but for some reason, I don’t want to lose her. I don’t know if it’s a fear for loneliness or a fear of the inevitability that things will not work out.

162,"I am F (20s) and my partner M (31). I didn't post in r/relationshipadvice because I feel like this is moreso life advice my partner needs.

I think my partner is spending way too much money on his car. 

We are comfortably middle class.

When he came back from America 1.5 years ago he had maybe 200k in savings, he gave most of it to his parents to help pay the mortgage and then bought the car from his bestfriend. He paid 50k upfront and agreed to pay the rest 70k in installments. So total for this car is $120k. He only paid it off very recently.

After he bought the car his parents started going through a tough time financially and they wanted to sell the house (which is his parents but they will be passing it onto my partner in a few years). However, my partner told them not to sell it. He said he would sell his car if they became really desperate. But he said he would do everything in his power to not lose the house or the car.

So in the last 12 months he was working all these random jobs to make money, uber 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. At 1 point night shift and day shift (only sleeping like 3 hours). Now he works as a courier. He was making a good amount of money but obviously sacrificing his time and health. His mother tried to tell him, if its too much stress, we can sell the house. And I was telling him that this car isn't worth the stress. Everytime, I try bring up that he should not have bought it or he should sell it, he gets defensive saying its his 'dream car etc'

So, the car and mortgage payments were manageable as he bought the car off his best friend. So his best friend was very lenient with payments. 

What I can't wrap my head around is the the amount of modifications my partner has been putting into this car, during a time of financial stress.

Getting new exhuast (2-3k), Body kit (10k?) tune (2k), it needed a new transmission (17k), getting wrapped (2k), spacers (?) and today he just told me he was getting it tuned again (2k). 

We literally live in the worst house on the street. As in no upkeep at all and junk everywhere. It honestly looks like a hoarders house. Why is all this money going into the car and not into maintaining the house? He was struggling to feel like it was worth $600 to put a fence/gate up for the dogs which we just ended up doing ourselves with timber scraps and board. He doesn't want to pay for a skip bin to get all this random junk removed from our house and we throw it little by little in the household bins. He says he wants to put a 2nd house in the back. With all the money he has spent on the car, we could have.

I completely understand it is his money and he can do whatever the hell wants. But his mother, sister and I can all see this is a tremendous waste of money at the current time.

165,"So basically, my uncle came from India, in August, to **Canada** based as a refugee. We had to pay like 7k for his stuff and lawyer and random paperwork since we told the government we are related to him.   


He lives in our basement rent-free. He makes 2k a month as a forklift driver for amazon. He has no expenses other than a $30 phone bill. He orders **ALOT** of food on Uber Eats and takes many Uber's, even though my dad offers to drive him.  


Now, he makes a lot of money compared to his expenses - how do we get him to pay? He isn't paying shit. We told him to pay just $500 a month. Is there any way I could scare him to pay us? (Fake legal paper, etc.) My dad really needs to pay off the debt he took off for him.

166,"I am deeply curious about my DS's treatment of me and it's been a few years since my general psychology course so I was wondering if some budding or current psychologist could help me understand my DS propensity to passive aggression and the seeming lack of emotional accountability. Here's the story: (I'm 6 weeks pregnant) My DS and I were talking about baby names and joking around. Eventually, oUT OF NOWHERE, she comes up to me and says 'you know you should start trying to find a counselor to help with PPD'. I knew she was right but kind of unnecessary and dark for the moment? then she adds 'oh , and probably do that soon just in case the baby doesn't make it past the first trimester'. I know she says this with care but I can't help but think she gets some kind of enjoyment out of being the bearer of bad news. She constantly momsplains like this and treats me like an idiot. When I told her I was pregnant she *told* me not to tell our mom bc my mom is pro-life and that it's my body my choice. Then proceeded to tell me what to do with my body when I told her I had no intention of termination. ""do you really think you can raise a baby?"" ""it's selfish not to consider the rest of the family."" ""baby's are really expensive"". Stuff like that. Not to mention that she consistently invalidates my feelings and pushes them off by just telling me to see a counselor. Why does it seem like she's always on a high horse looking down on me? Especially, when it comes to telling me to see a counselor. It's like she gets actual enjoyment out of treating me like a child and causing me stress.


TLDR: I feel like my sister is getting enjoyment out of treating me like I don't know anything, and making me stress about my pregnancy. What are some psychological reasonings behind this behavior?",21Dec2019,1
167,"Sorry this is a bit long, I am just so extremely frustrated and confused and wondering if anyone has dealt with this or advice on whether or not this is actually something to worry about. 

So imma start by saying I have never committed fraud, have good credit and repayment history, and have lived in the same place for years now. Nothing has really changed about me except that I recently did got married and changed my name and that is the only thing that may take a little for public records to update. I am in my early 20s so that might also be a factor here to. My work also requires extensive background checks and credit checks for new employees in my position and I obviously passed so I am 100% sure what this business did is absolute bull. 

My husband and I were looking at purple mattresses and they were advertising Affirm.com - One of those financing companies for retail stores. They do a soft pull on your credit and verify your identity. They do so by asking your social security number and for a picture of your DL and a selfie of you with your DL. This is just for making and account, not even to apply for financing a purchase. Well, to see what options they have, they require you to go through this and make an account first. I thought why not? Its $3,000 mattress, might not hurt to see what financing looks like. So I did so. About 15 minutes later I got an email saying they were unable to verify my identity and that because of this I was banned from ever doing business with this company ever again. EVER. A minute later I got a second email that said I owed money on a chargedoff loan as well and that I needed to think about reconciling that before applying for financing anywhere else. Keep in mind these both also sounded like automated messages. 

I was extremely confused and upset. I have never been turned down for anything like this before. I also don't have a charged off loan. I have one loan out in my name and it's almost paid off, never even missed a payment on it. So I immediately checked my credit report and used my one free annual pull and it all came back normal and exactly as I expected it. I got on the phone with their customer service number and the lady that I was stuck with literally sounded like she was reading off the exact automated email that was sent to me earlier. I asked what happened and why my identity cant be verified. All she said was that there were certain procedures in place and once you get the email that I got, it cant be reversed and i unfortunately can never do business with them ever. I mentioned that it's a little ridiculous to just verify identity of someone with a ssn and a picture of a DL and not have extra steps if you cant verify it that way. She literally told me that there were, just not for my case. But wouldn't tell me what ""my case"" meant!!!

At this point I am more confused and saod fuck it, she obviously wont tell me why so I asked about the chargeoff email. She then put me on hold for 5 minutes, came back, and told me that I was sent that by mistake and that it was meant for someone else. IT LITERALLY HAD MY NAME AND LAST 4 OF MY SOICAL IN THE EMAIL. In response to that she apologized again and said it was a system error. At this point I just asked to speak to a supervisor or something who can actually tell me what is going on because I was now afraid my info was compromised. The lady said it was against policy to transfer me.... ummm what!?. 

I will spare you the specifics because I literally just repeated the same thing 3 more times of calling back and getting different people. I emailed their customer service email and explained everything that happened and said I dont even want to do business with you at this point I just need to know what happened, why I was denied and told I was trying to steal someone's identity even though I was told neither my social nor name has never been used before with their company, and that I needed some sort of reassurance my social and picture of DL hasnt been compromised. I obviously got an email intended for someone else's credit report. Again, I got another email with the same exact automated response as before saying due to policy I cant do business with them.

Has anyone ever used Affirm before and had this issue? Should I be concerned?? I have no idea what to do and feel really wronged and confused and am just so angry by the way I was treated. I cant even so much as get any answer as to what happened. I am now worried that the report they used may be reporting something false with my social and that's why i can't be verified. I thought that if a company uses a background check or credit report to deny you business they have to provide a reason and a copy of the report? Am I wrong? Should I freeze my credit??

If you dont have answer thank you for at least listening because I am mostly so upset I just needed to rant about this awful company.",21Dec2019,1
168," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

Now I sympathized with him even after that, he ignores me and I ignore him but his presence is very toxic, I can get him fired for the homophobic comments he made.
Others have also complained about him but Im stuck working with him regularly. Supervisor takes no actions. I even asked to just switch shifts so I don’t have to work with this guy but no one wants to work with him.

173,"I'm 25 years old. I graduated about a year ago from college. I'm dealing with some life choices right now. My background is that I come from a above average middle class family. I'm 6k in debt and I need some advice from the internet sadly. I've never been financially responsible for anything. I got my first car bought from my father at age 21. Through out college, my rent has always been paid for plus tuition. I've never dealt with the real world. I've worked jobs before but i never paid for rent. I always spent the paycheck on myself and bought stupid shit with it. I can honestly say that I'm truly blessed for the family that god gave me. They take care of me and make sure I'm okay financially and emotionally.  If my parents pass away they will leave substantially a good amount of money to me and my siblings so that we are fine for the rest of our lives. I was fine until I went back to my hometown 6 months ago to study for my LSAT. I was studying for my LSAT for about 5 months and got my results yesterday. I did not do well and I am faced with my parents worrying and possibly disappointment if i don't succeed. While I was waiting for my results I was applying to jobs just in case my law school aspirations didn't work out. So far I manage to get 3 interviews in a different state from where I live. My family suggested I take the LSAT again, which isn't a problem. But I've been sad and depress here in my hometown. My friends don't really talk to me or hang with me. I have a job but I don't really work and my boss is my dad so I make a meaningless paycheck doing jackshit. I feel isolated here. I want to move out and experience life and responsibility. I already want to make income. I want to be an independent adult even if I'm already financially covered. The reason why i say that is because I see my brother at age 34 with a kid still asking help from my dad to cover his expenses. I don't want to live a life like that and be dependent on my family.  I don't know if I want to be in debt either if I get in law school because my sister is a lawyer but she is 250k in debt and will be out of it in 9 years because of her job forgiving loan program.  I feel miserable here in my hometown and I don't know if I can go another 8 weeks of studying and isolation again. A friend suggested that I save money since I don't pay bills as much and it'll work out in my early 30's.  Right now I feel sad I just want to work and make income, experience hardships because I think it'll achieve personal growth than me just being lazy and having my parents do everything for me. I don't have savings, I'm just really lost. Everything Kinda made sense when i was working back in my college town, I wasn't paying rent but I still worked my butt off doing 10hr shift days on a consistent bases and leading 4 other men. Over here in my hometown I just study and be alone, I feel like I have no purpose here. So should I go to another state and do the interviews hoping for a job? or should I study and save money while being sad here?  The Jobs I'm getting interviewed are paying a 25 an hour salary plus commission and the other 22 an hour all in Colorado. I'm from Texas.

175,"When I was younger, I followed my mother around everywhere she went. I slept in her bed up until I was 9-10 years old and I never left her side.

I’m now 18 years old (female) and I physically cannot stand her sometimes. I know that it’s extremely common for teenagers/young adults to have rocky relationships with their parents however I get along with my father great. 

My mother seems to annoy me in ways that I can’t explain. I feel as though I don’t relate to her in any way but I relate to my father in so many ways (especially music, and just in general). 

Whereas my father is very patient and this makes it very easy to talk to him, my mother is extremely hot-headed and has a short temper and I definitely follow her in regards to this so perhaps we are too similar in personalities and consequently clash, but I’m also wondering if I subconsciously dislike her for the following reason. 

When I was around 11 or 12, a few days before Christmas my siblings and I discovered that my mother had been having an affair with another man. 

Inevitably, my father left and stayed at his mothers (my Nan’s) house and that was the first Christmas I spent opening my presents without him there. I feel like ever since then (or perhaps a year or so after that) I became extremely close to my father and distant from my mother.

I’m not sure if I subconsciously don’t forgive her and this is causing a rift between us, or if it’s something entirely different and innocent (I was angry and upset with her but I was very young and I don’t think I fully understood the entire situation, but now I’m older and understand the situation a lot more). 

My heart hurts for my father because he loved my mother so much. He tried everything from therapy and marriage counselling but unfortunately he knew nothing was going to salvage their relationship. They now absolutely cannot stand each other.",21Dec2019,1
176,"I’ve been in current job for six years. I will get promoted if my boss moves on but highly unlikely that he will move. Not entirely sure I want his job but I’m way overdue for a promotion. I like my house and I have autonomy at work. My boss is elsewhere and we have a good relationship. The job is a good match with my skill set. I live in a nice area but I’ve made very few friends and I’m frequently lonely. I’m also older than others in my office so it’s lonely there too. It’s a decent climate but I hate the winters. Should anything happen to my current job, there’s a strong job market. Good cost of living so I’m able to save money. 

I have the opportunity to apply for a promotion with the same company in my dream city. I lived there previously and have numerous friends. Wonderful climate, slightly higher cost of living. The job would be more stress and isn’t a tight fit with my skill set. My boss and his boss would be in the same office. Should anything happen to job, harder to find comparable job. My plan is to move to dream city when I retire but this would get me there 10 years quicker. Easier for family to visit. 

What I want is to move to dream city and improve my personal life. The holidays are particularly lonely and it’s winter. That’s not helping with objective decision making. 

What is right or best or probably the safer decision is to stay put and prioritize professional over personal. Try to find more interests and make more friends locally. Visit dream city a few times a year. Wait for the right opportunity to open up in dream city. 

I’m upset because I feel that my whole life I’ve prioritized professional over personal and that I deserve to be happier. At the same time it’s important to be financially secure and the unknowns and giving up what I have professionally is unsettling.

183,"Backstory : Please don’t judge me, i’m highly embarrassed. I got pregnant when I was 17. My boyfriend and I had been together a year, i had dropped out of highschool and we had our own place. (we both worked full time) My boyfriend and I both were not in the best mental health places. I also had HG (morning sickness but 24/7 and worse) which made me literally incapable of getting out of bed and i dropped weight rapidly . I decided to have an abortion. honestly, I knew as soon as i found out i was pregnant that  i was at no place to provide for a child bc i was barely providing for myself (mentally and emotionally speaking). It would’ve easily tore me and my boyfriend apart, and i don’t think we would’ve been good parents. So ultimately, it was not a difficult decision. Bf was extremely supportive, amazing partner all around throughout the whole experience.

I am 20 now. My boyfriend and I are both at much better mental health places, and have been together for almost 4 years. Our relationship has developed into a wonderful partnership, and I feel content with where we are. 

I had a really vivid dream last week, and it made me worry. I smoke weed so I barely remember any dreams I have to begin with. I honestly freak myself out a lottt about being pregs, so i waited until a day before my period to take a test (today). That line was blue as fuck and i am definitely pregnant.  However, I don’t have the same feelings I had the last time this happened. I think when I tell him, he’s going to expect that I want an abortion, like I did the last time. And i don’t know what i want. And it’s confusing, because the last time i did know what i want. From the moment I knew i was pregnant at 17, I knew what decision i needed to make for myself. Also, I am totally in shock and processing (if that’s what you call a fuck ton of googling and rapidly shifting emotions). My boyfriend should be leaving work any minute. Is it bad for me to not tell him today, or should I talk w him? I think it might be a good idea to process what i want and how i feel before telling him, so i’m in a better place to handle his reaction. but i’m also unsure how long that will take for me to get to that place. Maybe I should just wait until tomorrow? It’s our “day off together” (we have one day a week we spend the whole day with eachother) 

TL;TR I was pregnant at 17 and had abortion bc bf and i were in bad mental health places, also had HG. I am 20 now, and boyfriend and i are still together, going strong, and both in pretty good mental health. At 17, i had no doubts it was the right choice to have an abortion. At 20, I’m unsure of what I want and I’m nervous to communicate to boyfriend the news. I think he will assume I want an abortion like i did last time, and i don’t know what i want!",21Dec2019,1

185,"The plan for this christmas is to spend it with my mom's family, whom, we don't see too often, and whose company I don't really enjoy. To start, I'll talk about my mother a little bit. So, my mother, while I can certainely empatize with her, I don't really like her that much. First of all, she's extremely selfish, plays the victim, won't listen when talking but will talk too much, she's always complaining that she ruined her life by marrying a man like my dad. I think she's an edgy 13yo girl trapped in the body of a 40yo woman. I think of this because she likes to identify with Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad, every time I want to help her with her mental health issues she's always like ""you wouldn't get it, I am too crazy and sad"". On a more real sort of based analisis on why her behaviour might be too immature and ignorant. I think it's because her father left her at a young age and she never said goodbye to him, also she got pregnant at young age, and worked in her childhood. I think, now, that she is relatively stable, and has her own life, she is living the teenage or childhood years she never got to live, but man, am I fucking sick of it. 

I'm telling you this because all my aunts and my grandmother are just like her or worse. One almost died this year because of a heart attack due to alcohol, the daughter of another one got pregnant at 14 years old because of bad parenting, and I'm not saying they are bad people, I just don't like their company the same I won't like a classmate who I don't get along with.

So, I don't know what to do, socializing gets pretty hard for me with people I kind of dislike. 

I can almost picture it, we are gonna go there, I'm gonna feel sort of disconnected to society because they live in an insecure neighborhood, it's all awkward handshakes and then I'm gonna sit on a couch and look at my phone for hours until like 3 am when everyone is drunk and eventually go to wait for New Year.

I didn’t want to cancel my scores, as it was the last acceptable test date for applications this year.

Welp, stupid me decided to order score sends to ALL the colleges I will be applying to, and now the college board says it is too late to cancel them (I called and e-mailed them), so EVERY school I’m applying to will see my awful scores. Now, I know most schools don’t care about Subject Tests, but I’m applying to a few T20’s, and given my situation they are more important than for the average person. Before you say it, I know my chances are itty bitty (especially given my circumstances), however I know I could handle the course load and I really, REALLY love physics, so I really wanted a shot, however small, at a top STEM school. It seems like now my chances are pretty much 0.

I think I did good on the ACT, and I’m also going to take the CLEP in Calculus, pre-calculus, college algebra, and natural sciences, but i feel like the Subject Test scores are going to ruin it all.

192,"So earlier this year, I did something really stupid. People were posting pictures of themselves on this forum I was a long time member of, and after years of never posting my pictures I posted my pictures. For some idiotic reason I posted bad pictures of myself. Well some people on the forum were nasty and calling me ugly and hideous and all sorts of stuff. I look a lot better in person, get complimented often in real life and have better pictures so I don't know what was going through my mind or why I did that.

I regret it so much and I don't know what I was thinking. At the time I wasn't in a great place so my state of mind wasn't good. I keep beating myself up for it and hating myself for doing that. I stay awake all night and can't sleep because I keep attacking myself for it and wishing I could go back in time and not do something so stupid. It's on my mind all day long and consuming me. Now I'm left with the scars of what those forum users said and it was all easily preventable. I'm so angry at myself and this is eating me alive.

194,"5 -6 years ago when I was 12 or 11, I would get flashbacks and I never understood these flashbacks. 

Until I turned 14 I learned more and I remember my friends talking about nonsense I can’t remember, what I did remember was the flashback I got, these flashbacks were something that happened to me when I was little maybe about 5-7 around that age... 

my parents would drop me off at my baby sitters house, I would always go and have fun. 
I remember a lot most of my child hood was spent in that house, but these flashbacks weren’t happy, they were the opposite. 
My babysitter had 2 sons in highschool I believe I don’t really remember I just know they were old enough maybe 17-19. 
One of the sons would sexually take advantage of me, at the time I had no idea what was going on. The one memory I had was

 (if you’re sensitive of being taken advantage of please skip this part)  

one day he took me to his room and closed the door and locked it,
he would tell me that it was our little secret, when I remember having this weird bad feeling, knowing it was wrong he had done it to me more than once. I remember saying no and How I wanted to go outside and play. 
This is from my deep deep memories that were triggered by these flash backs. 
He had me play tic tac toe, if I won I can leave, if he won , he would get what he wanted. 
I won the first round and he made me play again
That’s when he won..
He took advantage of me
He used his mouth, that’s all I will say
He would have his video game playing on full speaker so no one would get suspicious.
I never said anything to anyone 
I was so young 
I didn’t even know what was going on.
When he finished he would pretend like it never happened and let me leave and my babysitter never expected anything she thought I would go to his room to play video games....

(The sensitive part is done)

These flashbacks always come back to me out of nowhere.
Some may question whether or not it’s valid or real.
I know it’s real I literally start to remember it, because it was so weird to me as a child, I knew it was wrong and I wanted to stop going to my babysitter because of it.
But I just never thought about until recently. 
This is where my question comes in

Is there something wrong with me?

I don’t know how to feel about these flashbacks, I don’t know how to react

I don’t start crying, I don’t get mad, I just don’t know what to say or what to do. 
Is it too late to do something.
Most people feel at least an emotion but I feel nothing towards it, I just don’t know how to feel towards it.
I want the flashbacks to go away, but they come back out of nowhere.

I need advice, on getting rid of them, how can I find peace...

I’m sorry for the formatting if it’s messy.

195,"Hi,
I'm in a bad place and I would really appreciate any advice anyone can offer.

After a long period of unemployment, this fall I finally got a job in a field that really interests me, doing what I love. 

At the same time I moved into a house I just bought with my partner. My parents have been so excited for us and are coming to visit this weekend. We finally finished the last of the unpacking, bought groceries, and made plans to all go skiing together. They're really proud and happy for us.

I got a call today from my boss and she told me that my contract is being terminated. She said they've been struggling with me since the start and my performance hasn't been what they expected and I really underdelivered. I was blindsided. Now I have two weeks to finish my projects and then I'm gone. I'm crushed. I'm embarrassed and scared and ashamed and angry at myself. 

And now my parents are coming for what is supposed to be a celebratory weekend together. It's five days before Christmas and i don't know what to do. Do I tell them? How? What do I say?

I asked them advice, and they say, oh, just start by reading up newspapers... Initially it's all unrelated and puzzling but later you might connect the pieces. I think it's a good approach to follow up on one or two stories over a period of time.

Out of the 50k, probably a lot of them are not living in the town went to cities for job or school. There are more older people than youngsters here, there are just very less opportunity for higher income job or ""professional"" career over here. It is an inevitable situation everywhere in the world. Young ones that stayed back either started/succeeded family business, no drive to pursue a better career, uneducated/gave up on studies, working minimal wage job or unfortunately due to family issues limiting them.

They made a homemade bong, started smoking,  and I sat in the corner and just watched. I felt horrible for a couple of reasons. 

I said it was cause I had to go back home after this (I didn't). But inside,  I feel like I was just scared.

205,"Last week I broke up with my boyfriend. We'd been dating for just over a year and I felt that I couldn't do it anymore; I was so tired of looking over my shoulder on dates because his mom was one-hundred percent against him dating. It was mutual, I don't think he's mad at me or anything, but that and other things that have been going on make me feel like trash. I feel so bad for doing it to him, because he liked me a lot, I think. 

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I play a team sport, and I constantly feel like I'm the weak link. Last night at one of our workouts, we did our one rep max for a couple of lifts and I was *so* proud of myself when I got done; I'd improved from last year, where I felt weak and I was even feeling like maybe I was ""strong""... until I saw my teammate's numbers, which were loads higher than mine. I try my best, go to most practices and workouts, but I still feel like I never improve and I never will.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, it feels like all of my ""friends"" are pity friends. I *know* that they're not. They're probably what's kept me from quitting my sport outright (two of my best friends played on the same team as me last year; both changed this year to pursue better competition). I *know* they're not pity friends, but I still feels like everything they do is because they pity me; they're so much better people than I am. I feel like I ruin everything for them, that I'm obnoxious. One of them sent in our group chat, ""I'm getting my secret santa person a beta fish!"" and my stupid ass told her to make sure they could take care of it. Now she says that her mom says she can keep the fish, but not buy anything to go with it so that fish will probably die a horrible death. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my teammates don't like me. They don't say anything or do anything against me, but I just don't fit in with them. They talk about LuLu Lemon pants and professional baseball teams and stuff like that, but I don't know *anything*  about that stuff. I think they think I'm annoying too. One of them once told me, ""You know what? Why do you always contradict what I say?"" and then I realized that I *do* do that a lot... I mess up plays, I can't hit, and I think that they think I'm bringing them down.

I'll also probably post this in other subs to see if I can get a response, but I know I won't, because no one cares about my stupid problems.

But then we both started catching feelings. I'm lesbian and she's bisexual. Her mom knows this. I asked her out in front of my favorite teacher and she was so supportive of us. The next day, my girlfriend is really upset because she told her mother she was dating me. Her mother is homophobic and Christian so this is totally gonna end well. We plan a double date with a close friend of ours and the entire drive there her mom was listing rules and saying things like ""If (girlfriend's name) comes home with a single hickey on her body, I'll bury you in my backyard."" I have bad anxiety so I was on the verge of crying. The movie went great, and our group all agreed that her mother never takes us on dates again.

I don't know if I should go or not, and I'm not sure if her behavior is okay. I'm afraid we're gonna get split apart and we aren't going to be able to talk to each other. What do I do?",21Dec2019,1
208,"I am doing my best so far to be totally upfront and honest; that I'm wholeheartedly engaged, supportive, and participating when I'm with the Mennonites (like at their church meetings which they let any one attend) ... while I'm also not supplying any false hope of me wanting to be baptized, nor commit to living their lifestyle 24/7.

So I'm just not sure how acceptable, or inappropriate, it would be to ask to participate with them (even when not at church) with them in their simple lifestyle: staying off the internet mainly, using technology relatively sparingly, singing, talking, laboring, walking, cleaning, praying.

... Anyway, I hope my question makes sense: regarding me wanting to know if asking them would be a violation of their privacy for me to even ask to spend 2 days per week with them (since they are open/generous people)?

209,"I work at an independent living facility in the dietary department.  Due to inclement weather, my boss was trying to arrange cover for dinner and breakfast shifts.  He asked me to stay for dinner and cover breakfast the next day and offered an empty apartment in the facility to sleep in.  He extended the offer to the other employees, three teenagers (one boy, two girls) accepted as well as another cook (around 30M as well), the boss (30M), and myself (30F).  He also mentioned that there would be whiskey, rum, and Cards Against Humanity available to us.  

Fast forward to that night, the cook and the boss got super drunk.  I noticed that the boss was being particularly friendly to both of the teenage girls but since I have known him for a decade and always thought highly of him, I assumed it was just drunk silly friendliness.  I fell asleep several hours before everyone else.  

Two days later, one of the teenagers (I'll refer to her as L to make it easier, and the other 16F as O) told me that boss had sex with O in the middle of the night.  O had not drank anything but they woke up together before he went back to his bed.  He had a condom readily available in his backpack he put on partway through the act.  O does not want people to know, she claims since it was consensual she doesn't want him to be in any trouble.  

Boss gathered us all to ask us to stop spreading rumors.  I started off recording the meeting but he said he'd be honest if we all surrendered our phones.  His explanation?  He thought he was hooking up with me, not O.  He was under that impression until recently when the rumor got back to him.  He asked us to keep this quiet as he ""has a lot of good he can do here"" but got up to resign himself as soon as it became clear he would not be able to win back our trust or respect.  

The issue?  After he laid everything out to his boss, he was not suspended.  He is still working as usual.  I am unsure if he is under investigation but it's been several days of him still working in close proximity to teenage girls.  I don't want this swept under the rug and I know many of the girls there are uncomfortable around him.  The corporate office in Chicago already knows the story and nothing is happening.  O does not want to press charges (age of consent is 17 in Missouri).  I do not want this to happen again.  

He also has a long-term, live-in girlfriend.  She needs to know regardless of anything else that happens.

210,"***Sex is mentioned but what I’m asking is not sexual in nature.

I’m 22 years old. I live with my mom and stepdad. We have a pretty good relationship and they help me pay for school and my car.

Today I got caught by mom trying to go out and meet a guy to ‘hook up’ with from tinder. I ended up not going because my mom was furious. 

Once I told her I wasn’t going she told my stepdad. They both told me that if I ever went out to hook up with a guy ever again they will stop helping me pay for school, my car, my phone, track my cell phone, etc.

They also said even when I move out (I’m planning to move out within the next year or two, far away) if somehow they ever caught me doing this again they would pull the same stops as mentioned in the paragraph above.

The way I see it is, I know I’m a young adult, but I am an adult. I should be allowed to go out and potentially make mistakes without having a penalty that a 16 year old would have. I frankly would like to experiment with people and I feel that I have the right as a consenting adult to do that and my parent’s reaction to the mere thought of me going out and **having sex** is ridiculous.

Am I overreacting to my parents’ reaction about me wanting to go out and experiment with other people?

I had two main driving forces at the end of my 12th grade, before deciding on a college degree, I had a desire to learn programing, I had, for the previous few years, started to discover a passion for drawing and character art in general, and I've always had the final goal, to make it somewhere in the video game industry.
Problem was, I had at the time no way to consile my 2 main passions, coding and drawing, in any sustainable way, so I decided to stick with the option that I believed would garantee a more stable career. 
I chose my coursw because it CLAIMED to have a hight investment im multimedia and design, which I thought would be a perfect mix of my desires.

I was wrong.

I can't find anything in pure coding, for fear that I wont be able to bear it, I can't find anything art related, because I feel like I don't have any formal education in the area.

My question is fairly general, but this is the context:

I (27M) am currently on my last six months of studying a Msc in cybernetics (aka control engineering for americans) and I am having a hard time on desciding what to do after I graduate.

I was born and raised in the city I now live in, which is also the city were I am currently a student. I have been offered two different Phd's after I graduate at the same university, both are projects I find extremely interesting.

I have also been offered a full time position at a company I would describe as more or less my dream employer. The only drawback is the location of this company. It is in a new city were I have no friends or family  (1 hour flight from my home town).

So should I do a Phd and stay close to my family and friends or should I move to a different city and make sure I don't give up on this opportunity?

I know this is a personal descision, so my question is this:
When you are faced with a difficoult descicion about your future career or living situation, how do you resonate and what are essential points to consider?

I mean intelligence as in, knowing and understanding things more easily and having a more critical thinking. I want to be more aware and have better planning.

227,"I'm a 19 year old male from Ontario, Canada, I currently work in a fast food restaurant that I hate with every fiber of my body and I want to quit as soon as I can, I live with my parents, I have money for higher education but I don't know what to do, I previously went into Computer Programming but I dropped out because I had no motivation to do the course because I was resentful that I wasn't understanding the material as fast as most people in the class. I don't really believe in the cliche of finding a Job or Career that I will love or whatever, so I just want to know what you guys think is a good job for me.

I have an IQ of 114. I'm strongest linguistically, and weakest in 3D manipulation of objects in my head, and lower than average in algebra type problem solving.

I am an introverted person, I'm a very passive person, I'm also very stress sensitive - it doesn't take much to make me anxious, I'm a hard working person but I can't really work hard if I am working for myself, I can work hard for others but I can't be asked to care about myself very much.

My interests right now are more ""artsy"" - I've been getting into music recently and I have dabbled in other creative fields in the past but I'm not a super creative person, so I don't think it will work out for me to pursue an artistic field, even though I really enjoy it. I also think my attraction towards creative fields is my mind trying to avoid displeasure in a way, because creative fields don't immediately remind me of where I am insufficient, whereas computer programming for example, very quickly shows me that I am not as quick, cognitively as most people. So I don't really know what I should do, I wish I could go into a field where I have a chance of becoming the best at the job and simultaneously have high-status, for instance, I am pretty confident I am the best at my shit fast food job, but that is, of course, nothing to be proud about. 

Or maybe I could simply Adderall my way through a field that is above my capabilities lol.

Let me know if you guys have any ideas? Thanks.",21Dec2019,1
228,"Sorry for horrible formating I'm on mobile.


So I've had a crush on a girl from my school for a while now. I never had any luck with relationships, maybe it's because I have Asperger's, maybe it's fate or just bad luck, but Everytime I have fallen for someone, I see how they fall in love with someone else and I just have to be constantly reminded of it everyday. I admit it's my fault because I could never gather the courage to open up to people, until now. However things haven't changed.

For the first time in my life I asked my crush out, she said she was busy both times, and I think she has even started to avoid being alone with me. I figured out she's not interested in me and I feel helpless. I had to gather every last bit of courage to ask her out and I feel like I just wasted it...

Why did it take me so long to do it? Would it have been different if I was someone else? Did I ever stand a chance? I hate this feeling, I hate seing everyone else just randomly falling in love and being corresponded. Why does that never happen to me?

I started to think I'm heartless and maybe impossible to love, that I don't deserve it. But I also want to believe that just like everyone else I deserve to be loved. But I'm not like everyone else, if you ever heard someone on the autism spectrum describe it, I feel like an alien, I don't belong here and shouldn't be here.

Sorry for the rant, but I hate being jealous of everyone. It's like I'm starving and everyone around me is eating their favorite food while I can't do anything but watch. How can I get this feeling off of me? I don't even know what I'm looking for here...

Thanks for reading, sorry...",21Dec2019,1
229,"After reading a bunch of posts on here I’m kind of curious to see what people have to say about this.

I [F18] have known this person [M17] online from playing games since we were 11/10. I’ve always felt completely comfortable around them and I feel like I could tell them everything and they’d still be happy to hang with me. About 3 years ago he started hinting that he liked me. I had dissed my other friends’ internet relationships before that point and wasn’t sure how I felt about him. I eventually concluded that it would be impossible to date him whether  I liked him or not at that time. I ignored his hits and he ended up getting a girlfriend, Jay (not her real name) a few months later. Whether or not that was the right choice has yet to be determined. 

Roll around to a few months later and I finally got to meet him irl for the first time. It was really weird and amazing at the same time. 4 hours felt like 20 minutes. After that trip we stayed in communication and I started to fall for him. Remember: he was dating Jay

The next year I got to visit him again. We’re both weebs so we went to an anime con together (matching cosplays). There I met his other friends and it was really cool. This trip I stayed with his family for a few days. Ik he also feels really comfortable around me, but typically I think of tickle fights and cuddling as kind of a romantic thing. After that trip I convinced myself I love him.

I also came out as bisexual later that month.

Toward the end of that summer I ended up telling him my feelings in a late night gaming session. He jokingly said something like “what if I made up Jay because I really like you” and I told him everything because I thought he was serious. He turned me down hard and we haven’t brought it up since.

Earlier this year he came to visit me and we went to another con. I saw a cute girl there and asked her out (nothing happened with her :/ and felt like it would be something he could tell Jay so she wouldn’t see me as a threat). More tickling and cuddling ensued with him. I guess I never clarified that I was bisexual and not a lesbian (I thought it was kinda obvious). 

I visited him a few months later and I finally met Jay, I had no expectations going in and ofc she was a very nice person. I saw them kiss when they thought I wasn’t looking, that emotional screwed with me a little and I had trouble sleeping that night. More tickling and cuddling ensued this trip as well.

In recent months I’ve become a big fan of gay jokes (I find them ironic I guess) anyways in a call with him and some friends I confirmed that I was bisexual/more attracted to men. My crush thought I was a lesbian! 

A week later he dumps Jay. (She was flirting with another guy). We are very close friends and he poured his heart out to me. He thought she was the one. I cried, he thought I was sad for him (and I was) but I was really hurt by that. I thought I’d be happy when she was finally out of the picture but it actually hurt more in a way.

Anyways, my plan now is to wait for the right moment to strike. I’m thinking a month from now will be enough time for me not to be a rebound. (It’s been 2-3 weeks since their breakup). I’ve never been in a relationship before and sometimes I can’t help but feel I’ve been wasting all these years chasing after someone I can’t be with. We’ll be starting at our respective colleges in the fall (I as a junior, him a freshmen). Now that I’m so close I’ve been considering I should let him go. There are plenty of other people that want me. I’ve tried not to let my feelings for him stop me from dating other people, but I’ve never been able to find someone I like as much as him. Maybe it would be more logical for him to date someone else for another 3 years. I can’t move out of my state until I graduate and maybe I’ll find someone else to date by then. I’m really scared to give him up because I’m afraid I won’t get another opportunity with him. His parents met in highschool and were long distance. If he meets someone else they might never let him go.",21Dec2019,1

I’m a 20 M and have been pretty reserved my whole life. I’ve had some friends growing up and a couple long term but mostly I liked to spend time by myself.

I’ve spent long periods of time without hanging out with anybody before and it doesn’t bother me, but I know others my age hang out more often.

245,"How do you reconnect and repair bonds with friends who  you've stopped talking too while in an abusive relationship? While in a relationship, my ex didn't want me to create new friends unless she likes them/becomes friends with them. She got jealous and threatened to leave me if I didn't stop speaking with people she didn't accept. I complied with her demands for 3 reasons. 1)Because I felt like I owed it to her to support her decisions and stand by them no matter what because she was there for me when I lost my mom. 2)Because I felt lonely/feared being alone because during that time period I was living alone because my family travelled.     3) I started being ill and needed someone to care for me.  Through our conversations and her demonization of 3 of my friends (who are also her friends), she convinced me that they were not good friends to me because they weren't there enough for me at that moment while she was. I was so desperate to have her around me because I felt that I needed her, that I forgave her physical and psychological abuse. The more I became isolated, them more I depended on her for emotional and mental support. The last straw was when she attacked our mutual friend and then attacked me. When I finally told her that I don't want to be in a relationship, she stole my laptop, saying she wouldn't give it to me back until we got back together. I completely refused, she had physically attacked me the day before and expected me to forgive her abuse. 


It's been 2 years since I ended the abusive relationship with my ex. I still think about it very often. I'm working on moving past those memories, healing and finding peace. I started talking to 2 of the friends that I had previously cut out of my life. They said they were always willing to talk again to me when and if I came to them. I have this other girl friend who I've known since primary school, and I would like to talk to her. But I'm not sure if she will talk to me because I cut myself off from her suddenly-unbeknowist to her, it was because I was told by my abusive partner that she was laughing at me when my abusive partner attacked me in a jealous fit. I have known those 3 friends since primary school/middle school.

How do I reconnect and take the steps to repair the bond with my girl friend whom I've known since grade 3? 
I've realized that I should've talked to the 3 of my friends before I made such a rash decision with my ex to cut them off. 

And obviously I will respect whatever decision my friend makes in reconnecting.",21Dec2019,1

248,"(If you don’t know, Anorexia is a medical condition where the person doesn’t want to eat. Not in a not-hungry kind of way, but generally because they want to loose weight. They may or may not actually be overweight, it’s more of a false perspective about their weight.)

I’ve know this friend for 4 years, and we’re really close. She doesn’t have many other friends outside of our group, and she can be a bit loud and extroverted, so some people really don’t like her. She is a bit heavier than most of the other girls in our class, but it certainly isn’t excessive or unhealthy. I hang out with her in almost all of our classes, and I know her really well.

She used to be excited when lunch came around. She usually has a good portion of food, and wouldn’t have anything left. She’s really healthy, being active and running around. 

Lately she doesn’t eat much. She says she isn’t hungry and complains about being tired. We used to play tag at recess, but she stopped playing, saying she was tired. Someone else in our class brought donuts recently, and she didn’t have any. She normally isn’t one to shirk away from sweets, but she never had an excessive amount either. She’s also complained about being fat and wanting to loose weight. She’s said she was fat a few times before, but it was usually just one comment.

I don’t know what to do. I really think she has Anorexia. I want to help her, but I’m not sure how. I’ve googled a few things, but most say to just be comforting and send them to a professional. We’re in 8th grade, so I feel weird telling my friend to see a therapist. I don’t want to advise her to do so, only to have her reject the fact that there’s anything wrong and shy away from more help.

252,"My landlord is friendly enough and we have a decent tenant-landlord relationship. We’re not friends or anything though. Over the past year or so I have run into him several times around the house when he was clearly extremely inebriated. Could barely stand up, slurred speech, didn’t even recognize me, etc. I assume alcohol but could be something else. In any case he appears to have a substance abuse problem. It hasn’t really caused any problems except that he can be forgetful about maintenance tasks around the building. He doesn’t live here full-time but is around fairly often.

Tonight when I got home I witnessed him backing his car into his parking spot. He nearly crashed into the neighbors car and then proceeded to park halfway on the lawn at a very awkward angle. He then threw some water bottles out of his car and nearly fell over getting out of the car before staggering to the apartment door. It took him fully ten minutes to find his key and get in while steadying himself against the wall.

Me and my friends are also atheists and she always butts into our.. ahem... god jokes... by laughing and going “NO. no no. God is very real.” Totally ruins the jokes, and as no one was telling it to her in the first place, always makes the conversation sour. Also, if we would want to go talk with someone one on one, she follows. We tell her to leave, she won’t. All of us have expressed our distaste for her, and she is now becoming the butt of many jokes. We are just trying to get her to leave on her own, which I know is wrong, but she seriously can’t take ANY hints.

258,"Might be a lengthy post, so please bear with me:

For about 3ish years, I spent a lot of time with this guy. Him and I briefly dated for three months (Dec 2017; friendship started in Dec 2016), but continued the friendship up until about 5 months ago.  He would keep on begging me to give him another chance, that we were meant to be and that no one would treat me better than he does. I, being who I am as a person and with my own history with dating, knew that was bullshit. I’m secure enough in who I am to know that if I had to I could find someone else who would love and care about me, but he never believed that for himself.

In June, I knew I couldn’t be with him anymore as a friend/FWB. It was too much for me. He became obsessive. He would come to my job and wait for me to go on break or lunch. I asked him a few times in the past to bring me food if he had the time or if he just wanted to see me, but then it became an everyday thing, especially when I stopped asking. I was explicitly telling him not to come and he would anyway. He was straight out refusing to work on toxic traits about himself. He never thought he needed to improve himself and that things were perfectly fine because he had me. I was feeling trapped on a whole new level and it triggered me. It brought me back to a time that I don’t like talking about. I genuinely started to think like, “wow, I’m really not gonna leave him”.

Well, luckily for me, I did. 

Here’s where the guilt comes in:

So the reason why I feel guilty is because of the following:

1. When I told him I couldn’t spend time with him anymore because of all of the things he was unwilling to address for us to be together, he told me it was my fault for not giving him a chance. I gave him 2 years worth of chances (because there were issues going on even before we officially dated).

2. He said he will never love anyone else. He was either going to accept being alone forever or wait for me. (I don’t think this to be true, but still a bold and anxiety provoking statement because of his obsessive nature towards the end of whatever we were).

3. I found out he quit his full time job a month after this and became a janitor at his old HS. Telling mutual friends that I played a huge role in this decision. 

4. I found out through mutual social circles that his health is declining and he’s gaining a lot of weight (which is not good for the condition he apparently now has).

I’ve been trying to process this guilt with my therapist. And I avoid bringing it up to my current boyfriend because I don’t want him to think that I still care for this person. I don’t want him to question the relationship we have because I literally love my boyfriend more than anything. 

The simplest answer is that it’s not my problem anymore and I shouldn’t have to worry about it, but I do. I feel so guilty about this. No matter how many times I tell myself I did what I had to do for my well-being, the guilt comes back one way or another.

I was thinking I could move up there but I'm nervous, this is my first time having to get a job transfer and look for a place to live, plus he doesn't have his driver's license so he would have to get an uber to have apartment tours to get a good feel on the area. But money is too tight to spend 100$ on an apartment tour. 

The only good thing about waiting until March to move in together is that I would have my tax refund, however, that is the same time that my Granny will find out if she still has lung cancer and if she does she will undergo chemotherapy. I would feel too guilty to leave her while she's going through that. Currently, she's fine and while the radiation really knocked her for a loop she's recovering fast. What is extra sad is that since my grandmother found out that I want to move in with my boyfriend she has almost completely stopped talking to me or asking me to do anything with her or even to help her.

So, should I follow through with our original plan and move in together in January, and if so do I focus on finding a job transfer or an apartment first? Or should I wait until march and hope for the best that things work out for my Grandmother? What if things don't work out for her and she has to go through chemo, do I put off the move again? Additionally, should I find a job transfer first and move in with him and his crazy family while we look for an affordable apartment, even though I can't guarantee him that we won't be living there for less than a month? And if I do wind up staying should I start my next semester in college and should the classes be online only or in person like they always have been, though that would guarantee that I'm stuck here until May?",21Dec2019,1
261,"This is a throwaway account due to my main having my real name and I don't want this to be associated with my real name for a lot of reasons. 

My dad is very abusive to me. He is psychological, mentally, verbally and has been physically abusive to me. This took a HUGE toll on me over the years mentally which led me to emotional eating and now I'm about 20 stone (280 pounds) at a height of 6""3. About a month ago he threw a plate at me, yesterday he called me, ""mentally retarded"" for not bringing out the bin when he never asked me to, he would constantly tell me I'm, ""stupid"", ""dense"", ""thick (meaning really stupid)"", ""Not going to amount to anything in life"" etc. A few weeks back he got annoyed with me over his phone, pulled me off my bed and dragged me downstairs and kicked me out into the cold night, a few hours later he called and said he left a key near the house. None of these things he apologised for. Until I finish my degree, I'm stuck here in this house; there's complications in the family so there's no one else to go to, none of my friends has room. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly want to lose this weight; I don't want to be this big. Does anyone have advice, tips, suggestions to help me through times when my dad is getting abusive with me because when he is making me feel worthless, food has been the only thing to give me self-worth and happiness during the time I am eating? I don't know how to stop, it ain't as easy for me, I suffer from getting addictions to stuff so I feel like a complete junkie getting addicted to food or alcohol. I know it's not as bad as real drugs but to me, it's a huge problem, I can't get under control with my dad triggering my emotional eating so hard. I know one part of losing weight is going to the gym but what's the point if I can control the eating part?. I feel it'll be better taking it one step at a time and I don't know what to do or how to do it. My self-control is horrible.

Please help, anyone. Anything. I seriously want to get the weight under control. I hate my body and what I've disgustingly become. Any help to lead me towards this is really appreciated.",21Dec2019,1
262,"So I (24f) lived on my own for several years before my father passed away, my mom relocated, and as I result I moved in with her and my sibling again. My mom is deeply religious. As the years have passed and I’ve become an adult, I have expressed that I don’t really care for religion, and she gradually spoke about it less and less.

I live in a separate building from the main house (where my mom and sibling sleep) and I pay rent, so when I moved in with her this time I asked if I would be allowed to have guests in my part of the house. She tepidly said yes, inquiring about overnight visitors to which I responded that there wouldn’t be; and no one has ever spent the night.

All that being said, I have had a couple of male callers over. I work all day and my family is usually asleep or heading that way when I get home, so I figured it was a relative non issue. However, my mom likes to get up and look out the window if she’s heard a car door or to see if I’m home, and she has a video doorbell that she seems to check nearly every time it lets her know someone is so much as approaching the driveway. I try to be reasonably stealthy so as not to upset her, but somehow she always knows, and I hate feeling like I have to act sneaky when I am a grown woman and have already cleared the situation with her, 

The other day, I came home from work to her acting somewhat frosty, and when I went outside to my ‘house’ I received a text from her asking if I ever wonder what God thinks of my choices. I responded that if God made me, how can he judge my choices? I didn’t entertain the conversation for too much longer, but it really upset me. I try my best to be a good person and family member; in this matter I try to be considerate, I help out around the house, spend time with my family whenever I can, and generally try to be a thoughtful person.

When I came home today, I asked how her day was and didn’t get much conversation beyond that. My mom and I have always been pretty close (in the sense that I love her but, having lived away from home, have been able to censor parts of my life I know she doesn’t agree with), and it makes me sad that she is, I assume, being judgmental about my ‘extracurricular’ activities. I have needs, and my place is often the most convenient place to hang out.

I don’t know the best way to resolve this besides upping my sneak game, which ultimately still won’t make my mom’s view of my non celibacy as a moral failure disappear. Is anyone in or has been in a similar situation, and how would you handle it?",21Dec2019,1
263,"I had an interview Friday morning. It was going well, or at least I thought. Towards the end they mentioned they needed people to start tomorrow, or Monday. And that they’ll start calling people later that evening. 

I was not told this prior to the interview. I said I had a family lunch on Saturday, which I had planned for weeks. Its our Holiday dinner. I said I was available Monday.  I then realized right away what a mistake that was. I added, that if need be, I could cancel my plans. In reality, my mom would probably be upset if I cancelled last minute, after all the cooking she did, but I left that part out. 

I got home and waited for a call back, and I never got one. Was it because of the date thing? Has this happened to anyone else? I was talking to some friends about it and they all agreed I was an idiot. It just sorta slipped out.",21Dec2019,1

268,"A little background. My dad, (my mom’s ex-husband) was a pretty horrible human being. They got divorced when I was about five years old, and he left her with me, my three year old little sister, and my newborn brother for about a year. My mom lost our house and we all moved in with my grandparents. My grandparents became my second parents. My mom worked full-time, and they practically raised us for the next ten years. During those ten years, my mom (with the financial and emotional backing of my grandparents) engaged in an extremely ugly custody battle until my dad finally left us for good about four years ago. Again, they both helped us out a lot. They drove us to school, my grandma cooked and cleaned for us, they spent a lot of retirement money on us, while my mom paid for the house and other finances. Pretty much a symbiotic relationship. However, a few years ago my mom started dating a new guy who they hated. Long story short, they started fighting about it and have been ever since. My grandparents were kicked out/chose to move out (depending on who you ask) and have been floating around since then. Their relationship is extremely broken right now, and we have basically played the in-between role. I know that if I tell them she actually got engaged to this guy, they will flip out. I KNOW they will call her and start a fight-leading to an even bigger fracture in their relationship. However, their trust in me might be broken if I don’t tell them about this, because she sure as hell won’t. What should I do?",21Dec2019,1

At the beginning of the year I joined two plant based classes, floral design, and green house
I'm failing both because I'm to lazy to do any of the work, I know its my fault but I've already missed so much that I'm ganna fail the class and not ganna get the credits.
Then I have algebra, I thought I was doing pretty good in the class but then I didn't do the work for some of the new topics and I don't understand what where doing anymore, I failed a test and decided I needed to do sometime about it, I studied my butt off and thought I understood it, but when a really big test came I didn't under anything again and I flunked it, so now my grade is down the drain and I still don't understand what we are doing.
In my English class it was also entirely my fault, I didn't do a small write in paragraph but apparently it was part of a large paper that was put together over the entire semester, when it came time to do the second paragraph, I didn't want to do both paragraphs and skipped over doing it, but the paper only got longer and longer adding more paragraphs the farther into the year we got, and then on the last day of the paper I didn't have a single world done.

I was married before so I am quite more mature and experienced in life than he is. I have a good patience, but sometimes it's hard to let it go.

It turns out that he invited them to play videogames after the drinks. when my door bells, it's the couple, the couple guy's brother, the guy's wife sister and her boyfriend and everyone carrying a luggage.

It got to the point where my neighbor wasn’t paying me until every 3 weeks because he kept “forgetting” despite using a money app, and I got fed up with it. I kindly told him to please pay the day of class moving forward and informed him I began enforcing a late fee policy of $10. He pays me through the Zelle app and Zelle is so easy. You just the plug in the numbers and you send it off. It shows up immediately in your bank account. I chalked it up to him being lazy because as soon as I let him know of the new policy he was paying on time and even up to two weeks in advance. I could take advantage of customers forgetting to pay but I don’t. Instead, I always text them a reminder to send payment to avoid the late fee. This week the parent forgot despite my reminder. Payment was due Monday and I didn’t receive payment until today, Friday. I realized he didn’t include the late fee so I reminded him of it and he said “my bank takes forever to process through Zelle. You don’t understand. I did send it on Monday but it’s not my fault you just received it today. Do not charge me a late fee.” Now I know for a fact this isn’t true because of how the app works but besides that he’s taught me he’s a habitual liar and couldn’t care less about my schedule or policies. He’s also been consistent about paying on time the past 4 weeks so he’s suddenly having issues? On top of that issue, he dumps his kid at my tutoring center 15 minutes early and picks him up late, no less than 15 minutes late. (He only lives 5 minutes away.) Many times he doesn’t show up and he’ll text me 3 days later at midnight giving lousy excuses such as “couldn’t make it” or “i forgot”. Whenever he comes in late to pick up his child he always wants to talk to see how his kid did. Many times I will be tutoring the student that came after his child and he will still come in and interrupt us as if I wasn’t busy and as if he wasn’t nearly 30 minutes late.
Sometimes I just think he’s stereotypically cheap, thinks that leaving their kid longer at class means I’m teaching them more (getting more for his money), and they don’t consider other people’s lives or schedules as important. 

In general I’m really patient and I bend over backwards for people, but this guy just has me going nuts! I’ve never dealt with a parent like him.

He's not too rich like someone who starts with a T and ends with a P and should never be a president! ...Sorry, a little off course. But he's pretty rich that he can get one or two expensive things, or go out of state to visit Disneyworld, or land, or whatever. I don't think he's rich enough to go across country, but I could be wrong. 

Now I dis-owned him because of his mental and verbal abuses over the past years I've been born and stopped seeing him once I turned around 13, or 16 after my mom and ""him"" got divorced. He never treated any of us with kindness so why answer his texts, or calls about meetups and stuff if he never treated us fairly? Well...because of that, my little sister and big brother were able to have a ""fair"" relationship with him. Although, she and he are in a different relationship which involves money. No love. But to my ""dad"", it felt like he had his daughter and son back while his mistakes(he literally thinks of me and my other little sister as) don't seem to want to be around him. It really felt that he had his favorites and all I and my sister were to him were just unwanted human beings who don't deserve his ""love"" since we were different in his eyes.

In his childish mind, he decided to make it interesting by giving his two favorite children expensive gifts and trips to places just to make us jealous. I honestly don't care. The last trip I went on with him, I ended up crying my eyes out because he wouldn't stop yelling at me for no reason, and he never gives me things that I like. That does sound selfish, but growing up, he had always guilt trip us all and say ""I don't see you often enough to know what you really like"".

After that, I stopped replying to him and would even ridicule his ass anytime I talk about him. I don't even care that he takes my two siblings on vacations, or gives them bigger things. But lately, I've been battling my thoughts. I heard that he would probably give his wealth to his kids. Half to my brother, and half to my sister, and leave nothing for the mistakes. I told my mom that I don't care at all since he never cared for me or my little-er sister, but now I'm kinda at a loss. I hate him with every bone in my body that ached each second I had to put up with him, but now I kinda feel sad, and very jealous of my siblings. I have massive anxiety so I can't handle another second with him, but they can, which is why they handle him to get something out of it each time. 

Please tell me, do you think I'm selfish to be jealous of my siblings who might be in his will, or am I just deluded with so many thoughts that I don't see the real picture? Should I be angry at the one being whom I kicked out of my life that will give his wealth to his favorites instead of his other children? I'm open for any opinions, I'm also okay with knowing if I'm really a bad person so I can learn.",21Dec2019,1

There’s no real problems in the relationship, but we don’t have much in common anymore. We don’t like the same shows. When I try to put effort in, I feel ignored, etc. 

Growing up I was an only child with a single father. He remarried when I was 10. A lot of his attention went to her (understandably) after that.

300,"I want to stop talking to this guy because he creeps me out but i don’t really know how to go about it. Im going to send him a message on discord but what should I say? I’ll post info down below \/\/


Long story short is that this guy has done a lot of creepy/unsettling things and I don’t want to talk to him bc I don’t like his personality and think he’s gross. To be clear, I never wanted to be anything more then acquaintances from the start and have always replied to his messages to be polite. As of the moment I flat out ignore his online dms, but whenever he talks to me in art class I’ll reply (usually w/ the bare minimum.) I have a VERY hard time with confronting people, so it’s quite difficult  for me to tell him to leave me alone. Even the thought makes me nervous and clam up :T AITA for not saying anything outright and letting him believe we’re still somewhat “friends”?

Things he’s done thatve rubbed me the wrong way \/\/
- While talking he sent me a photo of myself that I’d posted on Instagram and deleted a week after putting it up
- Constantly brought up invasive/gross topics (even when we first started talking) Such as: Masturbation, Details on vaginas, Periods, What’s it’s like having a clit, etc.
- Asked for selfies a few times 
- Pressured me into going to his birthday party
- Constantly asked invasive questions about me and my life 
- assumed I was depressed and said he wanted to “fix me” like he had others 
- Made fun of the fact that I didn’t like to eat infront of people I barely know and tried to force me to do just that to get over it
- Talked about how he was getting off and the shower and was “cucked” by his brother knocking on the door
- Sent me promiscuous photos of other girls he got via a hacking app bc it was “funny”
- Said I was pretty a few times and followed up with sexual jokes. Always said jk after though so it’s toooootally fine right?",21Dec2019,1
301,"This is all very complicated and I do not expect anyone to read this. However if you do and could help at all I would really appreciate it. So I am living in a ""transitional"" rehab facility where I can live a normal life but everything I do is monitored. I have 8 random drug tests monthly. I also take CBD so the tests come back with normally 10-30 of some number of THC. Over Thanksgiving break I was allowed to go home and I smoked weed for the first time in a year. I tried to hide it with this thing called fruit pectin which makes your drug tests go blank. The program searched my bag as soon as I got back to the house and found it, and then I popped hot for about 60 whatever numbers of THC. My parents have a strict no weed policy and were very upset, as was the program. My tech was taken for a week and I was not allowed to leave the house. Fast forward to this past week, I had finals and was very stressed because my parents expect very good grades and I was not doing as well as they wanted. They were threatening to cut me off because of the weed situation and my grades. When I get stressed, I tend to eat very little. Today, my mentor got my drug test back from a few days ago and I had 100 numbers of THC on it. When he saw this, he went back to my older drug tests and found that I had 0 THC numbers right before my home visit, so he suspects that I took fruit pectin then because that has apparently never happened when you take CBD. There was also an occassion about two months back (before I was taking CBD) where they found fruit pectin under a couch cushion in me and a few other people's common room and immediately suspected it to be me for no reason whatsoever. Someone framed me/us because I know for a fact nobody else who ""owns"" that common room smokes or anything. They gave me a drug test by mouth that is much more in depth or whatever immediately after they found it and nothing came up.

Now the program thinks I have been smoking weed the whole time I have been in the program and have used fruit pectin to get away with it. My explanation for the 100 THC test is that I was not eating very much at all and that combined with the weed I smoked over break caused it to go way up. For the 0 THC test, I believe I was not taking the CBD consistently (which I can't prove because they don't keep logs of people taking CBD).

I understand their suspicion because of the 3 separate occassions (found pectin under couch and the 2 other tests, combined with me smoking over home visit and getting caught with pectin), however I can honestly say that the only time I ever did a drug in this whole program was over Thanksgiving. They are going to tell my parents tomorrow, who are about to financially support me in leaving the program and getting an apartment with my friend. I believe that my parents will back out of this and cut me off as soon as they hear about it.

I have no way to prove anything. I offered to take a lie detector test and was denied. I offered for them to ask the drug test company if not eating will skyrocket your levels of THC. They didn't believe it. If anyone knows ANY other solution, PLEASE help. If anyone actually reads this, thank you so much, I understand that it is super confusing, but any advice would go a long way.",21Dec2019,1
302,"Hey guys. I met this girl who works for the same company I work for that works down the street from my work property and she’s really cute. We met because she came to my property one day to work with me on some assignments. We got to know each other a little bit and at the end we added each other on social media. She’s from the Philippines and has been in this country for about 4 months. Anyway, I never messaged her first cause I wanted to respect her as a colleague and also not be creepy cause I felt like a lot of guys at her property probably hit on her since she’s a cutie and the industry I work in doesn’t usually have female technicians. She ended up like one of my pics on insta a couple weeks later. Then last night she DM’d me at like 1:30 am asking me if I was gonna come to the company Christmas party since her date “dumped” her and that she felt that no one she knew would be there. Ironically someone from her property that she knew actually offered to give us a ride with their date (kinda like a double date?).  We had a really good time at the party and after we parted way and I got home, I messaged her telling her I had a great time with her and that I’d like to chill with her sometime again.  
Then she said “Heyyy! I did too! Thanks for coming with me! And yeah sure. That would be much better than just sleeping here at home 🤣”

So guys, I would really appreciate any insight to what you think is going on. I really don’t want to overstep any boundaries and make her uncomfortable because that would be really unfair to her since we might have to work together again. But most importantly, I want her to know that I respect her as a woman and individual instead of some sexy coworker to hit on just cause she’s a girl (one of the very very few girls) that I work with. I also know she’s been in this country for such a short time and probably has her guard up high against guys and doesn’t know too many people at all... ugh but she’s such a cutie and we had a good time.

TL;DR at the bottom 
Ok so I’m at a new school and when I first arrived I became friends with this kid who I’ll call Adam. Me and Adam where friends but then he started to become an ass and he started snitching on people. Some important information is at my school everyone curses not around the teachers but everyone curses. And a prime place where everyone curses (my self included) is the boys locker room. So one day we were playing something in PE and I said a joke to Adam and he started talking about how it’s wrong of me to say curse words in the bathroom and threatened to snitch (at this time me n Adam where no longer friends) And from then it only got worse. He said he would snitch but one day he was being really obnoxious and annoying so I told him to shut up. He predictably threatens to snitch I just rolled my eyes and ignored it. (Ok so something important to know about Adam is that he is very sheltered. He doesn’t have a phone, he doesn’t know who any popular musicians are at all, he doesn’t know what drugs are, he doesn’t know any sex jokes) so today my friend me ,my friends, and, Adam sat at the same table for lunch and my friend who I’ll call Kevin asked if we preferred tits or ass. Well Adam didn’t know what a tit was so he said he was going to tell his mom and ask her. (Which would result in the whole “who told you that” which would lead to me and my friends getting in trouble.) Well then we started making sex jokes and Adam threatened to report us to his mom and the teachers. When we pointed out no one would like that and no one would want to be his friend he said and I quote “I don’t care I always tell the truth to my mommy and my daddy” (yes he calls his parents his mommy and daddy, And no were not in the 2nd grade where it would be normal) So then my friends made a joke about eggplants (if you don’t know the eggplant emoji is commonly referred to as a penis) and Adam started talking about how he loves long big egg plants. So naturally we all laugh our asses off which was a mistake because he threatened to snitch. So then at recess me and my friends where trying to convince him to not snitch and my friend who I’ll call Jason said that it would pointless for Adam to snitch on my because most of the stuff we said was in front of groups of my friends who would have no problem saying that Adam was lying. To which Adam threatened to slap me in the face which he said very vocally amongst a group of all of my friends. We also pointed out how Adam had said bad stuff himself constantly calling people retards and asshats and staring at butts. This was the end but he will probably snitch on me 
TL;DR 
My old friend doesn’t understand sex references and is threatening to snitch on me for cursing in the locker room.",21Dec2019,1
307,"How do you deal with relatives that you don’t really like?

I (18F) live with my dad and we get along fine. Trouble is, I just feel something is ‘off’ with his sister aka my aunt, but he really wouldn’t believe me. My mum passed away recently too and aside from the grieving,  she used to be my buffer because she didn’t really like my aunt either.

So my dad wants me to call my grandma often, and I’m okay with that, I love my grandma. But every time I call grandma, my aunt just keeps trying to hijack my call - I’d be able to talk to grandma maybe two sentences and then it’ll be like ten minutes with my aunt who will just go on and on about how hard things are for her, how much money she spent to take care of grandma, how they don’t have the money to hire a nurse (which my mum’s side of the family did for my maternal grandparents) and so on. Even when I know it’s my dad who’s been sending them money. If I cut it short dad keeps complaining about how much grandma misses me. Lately, my aunt has been asking multiple times when I’ll be coming to ‘work for her’ and joke about free help which I have never said anything about, ever? No intention to go and she can’t make me take an hour’s plane ride so at least I’m off the hook.

Now Christmas is coming up and she wants to come visit. Dad is really happy but I really don’t want her to - I once caught her snooping around my mum’s makeup/perfume a few years back, too (she said she was looking for something or another, but why would you start rifling around someone else’s vanity table).

I’m worried about protecting my mum’s things and I’m worried about having to put up with my aunt. Talking to dad doesn’t help either because he refuses to believe anything bad about his sister and thinks I’m too antagonistic anout her. What should I do?",21Dec2019,1

Not sure if this really belongs here, but I really need support and just want to make sure I'm not crazy for feeling this way?

So I'm home from uni for winter break and I live with my sister away from home, so we don't see our immediate family nearly as often as we did. In that time, my younger brother(14) has grown to be quite the asshole. This isn't exactly my judgement either. According to my mother, he has been mouthy and straight up insulting. When I make trip back down to my parents place he constantly digs into me about not being employed (currently at school full time) and I know it really shouldn't bother me considering Im older than him but like *Jesus Christ* it drives me insane. I can handle a light teasing and if its in good fun, its no skin off my back.

Additionally, he has grown increasingly physically hostile, to the point where he hits and scratches my sister and I. Just the other day he drew blood. That really made me mad but I don't have the heart to hit back. I'm a pacifist in the respect. Call me an optimist or whatever, but I really try to understand people before passing judgement or whatnot but I really need some advice. 

The only reasons I can believe he is acting this way is that he is becoming you know... hormonal. But even then, that is no excuse to be acting like a total douchebag. Ive talked to my mother about this because she doesnt deserve to be talked to like that either and she agrees that he is out of line. Is there anything I could say or do in the meantime?

whenever we talk abt eachother to eachother we agree that we always want eachother at social situations bc it makes us feel more confident, and comfortable. it also makes us feel cool bc we view eachother as like the ‘cooler’ person if that makes sense? either way we are always proud like “thats my best friend!!”

316,"Let me go into detail... I got a Facebook account when I was twelve. I am now twenty. Around the age of twelve/thirteen, I said some things I'm not proud of. This includes the ""N"" word (I'm white) and other not-as-terrible-but-still-unpleasant things (basically just talking sh\*t about people I knew). Thankfully, I stopped being like that before high school, but it still lives on in some messages that I exchanged when I was just a tween. 

Before I continue, I must add that the word was said in a friendly way. I'm not going to try to dignify what I did, I just want all the information possible to be on here. I never intended to be racist and I am not currently racist. I never shared any racist imagery or jokes, nor have I ever posted/messaged anything that could be viewed as racist (other than the ""N"" word). I, truthfully, said it because my friends did. That's really it. If it matters, it was never ""-er"".

The backstory is that I had a lot of problems when I was twelve/thirteen that influenced the way I acted. I was severely depressed (self-harming and had a suicide date set), was trying to find a way to come out as gay to my mom, and was forced out of the closet when I was in elementary school, leading to bullying until I went to a different high school. This affected who I was, but I don't think if anyone found these messages that they'd care about that.

Why I care: I want to be an actor, eventually, and just in case I'd rather not be torn apart because I was a moron and didn't understand consequences when I was a kid. The Camila Cabello thing kind of got me flustered.

My main question: Should I message those who I exchanged messages with to ask for them to delete our conversation? If so, how would I say it? I haven't talked to these people in at least five years. Or, is there a way on Facebook to delete old messages from both sides of the conversation? Or, do you think deleting my Facebook would be enough?

Also, am I a bad person because of this? Am I overreacting? I just feel icky and want to hear thoughts. Do any of you share the same experience?",21Dec2019,1

318,"Hey! So i’m 15F . I’m a lesbian &amp; let me just give you a little backstory of my life. I have always had an attraction to girls, I realised this when I was 10. I guess i sort of ignored it as I was embaressed &amp; scated. I talked to a few friends about it when I was 12 - I lost a lot of them &amp; most of them felt really uncomfortable around me. I then decided to date a guy that was one of my really good mates, we dated for a while and I slowly started realising that I had no interest in him whatsoever. Everyone was talking to me about ‘THAT’ feeling when you’re in love and I was kinda a bit confused. I didn’t feel anything. We ended up breaking up because there was just no connection. I then moved on &amp; dated another one of my mates last year 19M . I honestly saw him as a bro &amp; all my mates saw that. I couldn’t feel any attraction towards him. No connection either. We broke up for the same reason - no attraction or connection. Just too good as mates. After that I started talking to a few guys &amp; girls . When I would talk to the guys I could never really find an attraction, whereas with girls I immediately did. A year after experimenting with a few people, I then knew that I was gay. Anyways, it’s a longer story but that’s not what I’m here to talk about!

I’ve never felt love, or that ‘butterfly’ feeling. I never felt nervous around someone &amp; all this time I thought it might’ve just been that I didn’t believe in it. I was like the grinch when it came to love. Never believed in it, never tried to believe in it. I wasn’t really looking for anything - I didn’t want to look for anything. 

A few weeks ago, my friend introduced me to a girl 19F which is also a lesbian. I saw her instagram and thought she was extremely attractive so I texted her. We had one BORING conversation. ‘Hi. ‘How are you.’ ‘Wyd.’ The conversation lasted not even like 10 minutes, after that convo I couldn’t stop thinking about her. It was like, everything I did was to try get her to notice me. I got nervous, I didn’t even want to text her because I was so nervous. We didnt speak for a  week or so, but then got back into a conversation a few days ago. We spoke about goals, interests, hobbies, future, sexuality, past and all that. We are litteraly both the same person , it’s crazy. I felt that feeling. The feeling of always checking my phone 24/7 to see if she messaged, waking up &amp; immediately thinking about her, going to sleep thinking about her etc. My friend told her I was interested in her when they hung out and told me that she was calling me ‘cute’ and ‘extremley hot’. The next day she said said ‘Hey bold of me to assume you’re into me - but I think the age is a big thing. I would prefer if you were 16 &amp; I will wait till you’re 16 to do anything.’ I turn 16 in less than a month and that kinda shook me but like I completley understand! 

Today I was out with a few friends &amp; my friend told me she’s hanging with her. We planned to meet. My friends and I waited for a few hours for them to come , but we weren’t in a rush. As soon as they came ( her, my friend &amp; 2 other girls ) we gave eachother a hug and just said hi. They then decided to go get food but I stayed with the people I was originally with. They came back &amp; we decided to go to a park. We all drove in seperate cars to a park. The groups were kinda split up, she immediately walked over to me when we parked up though. She got to know my mates and we just had a little conversation. Only lasted about a minute. Then she went back to her group &amp; started talking with them, I felt awkward to approach them so I stayed with mine. While I was with my mates I kept seeing her standing up and quickly looking at me before sitting down. This happened like 7 times. She then came up to me &amp; told me to sit with her &amp; her group. So i walked over. My friend then started getting angry saying she needed to be home so we had to quickly cut everything short. I caught her staring at me multiple times before we all left. I was kinda upset, I wanted to talk to her more but I was so nervous &amp; didn’t have the chance to. 

What should I do from here? I really like her but what if she dosn’t feel the same. What if I’m so ‘blinded’ by the positive things. I don’t want to get hurt.

320,"Could really use some advice on how to keep going through such hard and trying times. 

My fiancé and I are in the process of moving back home due to financial situation. We both are struggling to find suitable jobs in our industry and just overall getting any interest from recruiters at all. We both been ghosted multiple times in the interview processes but that’s a whole other story. 

The real problem is Wells Fargo and CarMax are preventing me from going home for the holidays. I physically can’t move until I get rid of my car. CarMax was all set to purchase it until they ran a check. My records show that Wells Fargo was a lien holder and I needed a lien request from them. Well Wells Fargo refused to send me one since they had never received the title to the car when I refinanced with them. So they never technically had ownership. 

Anyways, apparently all of this can only be done by fax/mail only. I have been waiting for the request to come, from Arizona, for a week now. I have today and Monday left for it to arrive or else everything will be closed for the holidays and I’m screwed.  Don’t see why things can’t be done electronically. 

I know it’s my fault. Most things are. I’m just wondering how everyone gets through these Holiday times when things aren’t going so great.",21Dec2019,1
321,"I work at a YMCA in the after school program. Basically we hangout with the kids and help them with their homework, and also play board games, sports, whatever they really want. 

Today after all the kids left, me (21, M) noticed a pair of glasses left by a kid, on the table. I told my coworker (19, M) and he picked them up and out them on, as a joke. I said, “you look like an old white lady, next thing i know you’re gonna say something racist”. he then said “hahahahaha fucking n***ers” and just kept walking. we live in a sort of small town where 95%+ of the citizens are white. out of the 80 or so kids who come to the after school program, only one of them is black. 


it made me extremely uneasy and i didn’t speak up because i honestly did not know what to say, I was in shock. if it was any other job, i’d probably just distance myself, and let it go, but we spend hours a day with these kids and they look up to us, and are very influenced by us, so i think we have an obligation to not be fucking racists and shit. 



another thing, he has numerous times told kids to tell another coworker (who is half Filipino) that Trump is going to deport her, as a joke. 


I’m really bothered by this, but i’m afraid that 1. our superior won’t take it seriously. 2. the coworker who said it will hate me and try and make my life hell

324,"I'm feeling a little lost. This is going to be long, but I’ve tried to keep it short. Thank-you to whoever takes the time to read my life and offer advice or contribute, I really appreciate it. 

I don't really know where to start; maybe from the start. Although I'm relatively young, 21, I've struggled with my fair share of struggles in life. When I was younger, it was just me and my mother, I grew up without my biological dad in my life and that took a toll on me when I was younger. When I turned eight, my mother married my now ex step-dad and for a good ten years after the fact (until I turned eighteen and she finally broke things off) he emotionally abused me and my mother. There's things I don't remember and a good chunk of my childhood that have been blanked out. Needless to say there were times, even though he never physically abused me, that I thought he'd kill me or that he'd killed my mother; this was all as a young kid. 

During the same time-frame my mother started going to a very intense Christian Church and I think because of that, she found it hard to break things off with my ex step-dad, as it was frowned upon to divorce or get separated, they knew what was happening at home and didn't do a good job with consoling my mother or me in the way of advice or what to do. The church was very toxic and I believe I suffered a great deal of religious trauma while suffering through my trauma in the home too. I was powerless to do anything, I was stressed and scared
out of my mind from a boy until a young teen. Everyone I looked up to, my parents, people in the Church, all seemed to be doing the wrong things and there was nothing I could do about it. 

Once my mother separated with my ex step-dad, which was around, again, when I was eighteen, I reached the peak of mental illness, I dropped out of High School a month or two before I was going to graduate, I was a good student, but the weight of everything was crushing me and I'd reached a point where I was breaking. 

My mental illness started when I was at Intermediate, I think it's called middle-school in America, I was 12-13 and I believe that's when depression and anxiety began to wrap around my very being. Back to after High School and dropping out, I took time off from everyone and everything, for the rest of that year (2016) and the whole of 2017, I was bed-ridden and unemployed; my mental health had taken a big nose-dive as said above and I found myself at the peak of not only depression and anxiety but a three year long existential/quarter-life crisis, that started in 2014 where I struggled to find meaning in anything. Needless to say I was a full blown pessimist. 

At the start of 2018, after a year of contemplating suicide, an old friend from Intermediate contacted me out of the blue, he was back in my home town and he wanted to catch up. 
I was very socially anxious and depressed but I had nothing to lose, so when he invited me on an eight hour hike, just the two of us and offered me LSD, I accepted. Because of my religious up-bringing, I'd never done any drugs, smoked or drank alcohol up until this point, I was eighteen, border-lining nineteen. From this point I gained a friend, my best friend now, who's very much family, only I didn't know it yet. The acid trip changed some things for me mentally and while I don't condone drugs to help your problems, in this instance it worked wonders. Although this very instance opened a gate for me that led me to consuming LSD, MDMA, weed, alcohol and tobacco down the line. Over the next few months this friend of mine, stuck with me, through thick and thin, he showed up to my house whenever, un-announced, which I hated and got me out to do things, experience things, showed me another side of life, of compassion and love and understanding, of making memories and experiences. Through his help and repeated efforts he helped me to get up on my feet again and I owe him my life. 

2018 and this year has been nothing but growth; I’ve hit the ground running and I haven’t stopped. I'm over my existential/quarter-life crisis and I have my own meaning. Although these past couple years have been great and I've changed so much as a person, it's been a couple years of facing loss, the loss of people in my life. In August 2018, my uncle committed suicide, it struck a cord with me because I'd struggled with the same thoughts and had contemplated the same actions. And this year, a couple days shy of my uncles one year anniversary, my sister passed away from cancer. Each of these events in my life sent me on a spiral to drink and do more drugs more drugs (not the hard hard stuff)  more so then I already was; all ways to deal with grief and the pain of my past which I had not entirely gotten over or made peace with. And even though these past couple years have been great, I think I have struggled with substance abuse, I've very much seen myself as a highly functionable mess. 

This brings us to today. I landed my dream job a month and a half ago now as a Brewer after working my way up the working ladder, starting out last year as a cleaner and moving from one job to the next, finding what I like and don't like. I'm making good money, I’m not in debt, I've just bought myself a nice practical car (Honda Fit) and I'm starting to put money aside for a deposit on a house. I don't do drugs anymore, as I need to stay clean for my job and I've quit smoking, a week in now and my drinking is more responsible now and I'm just starting to enjoy non-alcoholic spirits. I'd say that I'm content now or at peace with my past and everything that's happened up until this point. I'm on medication to deal with my stress and sleep as well as the mild-depression. Life is good. But in saying that, there's still a deep sadness within me and it seems to grow the more I'm content, I feel tired and I feel old and I'm starting to feel lost again. I've tamed the monsters in my life and I'm starting to get my footing in life but I feel so out of place and empty. I think I'm starting to go through an identity crisis. I don't even know who I am anymore and I've changed so much I don't even recognize or am comfortable with myself. I need advice. These recent feelings have only manifested since I started this new job. Everything feels so weird, like it’s a dream, my past up until this point feels so distant. I’m doing better than I have at any point in my life and after reaching a point I’ve been aiming at for so long I just feel so… I don’t know.",21Dec2019,1

My uncle has since passed away. My immediate family knew of this, but I only recently found out. The abuser is currently a principal at an elementary school. I feel very uncomfortable about this, and I feel some duty to do something about it. I can't imagine that an abuser wouldn't have done ANYTHING when he has had access to children for decades. I don't have hard proof that he did this to my uncle, only the testimony of my close family members. I don't know the abuser's immediate family, and no clue if they have any inkling of anything.

328,"So I paid my tuition through a third party (officially sponsored by the school, I didn't get scammed here), but about half of the money was eventually paid to the college by a grant. Now, despite it appearing to be paid on my bill, the college is claiming to not be able to disburse my financial aid (though it appears to be dispersed on my account) because the transcript I gave them from my previous college has not been evaluated yet. This transcript was given to them long before classes ever started this past semester. The big thing I don't understand is how they failed to evaluate my transcript from the previous School when I got it to them so long ago. This, along with the fact that the third party wants the rest of the money for the tuition payment, is preventing me from signing up for classes next semester because multiple holds on my account. My my parents don't want me to pay the third party the rest of the balance until the financial aid comes through, because I should get a check back for the excess paid to the college, which I could use to pay off the rest of the payment plan. My problem here is that by the time all this is done, I'm going to end up being stuck with classes that I likely have no need for, and most likely will not fit my schedule so good. Because of this, I'm heavily thinking about not attending for the next semester.

my mother is also worried about this affecting my credit score.

I sent an email asking that my transcript be evaluated as soon as possible, and explaining my confusion as to how it was never done earlier before the beginning of the last semester.

My question here is what would be the best thing to do? Should I just bite the bullet and pay as much of the payment plan as I can, and then just pocket the check that I get back from the school? Or would it be okay to do what my parents want, and wait until I get the check first and use that for the payment plan? Are there any other options?",21Dec2019,1

Essentially, we got a plan together in which we would purchase a couple of uniforms from different time periods throughout American history- the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WW1, WW2, etc.- then we’d wear said uniforms all day, everyday, going in chronological order, for the week leading up to Veterans Day as a sign of support and admiration for those who served, past, present, and future.

I send emts from one account to the other for him. He is fully capable of doing this himself, but I handle all the bills in the house.

A couple weeks ago I sent the emt from one account, but for some dumb fucking reason, I didn't accept it to the other account. I thought I did. My excuse was i was  stressed about studying for my exam that was the next day. Fastforward to this past Thursday when I went to emt his pay for his next round of bills when I saw that three different bills bounced and he has been charged nsf fees. These are all important bills, not just internet or cell phone etc.

I was able to call the places yesterday (friday) these bills are for and I got the information to rectify the missed payments. Two of the places requires my bf to call in and talk to them to fix it.

Obviously that’s normal for a kid but she would even get mad when I went out with my uncle who I live with and that kind of bothered me but I got used to it because I guess it was reasonable. But now it seems a little ridiculous. I cant even be in my own backyard because she is scared someone will hop over the fence and kidnap me.

She would get so mad if I ever sat in front of my house without her there. She even gets mad when I sleep downstairs with my uncle and cousin because she says that I need to let her know where I am. It’s my own house! I tell her that and she gets mad. All I ask her is to able to go out in the middle of the day by myself at least once. She says she’ll think about it but she always says no.

339,"Maybe too much background:
My boyfriend grew up as I would call it “well off.” His dad is a CEO. His dad is the youngest of 9 kids. His dad’s family had nothing growing up. His dad had only hand-me-downs. They grew their own food as a necessity. My boyfriend’s dad arguably wanted for everything. So my boyfriend, through the hard work of his father wanted for nothing.

The Short Story: my boyfriend grew up wanting for nothing, but working for everything he had.

 The Longer Story: They built their own home from the ground up. But my BF has a hand up laying every tile, nailing every board, and hanging every picture. He walked the halls of his childhood home knowing he helped build it. He got his first job at 15. He put himself through college (though his parents paid for his private school education.).

His dad divorced and remarried when he was just over 12 years old. His dad’s new wife made about $150k over what he made. Her two children wanted for nothing and work for nothing. They’re 18 and 20. Both boys, both lacking in general gratitude and knowledge of the regular population’s lives.

We are spending an entire Christmas with them for the first time and we are bringing gifts. Mostly on my boyfriend’s dime, but I’m clueless as to what to give people that want for nothing. I grew up never even having gone on a vacation. That was for the wealthy only. I went to the beach for the first time at 19. His two step-brothers went to Europe (we’re all from the US) for the first time at about 2 or 3 years old.

I am used to $50 gifts maybe if it’s in the budget, and they are used to using their mom’s credit card to buy whatever they want. I don’t judge them, they’re good people and they’re kind. But they have a lot of things that I never even dreamed of having as a kid. We had a family give us an old PlayStation because their dad worked for Sony. That was the only game station we had.
 
Sometimes we would pretend we were at a fancy dinner with only candles lit for our sandwiches. My parents could barely pay the bill growing up. We had nothing. I’ve already watched my BF’s siblings and half-siblings not even thank their parents or parental figures for gifts before. I’ve watched them expect and voice better/nicer/more expensive things from their parents.

I’m scared whatever we bring won’t be enough. I’m even more scared because I’m doing the shopping (I offered (dumb)). My BF keeps suggesting gift cards. Which makes sense as their family sometimes buys themselves their own gifts using their parent’s credit cards. Maybe I’m just feeling insecure because I grew up very different, or maybe I’m truly clueless.

Either way, WTF do you buy someone who has access to anything they could possibly want or need? I don’t want to do just gift cards.",21Dec2019,1

343,"Especially compared to a lot of the threads here, I know this is a very small issue, but it's kinda been bothering me recently.

Basically, I (17f) used to have a really close friendship of 3 with two other girls (also 17f, I'll call them J and L). We met through swim team, and grew super close for our first 2 years of high school-- but me and J were always closer outside of our friend group of 3 because we went to the same school.

(TL;DR for the next block of text: me, J, L, joined a sports team freshman year, grew close. Only L did it last year. We got into a few fights,including one where I posted about me on social media to all of my friends. Now they are way closer to each other than I am to either of them). 

Our junior year (last year) , me and J decided not to do swim team separately. A lot also happened--J got a boyfriend who hated me, and she spent all her time with him and basically ignored me until they broke up. After they broke up, we started hanging out as a group more again.
 In this time, there were 2 big fights, both where J and L sided against me. One J told me after the fact she realized I was in the right. The second was much worse-- I made a dumb mistake and they didn't talk to me for days.
 I found out through a mutual friend that J had made an Instagram account that all of my friends and acquaintances followed and posted about me on there. It wasn't bashing me, but it said, 
""[the three of us] got in a fight. I've thought about it in every possible way but there's no way we me and [L] in the wrong..... I can't apologize for one more thing I didn't do!!!.... Literally I've apologized for everything that has happened in our friendship and she doesn't apologize for her being wrong in any way and I'm sick of it [note: she's apologizes first to me in less than half of our fights, and I've ended up apologizing for being in the wrong a lot- in the end, including this fight] let's hope we can get through this so I can delete this post""
I know it's not much but it really hurt me, and I ended up eating my lunch in my car alone for a while. It's been almost a year and I still am paranoid that all of my friends are talking about me behind my back, think I'm a bad friend, and hate me, a large part because of this post. Only one friend told me about this post out of all of mine (I'm pretty introverted and until recently all of my friends were better friends with J).
Long story short we made up in the end, but things never really returned to the same.
Slightly unrelated but my mental health took a few sharp downturns this year (pretty sure deppresive- intruisive suicidal thoughts, (very little) self harm, etc), then upturned, and now I'm not sure. Last week I couldn't even get out of bed after school, and this week I'm crying a lot but when I'm with my friends I'm happy again. (note: I know I should probably see a therapist at some pint, but I've never ever told anyone outside of strangers on the internet about this, other than telling friends I sometimes get sad for no reason, and I've never been able to tell anyone).

FFW to present day. J decided to rejoin swim. I decided against it, until about two or three weeks into when it started. Some other people were talking about joining, and I realized it sounded fun, I wanted to do more activities with J and L, and I really needed the exercise again. I was talking about it with J and a few others, and J was pretty quiet. I texted her that night and asked if she didn't want me to join it (I made sure to emphasize that  I wouldn't be mad if she didn't, I just wanted to know if she didn't and why) and she basically told me she's hated being friends with me. A lot of what she said was true--I had been judgemental and negative (partly due to my mental health, but that's still not an excuse) especially when it came to swim team. She told me she didn't want to be around me anymore, and that I had been bringing her mood down. 
I should add that for a month or two it's been a weekly occurance of J and L posting extensively about each other on social media, calling each other soul mates (platonically), saying how much they love each other (it sounds petty but it makes me sad that they never ever ever mention me in these posts when we used to be so close).
I brought up the fact that I wasn't as close to either of them as they were to each other, and J basically said, ""yeah I know"" and that it might be awkward if I joined because of it.

The last few weeks have been a weird limbo between me and J because I'm not sure if she wants to be around me or not, but I'm trying to be better. 

Then last week I had work at the pool while they were doing swim, and I was talking to them. L asked me, ""why didn't you decide to join swim??"" and I just shrugged. She told me she really wished I had.

I'm not sure if I should tell L that J told me she didn't want me to do swim. because she didn't want to spend more time with me- I don't know if J told her that or not, though I'm sure J told her a lot about my flaws and stuff. I know my friendship with J can be toxic, but she's legitimately an amazing, caring person who I love a lot, and she told me she still loves me. We've been friendly and keep making indefinite plans. I'm still not sure where we stand, and I think telling L might just be petty and hurt more than it helps, but I also want her to know the truth,and I'm not sure what to do.

344,"So I always go out of my way every year to buy my family gifts ever since I started working at 15. I make sure I always get something meaningful for them even though I get treated like crap most of the time. Today I went to the mall and I splurged on the kids and came home and wrapped up their presents and went ahead and put them under the tree. I got some nice Air Force 1s for my sister because she’s been wanting some so I felt great inside, as long as they are happy! Later on I took a nap and she came to my door to ask for my conditioner and I told her it was gone. She (13) proceeds to call me a “ S***** Dumb ass B****” and walks away.  I got the shoes back and plan on returning them cause this hasn’t been the first, second or third time she insults me this way. Am I wrong for taking the shoes back? As a kid I never got anything from my parents until I started the giving gifts tradition on Christmas. I cried so much cause it hurts.... what should I do?",21Dec2019,1
345,"My husband (39m) has a large family so every year we mix up names and buy a gift for one person. Except the kiddos who get a present from all. Pretty simple. My husband this year got his sister (41f). I was super excited about this because she tends to get horrible gifts. I really wanted to buy her something nice. After talking and debating we had something picked out we wanted to get her. She then sent me a email containing a want list from Amazon, it contained about ten items. The top two were robot vacuums. My husband and I discussed the want list and finally decided to buy her one of the robot vacuums off the list, as we both wanted very badly to buy her something nice and we knew from the list this was an item she wanted. 

Today my husband was on Facebook and saw a post from his sister that was about her new robot vacuum she had just bought herself. It’s just like the one we had bought her off of her Christmas list. Both my husband and myself were completely shocked and frankly upset. He had even told his niece (15f) about her gift. I’m very confused why she would buy herself this item after asking for it for Christmas and her daughter knowing we got her one. 

And now my husband and I are debating how to handle this situation. He feels that she is just getting a second vacuum, after all she asked for one for Christmas and then bought herself one so it’s now her fault she will have two. I’m really torn. I’m angry on one side because I wanted her to have a nice gift and instead of getting her the thoughtful planned out gift we had originally thought of we went with the “safe” gift off her list. And on the other side I’m panicked because I’m not sure there would be enough time now or even what to get her before we see her Christmas Eve at family dinner. I know we definitely don’t have time to get her the gift we had originally considered. Part of me wants to call his sister and ask about the new vacuum, but I don’t want to start trouble. I’m seriously disappointed and feeling stuck. Any advice on how to gracefully handle this?",21Dec2019,1

348,"So my close friends and I do a christmas party every year, and this year we decided to do secret santa. Our budget range was $50-$75. It was an optional secret santa, people could still come if the didnt want to participate.

When it got to me my secret santa got me a coat from the thrift store some chocolates I don’t like and a $15 gift card to a food place that I don’t like either. Around here coats cost about 20 from the thrift store. The coat just also isn’t very nice and it wasn’t washed, seems like one of the gentle cycle/hand wash/dry clean only and cant be put in the dryer ones and it smelled awful. Her gift came to about $35 est. She kept asking if I was unhappy but I kept lying and saying it was great because I didnt want to upset her as we are good friends.

Many people (including me) went over the budget and got up into the $90s. A few of them got new shoes or clothes or just things they genuinely wanted. Im not really picky, Im fine with just getting maybe chips candy deodorant hairspray lotion wipes socks or basically just cheap everyday essentials. And people know this about me because Im pretty stuck in my ways and its all I ever ask for from anyone.

I mean Im known to buy coats often and I appreciate the thought but I just dont like the gift at all, it was under the budget and she also ended up with a really nice gift. 

I also know that She did just move out and was short on money but the secret santa was optional and I feel like if she didn’t have the money it was unfair of her to participate in the first place. And again the things I ask for are usually on the cheaper end, if I ended up with $35 worth of everyday cheap essentials Id be completely fine with that. 

Anyways I just feel really ungrateful and I dont know if Im allowed to complain or whine about it because I feel guilty because in the end she did try. I just don’t know how to react.",21Dec2019,1
349,"Yesterday I (M/19) went to a dinner location with my friends/coworkers/boss. We ate a delicious Menu and after some glasses of wine and 2 liquor we went to a small place where we ordered a Gin Tonic. Everything was fine till that point. Then 2 other people joined the party, my coworkers knew them very well but I didn’t.
So I was sitting in this bar and all of a sudden my 2 friends left the club to go sit outside, which I totally overlooked. So I was left with the 2 other ones not knowing what to do... At that point I called my brother on the phone out of instinct. I went outside in order to hear what my brother was saying and I told him to get me, and ended the phone call. Then on my way inside I noticed my 2 friends sitting outside next to a fireplace. I approached them and said that I’m going to leave. Then my 2 friends started to down talk me like I’m the worst person of the night. Which I probably was... but this whole ‘let’s party and pretend that everything is fine’ is just not my type. Im not like that.
Anyway, my friends then said ‘You need to come with us, it’s gonna be fun!’ 
And my other friend said that’s really uncool from me to go home. 
I said ‘Please don’t be mad with me, but I’m not the right type for that...’
Thy then continued to try to get me to go with them.
‘You’re part of the Team you can’t just leave us, you gotta do the things you don’t like, maybe you’ll enjoy partying a lot’ they said.
I felt really really really bad from that point because I was leaving. I went inside to get my coat and umbrella, went outside again and said good bye to them and they were just ignoring me. Didn’t even say bye to me. Which did hurt me a lot actually.
After I left the place I felt so bad that I repeatedly hit the my umbrella to my head.

354,"Tonight my wife and I went to a small work event. One of the individuals there was gay, and we got a long just fine at first. My wife never drinks, and by never the last time she was drunk was over 10 years ago, and her and this individual (lets call him A) ended up getting pretty drunk. My wife is a very successful and confident woman, as well as outspoken for female rights, which I totally support. What is pissing me off is that the more A got drunk, the more handsy he got with me. He kept rubbing his hand on my ass and down my stomach, stopping right before my crotch. I would back away, and honestly, at the time I wasn't in a bad mood, just put off.   


Part of me didn't want to say anything because my wife works so hard and never does stuff like this, so I didn't want to kill the mood. But then, he started making joking comments regarding ""her pussy"", and she was totally playing along with it (I'm not worried about her cheating on me, just a heads up), but this totally pissed me off. They were making comments about my equipment, and that is when I said ""that's personal, next subject"". Shit kept on continuing though. I feel that shit is totally inappropriate and would never talk about my wife's privates to anyone. What really pissed me off though, is when we were leaving I told her I was uncomfortable because of how much he was touching. Her fucking response was, ""he didn't mean it like that"". WHAT THE GOD DAMN FUCK. I feel like because it's a woman and a gay man, that it gets dismissed. I decided not to press it further because it was starting to become apparent that my wife was extremely drunk.   


I'm absolutely torn right now because I love my wife so much, and don't want her to feel like she can't have fun. But I personally don't feel like being drunk is an excuse for any form of that behavior. On the other hand I don't think my wife would say that if she wasn't drunk, so I don't know what to fucking do here. I also don't dislike A, I simply do not want to be around him when he gets drunk because I feel like he will try and touch me again. The dude was talking about how he was checking my package out, and my wife just laughed at it. What if it was a girl saying that shit, would she laugh then?

356,"Sorry this is so long, but I feel like the details are important to the story. Please help me. 

About my brother: He’s 26. Just got his business degree last May. He struggled to find a full time job after graduation but ended up getting an offer from an insurance company answering phone calls. He relocated to the city I live in for the position. At the time, I had difficult roommates, so for convenience we moved in together. 

My brother has struggled with depression and anxiety since at least high school. He’s gone to therapy. He’s taken prescription medications. Somewhere along the line, he lost his passion for everything. It took him 7 and a half years to earn his bachelors degree, and that was a major accomplishment. 

Needless to say, answering phone calls for a living was not his cup of tea. Many customers are frustrated, annoyed, and angry when they call, leaving my brother as a verbal punching bag. He started having anxiety attacks at work, and that’s when he decided to quit. Note: before he quit, he had an interview within the same company for an accounting position (which he didn’t get). 

The only reason that I know about his resignation is because we live together. I kept questioning him and asking why he wasn’t at work. He blew me off at first but finally told me after I asked him multiple times. 

To complicate matters, my parents have recently moved near the area, so they frequently invite us to dinner or activities. My parents plan events to fit my brothers schedule (about 3 or 4 hours later), so my brother has been dressing up like he just got off work to avoid telling them the truth. When he first told me he was unemployed, i decided I was going to let him make his own decisions. He’s an adult. He can own up to this and tell the truth. It’s not my place to tell people. Maybe he can find another position before having to tell them, I thought. 

It has now been a month since he quit his job and he hardly ever leaves the house, let alone comes out of his room. He sleeps in til past noon everyday, doesn’t really shower and spends all his time watching shows, reading comics, or playing games. 

I’m stressed and worried knowing that my brother is unemployed and appears to have no intentions of becoming employed. I have no idea how he’s going to pay for rent, insurance, utilities, his car, groceries, etc. I encourage him at least every couple days and ask how his job search is going but... no progress. I feel almost burdened that I’m the only one that knows anything about this. 

Here are my thoughts/problems:
     I’m trying to be as understanding as possible since I know that his previous job affected his mental health, but on the other hand, he has no income, very little experience, no desire to find a job, and has had a difficult time finding a job to begin with. 
     My sweet mother has been planning Christmas around my brothers work schedule when I know for a fact that he will be at home doing nothing. It has been so frustrating to see him lie about this so for long. I want to tell my parents, but I know they will be very upset with him. And also, I feel like I shouldn’t have to be the one to tell them. We aren’t little kids anymore. But maybe this is more serious?
     I don’t know if I should be doing anything else/reaching out to anyone else. I’m stuck between feeling terrible for him since he’s at such a low point in his life and feeling like he needs to start acting responsible. 

Any advice or thoughts?",21Dec2019,1

358,"My brother has a friend and me and the friend has been ok for a while, just small talks, i’ve never been in a relationship and i’m 13, my brother’s friend is 15, I am in a play which was supposed to represent the birth of Jesus, I am playing as Mary, and he is a Wise man(idk he’s supposed to be an angel human are something) we didn’t interact much, he did act strange, he kept saying rude shits and punching me for some reason, then he’d ask for hugs and would try and hold my hand which was strange ofc.

Then yesterday, Friday 20th, he was in the Practice room for the play with me as I was putting the accessories away he did things like kiss my cheeks and asked me how I felt about him, I don’t actually know how I feel about him, I might slightly like him but I don’t know either, I’ve only had crushes which feel completely different, then we played a round of rock papers scissors during lunch period, he won the first round and immediately asked me where he could touch me?!?! (WHAT) i had no idea and was in shock and he touched my thighs, I didn’t stop him because I’m clueless and stupid and then he touched my vagina. I then was brung back to myself after a minute of shock when he pressed on it and I pushed his hands away, And I didn’t want the fact that my brother’s friend had just touched me without consent and it was stupidity on my part I just let it go and we played another round and since the first round I didn’t directly confronted him when he won he grabbed my hand and placed it on his penis, then proceeded to grab my chest, I still didn’t say a word and I hate the fact that I didn’t and just nodded away when he asked me to stand up I did, and I followed him to the practice room where it was only the two of and he proceeded to grab me more, at this point I should’ve probably done something, nope I didn’t.

He tried to kiss me, i’ve never kissed anyone before, I just stayed hard as a rock, then we heard footsteps, and that seemed like the only way I could get out of the situation(i’m half Thai half French, I live in thailand but there’s a huge language barrier because thai doesn’t have that many options on words that could express my feelings more and other words that would help people understand as when I say “I feel discriminated because of my___”) and then he asked me to be in a relationship with him in which I FUCKING HATE MYSELF ANOTHER TIME I COULD LITERALLY JUMP OF A BRIDGE FOR NODDINGGGGGGGGG.

Whenever I am with him he just touches me, no nothing, i’m not sure what to do, I want to break it off but don’t know what words I should use, I feel like he’s just using my body and my innocence anyways and if only a new girl who was innocent, young, cute and had a nice body came maybe that would make him leave me, but i’m not about to wait that long cause that’d be stupid, Maybe I do like him but he’s going way to fast or i’m going way too slow but I still don’t know how to break it to him, or maybe I should’ve actually yeah I should’ve just told him in the first place but my insecurities and the fact that someone is eager about me got the best of me and now i’m stuck in some relationship I don’t want to be in, I have no lucks with confrontation especially when there’s a language barrier but I need to do this, the play is today Saturday 21st December, I need some advice, I mean is it even okay to break it off with someone after 1 day?!

361,"This may be a long one.

A few years ago I had been going through a lot but I will cut to the main issue.

I had a falling out with a childhood friend during a bad time in my life. Social media was my outlet and a lot of things were said there. Not too long after, this person had 3 of their friends (who I had never met) begin attacking me online for anything and everything they could. As hurt people do, I felt the need to reciprocate. This went on for about a year. My friend and 3 of their other friends I had never met airing out my dirty secrets my friend had told them, bashing my body, running their mouths about my relationship and s/o. 

All of these people lived 1000+ miles away from me. These people said far worse things about me than I had but one of them decided to take it too far and not only try to get me kicked out of college, but they tried to ruin my s/o's career.

Flash forward to now: I have deleted all but one social medias and have left it alone but every once in a while they still bring me up on their twitter accounts. I had a falling out with my roommates and feared for my safety for multiple reasons (one was selling drugs out of the house) so I ended up moving out instead of feeding the fights they kept trying to start with me. 

Now my ex-roommates are internet friends with all of the people who bashed me online and tried to ruin my career. They talk shit about me, my current online job, make up lies about my living habits, and made fun of my s/o (who my roommates had only met once in a year) with my ex-friend and these people I have never once met in my life. I had never trashed talked my roommates on social media because I had gotten rid of it before we had a falling out.

I feel guilty for things I had said online and I feel as though if I didn't vent to twitter about my falling out with my initial friend, none of this would have happened and I wouldn't feel guilty even though most of the harassment came from their end.

Do I apologize to the strangers for fucked up things I had said online or do I just move on with my life?

I'm afraid apologizing will not do anything and it will just encourage them to start running their mouths about me more even though it's been over a year since I shut my mouth.

I'm still being stalked by ghost accounts on my art page, and being sent rude private messages by these ghost pages bashing my lifestyle, art, personal relationships, and my body even though I have completely stopped running my mouth and I barely post any information about my private life online anymore.

I did not get any of my friends involved so it has come to 6 people coming together online to bash me while it was just me basically trying to defend myself in the wrong ways.

Should I apologize to the individuals I have never met to get it off of my chest in preparation to start the decade fresh or should I just live with this guilt and fear that my social media past will ruin my career?

They treat social media like a competition while the only thing I ever post anymore is my art that relates to my life.

366,"I (21M) was born in a Muslim country where my parents grew up. We migrated to Australia when I was 10 years old and I could hardly speak any English at the time. Integrating into primary school and highschool was really tough for me because of vast differences in culture. Due to these differences, I was often bullied at school. I felt conflicted between trying to find my place among my western peers while also adhering to the strict upbringing of Islam. For example, when my friends started drinking alcohol I wanted to join in because I thought it would make me cool (lame I know) but drinking is strictly forbidden in Islam. Eventually I caved and I began living a double life: faithful Muslim around my parents but living a “western” lifestyle around my friends. 

Over the years this became really difficult and I started trying to explain to my parents the way I wanted to live, but every time I brought it up they would shut me down ruthlessly, tell me I was no good and even once kicked me out for a night in the cold because I was dating some girl (they let me back in the next day but wanted teach me a “lesson”). I genuinely slept on the porch that night with temperatures near 0C/32F. 

I’ve moved out recently and my relationship with my parents began to improve. We love each other more and can talk about things. But my mum recently found out I drink alcohol and she has flat out refused to talk to me, to the point where I can’t visit her, call her or even text her. She’s gone so far as to say she wishes I wasn’t her son. What do I do to fix this mess? I love my parents with all my heart but I’m just not the faithful Muslim son they want me to be.

367,"My bestfriend, my ex, my person.. 
Fucking asshole.
Let me give you a small snippet of this bullshit unless it's not bullshit who fucking knows anymore.. 
Everytime I hit up this person- in a positive, civil, sometimes punk manner (because I play around too much, some people don't like that.. I get it so I adjust which I do with said person) it seems like no matter what I say he doesn't care. Doesn't care why I said it, how I said something, or what the things I'm saying actually means because he puts in effort to not hear what I'm saying. 

In life sometimes people just won't hear you, sometimes they won't listen or understand... I guess it's ""rare"" to find someone who actually understands.  

He used to hear me, he used to want to talk to me and get what I'm piecing together or what my joke is.. I've made myself a prisoner to him and he doesn't even want me around he says he wants to be friends and wants to have me in his life for the rest of it... but that's B.U.L.L.S.H.I.T. 
I don't get it, how can he say all these ""positive, uplifting, reassuring, kind.. whatever etc."" Things he puts on this act and I'm not new to the theater I see it everytime something starts.. but I let it play through thinking the movie will be different. 
I don't get why I hold on, yeah we both are different people. Yeah we aren't made for each other (never made for someone else. That's ridiculous if you think that but do you not my say) We're supposed to be there for each other, we're supposed to care for each other even if we're not dating. 
I hate that no one fucking listens and he actually tried but I'm such a fuck up that it's ruined forever. 
Yeah it wasn't the top of the line perfect relationship but that's my bestfriend that's my buddy and he doesn't want anything to do with me even if I'm just asking how his day was.. or what he thinks about this idea or this thought or asking him questions about whatever. Just fucking whatever. It's lost and I can't let it go. 
I hate myself more and more each day because of this. 
I'm emotionally latched onto some idea, or some time period that I had someone that somewhat genuinely..? Wanted me around, wanted to talk for hours or just lay and watch a movie and not say a word holding the other tight because I couldn't hear his heart.


A lot of words have been said that ""everyone is looking for the perfect someone but no one is trying to be that perfect someone""

But how in the world am I supposed to find anything if I'm so blind, if I can't tell what's in front of me. If I think hey things could be like this. How the fuck am I supposed to go about this world if I can't move past this idiotic crazy relationship/now friendship..
 ""Friendship"" it's a fake ship, he's a good actor and I'm a terrible audience.. I ask too many questions because I want all the detail so I understand it greater than you are visualizing it. That I can see it with my own eyes instead of saying wow that's a pretty cool idea/thought. I don't wait for my turn to speak I hear you when you did speak and you act like i didn't say a word. So worthless, it's bullshit. It hurts. 
You're a dictator to my interactions and I have to let you or you'll cut me. 
Forcing you to hear what I actual said instead of what you heard.

I waste my time on this.. it's basically talking to a dead bird.

372,"Hello guys, I’m a workaholic, and every time I get days off I spend my time playing video games since it is what I like to do, and I make sure to stay in shape to be able to keep up with my job. I do have my thoughts of sometimes being lonely, not talking about my family or the friends that sometimes I hang out with, but I want someone in my life that’s with me together. I’ve never been in a relationship, and it comes to my mind a lot every time I have days off from work. I have everything I have ever wanted since I was a kid. I always thought about being financially stable, and I have achieved it. money is never been an issue for me, just the loneliness. I just feel empty a lot, my friends and family don’t really bring closure to my loneliness. Sorry, going straight to the point. I’ve been on a dating app called Okcupid, and I’ve had people like me on the app. Though I just feel as though I can’t mustered the courage in talking to any of them. I just don’t know how to flirt or start a friendship with any of them. I just want my life to change, though I don’t understand why I can’t be confident to talking to anyone in that app. I’m only 20 years old, my work seems to be going in the right direction, and my life just feels dull. What can I do to maybe understand to stirred away from this life I currently live? Sorry if this isn’t the appropriate subreddit to post this &gt;_&gt; (and if you’re wondering if I’m suicidal, I’m not. That’s something I don’t ever want to think about since I’m living a life I’m not struggling and I know people have it worse than I do, I just want to keep going with life with someone I want to travel the world with and enjoy the little things..)",21Dec2019,1
373,"My life is currently a mess. Everything was going amazing. I had a loving girlfriend, I was friends with everyone, and I was pretty much living a dream. However one night, my girlfriend texted me, that she doesn't feel like there's any chemistry between us anymore, and that she loves me, but the entire relationship seems pointless to her. I love her to bits, so this was as expected, a huge hit to take in. Well... I wish it ended on that. My friends that were with me at the time, found out about the break up, and (without my knowledge) started to text her insults and threats. Now look, i never wanted sh#t like that happening. I love her too much, to make her uncomfortable and unhappy by being with me, so even though my heart was shredded, I let her go. But because of my friends, she now thinks I made them insult and threat her. She told her friends, and because she's quite popular, pretty much the entirety of our school thinks I'm some psycho, and they hate me. Christmas break just started, and I've been thinking about letting everything go, and changing schools, since I don't think I'll be able to look at her without breaking down. Because of my plans, all my remaining friends are extremely mad at me, for wanting to leave. Also another problem is, that I'm the head of the school student counsil, so leaving would make a lot of trouble for the entire school. Also, my current school is 2 minutes away from my house, and in order to get to any other, I'd have to catch the bus.

 So in summary: I'm extremely heartbroken, my girlfriend and her friends hate me, my own friends hate me, getting to any other school would be a mess, and I'm just really alone and scared.

Should I just grit my teeth, pretend that everything is okay, and try to pull through the year? (the last one in this school) Or maybe let it go now, and let literally everyone hate me, just to find a little bit of inner peace? I really hope someone can help me with all this, since I just feel more tired and depressed everyday, and I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind. Cheers",21Dec2019,1

383,"Yesterday I was in the train, returning home from my university for the holidays and I was with a colleague of mine, we started chatting a bit since we had a mutual sympathy.

He's athletic and has an high pitched almost cute voice. 
I, just like him, had always feeling just for girls but there's a key difference, I wouldn't mind the occasional wank with other guys (while not interested in other practices) and before spending that time on the train I kinda thought that he liked me and it strangely felt good…?

I mean, the concept of being liked by a person with a lot of girls that drool over them made me feel good despite my long history of a shaky and unimaginably low self esteem. Unlike him I passed my entire teenage years hiding behind my fear of being judged by everyone especially for my gynaecomastia, being closed in a cage created by my own mind and made out of my own flesh; knowing that he had such a great plethora of girls that chase after him made me almost feel envious and kinda angry

So, without any reason he started talking about his ex girlfriend that left him like a year ago and now she invited him to her birthday, the fact that he likes his colleague and I talked him about one of my crushes which moved out and now I don't get to see her too often, and the fact that I seem to hit just on foreign girls, I didn't talk about, you know, the wank thing.

Then he told me about an incident he had and said that's a thing that he says just to people really close to him, so most of the people in his class don't know that and also seemed to have taken the occasion to make contact with me (?) Like you could show the part in which you had the incident using yourself, right? 

The thing is… when I got home I felt really bad, I don't want to say depressed or other edgy sh*t like that but I didn't feel like talking with my friends or playing with my younger brother I just felt sad, all I wanted to do was hear music and sit by the radiator, I didn't even had lunch",21Dec2019,1
384,"A little background to why I am asking for advice on what I should do...

Christmas is around the corner and I get a call from my aunt (mom's side) asking if how long I'm going to be home for Christmas. I told her I won't be attending Christmas dinner but would love to see her when my grandparents (mom's side) weren't there. She knew what had happened and is in full support of my choice and don't blame me for not wanting to attend.

If you're wondering why I've decided to not to interact with my grandparents until they apologize, to my mom (not, even me because I know they'll never admit they're wrong to a ""child""), here we go...

I make plenty of choices and some of those end up being big mistakes, not unheard-of. I had unprotected sex with someone who had HSV1, (claimed he didn't know and turn it back on me, that's another story though) and gave it to me. My test results got mailed to my grandparent's house because I have fantastic luck. They texted me and asked me what they should do with my mail. I asked them to just shred and toss them since I can access all my medical information online, not realizing that letter had the test results and assumed it was a bill. They decided to open my mail and proceeded to call my mom to scream at her, calling her a bad mother, me a whore, that no man is ever going to want me now and made it sound like I had AIDS (not shitting on anyone who have it but just comparing the severity of both diagnosis). My grandparents didn't tell my mom was wrong with me but just hinted at it so they might as well have. 

Here I am sitting in the other room and my mom hangs up and confronts and demands to know what is going on. I had just found out my diagnosis a few days prior and was having trouble sinking into the fact that I now have an incurable disease for the rest of my life. I haven't told anyone yet besides the person who gave it to me because I don't know how to tell people in my life that I made the biggest mistake in my life and have to live with it forever. I was ashamed and embarrassed. 

My grandparents not only disregarded my request to not open my mail and to throw it away, they decided to treat me like a child and not speak to me directly about this matter but go to my mom, who is the rock in my life and berate her for my mistake. It was a serious invasion of privacy and it tested my mom and I's relationship.

I realize that my mistakes not only impacts me but others around me as well. I had hoped to confide in someone before telling my mom about my diagnosis and assure her with what facts about HSV1 that I in fact do not have AIDS and can live a happy, healthy and normal life. Instead, I had to tell my mom at that moment and she broke down in tears, I have never seen my mom so broken and for that I can never forgive myself for my mistake and blame my grandparents for the ordeal. 

My mom and I are now closer than ever. After I had calmed her down, sat down with her and giving her all the information I have on HSV1 and actually took and with me to see my doctor and reassured her that I will be okay. She knows I made a mistake, I know I did but I can't changed what has happened and I have accepted my fate and come to terms with it. She's my biggest supporter especially when I have tough days where I hear the voice in the back if my mind telling me that I will be alone forever. My grandparent's ignorance to what HSV1 actually is and the judgment they put on me was uncalled for and it'll forever be remembered. I just wish that someday they learn the facts before they go running their mouth about anything to people and mind their damn business.

Anyways, I told my mom months in advance when the ordeal happened that I won't be there for Christmas , she understands my choice but doesn't exactly support it and said, ""you know that's how your grandparents are and you just have to let go."" Is it normal of me to not ""let go"" with what my grandparents did, the way they invaded my privacy, disrespected my mom and I and for the way they talked to my mom? Should I suck it up and go to Christmas dinner? (I'm still going home for Christmas to be with my mom and going to lunch with the rest of the family w/o my grandparents.)",21Dec2019,1
385,"1) MOVING
I live in a big city, where I grew up and spent most of my 25 years. I am now moving to a small city on the east coast. I feel like maybe I’m being an idiot because I’m gonna be significantly broker there even though the CoL is lower, because I will be paying rent and making less money than I do now (wages are higher here). Currently living with a hoarder relative. I’m moving there to live with a friend and just be independent. The past few years I’ve been kind of a recluse because of mental health issues and also lack of money, so I’m ready to reenter society. 

I thought I hated this city, but actually it’s got a lot going on and even though it’s expensive, people who aren’t poor have a great time here. I can live here on the cheap, and because of my rent free lifestyle, I can go eat out or go to shows or whatever. I’m worried about going to a po-dunk town when the problem was me all along.

Tl;dr am I an idiot for moving to a small city where I’ll be broke and not get to experience life? Or am I making the right move for my development? 

2) CAREER PATH
I am a lazy motherfucker who doesn’t like to work. I decided to become a massage therapist and craniosacral therapist (this is not an invitation to discuss the efficacy of CST!) because they make good hourly (like 80$ an hour, or more). That way I don’t have to work that many hours and can still make a good living, like 70k a year for 15 or so sessions a week. 

I also like the work, and feel I am making a difference in people’s lives. It’s manual and creative so it’s not onerous to me. Plus I get so much freedom with being self employed and tax write offs. I have about a year left till I get my license.

HOWEVER 
The downside of this type of therapy-esque work is I like to travel. I want to travel and experience different things in my life. But practice based work requires you to be consistent, reliable, and available to people. 

Also if I want to relocate it takes a long time to build up a client base. It’s not as easy as taking a position in a new city and having a full salary straight off the bat.

Am I shooting myself in the foot here?",21Dec2019,1
386,"My brother has more of a calm nature, however, he has deep psychological issues.

He has had depressive episodes in the past and he obsesses over things (idk why). 

The thing is that he is recently obsessed over marijuana and driving. Whenever he takes my dad’s car, he disappears for hours and drives it while high.

So it is comprehensive that my dad doesn’t want to give his car to him since he is aware that he drives it while high. However, monsieur everyone owes me something pressures us psychologically if my dad doesn’t give him his car.

He is threatening to beat us up constantly, especially my 26 years old sister. He constantly tells her to be careful with her words or he’ll disfigure her. I admit that my sister is a bit mean but he is the one who is out of control.

My sister (26) and him (20) got into an argument today for my dad’s car and I intervened. He has been threatening my sister more than me but I somehow was the one who ended up being dragged down by him.

I admit that I went psycho mode on him, I started screaming at him, telling him to leave us alone so he throw a shoe at me and I threw the shoe back at him and went physical with him but since he is a male and he is stronger, I got easily dragged down but I continued yelling at him. 

Once we stopped being physical, I told him that I will never talk to him again and that I will block him on all social media and so I did. He then asked me : « Why did you intervene ? My problem wasn’t with you. » 
It is true that we rarely have any problems with each other because I am the family member who supports him the most. I’ve found him a psychiatrist and i’ve always stand close to him through his emotional issues.
He then told me that he is sorry but that he is really angry recently and I told him that I don’t care whether he is sorry or not. I am never talking to you again so he then threw his cigarette on me.

394,"Hey, guys.
I'm 20 years old and it's nothing special that I really enjoy video games. However, I've been battling depression for a looong time and video games were always one of the few ways to escape my everyday life, to clear my head for a bit. Probably the only way that brought no harm to myself.
I've made friends because of video games, great friends who are still friends with me after 5 years.
Overall, as sad as it may sound, video games bring me the most joy in life.
That's why, for a while now, I've been thinking about getting something tattooed from one of my favorite games. Something that reminds me of good things I had in bad times.
However, I have a few concerns about it, ranked in importance, going from most to least important.

1. Will I regret it? In 2, 5, 10, 20 years, will I look at it and think ""what a stupid kid I was""? Even though I have changed a lot throughout the last couple years, I've been wanting such a tattoo the whole time. I think it first came to my mind when I was about 16. It's hard to predict in which way my state of mind will change over the next few years.

2. My parents. My parents love me and are very supportive, but they never understood what video games meant to me. They see it as a bad thing overall. My sister spending 2-3 hours each day swimming is fine, my brother spending multiple hours cooking himself a great meal every evening is fine, my dad spending hours each day in the garden, caring for the plants is fine, but me playing video games for a couple hours each day is not. When I do that, I am addicted and should stop. They don't understand that it's just a hobby, like anything else. I would understand their point if either I neglected other things for it, which I don't, or if I had an unhealthy lifestyle because of it, which I don't. I don't have an unhealthy bodytype, I go outside everyday, I am doing not too bad in college.
They don't think it's okay just because it's video games. Now if I was to get a tattoo about one of the games, I'm pretty sure it would only reassure their concerns.
I can already hear my father say some stupid shit.

3. The pain. I can NOT handle pain. Really can't. Call me weak or a pussy or whatever, but for some reason, I am irrationally scared of most sorts of pain. If I got a tattoo, it'd go somewhere on my forearm or wrist. I have no idea how bad the pain is.

Can someone with maybe a similar story give me some advice?
I honestly don't think I'll change my mind about this, but maybe someone here thought the same once and it turned out to be wrong.
How do I explain to my parents what all this means to me? I've tried countless times.
How bad is the pain?

Thank you in advance :)",21Dec2019,1

399,"Hello!

My husband and I have been together for 10 years (married for 3) and have a toddler together. 

When we were 21, we moved into a house that his parents own next door to them. The house is beautiful, but small.

His parents are control freaks. We expressed an interest in buying the house from them and remodeling it, but they refuse to sell it to us for a price we can afford. Their reasoning is “we will leave the house to you when we die one day.” My husband and I want to be homeowners now. We have a kid now and want another soon and we want to own our own house, especially if we invest money in it to expand it. 

My in-laws also are not helpful at all with our child. They can never babysit (already booked up as full time caregivers for our nieces and nephews) and we sometimes go weeks without seeing or hearing from them. My husbands siblings ALL live within walking distance from us and they aren’t super close and we don’t see them much. His parents just like the idea of having all of their adult kids living in the same area.

My family lives out of state (over an hour away) and I am an only child with plenty of support from my parents and extended family yet I don’t see them much because of the long drive and my husband’s work schedule (I am a stay at home mom).

Husband and I agreed to buy our own house but we cannot afford any of the homes in our area that meet our size requirements (at least 2,000 sq feet, 3 bedroom, and a home office space for husband). We live near a major city so the prices are ridiculous. 

It so happens that the prices in the state my family lives are very affordable and we can buy an even bigger house for less than our budget. We’d only be just over the border so my husband won’t be driving more than 40 minutes each way.

We told my husband’s parents our plans and they flipped out. They said we are making a huge mistake, they said my husbands work will suffer, they said we are going to alienate our child from them (not true since we are next door and they don’t have time to see him anyways), they said I don’t need help and should handle being a full time mom/homemaker on my own, and they said we don’t need a bigger house and we can make it work by bunking up and making our tv room our bedroom! And I should add his family is well off and sort of snobby and they would never do the things they suggested. 

Being close to my mom and family means I can finally have available babysitters who I trust and just have family around to be with. I feel very alone living here away from them. My family is very close.

Since then, they’ve cooled down and seem to accept it, but it still hurts my husband that he feels like he is going against their wishes.

We found a house that has a lot of potential and we are considering buying it. My husband seems excited but I know he cares about what his parents think. They can be petty at times and they gossip a lot, so I know he worries they’ll badmouth him to the rest of his family. 

My issue is, how do I know or make sure my husband doesn’t end up resenting me? He loves his parents and siblings of course but like I said, they aren’t super close and we never hang out with them (we all have kids the same age too). 

We have a great marriage and relationship but I’m worried this will ruin it. Am I being selfish?",21Dec2019,1

404,"I  got hired as an assistant for a small company about 3-4 months ago.

405,"My friend was a 19 year old transgender female. Her parents were never supportive, they have a history of kicking her out of the house, forbidding her to dress the way she wants or going on dates with boys. 
Her family never accepted her and that (among other less significant reasons) eventually drove her into committing suicide.
She had posted a kind of suicide note on her WhatsApp story right before but by the time we had driven to her house her parents had already called police and everything. 
Her story said that she still believes her parents are good people and that of they really love her, they won't put her birth name on her grave but her chosen name (she chose a name that is very close to her assigned name, i. e. Robert - Robin) 
We've all talked to her parents since (they got the same note in more detail) but they insist on putting Robert on the grave stone. My friend came out when she was 15. I understand that it's not easy for the parents to understand what she was going through and that they had doubts at first, saying it's not a phase. But it's been years. And it's her very last wish. She wanted nothing other than to be accepted as a woman and even now her parents won't respect her. 
I know its ""just a name"" but I don't feel right letting her parents put that on the grave. Our friends have offered to pay for the gravestone ourselves so that we can put on it what we want, but the parents said then we have to pay for the entire funeral, which we can't afford (they've already arranged most of it)

406,"Hello

  


So I have never had any big celebrations during Christmas or New Year's but I usually have had friends around with whom I used to hang out.

  


This time, however, I don't have any friends around in the city and I would like some suggestions on how I should spend celebrating New Year. Anything simple actually. I just don't want to spend the whole day in my bed, or working.",21Dec2019,1
410,"This is going to be a veeeery long one. Sorry for that.

I (f|18) have always been on the heavier body spectrum. It's also kind of hard for me to lose weight, but I'm really trying. For the past year or so I have tried to reduce my calorie intake by not eating as much sweet stuff anymore. I've been feeling alot better since I started that. 

Now the problem that occurred is my grandma. Don't get me wrong, I love her dearly and also visit her twice a week because she's all alone. 

The problem is that my grandma is used to feeding me all kinds of stuff. She cooks very fatty (she often makes pasta and throws huge chunks of butter in there, so that the noodles are basically swimming in fat) and since I've seen her cooking like that, it really disgusts me to the point where I try to not eat at her place at all to avoid having to eat her fatty meals. 

It's also like that with the sugary stuff. She has a huge shelf of chocolate and gummy bears exclusively for me! There's stuff in there that hasn't been touched in five years because I wouldn't eat it. She buys more and more when I've repeatedly told her to stop because I won't eat it.

Everytime I'm at her place she asks me if I want some snack, I deny and she acts all sad and says: ""You never want to eat anything nice anymore."" I don't know if her emotions are genuine or if she just pretends, but she seems to get really sad over this and I, ffs, don't know why this is such a big deal.

Sometimes she even demonstratively brings a few packs of cookies or chocolate to the living room and places them in front of me. 
I used to eat a lot of candy when I was younger (probably one reason why I'm still fighting with my weight today plus the genetics thing. I'm not morbidly obese but still have a belly and I'm not happy with how I look), and that makes it even harder to resist it. When there's nothing to snack on, then I won't eat anything, but the fact that she places the sugar straight in front of me makes me angry and sad.

Also, when it comes to Christmas gifts (the reason why I'm posting this right now) she's not different. I have repeatedly asked her that if she wants to gift me candy, she should get me one package of chocolate or something. One package. 

She gave me my Christmas present yesterday and there were eight different pieces of candy including a huge ass Toblerone bar and a 400 grams chocolate bar in the bag. All in all, it was about two to three kilograms of chocolate. I almost started crying when I saw this. 

Whenever I tell her not to get me any candy, she acts like she didn't hear me. When she goes grocery shopping, she always asks me if I want anything, and I always say no. She still brings stuff all the time. 

I have already talked to her about it, but nothing has changed. What should I do?


Tl;dr

My grandma ignores my weight losing plan and refuses to stop feeding me candy. I have told her about this, she won't listen. She gifted me two kilograms of chocolate for Christmas.",21Dec2019,1
411,"I'm really going to try and keep this as short and concise as possible. 

First, a little context. I'm a 35 year old male. Thanks to a really neat attempted murder from my biological father as an infant, my parents divorced when I was pretty young(permanent brain damage, fun stuff. Different story for a different post).  I was raised by my mother and eventually my step-father(SF1) from around age 6 to 18. I currently have a different step-father(SF2), and SF1 has been long since been excommunicated from the family(Mom, step-brothers, myself, etc.). I think I've had maybe two interactions with SF1 in the last decade.

 So, why do I feel like I'm slowly morphing into the guy? He was an abusive, sniveling little worm that somehow went unchecked in our family for ~17 years. I find myself adopting his mannerisms as an adult, I hear his voice echo in the back of my head every time I give generic responses during small talk.

^Does ^that ^even ^make ^any ^sense?  ^Like, ^I ^feel ^like ^I'm ^subconsciously ^channeling ^him ^in ^social ^situations.

Anyways, it urks me to no end. Fortunately, I'm not a total shitbag and haven't adopted any of his abusive tendencies or his manipulative nature. Why do I default to the behavior and mannerisms of a guy I've barely spoken to in the last 20ish years?",21Dec2019,1
412," So at the moment I'm in a bit of a conundrum. I graduated from high school a month ago, and I'm getting pressure left, right and centre about what I'm doing next year. I dropped the opportunity to be a part of the ADF gap year program because I felt like it wasn't the right time or thing for me, as I was in the completely wrong mindset. I currently hold one job, which is a dishwasher at a pub in my town. I'm only getting one shift a week, and as an 18 year old, I'm a pretty expensive dishwasher, so the likelihood of picking up more shifts pretty low. Many people have told me to gain my RSA and move into the front of the pub, as I already work there, and would be just about guaranteed a position. Though I had to think about this a lot, and after working this job after finishing school, I am seeing the impact it is having on me. As the job is at night time, I am having to fill a full day, and then go off to work, absolutely exhausted. Whereas, working a daytime job, I obviously wouldn't have to fill my days full of activities because I'd be working. Once I move in with my girlfriend, it will make things a lot easier between us, because we will both be home at the same times. I have actively been trying to pursue a Monday to Friday, 9-5 type job, with no luck so far. I am slowly running out of money (partially because it is Christmas time), and one of my options, which I will most likely take, is to apply for Centrelink payments.

This has been weighing on me for a bit now, and I have absolutely no clue what to do, and I need some help and advice.",21Dec2019,1
413,"TL;DR - poor health, crappy job, depression, lack of time - make it impossible for me to live a good healthy life. I also need a better job, but have absolutely no time to apply to new jobs/ refine my CV. So I am thinking of taking a few weeks off for myself. But I am concerned that being out of job will reflect poorly in my future interviews, and will interfere in getting a desirable job. 


Details- I saw a doctor today and had some tests done. I am in very poor health- PCOD, borderline diabetes, hypertension, vitamin deficiencies, weak bones, back pain, constant pain in legs and knees, BMI over 30. I was diagnosed with severe depression earlier this year. I am 30. 

I work a job that pays very poorly and is below my qualifications, but I took it because I desperately needed a job at that time. Commute takes at least 3 hours (to and from) daily, sometimes more. 54 hours work week, sometimes overtime, no lunch breaks, Saturdays working) and under-staffed department, and increasing workload everyday. Most of my work is time sensitive, so I am in constant stress. I have two reporting managers that give me completely different work and that too with short deadlines, so I’m performing poorly, and almost all my work is incomplete as of today. I sometimes bring my work at home but it still doesn’t get completed. I am sleeping late and lethargic during the day. 

This job is not aligned with my career goals and I doubt that the experience will be considered relevant in my desired roles. I wish to remain in the same industry but in a different role. But poor health and lack of time make it difficult for me to apply to new jobs. I am barely getting by in my day to day basic tasks, like showering and maintaining a clean house, and only eat junk food, hence the poor health, no time to take care of health and new career. 

I am wondering should I just resign? Take a few weeks / months to get my life together, get my health in order, develop a good lifestyle that I can sustain. Also, in their time, do some relevant certifications for my desired roles, meet people, learn how to go about it, and keep applying to those roles. 

My ONLY concern is- will it be difficult to land a job if I am not working? I have been told that it’s easier to get a job while you have a job. But my current situation is not so conducive to getting a job. And will I get a good reference if I leave my work here incomplete? I have been trying to get things under control but they keep slipping away. 

Alternatively, if someone can advice as to how can I take care of my health and my career while staying in this job, I will be grateful.",21Dec2019,1

416,"I was running late to a meeting as I had to pick up a friend/colleague and was one of the last to enter. A male colleague, Jason (not his real name) who regularly says harsh things to me (as a way of flirting through teasing and banter?) but also compliments me sometimes, spotted me as he was standing with his friends. I had tried to make an effort that day as I was meeting family afterwards and put on a new floral skirt and crop tank I had bought from a store popular for people my age. 


However, I quickly became less confident in my choice of outfit when he yelled out, ""that skirt looks disgusting!"" at me (luckily others were absorbed in conversation but his friends looked shocked and half laughed. I assume it was probably a joke to follow on from his 'harsh remarks' and was probably not serious at all but it seemed an odd thing to say and I felt targetted.


Did I take it too personally and was it meant to be 'flirty' and does it indicate that he likes me/has feelings for me? 


Also, on the way out from the meeting he threw a pair of his spare bundled up socks at me and hit me in the back of the leg and smiled at me.

417,"So I moved to the LA area in October. I don’t really know anyone down here and no one except family knows where I live. Yesterday I took my car to target and then came home. When I got home my dad’s ex girlfriend was at my place to take me to lunch. Just so we know it’s not here everything with my dad ended on good terms and she’s absolutely amazing and sweet and is kind of watching after me here and acting as family. Anyway, I pulled up next to her and said I was going to park my car. I parked it, we went to lunch, I drank a beer and lunch and was extremely tired when I got home around 1:00 so I slept until 9, woke up to smoke weed and watch tv and then fell back asleep around 1am. 

Here’s where is gets weird. When I woke up this morning I had to go get something before work. My apartment has a back alley that leads to the garages. When I went into the alley my car was just sitting there. The driver’s seat was adjusted and the light was on inside. My parents told me to call the cops and report it had been stolen and then returned. 

Theories I have/parents have: 

A. Someone was able to use my really well hidden hide a key and take it out of the garage which opens from the inside on a sensor but couldn’t get it back in because they didn’t have a key fob for the garage. This would mean they don’t live here or are a young teen who doesn’t have a fob. 

B. Maybe I slept walked in an extremely intense way and was able to do this without and damage to my car or myself. This is scary because that is really dangerous. 

The cops theory: 

I have a stalker. Because the week before I left my greasy work shoes underneath my car and someone stole them. I also have found the empty apartment underneath me open during the night. 

The neighbor who use to live there was back last week and said he’d “missed the place”. He was hanging out in the alley at night smoking. My other neighbor told me he was seeing someone in the complex so that’s why he was back and I shouldn’t be worried. 

They asked about anyone who would stalk me. The only person who comes to mine is my ex who would show up unannounced when we lived in the same town. I think he showed up to be manipulative and sleep with me but he never entered without my permission and honestly isn’t the type of person to be violent. 



I think what fucks with me the most is that they didn’t take anything or damage anything. We’ve installed a camera by the cars to see what’s going on and it alerts the neighbor and I when it senses motion. He’s a dad who had an extra baby monitor camera.

What do you think is going on? What are your theories? Because I’m at a loss right now. I’m so confused about this.",21Dec2019,1

421,"Hey together,

I fear this will be a bit longer but I need to write this down somewhere and if I get some advice out of it, all the better.

I hate my \[F18\] familys situation at the moment. I live with my parents \[F53\]\[M62\] and my grandmother \[F79\] in one house but three flats. I love all three of them and I generally had a pretty great childhood, but recently it all started going downhill. 

My dad has been morbidly obese for as long as I can remember, physically he is probably closer to being 80 than 60. My mom is decently fit but has been sick pretty much the entire year, most likely due to stress because she has to shoulder pretty much the entire household (I try to help when I can but I'm a university student, so my time isn't unlimited). On top of that is the problem that my parents work on their own (don't know the english term), which means they've got no chance to take of sick time (because that means to income) or to slack at all, and they most likely will never get a pension when they eventually retire (which means I'll have to care for them financially). Since my dad can hardly move or work for a longer time my mom does much more than half the work here. My dad also has a horrible, horrible work ethic and delays whenever he can, which led to multiple problems with projects they had and led to tax fees for doing them too late. Still, the financial situation is decently stable currently, I just worry about the future when they can't work anymore (and honestly, they should stop soon, because they are too old and too sick for the work their job requires.). 

Then the next point, how my parents combat the stress they face in their job life. They don't. My father has no hobbies and no friends and pretty much never leaves the house. My mother recently fulfilled her lifelong dream of owning a horse, but as it turns out it's expensive as fuck, she can't actually ride it because it's not well trained and she's made various really bad experiences with 'friends' from her stables. Oh, and the horse is sick regularily, which means she has to spend half her time in the stable, in freezing cold weather. Not good for her health, doesn't relieve stress but adds to it and since she is the main source of income that is lacking as well as she spends half her days not working. And the year long sickness might turn out to be something more sever than expected (we won't know until after the holidays).

Oh, and I don't think my parents love or even like each other. They coexist, but at least once a day there's a fight, the topic can be mundane or serious. Half the time it leads to my dad throwing/breaking something as well - he's got anger issues.

Then there's my grandma. She seperated from my (now dead) grandfather, so she lives alone, but in a flat above ours. She's barely able to move anymore so we have to take care of all her errands, we clean and cook for her and take her to places she needs to be (doctors mostly). I always thought she was decently happy, but she confessed today that the second I move out she moves to a retirement home (with what money I don't know) as she hates our living situation, the constant fighting, she feels lonely (we see each other daily, but I get her regardless, she doesn't really have friends either and her relatives/siblings are either far away or seriously sick or even dead) and she hates how unclean our house and yard are - they are, honestly, even I am somewhat bothered by it, but none of us have the time to take care of this and especially my dad is an absolute slob. Again, I try to help, but our space is so damn big that I have no clue how to keep up - I cleaned every part of the house in summer, it took weeks of about 6 hours cleaning a day and it already looks like it did before. 

I'm at an absolute loss. There is always tension in the air, no one is even remotely happy and our house looks bad to the point that I only allow visitors in my own room, because I can at least make sure that that's clean. Now it looks like my mom might be seriously sick, which will make the situation all the worse. 

I enjoy every moment I spend outside the house, I try to often meet friends because it helps me forget how miserable my home life is and the rest of the time I study because I very much need to finish uni as quickly as possible so I can start working and contribute to the budget. But I feel so guilty because I don't spend much time with my relatives, but honestly, I don't even want to. We have nothing to talk about. I know that I might not have much time with them left, but I have legit no clue how to spend time with them that doesn't end in a fight. I know that they love me, but they are as overwhelmed as I am with the situation and none of us have good coping strategies. My mom and grandma eat up their frustration until they break at some point and my father and I resort to screaming and crying. 

I love my parents and grandma but I hate living here and I hate that I know that they know and hate it as well. Spending time on myself is much easier and more pleasant but I feel extremly guilty when I do. I honestly don't know what kind of advice I need, but I needed to write this down. Thank you.",21Dec2019,1
422,"Sometimes (21F) I feel like my boyfriend (22M) neglects/ignores me so I talked to him about how I felt after he didn't reply to my messages for 20+ hours. I also was upset because we had stopped going on real dates, only hanging out in his room and going to Mcdonalds or eating other fast food and I was always the one asking to meet up with him. He understood where I was coming from, said that he's just been stressed with exams+the possibility of having to move back to his home country, and acknowledged that he knows he hasn't been speaking to me very much. He promised to change, and we did our best to have date nights at home because he is struggling with money right now by cooking, watching movies etc. 

So then, this week we hung out on 3 days and he said he wanted to do something together today (Saturday) however he ignored my message all day while being active on Instagram, even watching my stories. While I care a whole lot less this time around it still bothers me a little bit and I know I sound so clingy. I want to know how to stop being like this but also it is difficult for me to distinguish if he is really just busy/if this is normal or if this is a sign that he is losing interest in me. I just don't like when he ignores my messages, especially when they are asking a question.

425,"First, English is not my first language, so please be aware in advance. 

**Background** – I do most freelance work, so I have workhours flexibility, plus I am single. This is important later. 

**Problem -** My parents are starting to show signals of age, in particular my mother. I live about 120 km/75 miles from their city, and I am spending every weekend with them, to help the way I can. Problem is, they expect my weekend to start Friday after lunch and end Monday morning. Needless to say, this is starting to hurt my career and capacity to get clients. Plus, I don’t see my friends/potential network in months. 

I have two siblings, and they also help a lot. One of them works with my father and does the impossible to handle a small renting apartment they own, deal with tenants, eventual AirBnB, finding the best medicine deals… I value his work a lot. My sister, a lawyer, also helps the way she can. Problem is, both are married and have more traditional jobs. 

Now, my father and brother work in retail, and asked me to spend most December taking care of my mother so they can focus on the work. I lost a client but agreed. Now they recruited my SIL to help and she will start to leave their two kids for me to care (it’s vacation time in Brazil) together with my mother. 

Now, she is asking to spend a week next month at a relative’s house near a beach “since it can be my last time” and, even if she can’t move freely, it will be easy “since OP can be there to help me… if he wants.” Yeah, sure, mom. No pressure. After all ""unlike your brother and sister, you don't have a family...""

She wants me to sit by her when she’s on the bus if she gets on first. The other people on my bus (all the same age as me) say that I like her. I do, but they only think that because I talk and laugh with her. One night she texted me a friend of hers (as a joke) and said “I found a girlfriend for you, now date.” I replied with “Naw, I’m good”. She kept asking why and I kept saying that I was good. She then asked me if it was because I liked her because whenever she asks somebody on our bus they say I do even though when they ask me I say I don’t. She has this weird obsession with my hat and loves to wear it by going through my backpack and finding it. She’ll try to keep it away from me if I try to take it back and even went as far as to shove it down her pants so that it only touches her stomach so I couldn’t grab it. We have had this friendly competition to see who’s better with a senior in our class. Neither of us liked his girlfriend though and how he dyed his hair to look like hers.

434,"Hey Reddit.


I need advice. Long background story ahead, but felt it was needed for a full picture.

I am 28, father is 30. No children otherwise. I have zero child experience besides below.

My significant other does have a child, William. Without a word, the mother took William at 11 months old and left state after their break-up. He lost contact. At 3 years old, she took him for child support. He found out she lived in IL over 6 hours away. She never showed up to the court hearing. He was now paying child support on a kid he will not be able to meet. He did not pursue with the courts. At 7 years old, she finally started contacted him, go figure, it is because she needed something.

He would talk to his son about once every other month on the phone. He made plans to visit multiple times, but things would happen. She canceled, his car broke down, emergency that required his little bit of savings. It was a 7 hour drive. Not a cheap feat with an unreliable vehicle 

When we got together, the child was 9. S/o was upset he still has not been able to meet his son. I had the means and reliable vehicle to get there. He met his son for the second time in June of 2017. We met for a 3 day weekend. Couple months later, we picked him up for spring break and brought to Indiana. Take note...still a 7 hour drive (14 roundtrip) on our end with no effort from the mother.

I took up travel nursing and took a contract 30 minutes from where they lived over the summer of 2018. We had him every weekend, or a few days in the week. I think it was a fun summer for him. Or at least would like to think.

During that time, the mother's husband had left her (the one she fled to IL with when the boy was a baby).

At the end of my contract in August, we were going to have him for the last weekend. She dropped him off on a Friday. On Saturday, her now ex called us to state she was in jail. She and her new boyfriend forced entry? Into the home for belongings. We didn't know what to do. We were leaving for IN in 3 days...NC in a week for my next assignment. We did what we thought was best, not knowing what will happen with the mother in jail. We sought emergent custody. We filed in IN with a lawyer. She ended up getting out of jail about 2 weeks later. She agreed we should probably keep Will for the school year until she gets her feet back under her. We drove back to IL, to bring her to IN to meet the lawyer. She signed the new custody arrangement so we could get him in school.

So, we had emergent custody while we were going to North Carolina due to the mother going to jail, being homeless due to divorce, and she generally needed to get her life back togrther. The problem... the kid has ADHD, ADD, ODD. We never got his meds... he is a 4th grader with an education at a kindergarten level. Behavior of a first or second grade student.

He had his ups and downs with us. And I would imagine so! It was essentially a culture shock...his mother let him do anything, we, however, did not. The summer fun was over...school started.

The downs was anything to do with school work. In which, he would slam his head in the wall, or on the foor. Punch himself in the face, scream, throw tantrums. We caught him even torturing the cat. At school, he would pull posters off the wall, disrupt class, etc. He was suspended from school for a psych eval due to threatening to stab a kid. Mind you... he was in school for a whopping 2 weeks! This incident required a 48 hr ER hold for evaluation. He was released with a script for adderal. 

On his ups, he can be loving. He just wantwantwantwants. I would imagine that is from his poor upbringing though. He grew up at poverty level his entire life. I would imagine our lifestyle would have been a shellshock between the belongings and discipline. He never had anything at a stable, constant level.

Since his mother was released and cleared from jail, she told us she had her shittogether. After the psych incident, he wanted to go back to his mother. We jumped at it. So, I left my contract, and we drove from NC, back to IL. And left it at that.

In the time she had him  back(1 year). She moved twice a month at the least, couch surfing. Lived in a truck at one point. Stayed with an abusive (physically and mentally) boyfriend. When her resources were exhausted in IL. She came back to Indiana. She was here 1 month before we even knew. How did we find out? She told us because CPS became invloved. I guess the boyfriend beat the tar out of her in front of Will. CPS has been doing visits. Which, included our home as well since my significant other is his father. (No proof by the way. He was young/dumb and signed the birth certificate. The court refused paternity test at the time of child support order)

So. For the third time, the CPS worker met with us yesterday. She said things are going progressively downhill for the mother. Will was already 'suspended'from this school due to behavior. They got him into community mental health for medication. He continues to be a shit in school by being disruptive. The CPS worker is on the verge of removing him. She said she may have to open a CHINS case. But, uncertain if it will be in home, or out of home case. She had no food or clothes in the household, no car, no job... the cps lady has asked us multiple times if we would take him. There is no other family. The next option would be foster care. If foster care fails, he will be put in a group home.

I am at a loss. I am on a diversion at the moment because I b****slapped my brother in law for screaming at me, he called the police. Lesson learned, just lie tothe police. Another story. But I do not think CPS would approve of the home anyway due to that possibly.

But, if they did, all it takes is him to lie about something. The boy (now 11 by the way) is telling people my significant other is just a sperm donor, not his father. That we beat him. That I taught him to deep throat a hotdog (wtf?).

My guess is he is angry we gave him back, thus the comments. He was disciplined, not beat. Mainly involved nose in corners and running laps, because we found out ass whoopins...he just laughed at. We made him read a few pages in a book every night (within his reading level)or his multiplication table, a worksheet if no homework, and homework.

Due to misbehaviors, he was on a point reward system to earn his toys. 


We are morally conflicted. Do we attempt to wash our hands of it? Or try again and live life potentially miserable with this kid? Or, potentially pull this kid out of the miserable path he is forming .",21Dec2019,1

438,"(Sorry for grammatical errors. English is not my first language. This is also my first post! :D). Ever since I graduated junior high school, my parents forced me to take a business course during my senior since ""they know"" that other courses earn less and I have no future in others (this one got me the most because I knew I was skilled in other fields but they made me believe that I had more potential in business). I knew they were wrong and biased but they were both former CEO's so I believed them. I was okay with it but before I started college, I noticed that out of all my siblings (I'm the eldest), I'm the only one they are forcing to take the business. My other siblings chose what they are passionate about and my parents were supportive of them. I told a sibling my situation and she too has noticed. I just brushed it off and at first, I was enjoying college since new people and new experiences but as the semester went by, I've seen myself just doing everything without passion and with the only purpose of ""I just need to graduate.""  I did my best for this semester though so I can acquire for a discount in my tuition fee. Even though I have high grades, I didn't learn jack shit. I used to see myself like my parents who are successful in their business but now I don't know anymore.

I yearn to become successful in the future but under science. I asked them if I could shift to another course and they were fine with it until I mentioned that it's not a business course. My father started berating me and kept saying that I will not earn money on that course and my mother insisted that majority of her friends children have no jobs because they took medical laboratory (the course I want) which pissed me of more. I couldn't take it anymore and just went to my room while they scold me for being disrespectful and leaving the conversation. I already had the same conversation with them before I went to college and senior high but they still stick with their beliefs. Sometimes I wonder if I lack so much potential that they only see me becoming successful in business and that other courses would be deemed useless because of me.

I know shifting to the course I want would be difficult for me since I have experience but the challenge excites me and I see myself helping patients. I love my parents and want to make them proud but I don't want to spend the next 4 years learning something I don't see myself in the future doing.",21Dec2019,1
439,"Hi guys,

My best friend and I have been friends since we met during high school at age 14. When we were 22, my best friend made some new friends who were rude and condescending to me, and I walked out of a party. She was furious, and fired insult after insult at me. A few days afterward, she broke up with her boyfriend, and I refused to help her because of what she had said to me. Our friendship ended. A month later, she tried to rekindle our friendship, but I was uninterested. Our lives went in different directions for a number of years, but at age 27 (June 2017), we reconnected, and we have recently been as close as ever.

For the past six months, I have been living interstate (a two hour flight away) undertaking my PhD while my best friend is trying to acquire citizenship for her fiancé and has been raising her two year old son. She has also recently begun a travel business for her home country (a European country). While I have been away, we have been in constant contact via Facebook messenger, Skype and phone calls. She has consistently expressed how much she misses me, and how excited she is to see me when I get back. She tried to organise a move to where I'm undertaking my PhD for herself and her family, but in the end it was impractical because of their financial situation. She even suggested I sleep at her house for a few nights so that we can have a proper catch up. She was counting down the days, and so was I. I value her friendship tremendously, and she knows this.

Since I have returned, she has ignored my phone calls, and has ignored many of my Facebook messages. After I pushed a little, asking if she was okay, she replied and said she was just really busy with her business. I'm not here for long, and she knows this. She has had some recent trouble with her fiancé. They have been living with her parents because they currently have no source of income (she is a stay-at-home-mum, and her fiancé is on a visa that doesn't allow him to work), and this has been stressful because her fiancé doesn't like living with her parents. He returned briefly to their home country, but he is now back, and my best friend has organised a house-sitting for them in a neighbouring suburb.

I'm just not sure what to do. She is online all the time, but she says she is only online to manage her business. I have sent her all my availability, but she hasn't replied. What should I do? I know she's going through a stressful time, and I'm trying to be as supportive as possible, but I can't help much if she won't speak to me.

Thank you in advance!",21Dec2019,1

This recent Thanksgivings was bad, I feel like it was their fault but I understand I could just be being defensive of my boyfriend, anyway let's call my BF Josh. This Thanksgiving Josh and I went to my parents for dinner, Josh was asking me why I still hadn't done my college paper and when I responded with excuses of my procrastinating Josh said “come on you have to get it done” then he jokingly said “if you don't do it you won't get anymore of this Jewish dick” I had a smirk on my face and was Shaking my head when I saw my parents and realised they heard what he said that smirk turned into a frown and shanking my head disappointingly like I was upset at Josh (I wasn't). 

The next thing that happened. My parents made an effort to make Josh feel at home so in the morning he went into the kitchen and ate some leftovers with his hands (it wasn't anything super messy or he had to dip his hands into) my parents pulled me to the side and said he was disgusting and barbaric. It was weird for me because if I don't need spoon or a fork, I just eat with my hands. 

Then, my nephew (who is 3) was throwing a tantrum and hit me. My dad said “I bet you he saw Josh hit you huh? Haha” Josh was annoyed but brushed it off

The final thing that happened was bad. Josh is middle eastern (though was born and raised in the US, in fact he has never left the country) we were sitting on the sofa where Josh and his dumbass decided to apologise for the “Jewish dick” comment he made the day before.

My dad: I didn't know middle easterners could be any religion other than Muslim

My mom: I thought that would be going against Allah, but the again so is bombing people but your people do that anyways

Josh: excuse me bitch

My dad shouting: don't speak to my wife that way! Is that how you talk to my daughter?! How many many times have you called her a bitch today!?

My mom: your little boyfriend has acted horrible the entire time he's been here. I don't want him back in our home and I don't want you in our home unless you end this relationship

To me this is a huge decision, and I don’t want to make the wrong one.

Again, I know it probably sounds like a small matter to many but I’ve been stressing over this for the past few months. I actually think it’s affecting my sleep as well lol (I’ve been sleeping as late as 5am, unable to fall asleep in bed). Has anyone else faced difficulty making a decision on which sport to play in school as well? How did you guys end up making the decision? And are there any tips to help me make a better one?",21Dec2019,1
463,"Hello all. Earlier I was talking to my friend and he mentioned that he had sex on his birthday, losing his virginity. I congratulated him, but inside I felt terrible.

I understand that sex is a natural part of life. However, my problem is that I get very panicky whenever someone mentions that they’ve had sex. Just the thought of having sex scares me too. I realize that these feelings aren’t normal, but I don’t know how to accept that (almost) everyone has sex, or how to get over this fear.",21Dec2019,1
464,"Yesterday after working a full day I went to the local bar to pick my husband up from his work Christmas party. The party had started at 12 and things were still going strong by 7pm when I got there. I decided to have a drink and talk for a bit. (Recently I've been trying to really work on my social anxiety and have more conversations with people). Things are going well and I'm talking with lots of different people when I notice that one of his co-workers isn't really talking with anyone. I introduce myself as __'s wife and am confused when he shakes my hand makes a ""taken aback"" gesture with his body and an odd unfriendly face. I ask him ""what was that"" and he very sarcastically answered ""oh, you just look so amazing."" I turned away and tried to shake off the response. About 10 minutes later said co-worker comes over and joins the conversation with the people I'm talking to and to attempt to lighten whatever had just happened I say in a clear joking tone ""I'm so mad at you!"" No response, just another weird face. 5 minutes later and this person is making fake throw up sounds anytime he comes near me. I grabbed my husband and left. Honestly I can't shake this interaction from my head, it's been repeating on loop and I've cried for more hours than I'd like to share over it. I can't understand how or even why someone could be so cold and so mean just for the sake of being cold and mean. My mom and best friend keep assuring me that I need to let this go and who cares what some stranger thinks but it's really hard for me because I'm very hard on myself. (Husband is still sleeping and haven't talked to him about it yet.. he was pretty drunk when it happened so he wasn't my go to for talking about this last night.)",21Dec2019,1

466,"I’d like to start this off with saying I’m slightly drunk right now,

So a couple of months ago with a girlfriend of mine we made a plan to go swimming at a local swimming hole. We made the plan and I invited one friend who knew the way and another who didn’t get out much who I was trying to get out of the house. My girlfriend invited her friend out. It was a good day. But afterwards my friend who I didn’t invite(i will call him Dave) got super upset that I did t invite him. Keep in mind the car was full of people and couldn’t fit anymore. Furthermore, over the past few months face had cancelled plans on my 7 out of 7 times I tried to make plans, I was always the one to suggest a hangout and got denied every time. I never really questioned it. I then hear from a friend that Dave has been talking smack about me and how I’m a liar because I didn’t invite him the the swimming hole. Dave is a really big influence in my life and had been my friend for years, is there anything I can do to save the friendship and am I really in the wrong for not inviting him?",21Dec2019,1
469,"So I'm 27 and still living at home. I did all the mile stone thing up until graduating from college. Since then things have gone horribly bad. I had serious depression that kept me home for a full year without working. Then I gradually put myself out there with an easy job at Old Navy, part time. My extreme social anxiety led me to stay stuck in a part time job for 2 years. Since then I took on sales jobs that are hard and that I hate. I keep bouncing from job to job. I am not making anywhere as much as I need to be in order to survive on my own and pay off over 50,000 in student debt. I feel like I will never get out of this quick sand. People who I have went to high school and college all seem to have their shit together. Some already own a home and have a family going. I feel stuck. I need some advice. 

I have a marketing degree, but I cannot get any jobs other than sales. Because of my social anxiety, I have a hard time being successful in this type of job. I'm working really hard but I'm not good at sales enough to make a living. I don't know what to do. I need a good paying job to at least be able to cover my basic necessities and college debt. I have been in sales now for 1.5 years and I'm scared I will never be better than where I am now. 

What should I do? What career advice can you give? What life advice? Help!",21Dec2019,1
470,"Long story short: last year I gave small presents to some acquaintances' kids for their birthday and Christmas, as I had been ""babysitting"" them during the few past summers and has grown kinda fond of them (BTW, babysit is a bit of an improper term, as they are now tweens, so I was more like an entertainer and at times a partner in crime).

Still, as we don't really see eachother during the rest of the year, and they're growing up, I've been wondering whether I may be overstepping some boundaries with my small gifts? Especially since one of them is ""just"" a friend of the other one (whom I've known since she was 4 and our families have been summer-neighbours for decades).

So is it overthinking if I'm starting to suspect I'd better phase the tradition out before it becomes one of those burdensome social obligations? Or even something a bit excessive and unnecessary, considering the level of closeness with the recipients?

P.S. Going from small present to a text message on the other hand can feel cheap and kinda rude...",21Dec2019,1

• According to the cervical mucus method, we pitted her ovulating around the 5th or 6th of December, as that is when she claims it was the wettest down there. This was 8 or 9 days after the incident.

• Cut to today, her period is now 2 days late, as she was supposed to have it Thursday. The only reason I’m not panicking is that, for some reason, every third month her period come late.

   • June: 34 Day Cycle Length

495,"A week ago I started talking to a guy online and he pretty quickly established he wanted to be with me and asked me to move to his country this month. 

Over the past week he and I had been talking every day for 5-8 hours nonstop. He has said such things like I’m very important to him, he thinks about me, we are going to be together next Christmas, we’re going to do all this stuff together and he told me he wanted us to be together and wanted to move to his country this month.

However yesterday when I told him the animal I gave up for adoption, whom I went to visit, didn’t know me, he said animals don’t have feelings anyways. I said I’ll try to focus on my vegan activism so that I can at least help other animals and he said people are supposed to eat animals, I’d eat any animal, I just don’t care. Then I said I’m not asking you not to eat meat, I know you do, then he said you better not because I wouldn’t listen to you anyways. He came off as hostile and angry although I’ve never pushed my views on him.

Then that night he didn’t apologise at all so I finally wrote him I was sad because the only reason I didn’t break down while my former pet didn’t acknowledge me at all is I was thinking that he cared about me and would want to hold me if he was there. I told him he got me through this and that he’s amazing, the most important person to me. He then denied he was angry and said he was just expressing his opinion. Then I mentioned I had that morning posted

On my Instagram his pic with the caption that he makes me happy. He said isn’t that too fast? So....it wasn’t too fast that he said we will go on holiday together next year, that he said he wants to be my boyfriend, that he claims to have told his friends about me, to urge me to move to his country right away after I explained multiple times I need to make sure my pet is safe amd happy in his new home and to tie up loose ends? I told him I can go in the end of January but I have responsibilities and commitments. I compromised I can go in the end of December but he then said I have to go before Christmas.

Bottom line, he just didn’t want others to know about him because he knows he doesn’t take me seriously. Do you guys think I’m reading this correctly? By the way, I’ve never had any sort of romantic interaction before so I have no frame of reference as to what is appropriate and these are just my thoughts. Lastly I found it weird he was offended when I asked his surname, he said why do you need to know? And he also said he doesn’t want to give me his phone number because it’s private.",21Dec2019,1

My ex hates drinking but when they passed the bottle to me I started getting tipsy, but I felt weird drinking in front of my ex. We (me and my ex) were talking and stuff and it was really nice. Then the girl I don’t like (an ex friend who asked out my ex, lies about me and him, rly fake blah blah blah) keeps trying to sit on my exs lap and hug him. She also said she mastrubates to him and tried to embarrass me and stuff, but I just let it go. Then we started playing spin the bottle. Me and my ex landed on eachother like over 15 times but the girl wouldn’t let either of us move towards eachother (she got in between us) so no one kissed anyone and everyone was just yelling. And then my ex had to leave. After he left I ended up kissing the three other guys and pretty much everyone ended up kissing eachother. Then I found out ONE OF THEM HAD A GIRLFRIEND WHO HAS A MUTUAL FRIEND OF MINE. I also kissed a guy who is liked by another girl that hates all of us, and I just feel really gross and don’t know what to do. Also if it’s not obvious already I have feelings for my ex again lol. He asked me to go the movies with him and three of our friends (2 boys and my bsf) but then had to cancel suddenly... but his little brothers deaths anniversary was just yesterday so I have a feeling it’s about that. I just need advice from someone more experienced with stuff like that since it was kind of like my first real high school party (I’m a freshman).

EDIT:
my ex also has expressed uncomfort about me and other boys. We were also together for about 10-11 months, and broke up in August.

501,"Ok so this one is going to be weird, at least for me.

A year or so ago, it might be two by now, me and my boyfriend opened up a joint checking account we both had access to, to start saving for a new house. When we bought our first starter home, three years ago, it was with a 5 year plan in mind.

Now I will admit we have not been great at saving, but we did have stuff in there, and I thought we had more in there then we actually did before this happened.

So yesterday I am checking the mail, and find a bank statement. I usually just glance at them to make sure everything is correct, and put them away, but noticed this one was from our shared account.

It says the balance is close to zero and there are a bunch of large withdrawals to my boyfriends main account.

When I confronted him about this, he was honest, he said he should have told me and that he was not trying to hide it, but, he used that money to pay off my medical bills that went into collections about a month ago. (He also said he was very upset they ever got to the collections stage but didn't talk to me about that.)

When he found out about the bills in collections, he offered to help pay for them, and I accepted, I did NOT know it would be coming from the joint checking account, and our house money.

He didn't talk to me about it, or ask, he just did it. In his mind I am sure it was something that needed to be done, even if he should have asked me.

In my mind, that money is SACRED. It should not be touched for anything, and I have told him this before and I have never used it. I feel like if I wanted to use it to pay off my medical bills, I could have done that myself, but I didn't, I didn't even think of it because to me, the house money is not to be touched.

So yesterday, I found out we have nothing in savings towards a new home, when we are supposed to be out of here in a year, maybe 2. I am very upset and I feel like, even though he did it for me, he just conducted a HUGE breach of trust, to the point when I start saving again I am considering doing it in an account he can't access.

I would like to say this has never been an issue before, we have a good relationship, love each other, are loyal and committed, and talk about most things, and almost every big thing.

505,"Recently I have been recalling memories from as a toddler to about age 10 which, in my mind back then were absolutely terrifying. But it only happens when i get high (please before you say “just stop smoking weed then” just read the rest of this its nothing I really feel comfortable talking with someone about and I’m anonymous in here and need genuine advice or anything.) 

—One memory came to me when I was tripping and thought I heard my mum yelling my name when I was walking back from my smoke spot (she doesn’t know I smoke) and I was freaking out. And then this made me remember how scared I used to be as a kid when I would ALWAYS have nightmares about my mum trying to kill me, abandon me or hate me or anything negative. And I sorta realised that surely that isnt normal why would I dream that shit my parents are so loving and kind.

— there are a few others but I have forgotten them, but the one that I have just got then is. When I was really little I was absolutely terrified of the dark, and I always remember beimg scared of the dark but when I was high I got into bed and felt scared of the dark, and I just had all these memories of me Being scared of the dark and never sleeping because whenever I would cry me to my parents they would always send me back to bed and I remembered sitting cornered against my wall trying not to cry. I also think I have memories of me hVing sleep paralysis either that or it was just a early dream that I loosely remember.

I’m not really sure if this is just me being cooked and paranoid or if maybe this fear of the dark sorta traumatized me and made me wjay I am today? Alot recently I have been feeling really trapped with decisions that I have to make and burdens that I have to carry.

Nothing has really felt the same since them. I've also been trying to not talk to him for long periods of time but I always end up texting him again just trying to have a normal friendship.

519,"TL;DR at the bottom that summarizes the situation for the most part without all the details.

I was in charge of watching a co-workers email all day yesterday while they were out of the office. Unfortunately for us, they don't let us forward emails and instead make us use their personal email to make it look like we are there 24/7. In my opinion it's incredibly silly, as it requires us constantly running around checking emails at other computers, when we could simply have them forwarded and keep everybody involved CC'd on the thread.

I got incredibly busy between managing both their email, my email, as well as having to watch the phones and front desk all by myself due to our limited staff, and realized just as I got home and was getting ready for bed that the chaotic day most likely made me forget to respond to one of my co-workers emails. Which, in our work, we have a ground rule where we always need to answer emails with an hour or two, even if it's just responding to let them know the email was received and that we will get back to them when we get a chance. And since we us our co-workers emails to respond to everything, if we don't answer something it looks bad on our /co-worker/ rather than us. Which is another reason I wish they would forward emails, even if it's temporary during the day(s) they are not there.

The fact that I forgot to possibly respond to an email immediately got me worrying. So to try to remedy this, I got the idea to try to check their email on my phone from home just to check everything and make sure it was all taken care of. Otherwise, I know I'll get chewed out on Monday despite all that I was trying to do on my own and how busy the day was. 

Unfortunately, I didn't really think this through, because only after attempting to login to their email did it hit me like a ton of bricks that in hind-sight it was not the smartest decision to try checking a co-workers email. Because it was after work hours, I was attempting to login from home, and was not given permission to do this. Technically breaching their privacy, regardless of why I was attempting to do such and regardless if I had good intentions. However, this realization didn't hit me until after I tried logging in with a password that I was informed was supposed to be universal to all of our emails (which, it is in fact not), and their account was promptly locked due to a failed login attempt. I know they have the email application downloaded on their phone and they often try accessing it on their home computer, but I do not know if they will get a notification for the failed sign in attempt (and following 'lock'), get kicked out (even if they are logged in on these devices), or if they can see that someone tried signing in to the account at all.

So, I am unsure if they can tell this happened, and likewise, I'm also unsure if they will be unable to access their email all weekend until Monday. Which, if that is the case, will likely make them incredibly upset as I know they like to browse through and see what all is happening and going on and that they like to respond to messages through the weekend. And if they cannot access their email, it will require them talking to our tech support on Monday, and leading to an investigation. And considering I'm sure there is a way to track IP Addresses/Login locations, I'm pretty sure they can see that the login attempt was made from my location, which is the same location that is attached to my own personal email as I frequently check it from home on my phone. 

I'm absolutely mortified about the fact I did not fully think this through before doing it and worried about what I may be going into next week. I don't know what to do in this situation, as it's the first time it's ever happened to me. Regardless of why I was trying to access her email, it was still a breach of privacy as I did not have permission and it was outside of work hours, even if I do have permission and access to her email while at work. I could go in to work and not mention it at all (which I feel will not solve anything) but risk being approached about it if they do an investigation and track it back to my login location. Or I could come in to work and sit down with my co-worker and openly explain what happened and deal with the repercussions - but in that case, how do I even begin? Do I openly admit that I was aware I did wrong after the fact I tried? Do I explain why I was trying to login to her email, and that I did not mean anything malicious by it as I only wanted to confirm that everything was good with her emails? I obviously do not want to lie, and I also don't want to pretend like what I did was right, regardless of my intentions. It's just incredibly stressful, as I don't know what I'll be walking into on Monday or how to deal with what it. It can go so many different ways. I could walk in and they already have the problem solved and they seek me out the moment I get there. Or I could walk in, not say anything, and have them investigate and seek me out. And, for all I know, I could be overthinking and over-analyzing and I'll come in and nothing will happen at all.

What advice would you have in this situation?

----

TL;DR - Was running solo at work and managing enough work for three people. Forgot to respond to a co-workers email that I had to manually watch and check (and it's a rule to respond to everything), so I got the idea to try to access their email when I got home to check and run through everything one last time. It only occurred to me after the single login attempt (that stated their account was now locked due to the failed attempt) what I was doing was not something I should be doing regardless of my intentions not being malicious. Now I'm worried about whether my co-worker and/or our Tech Support (which is a single person) is aware of this or if they got a notification about it, and how to approach the situation on Monday. Do I go in and try not to mention it, to see if anybody is even aware of what happened and see if anybody even knows this occurred? Do I go in and sit down with my co-worker and openly explain the situation? How would I even broach the topic? Do I wait to see if she mentions the topic to me personally, in the event she solves the situation over the weekend due to having no email access? I do know that even if I had good intentions it was wrong to do this and I am mentally disappointed in myself for not having more common sense, but I just don't know the best course of action as I tend to over-think and micro-analyze situations like this.",21Dec2019,1

525,"I’ll start by saying my ex boyfriend was still in love with his ex and he had broken up with her only a few months after we got together. He would deny it but I knew he did. He’d bad mouth her, bring her up so often etc and I never felt like he was giving me his all including never bringing up the future for us. 

My current boyfriend who I met a year and a half after breaking up with that ex who was also my first boyfriend is a lovely man. We have been together for just under 2 years now. 
He’s kind caring and so patient with me. He has always said he sees me as the mother of his child &amp; the person to build with. We’ve been talking about getting a flat together etc. 

One thing, at the early stages of our relationship when we spoke about exes he mentioned he had 3. One was when he was in his early twenties and his longest of four years. He said that it fizzled out and that nothing really went wrong they were just too young and had they met when they were older perhaps things would have been different.
At first it did t bother me but every now and then he’d bring her up ( and he other exes ) just in general conversation, nothing that sounded wistful but it started to make me insecure and I wondered if he secretly wanted her back. when I mentioned it he said I’m being silly that they broke up 6 years ago and that if they were to get back it would’ve happened by now. He said he doesn’t think about his exes so nor should I. He’s also said that his comment about if they had been older was just him being mature about the situation and that he is happy with me. 
I’ve made it very very clear that I do not do second best ( something I wish I did in my first relationship). That if he secretly has feelings of regret etc that he needs to find a reason to break up with me because it would be the utmost disrespect to me. 

So.. should I lay this insecurity to rest or is this my gut instinct talking to me?

Here are some problems I have:

1. Smell: Everything is in one room, including the kitchen. So whenever I cook something or warm something the smell stays in the room. The dirty dishes are also in the same room and so is the trash bin. I dont have a balcony so I have to hang the clothes to dry in the same room. Due to this some smell sticks to my clothes. I try to empty the trash once a week and do the dishes once a week. Due to my busy life I dont have time to do it everyday.

2. Moisture: There is no window in the shower. I use warm water to shower year round. So sometimes some moisture stays in the shower and it escapes to my room. This results in some small mold growing in the corners of my walls.

3. Air circulation: I live in a small studio like I said before. There is only one window thats close to my bed. Its mostly cold and rainy here in the netherlands so I keep the window closed. Otherwise I cant sit down without freezing myself. So the air does not circulate easily in my apartment.

Some personal info, I'm 21 yrs old with no job and no experience whatsoever. Has Asian parents. Been wanting to share this for a very long time now.

A word of warning: I'm not good with words.

I lost my scholarship from furthering my degree in an overseas university because I had no motivation. It was hard for me to bring myself to classes or just start studying. I also developed a social anxiety because I couldn't speak English fast and over a long period or my throat would start to hurt and I started to slur on some words. This had led me to hard to get into a group of friends with the eventual behaviour of ""idk what else to talk abt"" when meeting people after having no friends for a long time.

My grades are already up but I lied to my parents that the university will send it on January. Every single day I can see that they would be screaming at me because of my results. The pressure of them saying ""Later on you'll work overseas and we'll be following you to stay there"" has led me feeling like shit in my own home everyday. I can see myself killing myself before going to bed or jumping from a building with the thought of all of this. I don't know what else I should do. 

Both my girlfriend and my sister said that I should take a one year break because I've been going on a streak of studying for 4 years straight directly after highschool (Pre-uni + 2 years in uni) but I'm not sure how I would feel if I disappoint my parents when they know about my grades.

548,"Background:

4 years ago I started hanging out with this girl I met on social media. We went to the same college, so would hung out a couple of times at campus (e..g, getting lunch together, even making out in her car one time). Eventually her and I went on a ""real"" date; we went to get dinner and see a show. Throughout the date, her and I made out a couple of times. When we got out of my car and started walking to the show we were going to, she was being flirty with me so I touched her butt. She said in a flirty/joking voice ""Haha anon stop that"" to which I did it again as I honestly thought she was being flirty/joking around. Then she said ""Anon I mean it stop"" to which I did and apologized on the spot. The girl then proceeded to grab my hand to hold it and we went on with the date. During the movie, she even asked me to ""place my hand"" on her inner thigh to ""keep it warm."" When I dropped her off at her house, we made out again and she even joked that she needed to ""teach me how to kiss."" She told me to text her when I got home safe which I did. We texted over the next couple of days, however, I started to pull back as I couldn't see myself dating her (e.g., rude to wait staff, immature, not serious about school, consonantly posting stuff on social media, etc.).

One day I ""innocently"" liked one of her friend's selfie on Instagram who followed me a couple of weeks back. A couple of minutes later I received a text from her ""Why did you like her selfie and not mine? I let you keep touching my butt when I said no"", almost seeming like she was trying to gaslight me for not giving her attention. A week or so later she asked about meeting up again and I told her that I was busy with school/work. Over the next couple of weeks she would text me memes (i.e., ""This reminds me of you"") and ""like"" posts of mine of social media. One time I posted on a social media outlet how a funny situation I was in landed me a date to which she texted me and said ""Remember my tips anon"" referring to her ""teaching me how to kiss.""

Fast forward a few weeks; I check my Twitter and I see that she has a screenshot of a tweet of mine with the caption ""This is funny coming from a guy who kept grabbing my ass when I said no on a date"" with a fair amount of people ""liking"" it. I texted her immediately asking her what was up and she said that ""someone had to call me out"" and gaslight me about how other girls were contacting her with a similar experience about me (?) which is not true. I lurked her profile and before she made that tweet she tweeted ""You're so cringey why did I ever go on a date with you."" A day later she started to ""like"" social media posts of mine. A couple of weeks later she even contacted me about buying a car that I was selling. Her ""interacting"" with me on social media (e.g., ""liking"" my posts, tweeting memes at me, etc.) continued for a couple of months before I unfollowed her. When she realized I unfollowed her she tweeted at me ""I'll miss you anon."" I remember randomly getting notifications on Tinder years back that she would ""Super Like"" me.

Now:

I realize that this girl has been friends with some of my friends. I'm worried about this ""rumor"" starting again and her ruining my reputation, even more so now that I have a career.

I can honestly say that me touching her butt on the date had no malicious intent; I honestly misunderstood her as we were just making out. After everything I did look up more on consent and ensuring that everyone I have sexual relations with is 100% comfortable. My girlfriend even joked to me ""Anon I appreciate this but you don't need to keep asking.""

Do you feel that it was weird that she continued to contact me following the date and the ""call out"" post? I feel like if I truly did something to violate her she would have cut me off ASAP. It seems that most survivors of sexual assault NEVER want ANY contact with someone who violated them. I almost feel like she is doing this due to me not giving her attention.  I posted this story on another subreddit and asked if I should reach out to her, but many agreed that I shouldn't as she may twist my words and use them against me.  

I appreciate any replies.",21Dec2019,1
549,"Just before I get going, this post is very serious.  Please read the whole post before responding.

I’ve got a friend who I’ve been very close to for the past 3 or so years.  When I first met him, he vaped.  He had been doing it a while and was heavily addicted.  Over the next year or so, he started smoking weed.  I must admit, I had a bit of a part to play in that, as I somewhat encouraged that behaviour, and would smoke with him.  I always viewed it as a recreational thing, and never felt any sort of addiction, but he started using it pretty much every day.  I connected the dots and realized that he has an incredibly addictive personality.  When he goes through a drinking fase he goes hard and begins to look like he’s an alcoholic, when he can’t use his vape, he buys cigarettes, when he finds a drink or food he likes, he has it non stop, just in general he falls into these addictive patterns.

He was building a reliance on weed.  He used it every day, several times a day, and he would structure his day around smoking.  At this point he wasn’t doing it for fun.  He wasn’t enjoying it, he just needed it.  Whenever I smoked with him which was probably about once a month, he would smoke massive amounts of it, and wouldn’t get high he would just be angry that he couldn’t have more.  It was getting out of hand, so I stopped smoking entirely and me and our other friend got him help.  It seemed to be going well.  He hadn’t smoked or drank in about 2 weeks (except for once on the weekend, and he seemed to actually get high) and he was doing well.  He seemed more like the old him, and things were looking up.  

Last night he smoked meth.  It was only once but if he gets addicted to weed that easily what the fuck is he gonna do on meth and weed isn’t dangerous but meth is really bad and I’m just scared that he’s gonna become addicted to this like he has with every single other substance he has ever used and I can deal with a dependence on weed but I’m not equipped to deal with a meth addiction. I’m really scared for him.

What first steps should I take?  I love this guy so much and I’m just terrified that he’s gonna end up dead in a ditch somewhere. The weed was manageable, he was getting it from legal dispensaries and we could tackle it head on but this is just so much more.

Anyone who really knows what they’re talking about, I would love some advice right now.",21Dec2019,1
551,"We were on a flight and in our row was this very tall and muscular piece of shit. My gf sat between me and that guy because he was huge and I’m also a big guy. Anyways, at first he was actually not that bad of a guy and we all conversed a little. About an hour into the flight my gf was leaning on me as we were watching a movie. I was fixated on the movie, but the piece of shit sitting next to my gf put his hand 🤚 n my gf’s leg and further touched her inappropriately. She grabbed my attention and I could tell something was wrong because her eyes were red and she was visibly distraught. She took my phone and txted me that she wanted to switch seats with me because she was sexually harassed. I immediately shook that piece of shit’s shoulder and confronted him, removed my gf from the scene, got the flight attendants involved, and made sure he was as far away from us as possible. The flight attendants were very understanding and related to my gf (they told us they go through that kind of harassment all the time). In the end, we decided to not press charges, and though she’s feeling better about the situation and laughing it off, I feel so terrible that this happened to her right in front me and I wasn’t there to stop it. I’m not trying to make this about me at all, but I really need some advice as to how to help my gf with this. I don’t know if it’s better to just drop it, laugh about if, or what.

552,"So I work at Whole Foods for about 7 months now. Right about 3 months ago I notice that this girl was making eye contact with me all the time. During breaks she would be on her lockers which is right next to the employees table for breaks and she will quickly look at me. She would be sitting down sometimes and while I was passing by she would look at me. I ask one of her coworkers is she had a boyfriend she said “no”. So I decided to ask her out about a 5 days ago. She was fine with it and got my number then I proceeded to ask her how old she was and she said 29 then I told her I’m 21. Then she kinda change her mind and told me I’m kinda young for her but still wouldn’t mind hanging out. I made it easy for and told her that she got my number if she wants to hangout to text me or if not then just forget about it. She never text me which is fine.

554,"First post ever so whoop whoop for that. Anyway I talk to this girl I know from highschool everyday on Snapchat. We have the whole streak thing and it's been like that for over a year. And we don't just send each other a picture to keep the streak we have full on conversations everyday (although I'll admit they're becoming repetitive). But I haven't seen her in person at all in that time. 

She's not a catfish shes a very real person I've interacted with before. I've tried to meet up with her in the past but the plans fall through because she's either busy or straight up ditching me. I get being busy she does a lot of school but that didn't stop her from making effort with other people. 

I realize I could easily be one of those guys that are just annoying and can't take a hint but I don't think that's the case. We're good friends and highly doubt she's annoyed by me like I said we have good conversations and tell each other a lot of stuff. I'm not trying to be in a relationship with her we've established that we're good friends so I don't wanna compromise that, but friends hang out in person ya know. We were really cool with each other in highschool and kept in touch afterwards, hence the streak.

I don't know how to proceed, it seems she's not making an effort on her end. Should I just try more? I'm honestly anxious because I'm not a big social person to begin with so the idea of initiating anything can be stressful, especially when you know the person might not be down. It's just annoying now because it seems like our friendship is stagnant.",21Dec2019,1
555,"I was in a relationship with a woman for 12 years. About 1.5 years ago we split up. We have a 7 year old son and she is chronically ill (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome). She is also intellectually gifted. She is bed ridden about 90% of the time, has high pain, low energy, and generally needs help looking after herself.

We still live together but I’m not sure how long I can stand it. It’s bearable, we share a lot of joy in our son, but most other interactions are not particularly constructive. I can’t just leave, as she’d be unable to look after herself (never mind our son, who we plan to leave with her).

We’re not rich, but not stuck for money at the moment either. She has to figure out how she can live by herself, but with her illness she has huge social anxiety and due to her pain she mainly distracts herself from reality most of the day. I can’t force her to figure out what will work, but as time goes on I just don’t see a solution that will work. Her family are pretty useless and all live in another country. My family are great, consider her part of the family, we will be spending Christmas together at my parents, but they wouldn’t be able to do anything either.

Essentially we need some form of full time care for her but can’t afford it privately, and I need her help to figure out how it’s going to work. Not sure if anyone can help with suggestions but I’m just feeling particularly hopeless about it at the moment and maybe someone has an idea that I can at least focus on.",21Dec2019,1
556,"I’m a 23yr old guy. I work in HVAC in Canada. Currently I am a liscensed gas fitter. I am not liscensed in a/cs.

So I have been working for a company for about a year and I am the only technician they have. They currently pay me $26 an hour. This is really good pay for my age, and comes out to about 50k a year, however only if I work a full 40 hour week every week. My work week can range from 1-60 hours a week. This year I only worked about 1200 hours and had ALOT of time off as the company is very slow. This came out to just over 30k. If I worked full time at McDonald’s I could have made almost the same money. All of my work is done alone, sales, installs, service calls, plumbing but I’m still quite new in the trade. I’m good at what I do and the owner of my company is nearing 70 and is on his way to retirement. He has told me many time’s that he plans on selling me his company. I’m currently not signed up for apprenticeship. This is a residential only company. I understand it’s a slow year and that they have been unable to keep up with demand in the past but I have not worked a full week in 3 weeks. I recently went to the dentist, paid car insurance, and bought Christmas presents all of which had to be paid for with my savings. 

So recently I got a job offer for 22$ an hour but it’s guaranteed to have 40+ hours a week. It’s at a larger company with over 30 technicians and I would be working on a team for the majority of my time, eventually I would move into more of a service technician role. This company being larger works both in the commercial sector and residential but has the opportunity to reach much higher pay upwards of $40+ an hour. After the 90 day probation I would be signed up for apprenticeship for my refrigeration liscense and I am long overdue to get one. They have better benefits and most of my work is organized through dispatchers and I wouldn’t be scheduling my own calls anymore. 


Now I told my boss I’m going to take this job. He took it very personally and thinks I don’t like his company. I believe in a way he looks at me as the son he never had. 

Today he called me with a new offer. $660 base pay a week for doing nothing. Every hour I work would be paid on TOP of that $660. This is a guaranteed 34k a year plus the hours I work.  My boss is very adamant that I own his company in the next 3-5 years as he is aging and is falling apart physically. His plan is to buy shares in my name by matching my pay checks until it is fully in my name. The main reason I want to leave is that I’m not yet signed on for a refrigeration apprenticeship. I told my boss this, and he says I will get it but asked if I could wait a year. I am tempted to take the offer as it’s a lot of money for someone my age. However I am a little skeptical of if I will ever be apprenticed and get a license. 

Now the company I’m going to started about 20 years ago when my bosses company was much bigger. It is a bit of a conflict of interest as this company took off and stole a lot of my bosses market. The new company is family owned and run and they genuinely seem much more professional and put a lot of emphasis on getting me educated. However during my interview the new company asked me if I had ever seen my bosses license. What a weird question I thought. Now I’m putting two and two together and I don’t believe my boss has one. I believe he buys air conditioning equipment through a contractor license. This makes a lot of sense, as I have not been signed up yet and in order to do that you need someone with a license to sign you up. However it is possible for me to be signed up under someone at another company’s license. My boss is good friends with the owners of other companies and knows many people who can do this for me.

I’m really young and I never have had to make such a big decision before. On one hand I would like to leave the company but in the other hand I am very tempted to stay and have the guaranteed 34k. It is very needed as I would like to be independent and move out of my parents home and into my own home. But on the other hand I really need professional schooling and training. I am a good technician and solve almost every problem, but I’m just inexperienced. Some days there are things beyond my abilities to fix and I just look stupid to my customers when I’m swapping out part after part until something works. Most of the work I do is self taught through YouTube, books, r/HVAC, and just what my boss shows me. 

There is more variety at the new job and I would be on a team with a much more experienced technician who I could learn from daily. When I’m sent out alone and I’m stuck there would be more people I can call and ask for advice instead of one person. 

To sum it all up, I would be taking a slight pay cut for a new job where I could get my schooling. But on the other hand I can stay, have income security and eventually own my own company, but I am uncertain when I will get my schooling done. I need to make money now. My current job will pay me a lot for my age. The new company the raises would be more gradual as I finish up my schooling. I like working alone but some days I wish I had people around to help. 

Thank you for any help reddit! I’m really stressed about life right now!",21Dec2019,1

558,"I started HRT roughly two years ago for aesthetic reasons I won’t go into.  But, I was friends with my now boyfriend for years prior to us getting together.  When we got together I was about 11 months in, and it didn’t take long before he noticed the differences in our strength.  

At the beginning of the relationship we would always roughhouse around, and he would be pretty rough with me but I didn’t care.  I could still hold my own pretty well.  

However, these past 6 months I’ve lost around 35 lbs, and with it I’m assuming I’ve lost whatever “male muscle mass” I had left.  I did some research, and being at a caloric deficit does in fact increase the speed of muscle atrophy.  The decrease in strength, comparatively, is insane.  And of course, he noticed this as well. 

Fast forward to the other night I was playing around with him, and he wasn’t really reciprocating.  I assumed something was wrong, or that he was upset.   But no, he tells me that I’m too “fragile” now, and that it’s too unfair for us to play around like that.  

He also said he can just pin me down with one arm at this point, but doesn’t because there’s no fun in that, but he now finds it boring to roughhouse with me.  I’m ngl I was pretty pissed, and I just went to bed.  I just wanted everyone else’s opinions on this, because I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.",21Dec2019,1
559,"I spent some after separating with my long term boyfriend with new friends in a new environment. I moved and was basically living my life as I wanted, drinking, partying and traveling.
I was single, so I was meeting people and simply having one night stands i'd say one every other month or so? Nothing crazy, sometimes i'd come back for seconds but that's about it. It all ended when I got taken advantage of by two guys and I met my (now) ex boyfriend the day after.
I was distraught after the event mentioned, but to get my mind off of it I met up with my ex and we totally hit it off. He helped me deal with what had happened and other things. 
Things started going south when he started asking about me and my past relationships. At this point I had been in one relationship and slept with 4 others out of a relationship. When I told him about this he was baffled, he couldn't believe what I was saying and just kept saying that if he had known about this before starting anything with me he wouldn't have. 
I was always a sexual person and never truly ashamed of it, but since then I believed what he said and always took his words seriously whenever he'd call me a whore or slutty for ""sleeping around"". It got to the point where he'd say, ""it's your own fault you got raped anyways, you should've never seen those guys again"" 

Its ingrained in me and it pains me to even think of this. This was all he ever spoke of when we broke up. Should I truly be ashamed for treating sex like it was nothing and sleeping around? Or did he just make me believe that?",21Dec2019,1
560,"I'm a 23 year old woman. I still live at home because I'm finishing up my degree. I feel like my dad is being extremely overbearing, to the point where I've been experiencing prolonged periods (\~2 months now) of extreme low mood, loss of interest in things I used to enjoy, and other things I don't want to mention here. He's been like this my entire life, but I'm at the point where I've been dealing with this for so long that I really can't take it anymore. Even though I'm 23, he still won't let me go out at night, he won't let me drive out of town, and he won't let me date. He also gets mad at me if I hang out with my friends. 

This has become an even bigger problem lately because I started a relationship with a guy a couple months ago, and it's been so difficult trying to hide it from my dad. My mom and dad met when they were both 23, so it annoys me to no end that he's forbidding me from seeing anyone. I really don't want to have to lie to my parents about where I am or who I'm with, but I just feel like they're (mainly my dad though--my mom isn't *as* extreme) being too protective. **I hate being made to feel like a child**. I really love my boyfriend, and I don't want my dad to force me to stop seeing him. The thing is, it's a bit difficult to go on dates with my boyfriend while keeping it a secret from my parents. He lives an hour away from me, so we only see each other at least once a week. Since we don't live close to each other, we normally spend the entire day together when we do see each other. I think my dad's starting to get suspicious about that. It also makes matters worse because my dad installed a GPS tracker in my car, so he *always* knows where I'm at. He doesn't always check it though, so I can usually get away with lying about my location. Again, I really wish I didn't have to lie at all, but... I don't know. Is it worth all the risk? I think so. To say my boyfriend has been a tremendous source of support during this low point in my life would be an understatement. 

I still love my parents, but I just don't know if I'll ever be able to work these things out. They have a very old fashioned mentality, so it's difficult to bring up these kinds of issues with them. Whenever I've tried, they attributed my concerns to just ""being an American""--we're Asian, by the way. My therapist has told me several times that the the best course of action for me would be to move out, but I do not have the means to do so.

She then left me on read many times, got drunk again and just had a massive go at me. I then found out she tried suicide again and was in hospital. Every few days I would check up on her but she just didn't feel like saying anything to me. Once she was out, there wasn't much contact either. We met on this game called moviestarplanet (I know very gay please don't lynch me) and on her bio, she put something along the lines of harming herself. I had an angry outburst, (my counsellor said it's probably PTSD) and told her I'm not sure if I can be her friend anymore and just having a go at her. Apologised immediately after but since then I messaged her and said I'm there if she needs me and I genuinely care. She said she'd been diagnosed with autism and I should go away. My dad has autism and I slag him off for it sometimes, I know it's not a good thing but I've been emotionally abused by him so I have anger towards him. She knows about this but she told me to leave her alone, saying that I told her I didn't want to be her friend. I tried messaging her a few days later but she left me on read. What do I do? I don't know if it's love or just friendship but I genuinely just want to talk to her again. It's embarrassing writing stuff like this down on reddit but I'm doing my AS this year and I'm being completely non-functional. My mum knows about this and just told me to block her. I wish I could but I genuinely can't. What do I do now? I have no friends but don't want to commit suicide because I'm scared what my mum will do. Help please? Thanks",21Dec2019,1
574,"Let’s not get into a debate about whether tip-based wages should exist. They do and for now they’re not going anywhere. 

That being said, there’s a significant amount of customers who accept the service of those who rely on tips and then when the time comes to pay they either forget that we rely on tips or they’re just choosing to be cheap. 

I’m interested in finding a strategic way to remind those who have forgotten or to put a bit of pressure on cheapskates ... without running the risk of insulting the customer or getting fired.

We enjoy each others company in General and laugh alot, and she copies some of my sayings and characteristics  All this sounds like she likes me too but then there's the part that makes me unsure. For example She never wants to give hugs (i'm a hugger) she never gives anyone hugs in General tho.

I visited a friend halfway across the country for a few days and ended up hooking up with one of their friends whom I’ve met once before. Sex was pretty good. However, I saw him and hung out with him everyday after that. He seemed very uninterested in me after that night. Not in a cruel way, he just had other people and things to tend to. We had a few one on one moments and they were really nice. Now, I’m back at home and will most likely only ever see him once or twice more in my life (If that). We differ in a lot of ways, and he is typically not my type, but I am extremely infatuated with him. I cannot stop thinking about him and am actually feeling quite depressed knowing that he will be living his life and I will never be a significant part of it. I think thats the worst part.

582,"I haven't been doing well in school for a few years now and I got held back this year so I was planning on getting my GED instead. I had some motivation when I first started studying math for the math part of the exam, but over time my drive to study and do other things slowly started dwindling. Now I'm at the point where I don't feel like getting out of bed unless its important now.

 I have little to no drive or motivation to do anything, even things I enjoy. I think it could be depression related so I've been thinking about talking to the doctor about it next time I go because I've been feeling anxious and depressed on and off for years and I actually want to make progress instead of continuing to feel like this. The anxiety in social situations and the becoming sad and angry at everything problem is getting difficult to deal with now that there's something bigger to get stressed about. 


And my mom has been little to no help with the situation. Sure she let me get a GED math prep book but that's about it. Sometimes I'll quickly lose my patience and get annoyed with her and be rude because I feel like she isn't doing much to help me. She's a lazy alcoholic too. If she's drinking and I say anything in an annoyed tone she goes off on me for almost half an hour bringing things up that never had to do with the original problem. She'll say things to me like ""quit acting like a twat!"", "" you seriously need to figure out wtf you're doing with your life because I don't want to take you out of school just for you to sit here and have me put up with you!"", ""You need medication!""

584,"Hi! 
So here's some background information for you to help me a bit more: 
- I am a sophomore in college and am currently a biology major
- My current GPA is a 3.8 
- My career choice from when I was younger always revolved around the same theme--to help others and to give back
- Last summer I participated in a shadowing program where I shadowing doctors around in both a hospital and office setting. While this program was interesting, I found most of the program to be boring. 

Here is why I am currently questioning whether I want to be a doctor or not:
- Medical school is insanely expensive
- Medical school is not only insanely difficult to get in to, but the workload is insanely stressful, more stressful than my current major which I feel like I cannot handle at times. 
- During the semester when I take my major classes I find myself under such immense stress that I have panic attacks and cannot sleep at night, sometimes for weeks at a time. 
- It takes almost 10 years to start making the money I would need to pay off the immense loan debt that comes along with going to medical school. (this debt is usually around $250,000 on average)
- When I picture myself in the future I see myself being a doctor, but it does not excite me, it only stresses me out because I know what it takes to get to this point. 
- I feel as though I do not have the love or the commitment that most people have when they want to become a doctor. The thought of not becoming a doctor doesn't really upset me that much.
- I have some other reasons but you get the point lol

Reasons why I am thinking about switching to nursing:
- It's cheaper overall.
- The requirements for nursing school are not as intense as the requirements for medical school.
- There are multiple directions and opportunities for me to develop myself in the nursing field. 
- I can start working right out of college and start paying off my debt. 
- I really do like the medical field and I cannot picture myself working outside of this field. 

Any advice will help immensely. Thank you!",21Dec2019,1

586,"I'm 27, in the last year of grad school. Single dad of a 4 year old. I don't have much experience being in relationships or dating in general. When I'm single, I just don't want to be in a relationship unless someone practically falls in my lap. I don't like to pursue too much and I make that pretty clear with women I talk to, and most of them seem disinterested after the fact. I honestly don't really care if I spend the rest of my life single. 

I've had 1 official girlfriend (my kid's mom) for 3 years when I was 21-24. The only other person I've dated was from July - November of this year. We weren't **officially** together, but the dynamics were really intense (both positively and negatively). We even tried to conceive a kid together. I know how preposterous that sounds. Both of these ""relationships"" were toxic, and I'd say it was a 75-90% me-issue in the recent relationship and maybe a 50-75% me-issue in my first relationship.

I have an anxious attachment style with intimate partners, and I have really poor coping mechanisms when I feel anxious. I have more of an avoidant/non-existent attachment style with my parents, and a secure attachment with my friends and son. I've been in therapy for a few years, but only recently learned about attachment theory.

I'm finding myself hurting so much more from the ""breakup"" from this ""unofficial"" relationship with a woman I've known for only 3-4 months than the breakup from the relationship I had for 3 years with my kid's mother. It's been about 6 weeks (almost half the time I've known her) since we broke things off, and I feel like I've made very little progress in healing. I'm consumed by thoughts of her. I know I messed up pretty badly, but I don't know if we were a good match either way -- She is very ambivalent/wishy washy, and that intensified my anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some advice/support on healing from this. I don't know why I am struggling for so long and so intensely from someone I met in July. I've been through a lot in 27 years, and I feel like I'm at an all time emotional low, but that could very will just be recency bias. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that:  
(1) Perhaps my long term relationship was also very difficult to move on from, and I just don't remember the details since it happened a few years ago. And we were going through legal issues simultaneously, so I think I was preoccupied by that rather than thinking about the breakup, but idk, I have a hard time remembering how that breakup felt.

(2) My first relationship was with a person who was objectively not a very good person, whereas my most recent partner seemed like a vast improvement, but there were still some subjective issues, e.g., her being ambivalent/wishy washy, that I don't know if I could have been OK with long term.

(3) I was never in an official relationship with the recent woman, so maybe I'm caught up with all the ""what ifs"" because there wasn't a chance to see how it could have went long term. But we started off terribly, and things ended terribly. I do feel responsible for most of it, but I don't know if we would've been compatible even if I didn't have internal issues.",21Dec2019,1

597,"Hello everyone, I'm 25 and I graduated college back in May in IT. I got a job in my field in July and was very happy and hopeful but as I lacked experience and they were under quite a bit of pressure to get their numbers up and still had people leaving for better work. They couldn't afford me the time to develop my multitasking and troubleshooting skills. This was a service desk job and I was there for about 28 days despite doing all I could to improve and I was just not enough in time. I was devastated for a while and went back to my old job at Target. Living with my parents paying off the car I had to buy in a huge hurry to get out there as well as my student loans. I've had a few interviews since then but no offers. I haven't even been looking since Mid-October. I still feel pretty discouraged right now. I don't know how to get into it again.

Before this, I didn't really do good at one of my internships which is an understatement. My performance was bad. I've been worried they would say bad things about my performance if they called them or say I didn't work there at all. I wanted to take it off my resume but there is an article I wrote for them basically saying how great they are as a company and how good they are. They refused to take this off the site at my request. So now I feel like this is going to keep me from getting another job in my field. All they have to do is google my name and they'll see the article from that place I want to take off. So I guess I feel trapped.",21Dec2019,1
598,"I’m currently attending college, full-time student w/ 15 credit hours per semester. (This is what I have to maintain in order to be given student loans) I’m commuting from home to save money, but there’s still a tremendous amount that I have to pay. An expected $400+ per month. This wouldn’t be unreasonable, but I’m currently unemployed.

That, on top of having recent and potentially (probably) re-recurring spinal problems (slipped Discs in lumbar-spine) have limited my ability - and frankly my want - for a job. I’m going to have to get one, but my medications, as well as the environment I was raised in, have caused me to have a less than appealing communication skill-set. I don’t think direct customer service will be an option for me, nor will anything with a large amount of heavy lifting (because of be back issue.)

Furthermore, my parents are about to split, and I’m going to have to live with my mother - who had been covering what the loans wouldn’t up until this point - who can no longer because *any* new form of housing will be more expensive than where we currently all live. I need to get a job to cover my college costs, start repaying on my piling up loans, as well as help my mother out in this time. I’m also trying to get down to a more healthy weight.

Let me get right to the point: We’re staying on a hotel because my uncle is visiting us for like a week and a half.
Our hotel allows pets, but it comes with a charge of a hundred bucks. I told my mom I’d pay half of it, and then she and my uncle can pay the other half. And whenever we go out, we can leave our dog with my aunt (that lives on the same city as the one we’re staying in) so she doesn’t get lonely, anxious, etc.
Long story short, she said no: she said that’s a lot of money (which it kind of is) and that she’s not going to take care of a dog like she’s a baby.
She said she was done with responsibilities of that kind a long time ago.
So, that means that if I don’t do something, she’ll stay alone on Christmas Day, and probably a whole week. We have a neighbor watching her everyday, and taking her on walks, but they also have plans for Christmas.

So I’ve been talking to this girl that I really like for a couple years now. Flashback to a couple years ago she and I worked together at the time and we first made contact because one of our co-workers told her that I had feelings for her. So for the first couple months that we started talking we actually tried dating and I took her out a couple times but unfortunately things didn’t work out. Soon after she realized that she wasn’t interested in a relationship we talked things out and were able to at least maintain a friendship. At this point in time I kind of understood why things didn’t work out because she and I went from literally not talking at all to all of a sudden dating. Going forward a few months she and I continued to talk just as friends and one day I came out to her again and told her that I still had feelings for her but again she told me she wasn’t interested in a relationship. We were able to talk and work things out and we continued our friendly relationship. I then did the same thing about a year later and again she told me she wasn’t interested, but this time I decided to back off for a little while and stop talking to her to try and get my head on straight (because honestly this was messing with my head a lot at this point). This brings me up to where I’m at now and I feel very confused because I feel like she and I vibe so well together, she and I share a lot of the same interests as well. My feelings for this girl are so strong that I honestly find it difficult to become interested in other girls. Also given all the times I’ve tried to move our relationship to the next level we’ve been able to work things out, we’ve never once gotten into any heated arguments. She is one of the sweetest girls I’ve ever met and I genuinely just want to make her happy. I know that as of right now she is not in a relationship with anyone so this leads me to my question; do I stay persistent in hopes of one day getting with this girl or do I just try to get over it and move on to someone else?",21Dec2019,1

It’s always been this way, and even though I am the oldest, my sister has learned how to get away with murder and boss me around through correcting my every mistake in public and in private. I am usually the scapegoat because I am older, and my parents tell me my sister has such a good heart and imply that if I would just “get along” with her we would be happy. 

Another one of our squabbles happened today, and for once I tried to “get along” with my sister. Unfortunately, it didn’t go well, and now I am scared to tell my parents because they will undoubtably blame me for not being “nice enough” to her again. 


So while my sister was unloading the dishwasher she found some bowls with spots on them. She asked me about them. I said I didn’t know why they weren’t being cleaned and told her to put them back in for another wash cycle. She asks if I scrubbed them, and I say no, because generally you don’t scrub dishes you’re loading into the dishwasher. You scrub them while they’re being put in the sink. She has never loaded the dishwasher before. I told her that she should stop focusing on telling me how to do my job and just do hers.

Later on, after I got done loading the dishwasher, I wanted to advocate for myself and hopefully reach a compromise with her about it. It’s the holidays and I really want to improve my relationship with her. The conversation went like this. Word for word.

Me: (Sister’s name), to prevent what happened earlier with the spots on the bowls, how about we all scrub our dishes before putting them in the other side of the sink?

Sister: (gives me a death stare) I always scrub them.

Me: No you don’t. I have seen you not scrub your dishes before. 

Sister: (in a sassy tone) How about this, you ignore what I’m doing and focus on yourself, just like what you said earlier. (turns back to her video games) 

I just retreated after that burn because I didn’t want to start a fight. My parents usually get upset when I try to go to them about this because they think we should be able to sort this out ourselves.

615,"This is kind of a long story so I’m gonna try my best to keep this as short and sweet as possible.

So I’ve been talking to this girl that I really like for a couple years now. Flashback to a couple years ago she and I worked together at the time and we first made contact because one of our co-workers told her that I had feelings for her. So for the first couple months that we started talking we actually tried dating and I took her out a couple times but unfortunately things didn’t work out. Soon after she realized that she wasn’t interested in a relationship we talked things out and were able to at least maintain a friendship. At this point in time I kind of understood why things didn’t work out because she and I went from literally not talking at all to all of a sudden dating. Going forward a few months she and I continued to talk just as friends and one day I came out to her again and told her that I still had feelings for her but again she told me she wasn’t interested in a relationship. We were able to talk and work things out and we continued our friendly relationship. I then did the same thing about a year later and again she told me she wasn’t interested, but this time I decided to back off for a little while and stop talking to her to try and get my head on straight (because honestly this was messing with my head a lot at this point). This brings me up to where I’m at now and I feel very confused because I feel like she and I vibe so well together, she and I share a lot of the same interests as well. My feelings for this girl are so strong that I honestly find it difficult to become interested in other girls. Also given all the times I’ve tried to move our relationship to the next level we’ve been able to work things out, we’ve never once gotten into any heated arguments. She is one of the sweetest girls I’ve ever met and I genuinely just want to make her happy. I know that as of right now she is not in a relationship with anyone so this leads me to my question; do I stay persistent in hopes of one day getting with this girl or do I just try to get over it and move on to someone else?",21Dec2019,1

617,"So. I'd rather not explain into full detail about how I got into the mess I'm in. But I'm currently in high school with all As and Bs, I'm a good student, I never start fights, I never get in trouble, and all my teachers like (I guess) me. My dad took my phone away 2 years ago, because I was getting bad grades at my old school, and I was watching inappropriate videos. **Which I have already learned my lesson on, since that was a long ago.** He recently gave me my tablet back last year and I bought a laptop with saved up allowance money from my grandma, because I have earned good grades and I don't talk back like I usually did. I've asked for a phone ever since a few days after I bought my laptop. Since I live with my grandma because of personal and family reasons, he refuses to buy me a phone because I don't live with him, yet he doesn't let my grandparents get me one because that's his ""responsibility"". Now, since Christmas is near, I really want a phone so I can start taking pictures and be able to talk to family and friends daily, so I don't waste my grandma's battery, or use the house phone all day. I'm trying to make a list of why I **need** an iPhone (since this is an iPhone family, if that makes sense). I already have stuff like to keep in contact with friends and family, taking pictures of fun moments, emergencies, and whatnot. So I need more reasons to why I need a phone and how I've learned my lesson and whatnot. I hope I said enough to give everyone an accurate representation of what I need.",21Dec2019,1

Hi Everyone, sorry if this is long

Hoping others can give me advice on a very important career situation. I have been working in the medical field for one company for over 10 years. It was the first organization I ever worked for, a non-profit, and I loved it. They were a community focused organization and very mission driven, as was I. Through the years I shined in the organization and had multiple promotions and came to a high salary for my profession (problem 1). A few years ago my boss and mentor, whom I totally trusted, asked if I'd be interested in directing several grants and thus shifted my salary to these time limited grants. It was another good opportunity and he said once they were done he would pull me back into the organizations budget. So I went for it (problem 2)

Several months after that, a very large academic medical center took over my center, and installed all their own leadership, and my boss was pushed out. This new company is private, and is ultra driven by the financial bottom line, they have an army of data analysts, and the vibe is not about any mission to help the community, but turning profit and everyone now is the best and brightest (problem 3). I don't shine as much and everyone who had worked there has these conflicts about the change in mission and company culture, as there is no loyalty or friendly feel in the office at all. In my department there are over 100 people and everyone is running round, appearing stressed about productivity, and don't have time for small talk or smiles.

The grants which fund my salary come to an end in a few months (problem 4). The grant did not spend down all the money and he assures me that the surplus will carry my salary through all of 2020. Of course details are vague. My new boss is nice enough and says he wants to retain me, and I believe him. Leadership says they will find some creative solutions if need be. Of the two options he said they are considering, one is interesting, the other is very boring to me. They want me to stay to help the community where I was raised. And in one year's time, much changes in healthcare, and new grants can come, others may leave or retire, other opportunities may arise. So basically it's ""hang in there and we want to find a solution and within 12 months we are pretty confident we will find a position for you and be able to fund you""

I've been looking for jobs for my title and in my salary range for 3 months, and there have been only 10, and **only 1** has interviewed me (problem 4). However, I really liked the place and they were super warm and welcoming, loved my experienced, and are also mission driven and a community focused organization. They sound much more relaxed and disorganized. They are surprised that I'd leave an academic institution for their non-profit and feel I'd bring much to the table and want me to leave my mark with all my experiences. I was shocked that the salary there is only 4,000 less than what I currently make, so that's pretty equal. The one thing I didn't understand is they asked twice if I was ok leaving the generous pension fund behind as they don't have that, but they have a 401k that they say is 3% first year then goes to 10% second year. (They are sending me the benefits package monday so I don't know about all the benefits besides this and salary).

It's hard to leave behind the only company i've ever worked for, but in a way that company doesn't exist as it became a for profit with no charitable mission. And I'm lost in a sea of the 'best and brightest' and don't feel too valued. On the plus side it is very close to my house (15 min versus 40 minutes), very close to my kids school, and close to where I grew up. At this stage of life starting over feels like a big deal. But there are definite positives at starting at the new place.

**I am feeling like i should use the offer from Company B to try to stabilize my situation at company A. Or at least see if they can get me better job security than jumping around to all these grants which inevitable end. Any idea what is the best strategy to do that, the best language to use? It's delicate and I don't want to ruin things with Company A in case Company B doesn't pan out.**

639,"TL;DR at the bottom, so here goes.. This time last year a kid who graduated in the class below me took his own life. Another friend of mine spiraled after he heard the news, and fell to drugs for his comfort. Earlier this year he OD’d and thank god he survived. Less than a month after, a friend I knew growing up and played sports with, hit a uni bus head on and passed away as well. About another month later, a friend I knew just as well hit a tree drunk driving and passed away. After his funeral I developed anxiety and panic issues that have been haunting me. To top it off 2 more people I was friendly with passed away soon after. But the straw to the camels back came on 12-8-19. Yes Juice WRLD died, hearse because of Percocets, but I hadn’t heard from my best friend all day about it. I called him, his parents went to his house that Sunday, his car was gone, I was worried. Although, it wasn’t uncommon for him to do his own thing and avoid his homies for a day or two. Monday comes and I go to work trying not to think about it. I succumbed to my worries and tried all of his dads phone numbers past and present, used google to find more info. Ultimately ended up messaging him over FB messenger. After work I had enough and was going to go to his house myself. As I’m pulling up I sense a feeling of unimaginable dread and anxiety. There are 6 cars outside of his house, and after knowing him for 13 years I’ve never seen that. I walk up to the door... walk in... and all oh his extended family is there. I then ask “Where’s *****”, and it will haunt me until the day I die. His uncle I’ve never met introduced himself, put his hand on my shoulder, and said my beloved best friend passed away the night before. If you’ve ever heard someone losing their mind, that was an understatement. I collapsed and bawled like I never have in my life. His girlfriend had convinced him to take Percocets for his first time. We agreed as brothers to never cross that line. It was laced. He couldn’t be revived. I am lost in this life right now. I need someone or something to distract me other than fucking work. I hate this hand I’ve been dealt right now. Losing my mind guys. Just losing my shit every day. Fuck. What do I do next? How do I improve this dread and utter sadness?

640,"On Jan 28th, i was 48kg. So i started lifting weights. I am now 56kg. However i look like i have gained a lot more. 

I do a lot of exercise because of walking to and from school, my job involves a lot of walking around and i also do martial arts which burns a lot of calories. Plus gym sessions

I am already eating 2850 calories as of last month but did not gain any weight, meaning my fat got turned into muscle. This is kinda scaring me now as its unhealthy to be losing fat when I’m already low on body fat.

I do not buy the shopping at home and we usually do not have high calorie foods at home. I eat around 1000 at school no problem, but now in the Christmas break i cant get those calories as easily at home. I think id need to be eating 3300 calories a day which quite frankly is not possible for me.

Quitting martial arts would be a realistic option because it burns so many calories. However i basically need it to keep my mental health and my parents would be mega dissapointed.

I don't want to turn this into a life story but I've been pretty much on my own since a kid, dad loved crack and smack, living in project housing(still do) and 2 crackhead little brothers running around getting girls pregnant living that life (not in a teenage rebellious way, these motherfuckers are DANGEROUS) 

One of their kids (my nephew) stays here most of the time if he's not with my aunty, I take care of him mostly since my mom is just old and shit, she did her best with what she had but yeah she has no energy to do anything anymore.

If the picture comes across clear enough in terms of situation, here's where I've come to a crossroads.

I was doing all the things I'm so hypocritical about my brothers and all that shit are doing. They just copied me, I was so self unaware when I was growing up - they all thought I was the shit because I was the oldest and walked around like I was Gd up but if anyone knows what it's like on this walk of life, that shit is an act and we make it up so we don't get stepped in our neighbourhoods. I'm not a guy, I'm not some ruthless drug dealer or killer without a conscious (even tho most slanging are just trying to get by I get it im not throwing shade) but were scared and feel unprotected growing up and that's why we act like this 

I'm kind of lost of words and got lost in what I'm asking for here.. I've been medicated for ADHD since months ago, and I don't know if it's because it made me think clearer or something but I'm only JUST becoming actuslly self aware of my surroundings and my environment. I have no one to talk to, no one to ask for advice, I don't know where the fuck to go from here. 

My money isn't the problem, my nephew, mom and I is all I support right now - they rely on me totally and have been since around 2014, it's enough money for me in a 1 bedroom apartment and live comfortable, but I can't just run out on them like that I couldn't live with it - I can't take them with me. Anyway I'm lost for words..  I'm trying eat right, not think about girls right now, I stopped smoking weed but sometimes shit gets crazy so I need to hit it sometimes.. I don't even know what answer I'm expecting to get out of this I think I just want someone to give a fuck coz I realistically know that statistically I ain't gonna mate it

I did the math on where I'm from and my environment and my chances of not being dead, on jail or strung out on Whitney (if they aren't supported from a young age to help guide them correctly) and it's pretty clear I'm not gonna make it

I’m an extremely outgoing person, but it’s a tiny public school with only like twenty-some highschoolers so I was under the impression that everyone would already be in cliques and would have no interest in me. But, to my surprise, I made friends within the first week and everyone seemed to love me. I developed a friend group, and it felt nice knowing there were people that genuinely cared about me.
Cut to this school year. It started out fine; everyone seemed to respect me and enjoy my company. But the past couple of months have been different. My friends have started to pick on me. A lot. Don’t get me wrong, they picked on me last year too, but it wasn’t that often and it always felt very playful. This year, though, it feels like I can’t get a word out without one of them insulting me, and it always feels sorta personal. For example, I’m basically the only one in the group with good grades, so they CONSTANTLY call me a nerd. I also joined the basketball team, and they’re all good at it, but not so much me, so they call me “bench”. They say a lot more than just these things, but you get my point.
I know what you’re probably thinking: “they’re just saying those things because they like you, you just need to grow thicker skin”. Frankly, that’s what I told my self at first. But here’s something I’ve noticed: they don’t do it to anyone else in the group. They’re all buddy-buddy with each other, but not so much with me. They don’t say hi to me, I’m the one that has to say hi to them. But they say hi to each other. Sometimes when I’m trying to associate with them they’ll straight up say stuff like “you’re just not one of the bros” and make me feel like they don’t want me there. Again, I wouldn’t feel this way if they did this to everyone, but they don’t; it’s just to me. They claim it’s out of love, but when everyone insults you constantly for the same thing over and over and over, it starts to feel less like playful banter and more like disrespect. It feels like they couldn’t care less about me; like I’m only there to be made fun of. I can’t have a normal conversation with them, because no matter what I say, they just insult me for it. And I can’t ask them to stop, because I know they’ll make fun of me for that too. And if I try a comeback, they just belittle me and tell me it wasn’t funny.
Don’t get me wrong, I am all for picking on friends. I think it’s a perfectly healthy and fun activity in a friendship, as long as it’s done in moderation, and they other party knows it’s all just fun and games. But that’s not what this feels like.... it feels personal.
My relationship with them doesn’t feel genuine anymore. But I can’t really avoid them because, as I said, my school is really small so I don’t really have a whole lot of options. I really want to be a real part of the group, but I don’t know if they feel the same way. Maybe they like me and it is legitimately out of love, but there are times when it really doesn’t feel like it. It’s gotten to the point where I sometimes feel depressed thinking about it. I just wish I didn’t care about their opinions, but the truth is, I do. I just don’t know what I can do to feel like an equal, because right now, it feels like I’m just the doormat of the group. I feel alienated, because I’m the only one in the group that they belittle like this.

655,"Over the course of a year, I've been really working on myself physically and emotionally and I've made some really good friends along the way.

What I need is another perspective as to why I get so down when I hear one of my female friends say that they miss their ex-boyfriend/lover.

I feel partially that it comes from a longing to be loved by someone else than family and it can come off as needy, but are there other reasons I need to tackle? And how do I stop being needy?

P.S. I have a great and supporting family and made some close friends along the way in college. From time to time I'm reminded that I've never been on a date before or kissed a girl, and I sink into this hole for at most a couple of days.",21Dec2019,1

657,"Our family has gotten together on Christmas Eve for gifts and then a traditional dinner on Christmas Day for over 40 years. Due to a medical condition, my grandma asked my mom if we could do gifts this weekend instead, which wasn’t possible. My mom suggested just doing everything Christmas Day. She declined since aunt 1 was hosting a Christmas dinner for her family, my grandma and aunt 2 and her family. We weren’t told because they were trying to ‘keep it small’. The thing is, they lied about a secret dinner last year so they didn’t have to invite my uncle and his family. When my mom called to tell me this she claimed to be sick, but it sounded like she had been crying. I should add that her dad passed away a few years ago and  due to this medical condition it is most likely her last Christmas with her mom.

I’m struggling to figure out if it is okay to be bothered by this or not. I was a little sad about it this morning and am worried it will cause me to feel uncomfortable on Christmas Eve for no reason.",21Dec2019,1

At my new location I feel miserable and the store is in shambles, already had a run in with the manager

He then proceeded to tell me that he's only teaching us because they love us. He told me to relax, smile and hug him back multiple times. I faked being okay even though I was already having a panic attack.  Every time.he moved I flinched and moved back. It ft like iwas breaking because the reason I was scared was because of them. But then they're telling me that it's okay, that we should stick together . It was very contradicting.

667,"Soo.. today is my 18th birthday and I just got back from my birthday party with my family. 
All my other friends already started their driving lessons, some of them even have their license already, but since I really struggle financially, it's never been an option for me.

But my parents surprised me out of the blue by giving me money for my birthday. I thought it was more than enough to afford my driving license.
But then I chatted with my friends and one friend told me how expensive it really is and I can just barely afford it ( I might even have to save money for another year).. This means that I won't be able to spend any money on my hobbies, clothes, food, anything really..

I am so thankful for the support I received from my family, but now I feel really pressured.
I'd feel guilty if I didn't start my lessons as soon as possible, but I also want to spend money on myself. 

Getting a job would be the smartest option, but I'm busy with school ( I'm in 12th grade and school is only gonna get harder ) , I live on the country side with a bad bus connection, I'm at my dad's place every other weekend (so I wouldn't be able to reach my job) and I have really bad anxiety, so I'm really scared of looking for a job.

All these things may just seem like excuses and maybe they are, but I just don't know what to do now.

I just almost had a panic attack, but my other friends kinda calmed me down. But this is still on my mind. Should I just wait and spend some money on myself while saving the rest or should I ignore all the stress and get it over with?

If I do go easy on this, I don't know how to tell my parents. They must have saved up for a long time for this and I don't want to disappoint them.. I'm scared..",21Dec2019,1

The store manager explained that there were only 5 staff members in the store and that they were close and team oriented to have a good relationship. I thought this was perfect! I'm married and need a stable job and so I happen to be the perfect candidate. The manager even told me that I would be getting paid more than what I asked. 

He then told me that, of these 5 staff members, 1 was a female. Now, with me being married I can careless. I have worked in customers homes and customer service inside a store, so I trained myself to give everyone the same attitude and tone when speaking. While the interview was coming to an end he wanted me to take his business card so I walked with him to the counter. Low and behold, the 1 out of 5 staff members, whom happened to be a female. For a 20 mile radius of this location she is 1 of 50,000 people... And it's my ex. Not just an ex I knew. But one I lived with and was with for over 2 years. Seeing her was awkward as F***... After that, I took his card shook his hand and left. 

So now I am at home, with his business card, deciding if I should call back and explain the situation or let things play out. The companies relationship is what keeps them in motion and is something that shouldn't be bent. Also imagining how this could impact my relationship, concerns me on whether or not I should take this job. Plz help reddit.",21Dec2019,1

Since then, I have been trying to get on disability for my issues but have run extremely short on money. This upcoming Monday I have an interview for a part time position where my boyfriend works so that I can hopefully have some extra cash for food and necessities. However, it is a minimum wage job and I still likely won't be able to work there until the new year.

Luckily enough my boyfriend and I currently live with his parents. While I don't pay that much in bills, I still have a $30 phone plan, $80 monthly medicine, and have to buy food for myself + boyfriend who also pitches in on groceries. 

What do I do? Can I go to food pantries? How can I afford to pay my bills? What about gas, as that's another $200 or so a month.

677,"I just want to preface this by saying that this is not a request for financial advice, but rather for what other people would do in my place.

I bought an apartment 2 years ago, and have been renting it out while staying with my parents. I drive an old, 1999 Toyota Corolla, and I would love to get a new car.

As of today, I have paid off 50% off the loan (from a family member, not from a bank), and since I got a pay increase when I moved to my new job at the beginning of December, I can pay off the other half in 15 months.

If I buy a new car, I would take 30 months, or a bit less, to pay off the apartment, while still paying for the car.

Now, as I am studying my degree part-time while working full-time, it really feels like I deserve to spoil myself and get a car, fully loaded with all the extras.

So my advice request can be broken down into 3 options from what I can see:

1. Buy a new car with all the extras and take 2 and a half years to pay off the apartment.
2. Buy a cheaper, but still a new car, and pay off the apartment in about a year and 9 months.
3. Keep my current car and pay off the apartment ASAP.",21Dec2019,1
679,"Hey team/fam/community I just accessed because I don't know who to talk to about this,

I'm just a guy who wants to leave a huge legacy in music, business, and love.

It's been going well; the enterprise so far consists of an retail product line for LED band accessories; a festival RV rental/artist relations service; sample packs and online courses for production for the specific type of niche music I came from, for sale on my artist page; and an 'ever' so slowly development of my music production. After a 24 yr professional music career, I don't doubt that 'the gigs are coming', as I will be ever present online and engaging my community and the shows book themselves with enough grassroots efforts put towards the scene/community you care about. There's even a new company I'm starting that helps musicians make money from home, recording covers to give as gifts online. (learn more about that [here](https://forms.omnisrc.com/signup/v1/5df99a1d4c7fa40dd802c661_5df9a16599f0b774ce6065cb.html)) 

However. I am still working a 9-5 job while doing all of this. I don't know how I exis...oh wait I do. I don't work out often. I sleep 6 hrs max a night. I buy ready to eat food. And my social interactions seem forced if they are not professional. Like, I'm so driven and passionate, yet I \*still\* am a human being with, wait for it, a desire for a partner. I'm feeling forced into  a lifestyle where intimacy is completely by chance; I could build a polyamory circle, which means more time put in that I don't have to give (I'd love for a person to get the best out of me, and that's hard enough with one person, never mind multiple, talk about burning a candle from every side). 

Do I mix business with pleasure? Because let's be real, I've got a product manufacturer and web developer who feel like the most romantic relationships simply because we are able to get excited about the same mission I'm on. (They're not romantic nor do I want them to be, I'm just trying to write this to prove a point). 

I'm operating at a level where I don't know how to separate what I \*want\* from what I \*need\*.

I need a secretary, a business partner

to be/not to be confused with a teammate, cheerleader, life partner ? 

I use these dating apps while I'm decompressing after my 16 hr days and I'm thinking, what on earth does my person look like or present themselves like?

Maybe I should just have a regular counselor

Maybe I should be paying for sex so that carnal feelings are a box ticked and I can get back to focusing on work? 

Maybe I need to just accept that I'm to be satisfied with having friends and that physical intimacy is denied to people like myself, and its a cost of the mission, I can be love / be loved when I retire?

My boyfriend is an absolute sweetheart and very very sensitive. Mentioning him at all will result in immediate panic and assumption that you hate him or constructive criticism is taken as an insult and so on. He’s definitely an adorable people pleaser but oh so very depressed. He also asks me if im mad at him or asks how im doing, far too often.

I have tried time and time again to encourage him to either see a therapist or find medications, or *Something*, but he’ll just chuckle and say “yeah..” but never do it. And you cant really force someone so I just leave it at that. 


But now i’m in therapy working entirely on myself. I am learning that I can’t, for my own mental health, keep trying to help everyone else when I need to focus on myself. But I have my wonderful boyfriend with me daily and he has depressive episodes that are draining. 


I cannot stress to you how much I love this man and I will absolutely never leave his side or get upset just cuz he’s got depression too, and I want to help- I really do! I am supporting him every day, best I can but I can only do so much. 



I need to be honest with him. He needs to understand that his habits affect me too though but I know if I say anything, he could very Very easily take it the wrong way and become More depressed...

690,"Okay. I know the title is a little weird, but hear me out.

I (28M) have had this friend (also 28M) for over 20 years. and we've known each other since Kindergarten and have been close friends for around the same amount of time.

A weird pattern has developed lately. When I hang out with him one-on-one, he acts like the ideal friend. Easygoing, friendly, jokes around, shows genuine interest, etc. etc.

But whenever we hang out together in the presence of this *other* friend of ours (whom we've also known since Kindergarten), about two thirds of the time his attitude toward me turns hostile at some point in the interaction. It's a weird dynamic where he'll start openly taunting/antagonizing me or trying to gain some sort of ""upper hand"" over me.

Example: Hanging out having drinks. At first, he'll be the ""punchy drunk guy"" who punches other friends on the shoulder in a brotherly sort of way. But then it escalates and gets more aggressive to the point where he's clearly trying to inflict real pain. And by that point, he's shifted his focus to me alone.

Or maybe we'll be hanging out as a group and he'll start taunting me in conversation without letting me get a word in edgewise.

Essentially, he turns into an asshole. But he *only* does it to me, and *only* in the presence of this other friend. And, like I said, the three of us have known each other since we were kids, and this weird behavior has just started recently. So I'm certain (or at least hoping) that it's temporary and not just who he is these days. That's also why I feel like I can't just cut him out of my life. I grew up with him and feel that I know the ""real"" him. And the real him is not this antagonistic jerk.

It's getting to the point where I dread hanging out with him and I am no closer to figuring out what's going on.

I don't know enough about human relationship dynamics to really dissect all this. There must be something going on under the surface.",21Dec2019,1

My younger and pregnant sister told my other sister, her twin, that something bad had happened, That one night about 2-3 weeks ago, her boyfriend came home, went to his moms room, his mom started wailing and screaming, they called a family friend and shut themselves in the room again, and talked for a very long time. They wouldn’t let my sister in and she tried listening through the door but I can only assume he later told her what happened. All she said was, him and his sister got into a fight with a man who called their mother a prostitute, because apparently she was a couple of years ago, they got mad but decided to invite him on a car ride, and he told her that they dumped his body in a pipe where he works. That’s ALL that I know, I don’t know if it’s true, my pregnant sister didn’t directly tell me, she confided in her twin. Her twin tried getting more information but didn’t get anything.

694,"My parents started inviting my cousin over, all normal. But then slowly yet surely, he's started being treated better than me. At first, he'd come and stay for a hour or two. If he slept over, he used the extra bed we have. Now skip to this day, he has been sleeping over for 3 to 5 days every week, he is allowed to eat whatever is in our kitchen and I'm only allowed to eat bags of cereal. He took all my videogames and electronics despite my constant effort to keep them. He sleeps in my bed and i have to sleep on the old swinging couch in the outside patio. Whenever i bring this up with my mom, she says i am disrepectful and if i talk back, she starts throwing things at me like sandals to plates. My dad always tells me to listen to my mom and if i try to continue, he grabs me by my hair (I'm a boy) and drags me to her. My cousin tool everything, my food, my room, my bed, my games/electronics, my water, my clothes, everything. I couldn't take it anymore so i locked myself in the small storage closet with the mattress i stole from the extra bed, my phone, a charger and headphones.

696,"Yesterday I was walking around with my sister and then we saw a friend and this friend owns a restaurant so he insisted us to have a coffee with us. He was also sitting with his friend at that time but we have never met his friend before. So we all started a conversation.  And we were sitting all together for hours. We all had a good time. We talked about many things but nobody mentioned about their girlfriends or boyfriends. Cause nobody asked and we were playing games. One moment we started talking about soccer teams and they were asking me my team and later they asked my sisters team and my sister told them that she is supporting other team then them but she also said told them that she likes their team too. Then I thought she likes that team because her boyfriend is supporting our friends team, and I asked her what is her boyfriends team and at that moment I did not realize but she got angry and she said that she was embarrassed because from the beginning we did not talk about our boyfriends and when I mentioned about her boyfriend at the end, it was embarrassing. But I just did not do it on purpose. I was just trying to have a conversation. But she said that it was a huge mistake, cause our friends might have thought like we were hiding something. I just don’t know what to do or say. All I know is, I did not do it intentionally and I did not even realize it until she told me.",21Dec2019,1
697,"I feel that the context on this whole situation is very important, as when you read the title by itself the obvious answer is “no.” This happened last night and the answer doesn’t appear so obvious, as I’m still confused on how to feel and what to do.

Context on the guy first; 
he always gave me weird vibes, and sometimes just said inappropriate things that made me uncomfortable (upon first meeting me, he made jokes about me getting gangbanged which was horribly awkward for myself and everyone who witnessed this.) I always just felt like I had to be extra careful around him.

Last night;
I was very very drunk, and I believe he was pretty drunk too. He still seemed a bit functional though, meanwhile I was just gone ahaha. I was sitting next to him and a few others on the couch, and he randomly asked me if I “could help him go upstairs to the washroom.” I agreed and helped him up, and then when he got to the top he grabbed my arm before I could turn and head back down. He pulled me into the bathroom with him and pulled me very close to him, with his arms around me. To be honest, I don’t remember if I squirmed to try and get out or if I just stood there. It was one of the two. I felt paralyzed and trapped. He kept asking me questions, like if I was a good kisser and things like that. I tried to make excuses, saying things like “Hey, you came here to go to the bathroom, I’m gonna go now.” He then leaned in and kissed me, and again I was paralyzed and didn’t move or kiss back. He asked me again and I figured that maybe if I kissed back he would let me go. So I did, but then he still held me close to him. Finally I just pushed his arms off of me, closed the door, and went downstairs. Thankfully he didn’t follow. 

I then proceeded to cry because I felt so overwhelmed in the moment. I know it seems dramatic, but I was really overemotional from the alcohol and something that would have just moderately pissed me off sober made me completely fall apart drunk. My friends took good care of me. I threw up for a while. Then I got a ride home, which I also threw up during. I finished throwing up at home but at that point it was just bile.

In retrospect;
Maybe I was just unclear in my intentions. He had told others that I wanted to kiss him, or that he thought I wanted to. For example, isn’t odd that he asked me to help him up the stairs when I was clearly drunker than him? He was probably thinking he was making a clear hint of “let’s get some privacy”, but I just can’t pick up on things like that, especially when I’m drunk. And, because of my non-assertive nature, I never directly said “no” or “stop” while he kissed me, just made excuses and tried to leave, which he could have misinterpreted as he was also drunk.

I just don’t know what to do or how to feel. I don’t want to immediately villainize him because he honestly may have just misinterpreted everything. It seems my friends forgive him and believe him because they let him stay the night and posted a lot of pictures with him. 

TLDR; A guy made moves on me at a party and I was too drunk to understand what his intentions were. He proceeded to kiss me and I was so drunk I wasn’t sure how to stop him. Everyone else seems to have forgiven him and I feel like I should too, but what he did still really scared me in that moment.",21Dec2019,1
698,"My best friend and I are drifting because she struggles with tolerating my anxiety even though I’m trying my best to work through it. My other closest girl friend is always there for me but we don’t hangout with the same crowd. 

I’m taking a gap year from school to get my mental health (anxiety) under control so my human interaction is limited. I’m a sophomore and didn’t make many new friends my first year. 

I don’t really keep in touch with my girl friends from high school at all. 

I have a few guy friends, but little to no girl friends. Everyone else I know has these nice big groups. 

I feel super lonely and I’m incredibly grateful for my boyfriend in this time because I’d be really really lonely without him. I understand this isn’t a good mindset to have but when we started dating this problem wasn’t as intense. 

I could easily find boyfriends but he’s a person I truly want to be with. I really need more friends though but don’t even have the drive to approach people because of my fear of awkwardness and fear that my anxiety will get in the way. 

I’m sick of hanging out with mostly my boyfriend because even though I love him and he’s my favorite person to be with, it’s just the FACT that I know I can’t continue this way for months or even years on end. 

And before any of you ask if I’m only with him because I’m lonely no. I started dating him before I took the semester off and started becoming flooded with feelings of loneliness. He genuinely is the kind of person I want to be with and I do love him. But I know that I’d he lonely without him.

700,"I'm in my early 20s and a student, I don't know how to deal with my feelings I thought I might come here to get ideas.

I feel like I'm not good enough, my parents and my siblings are successful in their jobs/studies but on my part I've been under performing in comparison and I don't seem to have the same go-getting qualities as them.

I've been dealing with low self esteem and over all being lost for years now.

Growing up I wasn't as manly as the other men in my family, I couldn't relate to my father who was a sportsman. Most of what I got from him was the perception of feelings of disappointment. I used to be shy, introverted and lost in my head (to some degree I still am but I've gained in assurance and manliness to some degree).

I haven't been doing well at school or sports and as far as my hobbies go I've been able to do well to some degree but nothing exceptional unlike others in my family.

My father is very successful and has a high paying job, my mother less but still better than average.

My father has high expectations and in regards to my mediocre performances he dismisses me as a person through suggestion (the rest of my family is also successful and I've been getting the same vibes as them).

My mother it seems, whenever I'm making progress, likes to belittle me through suggestion and becomes passive aggressive unless I'm going in a direction that she wants. It's as if she wants to mould me into a weak person, make me passive and gentle like I was when I was little.

I believe that I should push myself to take steps forward and quick, but I find myself paralysed and anxious. I don't want to make a fool of myself yet again by making wrong decisions,  I don't want them to control me and at the same time I don't know if they have my best interests at heart or not, I don't want to live my life and end up in a place in which I get stuck realising only years after that I have monumentally failed.

I think that I'm smart to some degree but my emotional intelligence (concerning me and other people) is under developed. I have no idea of what I'm capable of and I have no past experience proving any particular useful talent. I believe that if I don't become exceptionally good at something then I won't matter to the people I love the most.

Unfortunately I have spent years hiding from my inadequacies and now I'm short on time, I must face reality but I think my perception of reality is twisted and I'm scared of failure.

Right now I'm under pressure, I must perform or else I will fail. I don't know much of the real world and I don't know what the market is like, I tried to find out and work a shitty job for a while, take a break in my studies, but all that did was deteriorate my mental health even more and it took me a while to recover.

I don't know if I'm just not as capable as them or if that belief itself is a self fulfilled prophecy. I'm also scared that believing that this is a self fulfilled prophecy is actually what is making it a self fulfilled prophecy if you know what I mean.

I feel like I'm trapped, what can I do to regain clarity? I'm overwhelmed.

703,"Hey, I had an exhausting night at my friend's house. I got there at 11 pm and left at 8 in the morning. Four of us got together to celebrate his birthday and he just sort of spiraled out of control. He spent most of the night lecturing us on spirituality, conspiracy theories and his personal belief that he is appointed by God and holds the key to all the knowledge in the universe.


He often talks about this kind of stuff but today it was worse. Things got heated as he was nearly screaming at certain points and wouldn't let anyone else talk for more than a few seconds without interrupting and spiralling into a rant. It was basically the three of us trying to calm him down, trying to explain that he was being self centered and at times his wife would lose her temper. Eventuallt she went upstairs.


Around 3 am it was just me and my friend's brother. My friend kept smoking weed and drinking, going through almost everything we got for the four of us for the weekend in a manner of hours. His brother tried to go to sleep on the couch but he kept talking to both of us even if I just nodded or said yes.


Around 5 am his brother started telling him to fuck off and getting really angry with him. I just turned on music and also tried to sleep but he kept sitting there, smoking and talking, I think literally to no one at that point.


After he'd finally gone upstairs I felt confused and fried (I was on a low-ish dose of acid most of the evening), and went home. I tried to just relax and watch tv and didn't think about my friend a lot.



I just got off the phone with his brother however who was furious about how last night went down and how disrespectful my friend was being. I agreed with that.


Now I'm sitting here collecting my thoughts and it's dawning on me that maybe this is a mental health crisis rather than just inconsiderate behavior.


I don't know if this sounds serious to you guys? I know little about schizofrenia or psychosis. And what can I do to help?


It's hard to approach his brother with this cause he also believes in the conspiracy theories and anti-scientific ideas that my friend keeps ranting about (even though he is angry with how he acted) and I don't know if I could name that as a symptom.


My best friend is his wife who has mentally checked out of the marriage a long time ago. She's on a fun weekend outing with her work and I don't know if I should bother her with this.


They have a son and I think I'm just gonna head back over to take care of him but Idk what else to do.


Sorry I am sleep deprived myself so I'm a bit incoherent.

704,"As the title says, I have a party for a long time friend tonight at her house.  Her and I in the past have had our differences and are currently working on patching up the friendship because of a situation that came to a conclusion in July (a situation she started with another friend, but one I did have an unintentional hand in making worse). I said my apologies where it was due, but understandable so, she said she had to take some time to rebuild trust with me. That’s fine, I’m very reasonable and I recognize where I went wrong.

However, something these recent months has been bothering me about the friendship. Something I didn’t want to confront with myself. In short, between the years 2011-2013, I was in an abusive relationship. A year into the abuse, I confided in her about being worried about being pregnant (he never used protection and at this point 6 days late).  I was so overwhelmed that I confided in her about what happened to me, what had been happening to me, and that I needed help. I felt like I could safely do so because she too suffered an abusive relationship in the past that I helped her leave. After I get off the call with her, I find out that her boyfriend (now husband) was on the call (it was a Skype call and he was out of the camera view). Then I found out she told my abusive ex not about me being worried about me being pregnant, but that I told someone about what he was doing to me. The fact she said anything at all devastated me. 

I was stuck in the situation for a year after that instance. There were repercussions for what I said and I wasn’t allowed to see my friends anymore. Her justification was that, “I introduced you to him and he was my friend first before he became your boyfriend.” When I left the situation, I pushed down a lot of stuff, including this.

I talked to her about the whole thing in winter 2014. She said she only 80% believed me because it wasn’t her relationship and he was believable too. She never apologized for at least going behind my back. She doesn’t understand that it compromised my safety (and back then, it did). 

Then I compared it to how she treated me in this situation, the one she got upset about now. It was chalked up to a misheard he-said she-said. I relayed information that I believed true (confirmed from two separate people) and I did what I did to try to mend a friendship. It indirectly made it worse, and at my friends’ expenses. She said she forgave me, but that I would have to work to gain her trust. 

I’m anxious about going to her party tonight. I don’t know where our friendship stands. I don’t know if I even want it anymore. I want to talk to her about how she treated me (obviously not tonight, but another time), but it’s not an option. I don’t think I can be friends with someone who never recognized that what she did was messed up. I don’t care if she doesn’t recognize how it compromised my safety and the repercussions I had to face, because my ex was the one who abused me. But she sees no wrong, last and only time I confronted her about it (winter 2014).

The third one never really responded.
Anyway, today rolled around and I never heard back from the other 2 so it seemed like all plans were off. I hung out with them last night, and my birthday didn’t come up in conversation once. Then they texted me just an hour ago, with the second friend saying she doesn’t have work and the third one asking what the plan is. 
I’m so grateful that they cleared up tonight to celebrate with me, but before that it really felt like my birthday was a second thought to the two other friends and I was really hurt.

714,"(Context: I'm 23M and I live in an Asian country)

How do I put this. Well, I gambled everything wrong.

You see, I'm a massive jazz fan. Not even the sweet, friendly jazz that you can show to anybody. I'm at the base a Frank Zappa fan who's specifically into his more experimental, nonsensical sounds (we're talking Weasels Ripped My Flesh). While I also adore Thelonious Monk and Chet Baker, I connect a lot with and look for avant-garde jazz sounds (like Free Jazz). Last but not least, I'm also a huge Moondog fan.

If you think that's already such a tiny niche in the west, try and imagine how it is where I live. Even my other idols like Lou Reed and David Bowie, both of which are legendary figures in music, aren't in even a fraction of the public conciousness here. Nobody's at fault, just cultural differences. I just gambled wrong by being probably the only Frank Zappa/Moondog fan in this city, or maybe even this country.

I'm not a social outcast. I have a pretty good social life. I still keep in touch with friends from middle school and up just because I've never had a fallout with anybody and they appreciate me for it. My coworkers like me and I blend in just fine. I also have no problem meeting and befriending new people. However the problem lies more in that all I have are ""general friends"". You know, the ones that you can share the daily life with, but not really there for you to pull into your own world.

I feel like this also affects my capabilities at getting girls. I've never had a girlfriend ever and my disconnection to my own peers is probably related. People always comment on how I just need to stop listening to ""weird music"" or ""old people's music"" and how that will either bore or weird girls out. I do try to get into pop music and once a week I browse for what's trending in music here. I'm not really into it but I reckon it might helpful to know somewhat for reference.

I've tried to introduce people to my kind of music before (in music exchanges like listening to each other's picks). I also sometime queue my music at work (employees can queue their own music at the end of Friday workday). However people just complain and skip it. I know they don't mean bad, they're not mean people, just cultural differences and I gambled wrong :(

Music is just one thing though. I also love movies, but as you guess it I'm mostly interested in older movies. The lovely era from late 60's to late 80's, Walkabout, Taxi Driver, Chinatown, Mad Max, The Trilogy of Imagination, that sorta stuff. My most favorite movie is probably the worst favorite movie that a person like me could pick, My Dinner With Andre. It's extremely tough for me to introduce these to people because movies aren't portable enough. I do go to the theater with friends monthly to watch current movies but no opportunity comes out of that.

I do have a single conservatory friend with whom I by chance had a great evening talking music. But they're not close enough to meet up even monthly. For movies, I don't have anybody. I pretty much discuss everything with foreigners and strangers on the internet. I've tried to find real life clubs, there are only a few closed college clubs which are difficult for me to join because I have no academic involvement or exposure to music or movies. Online groups in my country are very disappointing. I just have no outlet for my interests.

I know some of you will say ""maybe you're not trying hard or good enough"", but it shouldn't be this hard man. This was originally supposed to be about getting a girlfriend, now getting a friend is good enough. I've had a few friends (online) suggest that I try to find a business opportunity somewhere and just move out of the country, go somewhere that's more culturally ""in tune"" with me. But I've lived here my whole life and I don't want to just give up on this city.

I guess that's why I like RedLetterMedia and My Dinner With Andre so much. In all my 23 years of living I've never been able to have that kinda friend or discussion. People tell me I should keep being myself and it will come, but damn ain't it hard all this time. I wouldn't never go back and lose out of the things I've enjoyed so far in art, but shit, you know.

You can play me the first 5 seconds of any pre-1970 Frank Zappa track and I can tell you its name, album, perhaps year of recording, and even personnels. But it's all pointless anyway haha. I sometime regret not having any adventure or experience to tell like my peers, yet I'm also proud of how I spent my time (on music and movies) and turned out right now. This whole thing man, is just bad luck, a big prank.

I'm just really tired now. Maybe just tell me I belong to nowhere like it's a fact, so I can be at peace. Don't give me hopes and put me out there in the sea of unknown for who-knows how long. To know that I'm meant to be alone is land, is firm ground. Don't bury me at sea.",21Dec2019,1

718,"Hi Redditors, 

Asking for some advice. My friends and I have booked a big new years weekend away in another city (same country). To explain my situation - I’m currently a student and working part-time. All of my friends are in full employment and earn full wages. My boyfriend is also coming and among them. So the accommodation that we booked was already over budget for me - however I had already agreed and didn’t want to let people down. The weekend is now getting more expensive as people would now like to go out clubbing for new years (was hoping the plan would be to stay in our airbnb that is a nice house that we have just for ourselves, but they would rather go out) - so that includes extra door entry tickets, drinks, transport in town that I can’t really afford. I’m up against a wall here.

I’m in the position that I am finding it financially difficult to join this weekend away. My boyfriend has offered to pay for some of the expenses but I find it difficult to accept as having my own financial independence is important to me. It is not the first time I’ve been in this position because of my friend circle and our different circumstances.

She just started to treat me with sass, every other sentence she reminds me of all my imperfections and throw indirections every time she could, and she wonders why I don’t talk to her. her favorite insults are that I’m useless, said in different more (not to) subtle ways, that I’m autistic and it feels like I have Down syndrome.  
Even before that I already have problems and she knew that.
My dad recently send my with his part of the family in other state and i was so happy that I forgot how I felt, my dada said that my mother relaxed, I foolishly thought that she reflected on her ways but first thing when I came back at 2 am, she didn’t even blink at my.

I have a lot of mental health problems.  I'm bipolar and have BPD.  I'm scared to let people be close to me, so I act mean/ tough. No job-- I break down and run.  Same with school. 

Two of my dogs died this year.  Sisters.  Cat I've had for 11 years is getting gray hairs. It might sound silly, but we spent almost half my life together.  She doesn't tolerate my bullshit and she leaves if I'm too demanding.  I love her so much.

726,"So throughout my childhood I’ve had many instances where I would feel trapped, like I was doing something wrong, where he would be yelling at me or my mom for something we did. I never understood what I did wrong. But I’ve went through a good part of my life living like I was always in the wrong, waiting to be yelled at, diminished of my self confidence. I still do, even at 19 years old. 

It wasn’t until I went through a few psychology and philosophy classes in college that I really started to understand my father, and his frame of mind. What I’ve learned is that he is very manipulative, he will guilt trip us into doing things he wants us to do and having my mom buy him things he wants. He will also say the most crude things and when received with any criticism he almost immediately plays the victim, proclaiming us as the ones “ganging up” on him. He will sometimes go out of his way to do something for us in a weirdly kind way, like cleaning for us or buying something and later uses it against us when he wants us to do something for him (I realized this and won’t let him do anything for me anymore).  It seems as if we can never win against him and his manipulations, and it has been instilled in me that winning  against him is the wrong thing to do. Because for me to win he must be the one to lose, and that makes me the bad person. 

I’ve also noticed his extreme anger issues. He sometimes walks around the house in a constant state of looking for something to be angered about, it seems. We have cats, and he will sometimes walk into them and scream at them for being in the way. He will punish them for retaliating (hissing) by screaming or hitting them. I see it and I can’t help to think that is how he treats me and my mother as well (except the hitting part). Any minor inconvenience will set him off to a level 10, screaming “FUCK!” or “SHIT!” and everything else. He will go out of his way to go to you to complain about something that set him off, whether it be something about his personal relationships, something he did to himself, even things that have no real remote affect on him, such as the unfortunate outcome of the ball game. But he makes it so much of his own problem and beats himself up over it and ends up taking it out on everything and everyone around him. Also adding onto the ball game part, if our team loses, he automatically is in the worst mood, and takes it out on us. I dread looking forward to the days when our team plays. 

He does have his good days, when he will walk around in what seems as he is in bliss, and he will want to connect with me and ask me to hangout. I look at him and I can feel the hurt he’s brought to me and I can’t allow myself to allow him to get any closer to me so I tell him no, and he gets upset over this and blames me for changing. Changing into someone who doesn’t want to hang with him anymore like I did when I was a kid and he reminisces on those days. 

He does have a legitimate problem however, he has permanent nerve damage, and thus drowns himself in marijuana and prescription medication, which only seems to mitigate the issues, if not make them another issue to have when he runs out of his supply. This damage only occurred recently though, and his anger and immaturity had lasted years before. 

I feel so bad for my mother, as she is the one who takes the most shit from him. I try to talk to her about the situation and reason with her about him but she doesn’t want to listen. She knows he has problems, but it seems to me she’s been dealing with them for so long that she doesn’t know how not to. I do stand up for my mom, I come back at him with his crap when he is taking it out on her, and he does initially retaliate but later realizes his faults and apologizes to her. Now listen, I’m not good when it comes to communication with spoken word, I’m much better at articulating my words over text. So it comes as a great difficulty to talk to my father and the things that are at issue with him because it comes off the wrong way and as I am harassing him. And he uses my slow processing with words to his advantage to come back at me and make me feel stupid with what I am trying to say. He doesn’t want to hear anything about anything that has to do with his actions and the things he says that are negative, so it comes at an even greater difficulty to communicate with him. 

I just feel like I’m stuck in this , and I want better for my mother and I. We’ve been in each other’s lives for so long and they’ve been together for almost 10 years longer than I’ve been in the picture. But I don’t know what I should do. I desperately ask for help in this situation.",21Dec2019,1
727,"Where I live the weather fluctuates a lot between warm and cold so my tire pressure has gone up and down slightly.

BUT recently I had my back left tire go completely flat overnight. I used fix a flat  and haven’t had problems with it since. That was less than a couple weeks ago. Now my front tire on the right lost all of its air completely but it started slow. I filled it up and the it dropped back down within 20 minutes. I’m gonna put fix a flat in it now. Two tires going completely flat within a small timeframe seems really suspicious.

I do stay in a poor area of town. I wouldn’t put it past my boyfriends brother in law to do something like this. He hates his life and has been rude to my boyfriend and others but especially awful to me over the years.

728,"It’s really a long story but just this morning I ended a relationship with the person who’s been my everything for the past three years, and to me that felt like forever. We went through so much together, but after awhile our interests were different and I tried to go along with what would be ‘best’ for our relationship and her and what she wants and needs, but I found myself being lost in it, so I knew I had to end it. I postponed talking about how I felt or bring it up for a long time, because like, I loved this girl, even though I knew I couldn’t provide when she needed and her I, I wanted to believe our love would surpass the problems. I was her one and only, and she truly wanted to believe we’d be together forever, and so did I, but I grew distant from her because of my Internal conflict. We finally broke up after a conversation we had just this morning and I don’t know quite what to do with myself. While I don’t regret anything, or the decision, I feel both guilty, disgusted, and relieved.

729,"I’m 21 and I literally suck at romantic relationships. My first one was at 15 and I jumped into it because he was the only guy that shown interest in me and I wanted to say I dated someone before. Everything he did (kissing, hugging, cuddling) made me uncomfortable and he could tell I wasn’t reciprocating and I was uncomfortable and we lasted a month into the relationship.

I determined I wasn’t ready for dating, and put off dating all of high school and I thought I’d find someone in college but it never happened. I really wanted a relationship, but I never met someone in my life for that to happen.

Flash forward to 20 and I decide to get tinder because I wanted a real relationship to happen. My two older sisters both found their guys outside of dating apps and it always made me jealous. I get tinder and go on a couple of dates but it never went past the first because I wasn’t interested in them or too nervous to go further. I talked to this one guy for 4 months but we never met in person, and I was head over heels for him even though we never met. He never felt the same way towards me because he stopped talking to me.

I recently met this guy in November on tinder after going on there sad and lonely one night and we hit it off. I thought he was attractive. We go on a date and I immediately was nervous and all giddy after and knew I wanted to keep seeing him more. As the dates progressed with him things hit a roadblock when he wanted to cuddle with me.

I remember cuddling in my last relationship at 15 and how uncomfortable it made me. I had that familiar uncomfortable feeling come back and it worried me.

After he cuddled with me on his bed it felt too fast, unnatural, and I didn’t have any desire to do it with him.

We kissed on the fourth date and I felt nothing from it, he had to be the one to ask me.


It’s been a month and we are still seeing each other but not officially, and I’ve been overthinking everything so hard and flipping back and forth deciding if I like him or not. I keep thinking if I keep seeing him the love and trust will grow but there’s some attraction now but not completely. I got comfortable with cuddling him and I find it nice now, yet making out is still weird for me and I told him that.


Just now he texts me asking why he’s always the one initiating cuddling and kissing (which isn’t always true-I do start cuddling with him) but he feels as if I’m not interested in him and thinks we are moving too slow and he’s not used to moving this slow in his past relationships. I keep telling him it’s my first real one and I’m not used to everything he’s doing, which is true but I also don’t know if I like him enough or if that will eventually grow?

I keep getting flashbacks to my month long relationship at 15 and all this same stuff happened, always the guy I’m with initiating, me uncomfortable, him sending I’m not interested and things ending there. I just want to experience love like everyone else and I don’t know what’s wrong with me :(

I’m not lesbian to clarify lol, and I considered myself aromantic during this whole mess but I realized it’s not true considering the fact that I had crushes.

Should I stick to meeting guys outside dating apps? Have I not found the one yet? Am I broken?

I do struggle with mental health issues and I am seeing a therapist soon and talking to her about this. I just want to feel normal and be in a loving relationship and I fear I never will and I’ll never get a husband or have kids and I feel alone and depressed and it fucking sucks!",21Dec2019,1
730,"I (18 M) am autistic, and i live with my family still. My brother (11) clearly has something wrong with him. He always wants what he wants, and will stop at nothing to get it. Even if this means screaming to anyone in the immediate viscinity, or threatening to commit suicide. 

It doesn't matter what it is. If he doesn't get to go to the store with mommy he breaks down in tears and starts talking about shooting himself. If he doesn't win a game of Fortnite, he tells the person to go die. It's like this every day. And, with my afore mentioned autism, i have a very big sensitivity to sound, and especially high-pitched ones like the screeches of the velocerptor i call my brother. It drives me crazy, and makes me horribly nervous/anxious. I can't stand it anymore. 

I've grown tired of this, but this isn't all he does. He does other strange things as well. He talks to himself, has conversations with people who aren't there or even inanimate objects. He sings random verses of random songs in public, and R E F U S E S to use headphones to watch videos on his phone no matter where we are, beit the store, the library or even at my place if employment. He would do something, (i;e leave a dirty plate in the living room) and then push the blame onto someone else. 





I try to tell my mother how these things effect me to no avail. She tells me not to use my brother as a reason to ""not be social with the family.""

As I'm writing this, my brother is having an argument with my step-father because he won't shut up while he watches tv.

733,"Honestly I have no idea how to be an adult. I feel like a little kid in an adult’s body. I act like I’m 10 when I’m actually 21. And they don’t teach you how to be an adult, at least not anywhere that I can find. I want to grow up, become mature and independent like everyone else my age. I don’t want to be living at home and having my mom take care of me and do everything for me for the rest of my life. But I have no idea where to start. 

I dropped out of school a long time ago and stopped trying/caring/paying attention when I was in school even longer ago. Now I regret that deeply because I know absolutely nothing and probably couldn’t get a job to support myself or do anything useful. Another problem is that I’m autistic and have no social skills. I only recently became more self aware that the way I act isn’t normal or acceptable. I’m loud and blunt and can’t think before I speak no matter how hard I try. 

Due to another health problem I have I can’t do a lot of walking or moving around. (We’re still not sure why nor my doctor). So even if I do get educated enough for a job, what job could I possibly do that doesn’t require a lot of movement? How can I ever be normal and fit in? 

I have a fear of talking on the phone and can’t stand being around most foods. I’m very picky and don’t like the taste/texture of most food items so being around them makes me feel sick. I can’t cook or do dishes because of this. 

I spent my whole life just playing and having fun and not worrying about the future but now I’m completely unprepared for adulthood. I have so much catching up to do but I feel lost on how to accomplish all this.

Can someone please teach me how to be an adult?",21Dec2019,1
736,"Okay me (19) and my bf (21) have been having the worst time trying to get into an apartment whether that be with roommates changing their minds the very last second or not meeting income requirements or not be able to find anything affordable.

We’ve also been extremely rushed from his russian mother who is a whole case in itself which I’m not even going to get into.

We applied to many so we’ve wasted quite a bit of money on apartments.

We finally found one that was in our price range in a great area and had all the features we wanted.

I personally am just staying with my bf and his mom right now. I’ve only been here like 2 months. I don’t have family to stay with. I do not have parents. I grew up in foster care. And for the past few years have kinda just been living around. My name is NOT on the lease since I was only staying at this apartment with them temporarily and me and my bf were gonna move out soon anyways.

Now we applied to this place. Thinking everything was gonna be fine. We don’t meet the rent requirement but they said they do credit with conditions so we basically just put a bigger deposit down. Thought that was taken care of and that was our only issue.

Now I’m finding out that apparently my application personally is being put on hold because of my address. I explained, I’m not on the lease here no. But I’m just staying with my bf for a little bit till we get on our feet which is what we’re trying to do.

Now may I mind you this is the most bizarre thing I have ever heard from an apartment complex. How could my name not being associated with an address cause me to not be eligible to move in???!!!

The person I talked to just worked at the front I guess. But she said she wasn’t sure what to do about the situation and asked if I had any other addresses I could use which I said “no, like I said I’m staying here temporarily....” at this point I’m getting pretty annoyed because we just spent $400 on apps and admin fees that won’t be refunded because of some bull like this. I would like to demand my money back because I have never ever heard of that before. And that’s so incredibly bizarre and unheard of I feel that type of policy would be something to mention. They REQUIRE an address what am I supposed to do?

Address: “Car”
Address: “off highway 183 on the corner of research.” Like that logic doesn’t make sense if someone is homeless and trying to get a place. And I’ve lived in my car before so this is ridiculous.

All the lady at the front said “my property managers would be the ones to deal with this because I am not sure how to go further with this. But they won’t be back until Monday.”

I asked if the apartment would at least be put on hold thanks to my bf application and they said yes.

Totally unsure of what to do and before y’all suggest yes. I did think about just taking my name off the application and just living there without my name on the lease. Only issue to that is this place requires each car has stickers on them and they have a tow truck every night come and take cars that don’t belong there. So that’s where I’m stuck I wouldn’t have anywhere to put my car.

Any loopholes y’all can think of or advice? It’d be super appreciated. Thank you for reading!",21Dec2019,1
738,So a girl school that I like asked me if I wanted to throw a Christmas party together. I said yes and she asked if we could have it at my house. So the day of the Christmas party comes(which is today) and I wake up at 7 to start cleaning the entire house and make baked goods. I based the entire party around her and got all the foods and drinks that she likes because that’s what I do for a girl that I really like. The entire house was completely clean and had not even a speck of dust. I baked until 2 in the after noon(I started baking at 10 in the morning). Then three hours before the party she tells me she won’t be able to make it. I didn’t know what to say so I left her on read.

740,"The title is a tl;dr version of my post.  I've been alone my whole life (besides my parents) - no friends, no loves, plenty of crushes.  No one wants to be near me in person.  Girls specifically will run away screaming at the sight of me, and one even went as far as falsely reporting me to the police for harassment.  All I did was be within 30 feet of her, I didn't even know her nor look at her.  One even called me a Big Hairy Monster, which couldn't be further from the truth.

No guys want to be near me in person.  In fact, a group of three people once actually invited me to be a part of their ""inner circle"" as a friend, and for two years I believed them.  At the end of those two years, they revealed to me that they were pretending to be my friends this whole time, and that the ""bully"" that they defended me from earlier was actually another friend in that inner circle and the whole thing was staged.

To be fair, I do have some issues.  For starters, some staff-to-me abuse and wrongful alternate placement caused me to drop out of high school.  I don't have a ""real"" job yet, but I am earning 8 dollars per hour, 2 days per week.  (This might eventually increase to 5 days a week, but that's besides the point.)

Additionally, I have Asperger's Syndrome, making social interactions near-impossible.  This is why I found my first friends on Discord less than a year ago, but I still haven't revealed my voice to anyone.

I'm currently suffering through some heart issues which prevents me from leaving the house, but my interests lie solely in computers which prevents me from leaving the house anyways.  I live in my parents' house, so there's that.

I don't want to learn how to drive, not because the test seems too hard, but I have severe anxiety, and what if I have a panic attack and ram myself into a wall?  No, anxiety medicine doesn't work on me, I've tried every one under the sun.

My point is, I'm lonely.  I have a close circle of friends now (all male), but I feel the need to have a significant other, a person to love besides my parents because parents.  But the previous statements prove that my chances of finding someone are extremely slim since I can't go out on dates, or at least how dates usually work.  Also various factors are preventing the previous complications from improving.

My only course of action is to find a girl my age on the internet (social media or otherwise) and hope it works out.  I did find a 20-year-old who seemed my type and was just as broken-down as I am, but she rejected me.  It also doesn't help that not many places have an accurate ""single/in a relationship"" sign for each person, that would help me avoid talking to people who might be in a relationship already.

How should I proceed despite my issues?  Any non-sketchy non-predator-filled places on the internet to find a significant other that's my age?  Wishful thinking, I know, but there has to be an alternative to dating somewhere.  Even a distant relationship would be great.  I find it impossible that there's no girl out of the 7,000,000,000+ people on Earth with a similar life to mine - there has to be someone.",21Dec2019,1

My boyfriend and I live on our own and live on a top floor flat. The flat block I live in is only 3 flats and we all have a floor each. They’re quite big flats so we decided that he could have his own area of the living room for a setup for gaming as long as he didn’t get too mad and chuck things as i don’t want anything broken, any trouble with the neighbors and I know that they also have a baby downstairs. 

When he gets back from work, the first thing he does is turn his computer on, as well as waking up in the morning and from doing anything else. This is quite frustrating as i feel that I have to make the effort to spend time together.

When he gets angry at his game, he shouts, like really shouts, some of his friends have stopped playing with him because of how bad it can be. He used to be worse and went through 20 controller in about 2-3 months which of course is A LOT of money. We both work and money isn’t an issue but having to spend that much all the time simply because someone kills him in a game is painful. He doesn’t tend to chuck things anymore but I was getting ready for an overnight and he has been on his computer all day and has been getting a bit annoyed but not shouting. He woke me up from a nap because he was shouting REALLY loud so i text him and asked him to stop. I then heard a loud bang and went out to tell him to stop again and he threw his mouse against the wall and said “You telling me to stop shouting makes me more angry!” So I said “Why are you being nasty? I just asked you to stop shouting because I was asleep and it’s 9pm and we have neighbors.” I bought him a new mouse for Christmas too that cost a lot of money and I don’t want to give it to him if he’s going to break it. This isn’t the first time he has said something similar to this and isn’t the first time that he has shouted at me over the game.

Unfortunately, my parents have decided to get a divorce, and I’ve requested to change my last name to my mother’s maiden name. Neither of them would stop me, but they aren’t happy with it. The primary reason isn’t for the divorce, or the negative impact my father has had on me. My last name is weird, and I get a lot of shit for it (think Butts, Gaylord, Pusey, etc.).

Is this a stupid/rash reason to change my last name? I understand their perspective that it represents a disassociation from the family and all that, but that’s not what it is at all. I don’t think a last name should represent who is or isn’t family anyways. Keep in mind though that this is not an amicable divorce, our family is kinda divided right now b/c my father made some bad choices. 

I just strongly dislike my name, and I’m really insecure about it. They say as I get older nobody will give a shit about my last name, but even if that’s true, it’s a self esteem thing for me.

759,"I’m an 18-year-old guy starting my first year of college this semester. I went to a really small private high school, with about 150 kids, and knew everyone pretty well. Last year I heard through some mutual friends that this really shy, pretty girl two grades below me had a thing for me, but I was in a relationship at the time and I didn’t really take notice. My last relationship ended over the summer and it was a pretty messy breakup, I was pretty upset for a while. Then one day I was out with some friends and we stopped in a little antique bookstore we frequent and turns out that pretty girl from high school works there. We got talking about school and work, and she was super friendly and charming towards me. I bought some stuff and left making a note to go in the next weekend and try to get her number. It didn’t go exactly as planned and she kind of seemed to panic when I asked for it, I told her there was no pressure, and apologized for putting her on the spot at work like that. She kinda mumbled that she wasn’t looking for anything at the moment and I left. I went to a friend's cabin that night and around 11 I got an Instagram notification: she had reactivated her old Instagram account, apologized saying that her mom had walked in just as I was asking, gave me her number, and asked if I wanted to get coffee sometime. We set it up and got coffee and walked around town for a couple of hours. Honestly, it didn’t go very well, I was really tired and had to pee really badly for half of it like genuinely thought I was going to piss myself. We wrapped it up and her mom picked her up, I asked her if she wanted to do it again sometime and she said yes. Later I texted her saying I had a good time and whatnot and asked her again if she wanted a second date, she said sure and then I proposed a plan and she didn’t respond for like 12 hours and I sent a second message saying it’s all good if she changed her mind and she responded with a nice little message saying she wasn’t sure she had the time or mental space (whatever that is) for a relationship, but that she had fun. Great, I got shut down. Now normally I would just admit defeat, but this girl is actually perfect for me like really, I need to date this girl. I think a big part of it is the fact that I’m in my first year of college this semester, and she is still in high school, and I think explaining that to her parents is a bit tricky. I went into the bookstore with some friends again last week, and about a month after our coffee date, and she happened to be working. We talked a little bit and I seemed to make her really nervous, or I guess just more awkward than usual. My friends and I are all getting together for New Year’s Eve and I want to invite her, but I’m not really sure how. I don’t want to scare her or make her uncomfortable, but the only way I can really talk to her face to face is when she is at work. I’m just not sure what my next step should be or if there should be the next step at all. At advice is appreciated.

Recently I was using his phone to Google maps something and Instagram was open - neither of us have Instagram (that I knew of). He has a page that he started posting to a month or so ago. He posts videos of himself in the car talking about disability stuff, making weird noises and being really over-the-top. It was really weird for me to see...like it was just so unexpected. Why wouldn't he tell me he was doing something like that? I don't know it's just thrown me a bit. Especially since all his videos are about support and motivation and stuff and I have really needed his support in that time and he hasn't really delivered. It seems like he just follows typical follow-for-follow pages and stuff but it still leaves question marks in my head....does anyone he know follow him? Is he talking to people on there?

764,"Hello all, I apologise if this isn't the place to do this, or if I accidentally trigger anyone, hence why I marked it as trigger warning because that would be my last intention of this post.

Since the beginning of this year, my cousin (13F) has been acting.. Off about her weight. I'm only 5/6 months older than her, but have a few mental disorders myself so I understand how hard it is to be fighting through it.

Backstory here:
Her mother (my aunt) isn't the most understanding person. I'd say she's on the line of being verbally abusive at times, and my father and her have had multiple arguments and the such, leading to our families having a bit of a grudge. We used to see each other a ton when we were younger, we still do but not as much. We go to the same school also.
She likely wouldn't care if I brought this up to her, so I don't even think anyone would take me seriously.

I thought maybe I could bring it up to my parents but they were pretty much making fun of the whole disorder, which I told them was unacceptable as its very real and affects people in horrific ways, but they didn't really get it.

Back to now:
She's skipping lunch, and sometimes breakfast. She's stopped eating fast food and is obsessed with eating healthily. She has had a pretty dramatic weight drop and she was skinny before hand. I'm getting increasingly more worried, she's obviously not doing okay but we don't usually have serious conversations. We have had a few, but in general she's hard to get through, and is quite closed off.

So, I have a few questions. I am more than willing to personally help her through this, I'll do anything, and I will be consistently there for her. I know she'll have slips and I know it's not going to be easy, but I am more than willing. I also won't try and push her to recover, I know it's about being ready in your own right or it'll be hard, but I also want to make sure she's as safe as possible. 
How can I best help?
Is there any food I can get that she would eat more willingly?
How do you guys like to be talked to about the subject, do you find you get triggered easily or anything like that?
How do I start that conversation?


And, yes, i am trying my best to get an adult involved, but I don't want her to get worse by involving the wrong one.

774,"My mom is from a large city in California and I moved to a tiny town in Oregon that haps maybe 3,000 people in it. Whenever she comes to visit me and my family (husband and two kids) she is always doing things that are rather embarrassing. She is very ""Californian"". She is loud, impatient, rude, and displayed other behaviors that dont blend well with the slow easy going nature that is the small town I live in.
  
One example was when we went out to eat and the waitress was swamped with our table and two other large parties and forgot my moms beer (at 11am 🤦‍♀️). When the check came she started loudly exclaiming how she didnt want to pay for the meal and how its bullshit that the dumb waitress couldnt do her job. She decided to pay for the meal but didnt tip. I told her to stop being rude and to just tip because she may not be coming back but our town has 4 restaurants and me and my husband would be coming back here and we didnt want to be known as the jerks who dont tip. I left some money on the table but on our way out she went back to the table to take the money back. I told her to knock it off and she proceeded to make a scene but eventually left the money. 

Another time when I was picking up my son from school she came with me and the whole time she was loudly commenting on the other moms saying they looked like meth heads or crack heads. I told my mom to knock it off because they could clearly hear her, but again she didnt said she didnt care cause she didnt know these people, but again I told her I have to see these people literally every day and that she was being rude. 
  
Another example is when we are driving around in town. In CA the speed limit on the highways are 65-70mph, in our town they cap at 55mph. Everywhere we go she is either speeding or yelling at us to drive faster despite the posted speed limit. I hate when she drives because she is cut off locals and drives very aggressivly and when we pull into a store front it feels like everyone is looking at us. 

Other than straight up banning her from visiting till she can behave is there anything I can do or say to her that will make her understand that she cant act like that? I dont think she understands the concept of a small town. I think shes so use to living in a large city where people come and go and you can embarrass yourself because you won't see the same person twice, but here I see the same folks every day. She said I'm overreacting and no one cares but I told her there is a reason why people from OR hate people from CA and she is like the total embodiment of that stereotype.

780,"So here it is: 

I am about 45% done with an AA in liberal arts and 30% done with an AS in business administration. 

My ultimate goal is to go for vet tech, but I wont be able to start on that degree until next fall, so fall of 2021. I figured I could finish one of the degrees above by the time its time to start my vet tech degree. 

My dilemma is that I really want to go the liberal arts route. I would enjoy the classes more, it would take less time to finish and i thought it would look good to at least have some degree as opposed to the nothing that i have now. Plus my vet tech degree will be my practical route. the one that i'll be able to find a reliable job with. 

Now, on the other hand i have some of an AS in business somewhat completed. I was just wondering if this would be a better option as I have always had some business ideas and would like to open my own one day. But this degree would take longer and I'm not sure I would be able to finish it time for when the vet tech program starts. Plus I heard/read that its not super useful if you don't go for your bachelors afterwards.

Being rejected and sexually starved from my ex would get to me sometimes resulting in a fight that sometimes led to us both crying. Is this something I grow out of (the high sex drive) as I get older or do I need a woman in my life that also has this much of a desire?


Odd title on the advice page I know but I didn’t know what else to put. I don’t think I’m special or anything I feel like I’m a normally horny 21 year old dude but the desire is there 24/7. I masturbate at least 3 times a day but it’s probably between 3-6 usually. This huge desire is what caused me and my ex to break up. I wanted to have sex every single day, sometimes multiple times a day, and she really only wanted to once or twice a week. It was just so hard to be rejected from my ex 7-10 days in a row when her reason more than half the time was “I don’t want too”. 

On a personal note, sometimes I would lose my composure and ask why she always said no and that the excuse “I don’t want too” isn’t valid for two weeks. I did hundreds of things I didn’t ‘want’ to do for her, including some sexual ones. I know this is a personal thing I need to work on but I guess I’m asking if this level of sex drive is normal?

793,"Hi all. For the past few months, I have felt stuck inside of this delusion I can't get out of. 

I feel as if everyone and everything is physically and mentally against me. I've felt like this since October, because some things were going around about me at school and some people were mad at me. This drama has since faded, but it has left me in a black hole of paranoia and anger.

There are lots of things that I could describe, but i'll only describe the biggest things for now. One of the biggest and most constant feelings I get is paranoia. I have a severely tough time trusting people and believing that they geniunely care for me. I've even asked my best friend if he would truly care if I died, just so I can verify he cares about me. That's just one of the smallest things i'm paranoid about. The highest fear I have is that someone is trying to kill me. I feel like someone (possibly the government...?) will kill me soon and that I do not have much time left to live. I've told myself that this is no way true, as I am a 13 year old child who does nothing. I have emotional breakdowns a lot and have even thought about suicide.

I tend to get angry at/snap at people randomly. I often believe that they are talking about and/or plotting against me. If they joke about or mention the rumors from October, I get really defensive and angry. If strangers are talking and suddenly look at me, my mind immediatly jumps to conclusions and assumes they are against me. 

I can't live in this delusion anymore. I've tried to tell my family, but they dismiss it as me being ""silly"". I need help, not someone who will call me crazy.

And from this we came to an agreement that we were okay, and that we still care for one another but we will never see each other in that light ever again.

Fast forward to current day, his dad is a taxi driver. He is a lovely man and just so happened to have picked up my current boyfriend. My boyfriend was unaware that his driver was my ex’s dad. They had small talk, as you do in Taxi’s and then my boyfriend made a passing comment that by being a nice guy got him his current girlfriend because he stole her from her ex. Fast forward, and he realises that this is my ex’s dad. He seemed dead on, and happy enough.

Then I got home, and I had received a text from a mutual friend of my ex and me. He said that he wanted to come forward because he found that what my ex was saying was unfair. My ex had been calling my a psychotic bitch, and the only reason he keeps contact was because he was being nice. 

This kind of hurt me because I assumed we put the hard feelings behind us, but perhaps not. The thing about this whole scenario is that he is the one to start conversations with me, I have not started a single conversation with him in the past 9 months after we said we put all bad blood behind us. And he has been commenting on my posts, and popping up a lot recently.

What does he want?",21Dec2019,1

Some background here, we work together (I know, I know) and while we’ve had “almost” hook ups several times, it took almost a year before we actually did anything. We never flirt at all in the office (we don’t work in the same department nor are either of us each other’s boss) but we always hang out in social situations and have a really good time. 

This may very well just be a drunk hook up to them but I guess I’d like to get an idea of how I can see if maybe it’s more than that to them without just coming out and asking.

I get on well with most people that do talk to me, I always joke around and like to think I can be fun to be around once I get to know people, but I very rarely initiate the conversation unless I know them very well because I always feel like I'm pestering them. This is how I lost most of my friends from school/college/uni.

I know there's more to life than just playing video games but I don't like going out and doing things on my own and don't have the friends to go out and do it with. I don't really enjoy my own company which is why I play a lot of video games as it is, it let's be focus on far too much else to be alone with my thoughts.

There 2 courses particularly gives me a lot of trouble, first one is called Special Topics which we build a website by ourselves from start to finish and we need to present it at the end of the semester as our final exam and other one is my senior project which is like a thesis. Problem is both of courses' lecturers are demanding a lot of work for every week. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I manage to do is to work on one project for a week and I give some excuse to other course's lecturer. Even if I do that it just takes a lot of my time, some nights I don't sleep. I've gain a lot of weight but I literally have no time to go to gym. Fuck, I don't even have time to read some book.

823,"Hello everyone, 

Basically, my girlfriend is obsessed with pets. Currently, we are renting a house and we are allowed to have 1 cat and that is all. We currently have 1 cat, 3 bunnies, 4 hamsters, and two chinchillas. She takes care of all of the pets well, and keeps the house clean, but she really lets them take up the whole house and the bunnies poop everywhere all the time and it pisses me off. She recently went on a trip and left me to take care of all of the animals, and I really am feeling like I’m losing my mind. I feel like I’m not standing up for myself enough about not wanting so many animals. Every time I try to bring this issue up with her she says “ugh, you didn’t seem to have a problem before. You’re being so rude just calm down.” The worst part is she announced to me recently that she is going to buy 2 more cats, who are the nieces of our current cat. She’s infatuated with the idea that they are blood related, but I am really feeling like our house is full already, and also the two kittens will cost $2000, and she is spending this money behind her parents back. She is an international student living with me in a house in America, and I’m just like fuck what happens if you leave the country or move back home? My parents already made it clear that they won’t take the animals. She says her parents will come buy a house in America within the next 6 months, and then she will move all of the animals to her parents house, and the new cats will only be with us until they do that.

She is overseas traveling in Taiwan right now and this feeling just keeps boiling over in me, I can’t continue to clean the bunny poop and do all of this stuff when I don’t even want the animals in the first place. I’m just miserable, and when I texted her and called her about it she just says “we’ve talked about this, they’ll just be at our house til my parents buy a house.” And she tells me she’s going to “log off now because I’m being rude.”


I’ve basically drawn up a plan at this point and I want to tell her that if she gets the two cats, I’d like to take my name off of the lease and move our effective immediately. She probably will just think I’m being annoying, she never treats me like what I’m saying is serious, but I really want to do this.

He is 27 years old and he is constantly talking about this childhood. If anyone else is sharing their problem he will find a way to make it about himself.  He has this need to always talk about what happened in school, with his cousins, his great father (a recurring topic) etc. His stories are always a bit exaggerated and anyone is close to him can tell that there is no way this guy did the thing he is saying he did. He is timid and awkward in social situations but acts like a lion when he's with his close friends, I happen to be one of them so I couldn't help but notice these things over the past few years.  He cannot handle criticism well, or at all, and is always in a defensive state. The  most annoying part about him is his need to oppose every view presented to him. He has the need to play devil's advocate for everything, regardless of the fact that the information presented could be totally new to him. He will still oppose and never just agree. He has taken a lot of bigoted stances just for the sake of playing devil's advocate. This has made me question my friendship with him as I'm not sure I feel comfortable being friends with a bigot. But considering he has been my friend so for long I have this urge of helping him, letting him know that its annoying and he  needs to change his perspective about a few things. However, as I said before, he does not take criticism well, even from his closest friends, and is defensive about everything.

Every time we bring up the topic of him getting  a girlfriend he goes silent, probably the only time he's silent because he talks A LOT. Unnecessarily a lot.

828,"So today I got some texts from friend A, she was talking about how she got super wasted the night before and couldn't remember anything. I got concerned but put it off because my other friends, friend B and friend C, were all reacting with nonchalance and humour. But then, later at around 10:30pm I got a few more texts from friend A. She got/is getting wasted, again. This time I showed my concern, I was sort of freaking out because this isn't how kids (we're all 14 y/o girls) behave, right? I was telling friend A to stop drinking but she kept drinking and didn't listen to me. She also kept drunk texting us and sending audio clips of her laughing and saying weird things with someone in the background. I told her to stop and to get some water before she does anything she'll regret and then she spoke about how her mom was also drunk and her god mother kept giving her drinks at the Christmas party they were at.

I then texted friend B, I told her how I was really concerned for friend A and was wondering what we should do, if anything. But then friend B reacted with such apathy, she was saying how it wasn't a big deal and it's happened before, that she and friend A have gotten drunk together. I was asking her why they would get drunk like this and the only answer she could provide was ""yolo"". I'm sort of sceptical about this because I know the negative effects of alcohol on young kids.

Am I honestly overreacting and I should just not worry at all because it really is 'no big deal' and it's just a normal thing around here (Britain - I'm not from here originally). Or should I actually do something because I am really concerned about this. It seems so out of character for them. Plus friend A and B are both working through some stuff with their mental health, more so with A as she's been getting therapy and everything. I really don't want to overstep any boundaries and come off as essentially an overpowering prudish downer. However I also don't want to stand by and watch my friends do something dangerous that they might regret and do nothing to help/stop it. It's making me uncomfortable because substance abuse is something that hits hard with me and I don't want them to go through that, even if it is just a 'one time thing' because it might turn out to be more than one time and soon it's an everytime thing. Maybe it's just because I've never really seen young people like us get drunk and having that be viewed positively, or it's a cultural differences thing.",21Dec2019,1

837,"I was messaging doordash help on Twitter with his phone and I had exited out of it and saw her name and a message asking if he still uses Kik. I couldn't help myself so I read like their last few messages and he had said "" I missed you, loser"" I know he was saying it like a friend and I have no doubt he loves me. But it hurt and I guess he knew I saw it or was scared of me seeing it because I checked later and the chat was deleted. Am I a terrible person for looking and doubting him? Am I a terrible girlfriend? Doesn't anyone know what I should do? Is it terrible to check that? I feel so terrible. Ugh I wanna die.",21Dec2019,1
838,"Today I found out that a long time free d of my family passed away due to a hemorrhage. Today was going great, I had been hanging out with my friends, joking, playing, and then this bomb was dropped on me. The entirety of my house is in shambles except my little sister, who's had a very emotional attachment to said friend, but we haven't told her that they passed yet. I just want to understand why it is I'm not distraught right now. I loved that friend so much. I went to their wedding. I spent hours at conventions with them. They were one of the first people to accept my family into their group, and yet I'm not crying. I'm not curling into a ball and dying. I feel confused and hurt and depressed, but I don't understand why I can't bring myself to cry. I feel like there's something legitimately wrong with me. My minds going a hundred miles a minute but I still can't understand how someone can just be gone like that",21Dec2019,1
840,"I have made one of my biggest mistakes today and I need a little bit of help figuring this one out.

So, my husband and I share a queen size bed that he has had since before we met. It's an okay bed, but it is covered in brown stains. 

In a moment of brilliance (or not so brilliance), I got the idea that maybe I could clean aforementioned stains out of the mattress with laundry detergent, some water, and a sufficient amount of scrubbing. That was the idea anyway. 

Now it is almost time for my husband to get home from work. It's been six hours since I tried scrubbing the stains out. All I've succeeded in was soaking the mattress and adding my own blue stains to the bed. 

My question is, what do I do now? Is there any way to dry this quickly? I've tried an iron, but its incredibly time consuming and I'm not sure it's the safest option. 

Also, how do I explain this to my husband?",21Dec2019,1

843,"I (18M) saw this girl (19F) (we’re both college freshman) I’m interested in post a TikTok vid and it went like this: “Things I lost in 2019:”, “my will to live”, “my lungs and liver”, “good grades”, and “my virginity”. I don’t think she was joking about anything, she was being self-depreciating. This isn’t the only concerning vid she’s posted. 

Is this a major red flag and am I right to be worried? Not long after she deleted the vid",21Dec2019,1
844,"I got into my dream school RISD early decision (binding) but i got 0 financial aid. I also got into my second choice Parsons with around 55k worth of scholarships and financial aid, meaning i’ll only need to pay 10k a year.

My family can afford the 66k-70k risd price tag (i just need to do some serious budgeting) and i am absolutely in love with RISD and not so much Parsons...but i am losing my mind over the money situation. I can literally finish my education at parsons for 1/10 of the amount at RISD. I’m not even sure if you can repeal the ED contract. Tbh i’m not even sure what i’m trying to ask for...
i’m i making a mistake going to risd instead of parsons? Is the education going to be worth it? Am i even going to be able to pay off my debt? please help calm my mind 😭",21Dec2019,1
845,"I live in PNW and want to start solo hiking/traveling. What are things/tips I should be aware about? Mostly concerned about transportation since people have said to be very careful driving alone and to carry extra car tools, things etc. 

As far as hiking gear goes, what do I need besides obvious things like hiking shoes, first aid, water bottle etc.? 

Any other tips in general would be greatly appreciated.",21Dec2019,1
