0,"I have had a interest in a pals gf for some time. And it was mutual. What spikes the interest is kind of hard to tell because when i start to think about it i just get overwhelmed. Anyway, when my friend and his gf broke up, she moves back where she grew up (6 hour drive away) couple of months after their split, she and i became best friends over a platonic base (snapchat, texts, later on phone calls) and we both found out that we really liked each other. Weeks wendt by and we had been sexting, video chatting and all that cliche stuff. Then the trouble came. She friendzoned me all of a sudden and told me that she was ""really sorry and that she still had feelings for her ex / my pal"" the entire thing is as usual, complex. There was alot of ball's in the air between us during a short timespan. We both got on again of again platonic. We started acting like children. We met up, had a date. Made out like animals. We were supposed to go to my place and buck bot i lost my keys..... i know i have made a real impression on this girl, and as has she. What stands between us is her lingering feelings, and that she has now moved to a new location (just a two hour drive) to study there for a year. But she says that she wants to be a ""independent woman"". I get a little bitter just by the thought because the same day that we had met up and i had lost my keys, we discussed what we ""were"" with much passion and she still wendt out and slept with a tinder date back where she lived at the time. I'm a highly logical person if one sees past the situation. To me that way of acting is kind of bothering me. Do you people have any advice for my convoluted experience?",31Aug2019,1
1,"I live 9 stories up, and have never had an ant issue before (roaches, sure. But not ants). Recently I have been noticing ants milling about in the kitchen and bathroom. I live relatively cleanly for an early 20s guy, and have lived here for 4 years without ants.

2,"I'm not a superstitious person, but my apartment is starting to really creep me out. My boyfriend and I keep seeing these weird shadows all over the place. Not anything huge, like a person or figure, but little movements in strange places. I hear weird sounds all the time—it's an old apartment, which might explain that, but also it's old enough for this place to be a prime candidate for something spooky. I know this seems like a shitpost but I'm really, seriously freaked out. Any de-ghosting advice, Reddit?",31Aug2019,3
3,"My grandfather was watching Fox News for 12 hours per day the years leading up to his death. He became very angry and frustrated with the world in his finals years, when he should have been enjoying himself. 

My grandmother now watches hours of Fox News every day. She's afraid of what the evil, socialist, leftist, liberals are trying to do to the country, and outraged at how unfairly the media treats our greatest president. 

I saw how it affected my grandfather, and I know it's affecting her in the same way. I've tried so many times to explain that it isn't good for her and there are better media to consume, but she doesn't listen. 

Is there an effective Fox News intervention?",31Aug2019,3
4,"Hi, I decided to post this on r/advice because no one in my life could give me an unbiased opinion. Backstory, I am only 17 years old, have a permit, and live in the state of Nevada. Legally I am not supposed to drive without anyone over the age of 21 that has a license. I know I messed up, I had just gotten off work and was on my way to see a friend. I’m only allowed to drive the car to and from work., but after driving a couple weeks with no problems I thought I’d come see a friend who didn’t live that far from my house. The car is also my brothers and the insurance is under his name, which I pay half of since he was another car on the insurance. We haven’t put it under mine because it’ll cost a lot more and I don’t have my license yet. In October once I turn 18 I can get a license. Back story over, i was at a 4 way lane, which looks like a 4 way stop but only I had the stop. So I stopped, waited about 5 seconds, looked around, hit the gas pedal when I saw it was clear since I was going straight. All the sudden I hear a honk and a car from my left side hits me, causing me to spin to the right and hit the car right to me. I ended up a couple feet from where the accident occurred. Off the bat I was in shock. 
    “Did this really just happen?”, I remember thinking to myself. I got out and asked the owner of the vehicle to my right that I hit if they were okay. Her cars headlight was completely broken off, and the top front was messed up. The equinox’s driver, (car that hit me from the left) got out and looked completely dumbfounded. Like he didn’t know what to do. The other lady immediately dialed the police and when she did that, the other guy told her he didn’t want to get in trouble and drove off. Me and the owner of the other vehicle talked, and I let her know I only have a permit and getting involved with the police will get me in trouble, and that I am willing to fix her car since at that time I really thought I was at fault. We agreed right before the cops got their too figure this out on our own and not file a report. Cop got their, didn’t ask much about my license or permit or anything. He asked if we wanted to file a report and we both said no, and also let him know the other car had driven off. He told us to park down the street since at that point we were still sort of in the way of others, where the collision happened. 
       As the cop leaves, 5 minutes go by and the owner of the car that hit me, the equinox shows up with his girlfriend, who happened to be the owner of the vehicle that he was driving. She was very confrontational demanding my insurance info and this and that. The only damage on her car was the front license plate had broken off, which we found on my car where he had hit me, inside of the ripped off vehicle part. 
            After discussing it we decided I would pay the damages, because at the time I thought I was at fault, being knew to driving and never being in an accident, and how they were treating me and the situation. But the owner of the car I hit called me and let me know she thinks it was his fault because he hit me first which caused me to hit her. So she got his and mine insurance involved and now the guy’s girlfriend is also going through the insurance but she is adamant it wasn’t her boyfriends fault. I don’t know where to go from this point, if I missed any key piece of evidence please feel free to ask questions in the comments, and I will try my best to answer them. Thank you, r/Advice.",31Aug2019,1
5,"I’m 33 (if that matters). She’s 26, works as a therapist, first year working.

Last text I got from her was 

“I’m really don’t have any emotional/intellectual energy left over right now and won’t until I’m in a better position in my career. If you could check in with me before asking me long questions, i would appreciate it because I feel like you’ll get angry at me if I don’t respond and then I get angry that I feel obligated to use energy I don’t have.”

(Me getting angry for her not responding was abt a very specific time that a stranger attacked me on the subway)

She makes a regular habit of using therapy terms to make out like what she’s saying isn’t overbearing/rude. 

How do I get though to her? A lot of times I profusely apologize when she acts like this just to mend the relationship, but I’m drawing boundaries now. 

She won’t even have a conversation with me, when she’s butthurt about something. Should I just limit interaction? It sucks when it’s family you care about, you know..",31Aug2019,1
6,"I need an outside perspective.

I feel like an idiot, and now I'm stressing out over all the things I missed while I was busying screwing off during my Fresh-Soph years of high school.

I'm now a Senior, taking AP Physics, AP Lang, Honors Econ/Gov, Math III and Spanish II. Since my school doesn't offer AP Gov't, I'm going to be studying with a small group of students and our Gov't teacher to get ready for the AP Exam in May. That's all fine and well, but now I've got the determination/urge to ADDITIONALLY take the AP World History (Sophomore) exam, and as well as the AP Human Geography (Freshman) exam. I realize they're not at all necessary like the SAT's, etc., are, but I still want to get them out of the way. 

Any advice? Do you think I should prioritize and take only one, or maybe even two?

9,"There's this guy, I'll refer to him as P, which isn't really his initial. P works at a food place on the campus I did my internship in. Let's call the food place N

Backstory: P and I only make small talk. I don't know him well but I do know him well enough to know that he's kind and genuine and selfless and I think he's adorable. There's just something about him, I can't put a finger on it, that makes me like him a lot. His presence is very comforting and he's just a very sweet and likable person. I had a gut feeling from the first time we talked that he'd be special. 


A month after our first encounter, he did something kind and selfless for me that could get him fired or, at least, in trouble with his manager. He did it just so he could say ""thank you"" to me for always tipping him. He caught me by surprise that day. I've been keeping an eye on him, he never did that to anyone else and literally everyone tips him! He made me feel special, like i meant something special to him. 


I've been intrigued by him before this incident, but after he did the thing, I just really liked him a lot. He can make or break my day: if I get a chance to make small talk with him then my day is made. If I don't have a chance to talk to him, I feel like crap all day. I started changing my daily routine just so that I could sync it with the times when he's free and I can talk to him. I buy food I don't want just so that I could have an excuse to tell him to ""have a nice day"" or ""have a great weekend."" Just so I could talk to him. 


I started to spend all day at N and I take my laptop with me to work there, just so I'm near him, in case he wants to make a move. But he never did. The most he did was this: one time he said ""Good morning"" to me as he walked past my table. I know one might think he was being polite, but I could tell it meant more to him because: he never greets people first, he was nervous, AND I saw him smile wide for the first time that day!! He has a RBF and never smiles wide. with his teeth showing. His face turned red even. Am I reading too much into it? 


His face always turns red when I talk to him. He chuckles nervously too (he never does this when others talk to him). There's a gleam in his eyes too, which usually isn't there. His head snaps in my direction when he hears my voice/laugh (if I'm talking on the phone or to someone else at N). He pays attention to me. I feel like a stalker because of how much attention I pay to him haha.


Anyway, I'm not like that. I know I'm not a needy attention hoe, but I don't know if I became needy now. I just really want to get to know him and keep him in my life I guess, not necessarily as a love interest, but just as a human. As whatever he wants to be. I really really like him, as a person, as a potential friend.


Fast forward to now: I finished my internship and I don't go to N anymore. I miss him a lot. Like a lot to the point where I cry myself to sleep every night. He's always on my mind from the moment I wake up until just before going to bed. I guess I can say i'm emotionally attached or whatever. Is this normal?!! Or is there something wrong with me? because I literally never felt this way and I'm very confused by my feelings/actions lately. I haven't been myself.


I left him my contact information before I left, and he emailed me. I replied and that was it. He didn't write me back. I'm sure my email went to his spam folder. It scares me to think that he thinks I never replied, and that I'll probably never speak to him again.


He means a lot to me and I feel like I have no right to say that because we're not even close enough to be friends. Am I excessively needy or am I in love or am I a lunatic?? 


Please help lol

10,"Hey guys! Looking for Redditors who have experienced something similar, or who knows a lot about this stuff. 

I got my wisdom teeth out Wednesday morning and my bottom lip and chin are still completely numb. The dentist said the numbness should have worn off by the end of the day Wednesday and it's now Friday. He did prescribe me some steroids to hopefully help, but no luck so far.

11,"This is my first post ever here on Reddit, so sorry if I'm not the best at explaining my situation, but anyways..

I'm a 15yo girl, and I need some advice or help with understanding something.

Basically, for the past two months, I've been having this thing where I blink for long times and make this noise uncontrollably. I make a weird noise like 'hm' or I have the urge to say words with the letter 'r' in them. Sometimes I have trouble breathing, but it's not bad to the point where I'm gasping for air.

I thought that maybe it was tourettes, but I called my sister, who's fiance has tourettes, and asked her for her advice. She thinks that it might just be stress, but if I start twitching or something then I should go see a doctor. 

I was unsure, but went along with it. 

The reason I was unsure was because my dad does the same thing. When he's working or doing something, he shakes his leg and starts doing the 'hm' noise over and over. I was wondering if he'd passed off something to me when I was born, if that makes sense, and I just want to know if I'm just stressed or not because I don't feel stressed or anything. It's still summer vacation for me, and I've actually been very relaxed.

If I don't make the noises, I feel like I have a lump in my throat and have this weird feeling in my nose. To make the feeling go away, I'd have to growl or snarl for a long time, and I really hate the feeling.

I've searched online everywhere and have gotten no answers.

I've been thinking about calling my dad and asking him, but I don't know when he usually gets off of work since he lives in another state. I don't want to bother him if he's busy, so should I go to the doctor, or do I really have to worry about this?

I really hate making the noises.",31Aug2019,3
12,"So I've been seeing this absolutely amazing woman (23f) for just over 2 and a half years, about a year ago I came to the realisation that I (22m) am also sexually attracted to men.

She has previously questioned sexuality on a few occasions and I have pretty much straight up lied to her, I feel incredibly guilty about this. Now I know she will not have a problem with me being bi (she is herself) , but I have terrible anxiety and basically am aware that I just need to bite the bullet and tell her.

13,"I am F26, my SO is M33 and our next door neighbor is F50s. We’ve lived in here for almost a year now. It’s nice and we like it! Our neighbors are close in proximity but we’ve never had problems. 

A few months ago, we could tell she started doing construction on the inside of her house. It was obvious she had family/friends doing the work instead of hiring a contractor. I assume this requires some sort of permit but I’m not really sure. 

One day, we were coming home and noticed a red sign that said “Stop Work” on their front door. The town must have found out about what they were doing. Jokingly I told my SO that I hoped they didn’t think we reported them. Well, it seems that’s exactly what they think! 

Twice now I have been enjoying the back porch with my dog and I’ve heard the neighbor make loud comments to her guests that felt aimed at me. She said some of her neighbors can’t mind their business and just this evening she said that I was sitting outside just to be nosy. 

We never formerly introduced ourselves but I feel like I want to nip this in the butt before any potential escalation. I’m anxious though. What if I’m totally wrong and seem crazy? Or worse I seem actually nosy for overhearing her conversations. But like I said, the houses are in close proximity. Hearing what’s going on is inevitable.

16,"So I (18M) live with both my parents still. My parents have treated me so well and I am so grateful for them. Our relationship is awesome. However when it comes to my brother (28M) and them it is so off. He always talks about how as a younger child my mother would act more as an authority figure than an actual friend and he is envious of other people who have great relationships with their parents. He didn't say anything about my dad so I assumed he felt the same way about him. He said that he loves them but their relationship is ""weird."" Hearing this made me feel so sad and guilty. He is generally a person who keeps his feelings enclosed. Him and I are close, but sometimes trying to talk to him is like talking to a wall. I feel like I am a huge source of his grief seeing that I have had a great childhood and relationship with them. Hearing him kind of bash them breaks my heart. I feel like I am in the middle of both of them. My parents always speak about him in such a positive manner and they always bend over backwards for him.  Sometimes it breaks my heart when my parents buy him a Christmas gift out of pure love and he just acts so meh about it. Seeing their sudden sadness of being shut down breaks me.  I don't know. I'm sorry if this became a jumbled mess I just feel so incredibly sad and lost. Thank you for reading.",31Aug2019,1

20,"My sister has always been the type of person who would do things her way, with very little interest in listening to criticisms of herself or her choices. She’s never really had great communication skills, and as a result hasn’t had many strong friendships. She’s stubborn and combative; very adamant about her own boundaries but dismisses others’ (mine, my parents, her boyfriend’s). She does have really good traits: she is an amazing artist and is a fun, smart person. She had been in a relationship for about 8 years with a guy and they lived together for 6. This was her first place outside of my parents’ house, and even though rent was really low, he still paid all of it. She had a shitty job that she hated, a job I got her 12 years ago that she never moved on from.  (She still works there.) From what I gather (although I’d say she is an unreliable narrator), over the past year, he’s gotten fed up with her inability to change her work situation, coupled with her constant complaining about it. He’d really been her only communicative outlet because she never talked to the family about job stuff; it made her visibly uncomfortable when someone would bring it up even innocently. Anyway, a few major disagreements over the months led to a big rift in communication. Eventually it sounds as if he checked out, and one night went so far as to ignore all her calls when she wanted him to come pick her up from work (she can’t drive and never went through the process to get her license - another cause of contention at times). She came home and he was in the living room playing video games. This particular argument led to her “cracking her phone over his head” and him grabbing his things and leaving. He came back the next day and completely moved out. He covered the rent for that month and the next. He refused to talk to her and even had the police escort him to the apartment when he needed to pick up his SS card from her. She has shown me screen shots of texts between them as long as six months ago in which he tells her he isn’t happy, and that she should start to look for a roommate. In response she told him to “cut the shit.” He moved out at the end of June. Now it is nearly September and he has expressed to her only that he isn’t ready to talk. She continues to reach out to him, and vacillates between rage and denial. She has been sending messages to our family group chat about how evil it is to “attack someone’s comfort” (referring to the fact that he moved out and left her to figure out a roommate situation). My parents don’t know how to talk to her. If you attempt positivity, she replies with cynicism. She called my parents stupid and dumb recently, I guess in jest, but my dad expressed his annoyance with that and instead of apologizing she justified why she thought he was stupid/dumb. She reaches out to me way more now than she ever has. Earlier this year, she cursed me out and called me a garbage sister when I tried to talk to her about the way she speaks to our parents. This caused some tension, but we went out for her birthday as a family. Not long after that, I ran into her at Starbucks when I was at work, and she completely brushed me off like I was a stranger. Anywho, now her texts to me and the family are solely pseudo philosophical, conceptual paragraphs about why it was so fucked up that her boyfriend left her after so long. I just don’t know what to do or say because advice doesn’t seem to be well received, not that it ever has been. I’m generally the type of person to cut contact with anyone who I feel is toxic or resistant to positive and rational advice. We haven’t always been the closest, but I also feel extreme guilt because I’m the closest thing she has to a confidant at this point.

she doesn’t talk much, a few words here and there but mostly jibberish, she’s also been watching disney’s princess and the frog a lot lately which could explain the kissing thing but not much else. 

i work at a daycare, and she also goes to said daycare, so she’s not in the same room as me but i do see her during the day. that being said i don’t change ALL of her diapers and i do get A LOT of help at home, so a few days ago as well as today i noticed a kind of brown discharge in her diaper. i didn’t say anything about it before today bc the first time i thought maybe it was a little poop but today i noticed it had a very foul smell. 

i trust everyone that is around my daughter while she’s with me, BUT she goes to her fathers house every other week and i only know what he tells me. im not pointing any fingers yet, i just simply don’t know what goes on and who she’s around while she’s with him. 

it’s friday, but her pediatrician will be open for a short period of time tomorrow so i’m writing this to (hopefully) ease my mind until i can call and make an appointment with him. i also have a past of sexual abuse so i just want to know if this is a genuine concern or if i’m just afraid because of my own past experiences.

25,"I’m sorry this got a little lengthy.. 

As the title say I(20f) need some help with my brother(17m) and how to help him get better. 

Some background : I have been living with my grandma for my studies for the last year and he is going to start the last year of high school (France) 

As far as I remember my parents were always nicer with him, especially my mother and he always got away with shit that would get my ass beaten up.

A good example is when he brings bad marks or bad remarks from his teacher, my father will try to rip him a new one meanwhile my mother will always defend him. This has led to a situation where my father grounds for a week or two and my mother goes around that and let him go see friends/go to parties/not be grounded more because it was “enough”. This behaviour from my mother upset so much my father that he said that if she wanted to go around him like that she would have to take care of him completely and that he was “retiring” from raising him.  Since that they don’t talk too much, my father isn’t involved at all in his life, but they somehow all live under the same roof

I have to admit that I’m not that close with him because he still mad at me for snitching on him to my parents. He is an avid weed smoker and meanwhile this isn’t a big problem for me, it became one when he got a moped and decided it was a good idea to ride it drunk and/or high, the whole time snapchating everything. So I told my parents because I was worried for his safety and he’s still angry at me for that. 

Another problem with him is his education, he always had and has a problem with any form of authority, he has already repeated a year and doesn’t seem to know what he wants to do with his life after that, the only thing he seem to care about are weed, his friends, music and having a good time. 

It’s been bugging me for a few months, it want to reach out for him to talk him about his future, about the mistakes I made and how he can learn  from that but I don’t know where to start without seeming pretentious and/or patronising 

So, any advice ?

28,"So I will be moving back to my home country soon and might nit get the opportunity to save up money in my current country because it is too difficult to find a job (8+ months 150-200 applications and not 1 reply).

29," I am currently learning Latin (learning as in opening the book, saying to myself ""i have no fkn clue"" and closing the book"") due to my schools curriculum. Since i go to a private school i can drop it and take up a new language and When i graduate high school i have dedicated myself on going to Fire Academy and becoming a Firefighter Paramedic in Florida where Spanish is very largely spoken language.If i start learning Spanish now i will have a head up in my career field and it will be easier for me to get a job in the specific department i want. I have also been learning German for a while now on and off but i don't have a great grasp on it so i would like to continue learning it because i enjoy the history and the language itself. So i can either learn Spanish which i'm not super interested in but i'm interested in the fact my future could possibly be better with it, or i can learn German which i feel i will not get a lot of use out of but i will enjoy learning it.

30,"A little bit of background:

I'm 15 and I've been home schooled for 4 years. I left school at the beginning of year 7 after trying two different secondary schools, and leaving them both within 3 months due to anxiety. My mum and I then began home schooling and it was going okay for a while, until some family issues occurred, then the routine flew out the window. Anxiety turned into depression, depression turned into weight gain, and all of that combined caused me to literally isolate myself from everyone, I went over 3 weeks without showering, days without leaving my room, I'd eat out of boredom, I cut off all my friends and literally wasted 4 years of my life.

Recently I got a bit better and went to college (a course for 14-16yr olds), but left there eventually as it was too challenging for me. Now, I look back over those four years and absolutely despise myself for missing out on life. So I got some of my shit together, got a tutor and sorted out my hygiene and diet. I'm still trying to lose the bit of weight I gained but that's not my biggest issue, that's manageable, my issue is that I genuinely haven't socialised with anyone outside of my family or the internet in 4 years. And now I'm starting at this new school in 10 days which I'm very excited for but I have no idea what to do.

I'd also like to add that the entire school only has like 60 students in it, as its a new private school, however in some ways that makes me more nervous. Like if I mess up, everybody knows who I am or what happened.

I don't want to end up having a panic attack at school, or freeze up, in an ideal world I'd walk through the doors and be this confident outgoing person who makes friends easily and knows how to form human sentences without stuttering and breaking a sweat, but that's not the case.

I'm basically asking advice on how to be able to go to this new school, and not die internally? How to make sure I actually stay there, instead of backing out, as I need to pass my exams. So if anyone has any advice on what to do and how to cope being in that whole new surrounding, that would be very appreciated. :)",31Aug2019,1
31,"Two months ago was my best friends 16th birthday party and she posted a couple pictures in an Instagram post. In one of these pictures, I’m wearing a dress and I’m  seated in such a position where a piece of my undergarment is visible if you zoom in or look very closely. 

I didn’t know the picture was being taken at the time and am not even looking in the cameras direction. By the time I saw the post, over a 100 people had  already seen it. I was mortified and asked her to remove the pic but she told me she couldn’t delete the pic without deleting the whole post. She tried to reassure me by saying that no one would notice, that they would just think it was my bathing suit (everyone else in the pic was in their bathing suits) etc,  and I just let it go. I figured there’s no point in asking her to delete the post now because over a hundred people have already seen it. However, the incident stayed at the back of my head all summer and kept me up  at night. I feel so ashamed, embarrassed and angry at myself for not being more cautious of how I was sitting. Not to mention, just thinking about all these people having seen me in that position makes me sick to my stomach. 

I’m seeing her tomorrow for the first time in a long time, what do I do? Do I ask her to archive the post? Am I overreacting, should I just find a way to let it go? I know this situation could be so much worse, chances are, none of this will matter in a couple years but i  feel like I have no one to talk to about this and I could really use some advice.",31Aug2019,1

39," 

In April of 2019, I learned my mother was getting kicked out of our home. Since I was a senior in high school and planning on going to college, I didn't worry that much since our grandma had agreed to help us for a while. So, I apply to a college, get accepted, applied to housing and got everything I needed but then I got a bombshell, I didn't get into their housing department. So, I decided to ditch college for this year and wait until 2020 to go to college. Now, I glossed over a bit of complexity, but to make another long story short my grandma was getting frustrated that we weren't out of her house by July, since my sister was still in high school and my mom couldn't do much right now, I was targeted for ""not doing anything with my life"" and ""dropping out of college"" so I decided to move to my dads house.

Some backstory with my dad, my dad was an alcoholic and went back home, when he got an opportunity for a good job, to a small town in West Virginia. But then he got into an accident where alcohol and some medicines combined caused him to be hospitalized. Since he was drinking so much he was quite poor and could barely afford food so his sodium levels were very low. The doctors then, reasonably, pumped some sodium into his body. Once again, to make a long story short, when you pump sodium too fast into somebody they develop a syndrome called ""Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome"" (ODS). In most ODS cases the patient is put into a nursing home for the rest of their lives, my dad got very lucky and recovered from a catatonic state almost instantly. But since he was in the hospital from January (2019) to March (2019), he lost everything except for some small stuff his cousin had managed to grab before it was donated or destroyed, he even lost his home.

When he got out, he stayed with his cousin until the beginning of August (2019).

In July, when so much shit was happening to me I decided to talk to my dad and asked him about so many things from alcohol to cigarettes to gov't benefits. He told me so much and he was stable, it sounded like going into the hospital ended up working in his favor. Although, after hours of conversation it sounded like he was doing great and I would be happy up there with him until I went to college or found something. So, my stupid ass bought a plane ticket for me and my bird (I can't leave without him) and moved in with him.

I found out on day fucking 2 that he lied to me about so much. Yes, it's true he stopped drinking, he didn't stop smoking (if anything, he smokes more). He barely gets any money from the gov't. I live off of ramen noodles because its the cheapest thing we can afford, my bird is barely getting much to eat, he lives off of the cheapest birdseed and apples from local apple trees. The doctors told him he was a very healthy dude for his situation and could ""resume normal life."" if the fucking doctors would take 3 seconds to look at him, he's got bipolar disorder, hes got memory problems and he barely remembers my siblings names, he never talks about them and only talks about how ""everyone in the world won't help him because he was in the hospital."" Now, it's true that the gov't really fucking screwed him over by punishing him by getting a job (Won't give him enough food stamps, and lowered the amount of money he gets for rent, won't allow him to get disability benefits). He lied to me about so much that I barely even know him anymore, he doesn't know me anymore and he lied to me to get me up here so he can see me for the first time in a year.

Now for a bit of good, his cousin, we'll call him Phil. Phil did so much with his life until his heart decided to stop working and is living off his savings and disability (his heart works at 15%). Phil can get me a job at any one of these places: FBI Fingerprint analysis, Corrections Officer, anything post office, 911 Operator, SCUBA Diver, Police and probably some more I forgot at the time of writing this. Fortunately, for all except the last 2 pay at LEAST $18/h (in West Virginia) and to WV standards, that's exceptionally high.

My question is: What do I do?

If I go home, I may lose this huge opportunity, it's also possible I can still get it where I used to live

If I stay, I'm pretty much guaranteed to get the job but ill be stuck with my dickhead dad

Alternatively, I could say fuck it and get the job and just move my ass out (I have no idea how to adult, and I have to grow the fuck up fast)

One last thing, my dad treats me like I'm 14, he only barely let me get a bank account, he won't let me get a job, he won't let me get a car and he keeps holding me back.

If there is anything else you suggest please leave it here, im in dire need of some help.

Ok so I’m feeling done man and not like a depressed sad done but like a calm content done. I’m a junior in high school just started don’t have my license won’t have it for another year I’ve seen all of my friends surpass me in every way possible. I don’t play any sports but I’m athletic just never got into it as a freshman. I’m just tired man like their are these amazing football games at our school that are so much fun to go to but I chose to opt out because I don’t like being a damn bum and hitching a ride from my parents. I’m not depressed and I don’t have a horrible life but I just wanna like stop. I once was the center of attention with everyone and cool with everybody but I’ve fallen off so hard. Wouldn’t consider my self a loser but also wouldn’t consider myself cool with all the cliques anymore I just fall in a awkward middle part. I haven’t had a girlfriend in years still haven’t lost my virginity and really their are no signs that it is. I know high school is more than this like you know the people that are your “friends” but they aren’t your friend friends the ones that you can make small talk with when your with them but you wouldn’t see yourself hanging out with them after school. Well I hear stories of parties from those friends and I feel like just I don’t know how to explain it but I’m just tired man. It’s like I’m funny I can make everyone laugh but I guess it’s for the wrong reasons because I don’t get invited to anything I’m just there.

So basically, I dumb my ex-gf some weeks ago because things weren't going well and because my feelings had changed towards her.
Few days ago I told the girl(15) I  loved for more than a month, what I felt and told her all my feelings. She told me she also felt something, but she wasn't really sure. We're really close and I know most of her shit and she does mine.
So today talking about whatever, she told me that by the age 15, she has slept with more than 14 guys(I already knew she slept with 2 guys, what I don't really care). 
Is there something wrong with her ? Because in my point of view she shows to be not good on long lasting relationships, and I'm scared she might ""leave"" me and/ or use me and by the time she's bored cut all communication with me.

51,"So I started a new job in June in a local amusements and I honestly love it. I enjoy the work, the customers and the other staff members are extremly friendly and helpful...apart from one.

On my first day I was introduced to this person and she was to help train me in as I have never worked in that sort of environment before and she has been working for the company for the last 15 years . I had never met her previous to starting this job and all seemed to be ok for the first week but then something changed and I think she took a dislike to me. Ever since she talks down to me, snaps if I try say anything back (even if I know I'm right), any time I ask anything I am just given a deep breath as a response, made to feel stupid if I don't do something exactly as she does it even though other staff members don't follow her method and just made to feel really uncomfortable when she is near.

It's started to make me feel very anxious before I go to work and I see on the Rota that I will be working with her as I feel my every action is going to be constantly judged. It's getting to the point now that I feel like I should just leave the job because  she has been there for 15 years so if I complain to the manager (who is sooo helpful and nice) he will just take her side or even if he doesn't and he says something to her it will just make the situation worse for me as I will still have to work with her. So I just feel helpless to be honest.

I really really need this job to help support me and my girlfriend as we just got our first house together and I honestly don't know what to-do. If anyone has been in a similar situation to this or has any advice I would really appreciate it

53,"I don’t know why I’m like this. I have a fear of death, and I have never lost anyone in my life before. 

It’s not so much that I’m scared of death, but rather dying young (I’m 20), or in a painful, non peaceful way. I would say that that’s my biggest fear as opposed to losing someone I love unexpectedly or in a non peaceful way, such as death by a violent act, a car accident, a plane crash, and so on. If a loved one boards a plane, I fear that they’ll get into a plane crash and have a tight, painful feeling in my chest until I hear that they have landed safely. If I spend a day with a relative or friend and they leave in a car, I fear that they’ll get into a car accident. I feel especially worse if I don’t get a text from them within a few hours, because then I start to fear that something horrible has happened to them. If I’m waiting for someone to arrive and they’re late, I suspect that someone might have hurt them. The list goes on, and I don’t know how to deal with it. 

I don’t always worry about my loved ones, but myself, too. I fear that I’ll get into an accident or be murdered and I won’t have the chance to live a happy, fulfilled life. What hurts me more is the thought that my mother will suffer for the rest of her life because of the pain that my death will cause her. If I’m in class and I see someone I don’t recognize as a fellow student walk in, I fear that he’ll shoot up the classroom. I have all these irrational thoughts and no way of coping with them. Once an irrational thought enters my head, I have trouble getting rid of it. I try and tell myself why the thought is irrational, but and I will understand it, but the physical pain/tightness in my chest doesn’t go away.

60,"Hi, 

I’ve been playing at the same cricket club since I started playing which was about ten years ago and I’m now on the committee etc and do all sorts of bits and bobs to help run the club and i have always thoroughly enjoyed it even when times were hard and results weren’t going our way as we’ve been relegated a few divisions in the last few years. But this year the atmosphere has been completely toxic, double relegation doesn’t help... Everyone is moaning about everything, nothing is positive people are leaving and not playing and what even worse is new people have turned up played a game or two and decided they don’t want to be involved which has never happened. This is all the result of people revolting against the captain, TBF he’s made a few mistakes and he’s kind of a marmite guy but I do think people have got it in their heads and it’s just become a witch hunt as people don’t want to accept that we’re losing games due to more than one person... To cut a long story short, I had a falling out with a “friend” of mine on the pitch and it shows no sign of getting better (both playing the last game tomorrow) and I haven’t been enjoying playing for about half the season now. Should I just give up playing if I’m not enjoying it, find a new club and see if that helps (my brothers and Dad are associated with another larger club 5 mins away) or should i stick it out and see what happens. 

Long story not cut short; we fell out over a combination of things. Some known to him and some not. During the game which we batted first he’s as the captain was sat on the sidelines saying the club is shit were all wasting our time and if he drove himself to the game he would have fake a family disaster and left, which as I try to be a positive person and really enjoy playing cricket really pissed me off (I just smiled and said let’s just finish the season off last two games).Generally, people in the club use me as a bloody punch bag, not physically but whenever they are in a bad mood I’m the but of the jokes and this “mate” is often responsible and he also told me when he was pissed last year that I’m apparently too nice and shouldn’t let people speak to me the way I do and this always chips away at me especially when I’ve had a bad day. Back to the game next incident is me talking to a 17 y/o kid that was bowling, pinged a few bad balls in in a row I went over tried to calm him down asked him what went wrong and helped him fix it (which he did from then on) and during this he barked at me to get on with it stop wasting time and just let him bowl. Then there was another altercation when I came on to bowl, I simply asked him (he was captain for the day as the proper captain was absent) if i was bowling the next over again after being told I was and this question was met with a rude answer... and then he and another guy just kicked off at me and started saying stupid stuff like if i ask stupid questions I deserve stupid answers??? So I at this point got quite upset and there was quite a heated argument between the three of us and I proceeded to do very poorly and left straight after. 

Now I’m playing with them again tomorrow as I’ve also had my ups and downs with the captain but we were short this week and after saying I wasn’t going to play I felt bad for him and agreed to play as I do think he’s a good guy really but people getting in my head clouded my judgment (not an excuse I was just weak and became a sheep, but have seen the error in allowing people to influence the way I see others and want to work on that). What do I do? Going forward and tomorrow, I’m willing to discuss it if they are willing to be civil and speak sensibly I’m not the sort of person that takes violet threats which one of them I known for well and that will just mess any chance of us making up up as that’s the end for me I will never back down to that sort of thing (not violently on my behalf I just don’t agree people using violence as a threat in these circumstances and will become unreasonable). Do I try to reconcile or just focus on the other 8 that want me there and are my friends... 

BTW I know this is long and kind of pointless petty rubbish but I literally look forward to cricket all of the off season and it’s very important to me an this has been one of the worst summers of my life and had a major effect of me even my brother who I don’t get on with was nice to me after this as he knows it’s making me miserable and even said it (that made me smile, funny how being sad dame make people come together).I can’t really speak to my Dad as he just gets angry as he wants me to play with him and my brothers but I was old enough when they left to have made friends there and did’t want to leave and he gets upset with the amount of stuff I get given to do there as he doesn’t think it’s fair on me. 

TLDR: had a pretty bad falling out with a friend at my local cricket club I’ve played for since I was a kid and another guy there and haven’t been enjoying playing this year due to back feeling in the club anyway do I stay and hope it gets better or go and play for another club.",31Aug2019,3

63,"So here's the story.

First of all I'll start by saying I may have adapted a ""not caring about anything"" attitude,this goes back 5 years now

Let's say this began a couple of years ago,my parents have never and will be parents of the year or anything,they're just average parents I guess. So about 2- (2017-ish)3 years ago I noticed something off about my dad,one day I accidentally saw his messages on ""Whatsapp"" they were to another woman not being my mother. (I knew he was cheating before my mother found out eventually) That day part of my respect for him dropped significantly. After that (2018) my mother found out and we had a family meeting or whatever,we agreed to keep being a family but lowkey our family dynamic has been dead for years.

(One thing my parents haven't been around for some years of my life and my older siblings) 

But ever since that ocurred my respect for him is by the floor now honeslty,non-existent basically

Rn (2019) my dad is working in Alaska so I rarely message him or even talk to him now,not that I mind because I don't

I'm not sure this is the right subreddit 

But once again is it wrong of me to be an asshole towards him?",31Aug2019,1

78,"Hey,   
So in 8th grade, I met a new friend and he's been a really good friend of mine for the past 2 years (I'm in 10th grade now). The thing is he always used to annoy me and always was toxic to me. For example, I once told him and some other friends that I was in a school trip next to my grandma's neighborhood and a guy behind me said it is a poor neighborhood, even though it wasn't and since then he's been telling me my grandma is poor, and that's just one thing. Every little thing that happened he just tried making me feel upset (and sadly sometimes succeed). For example, me having a low kill game on CS:GO, me saying something that's a tad bit emotional, me not talking and some more stupid reasons. He would always try to say something that he knows will annoy me. Now I can't say I did do nothing wrong, I did the same things he did to me too, but the thing is I stopped doing that a while ago, and now I only s\*\*t-talk him only when he s\*\*t-talks me. Now here are the problems: 

\-I'm moving to a different high school than most of my friends and I don't want to risk stop talking to them and not having friends afterward. 

\-The friends that will come to the same school as I talk to him regularly and has no problem with him

\-Every time I'm trying to have a serious conversation with him about it he just tells me stuff like ""F\*\*\*ing P\*\*\*y"" and ""Deal with it"" 

Now I don't think he has bad intentions, but it's really annoying and I don't know what to do..

80,"So I'm currently working two jobs right now. I work as a delivery driver and I'm also a cashier for a gas station. I only want to work one job because I'm a teenager and I'd like to have some time for myself. Any advice? Here's some pros and cons.

Delivery driver:
1. Dead end job
2. $7.45/hr. But shitty hours
3. Great co-workers
4. On top of hourly pay; I get tips and commission (averaging almost $200/wk.)
5. A lot of wear and tear on my car (no company cars)
6. Basically work whatever schedule I want 
7. Lots of awesome co-workers
8. I ABSOLUTELY love this job

Cashier:
1. I work graveyard shift so I'm by myself for 8 hrs (kinda dangerous for a 4'11"", 20 yr old female)
2. $8.50/hr, getting a small raise in 3 months
3. Badly understaffed so we never have vacation time
4. Co-workers rely on next cashier to come in at scheduled time, otherwise the full weeks schedule must be changed.. A.k.a. it's a pain in the ass for everyone if you call in sick or for an emergency
5. I HATE this job.


(So) Tldr; Should I keep a job I absolutely hate that pays well, Keep a job I absolutely love that doesn't pay well, or should I just keep pushing myself to work both jobs (about 70 hrs of work per week)?",31Aug2019,1
82,"Ok, so a friend of mine just sent me a text saying that he *might*?be homeless soon, and that although he has a place to go, they don’t allow pets, so he can not live there as his cat would have ‘no place to go’, and said that he’s considering milking himself. He asked me if he can have a room in my family’s house, for what I assume would be long-term. This person has never met my family, and currently rents out his mother’s basement. I’ve been in his apartment before, and he is pathologically messy and unclean. Old food and flies all over the place. As well, he appears to be very attached to me and considers me his best friend. I have hung out with this person regularly for years but I never had that level of attachment to him, he was just sort of there to hang out with and was a very irritable and arrogant person so I tended to not seek out seeing him unless he invited me. A few days ago he asked to rent out an apartment with me, and I declined due to lack of means to do so and and I did not think I would enjoy living with him. I suggested he find a shelter for his cat and go to the hospital if he feels that he’s actually going to kill himself. I have no idea if his story is even accurate but he’s prone to exaggerating things, bouts of self-pity, very intense emotional reactions to things which are relatively mundane. It seems that he is trying to pressure me into living with me using emotional manipulation. I’m sort of shook. Should I feel guilty for not letting him live in my parent’s house abruptly? (Not that my parents would ever let him actually live in our house). I blocked his number because I think he’s probably having an intense reaction to my rejection of his request and I think I may need to cut this person off if he’s intent on trying to live with me.

84,"This morning I found that my trash yet again was ripped open and gone through. Trash all over my porch and front yard. Any time I run out of space in my trash can this always happens and I understand it’s mostly my fault for leaving it out. Even if I wait to take it out the night before the trash guys come it almost always is torn open by the time they get here. 

 I had it this morning and even said I would kill it if I got the chance. After cleaning everything up I went on with the rest of my day and actually was having good evening visiting my parents. They’re within walking distance to my house from there so I usually walk instead of driving. 

As I rounded the corner of my house to go inside a cat  I didn’t recognize was standing there. I stopped for a moment and then did what I regret so much now. I took a small step forward and the cat ran as fast as it could away from me. I struggled to keep my eyes open as a large truck came and ran it over as it crossed the street. I saw the truck coming and can honestly remember knowing it was because of me what was about to happen. The sound of bones breaking is still shivering down my spine now 3 hours later. 

I gained hope I shouldn’t have when I saw the cat moving slightly in the neighbors yard across the street. I cross the street to get to try and see what kind of injuries better without scaring it. I see that the bottom half of the cat is noticeable flatter that the rest of it’s body and that it obvious it can’t use its back legs at all. I’m ashamed I ended up spooking it again but this time it took about three what seemed very difficult steps that made it’s back half seem completely paralyzed. It sat there with it’s tongue hanging out trying either to get enough air or because of the pain I’m assuming. I’ve looked outside periodically and it’s still alive and suffering. I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world and wish I would’ve just came home a little later. I think it’s either the neighbors cat or a stray. It has no collar. 

I wanted to help it but when I called my parents and asked them what to do they told me I shouldn’t try to tell the neighbors because they would take care of it themselves. I disagree but I’m also too shy to be able to tell them it was because of me. I also don’t have enough money to go to a animal hospital plus I live in rural West Virginia so it would be hours to get to one. I feel like it makes me a bad person not telling them or not trying to help it.  I know it’s not really my fault because I didn’t mean too but it still happened because of me there is no denying it. The cat looked at me in such fear after like I was coming to finish the job. My parents tried to tell me its just a stray and that it happens all the time but all that did was make me more mad/sad. No matter how I look at it I feel like I killed it and the fact it’s sitting outside slowly dying is really fucking me up inside. I have no idea what to do please help.",31Aug2019,0

86,"Back story: I'm 28 years old. Studied Corrections/Law in Post-Secondary school. Graduated 4 years ago. Currently working full-time as a security guard, making just over Min. Wage. Current loans: $50,000 debt ($25k student loans, $25k vehicle loan). Can barely make ends meet.

I've been applying to jobs in my ""field"" since being out of school, 4 years ago. I've been to about 8 interviews within that time and have only been able to lockdown low-paying jobs. I worked as a Youth Care Worker 2 years ago right after school, but the stress was not worth the minimal pay (~$2/hr over min. wage). Unsure where my interviews have been going wrong. I've had a couple opportunities, and have somehow screwed them up. I believe my time is worth more than win. wage, and I'm a fairly competent worker. I have decided to stay at current security job for the experience, and believe it's good to stay at 1 job longer and wait for the right position. 

I applied to a large city in Canada for their open position of 911 Operator. Apparently they are hiring 20-40 people and pays $33/hr. This would be a lifechanger for me, and has now become a dream to lock this down. They responded back to my application through email with an online questionnaire about basic information regarding the job to ensure I was interested. I passed onto the next level and have set up a time to go to their HQ for a 2-hour testing segment, which includes: ""short term memory, typing, spelling, sentence clarity and reading comprehension. Evaluates call taking skills, such as computer-related multi-tasking abilities, keyboarding/data entry skills, memory retention, prioritization, map reading, call summarization and performance under stress."" This test is 14 days from today. 

My main concern is my typing skills. I tend to have terrible habits on a keyboard and poke at keys with my index fingers, and regularly look down at the keyboard. Regardless, I can do over 50wpm (this job requires 40wpm). I've been using a computer since I was like 12, so I'm very fast, but it's still a terrible habit. Should I be trying to break this habit and become a ""proper"" typer? Is that possible within 2 weeks AND maintain/improve the wpm requirements? Or should I just go in as is and hope they don't care how I type, as long as I can do it fast enough?

101,"I am seventeen, and my girlfriend is sixteen. Our original plan was for me to move to her (we met on vacation, but since we've gone back to our homes we live about ten hours way), we've been together for over a year and I have witnessed a *lot* of things (we call each other all the time). 

&amp;#x200B;

Her dad was worse than he is now. He used to beat them constantly, he kicked my girlfriend's eldest sister out of the house frequently, forcing her to stay at a friend's or on the streets, he pinched and hit his little sister (2 years old) when she cried too much, he once even got in trouble with the police because he held a knife to his girlfriend's neck.

He doesn't physically abuse the children as much -- it's usually little things now, like pushing them into a wall harshly. The last ""big"" physical thing he did to them was fight my girlfriend's twin brother, making him fall out of the truck and hit his back on the pavement. This was back in March.

Now, however, it's more mental abuse. He constantly degrades them, forces them to drink alcohol when they are all underaged, has kicked my girlfriend out of the house, gets drunk and drives them places, forcing them to go with him, doesn't let my girlfriend or her brother use their phone, play games, watch TV, do their homework, go to sleep at a decent time -- they *always* have to spend time with him. 

Her dad has been diagnosed with multiple mental disorders openly tells his children that he wants to end his own life. He obsesses over his ex-wife who recently left him and constantly gets her to come over. Recently, about two months or so ago, they had a huge fight that lasted hours because the ex-wife and him had a baby, but she refused to take the baby around him (for good reason.) He screamed at her, degrading her, threatened her, and she never came back.

My girlfriend is breaking. She has had to deal with this for 16 years... she has developed a lot of mental problems (she has never been diagnosed with anything because her parents would never allow her to seek therapy, but she constantly degrades herself, harms herself, and contemplates suicide, telling herself she ""deserves"" everything that happens to her, and that she is selfish for complaining about her life). As strong as she tries to be, I know she's hurting and... I just love her so much, and it scares me knowing that something could happen to her at anytime and I can't physically be there for her.

I would also like to note that she has no immediate family in the area. She has mother who doesn't give a shit about her enough to help her, and her eldest sister, who has moved out at this point, cannot afford to take care of her and her brother.

I have asked her if I could call CPS, many, many times. No matter what I say, she always says no. I want her permission, but she keeps refusing it. But I know she needs it, even if she doesn't see that. However, I promised that if her dad were to hit her or her brother again, that I would call CPS whether she wanted me to or not.

But the more stressed she gets, I have to ask, is it really worth waiting? Should I just call CPS? Or is her situation not as bad as I think it is? I want her to be safe... and I want to do what's best for her. What should I do?

*I would like to note that she got a 9 out of 10 on the ACE test, the only one not being marked was sexual abuse.*",31Aug2019,2
102,"I (17F) have an older brother (25M) who gets treated like a princess by my parents. My brother played all different types of sports growing and is currently in medical school. My parents always defend him even when he’s in the wrong. 

My brother burned our new white table with a hot pan and when my parents found out they said “oh it’s fine that must have been an accident. he’s sleep deprived from studying.” However when my dad first bought that table he told me that if “i ruined the table in any way, i’m not getting a car.” I kept that table so clean but when he burns it, it’s alright??

My brother still lives with us and he is literally a PIG. He always trashes the whole house. Leaving food, garbage, hair, etc everywhere. On some occasions there will be maggots in bowls of old food.  disgusting. My mom told me that I should clean up after him. She acts like he’s 9 HE IS A GROWN MAN. He is going to be a surgeon but can’t do a simple task of cleaning up??! She would start yelling at me how” I should help him out”

They are always so hard on me. One time i opened up to my mom about my depression and she said “do you want to live in a crazy facility?? why are you sad when you live in this expensive house and wear nice clothes.” But when my brother talks about how he’s stressed they will come to his aid with support.

103,"Since 2016 I have been raped, been the key witness in a court martial, been in an abusive relationship, been conned, had two grandparents die, had five work colleagues get shot at the Capital Gazette, and now been lied to for 9 months by a guy I’ve been dating who’s in a major band. We all got matching tattoos backstage at the end of July and then two weeks later he tells me I’m off the Europe tour and we shouldn’t be dating anymore. 

Friends are trying to help, but no one has any concept of what I’m going through.  Everyone is getting married and having kids - things that I would give my left arm for at age 39.

All things considered I’ve lived a good life. I have great parents, I’ve had a wonderful and exciting career, served in the Peace Corps, have two major degrees, and live in a fantastic condo. I keep a gratitude journal. But at the end of the day - despite all the superlatives I’m lauded with - I feel empty and alone. I go to bed alone, wake up alone, and spend most of my time alone (even in a crowded room). 

I just don’t understand what’s wrong with me. Dad, why am I not good enough? When you’ve been told through actions, inactions, and words for years and years and years that you’re not good enough by guys you begin to believe that. There is something clearly wrong with me. I need help. I can’t keep going it alone. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I’m in therapy but there is only so much that can do.

104,"Gah so format probably wrong and I don’t know where to post this but lemme know what you think y’all.
I (23f) around six months ago use to go in the morning and walk to get coffe with my infant son. I usually had a routine where I would go out again in the afternoon to walk around the park with my son,too. So when I would go to get coffe I notice this new group of old men, who spoke a different language. Not sure what. While I waited for my coffee the two old men would stare and point at me and my son. I didn’t know what they said about him but I felt like the way they looked at me they were probably saying smt sexual. Made me uncomfortable. I saw them often in the same spot for a little bit till I didnt. They were all just gone. 
A week or so after that something weird started to happen. A black car with two white stripes seemed to be follwong me. I didn’t really know tbh at the time because I saw other cars of the same one and just figured I was being paranoid. But there were times where this black car would do loops and I would see it all the way until I got home. This car has tinted black windows so you really couldn’t see through them. After a little bit of that, it got worse.
One day around 530pm I decided to walk an opposite direction from how I usually walk with my son. A street over from mine just to walk around because my son loves the outdoors. Anyways I noticed the same black car, white stripes and tinted windows come where I was. It drove slowly next to me and turned into a parking lot across from where I was. I felt this gut feeling to go home cause smt wrong. So I looked at the car and started speed walking home! The car noticed and drove a little passed-me and disappeared. I felt relieved as I was already  on my street and almost home! Than this trashy looking grey car (literally looked like a dump and sketchy, didn’t have a back seats) come behind me. I was almost a few doors down from my house. This van blocked my way and was on the side where my house was. It was close near me and my heart dropped, I was scared for my son and i &amp; was not even far from my house.  The guy driving the car looked right at me and was slowing down with the front door opened , as if he was ready to grab me or my son on the stroller idk. I was starring him down and I was shook. I believed this guy probably in his 40/50 wasn’t alone. There probably was another weirdo in the back ready to grab us or hold as down cause literally this car had no seats!!!! I panicked and ended up running away from my house since I couldn’t even get there and ran up the street . Before I could get to the stop sign I looked back and noticed the van doing a U turn around the street, &amp; I turned back around and ran back to my house and made it inside. 
For a month or two I didn’t even go outside hardly, and never walked alone. But recently I started too. I first went out in the front with my son alone and than parking lot, to up the street and just around the park. I don’t go to get coffe or anything just around the neighbourhood. I go to the gym now and get driven there while my bf watched our son.  Now fast forward to today. I stopped a routine and started going out only once or sometimes twice close by, which was good. 
Today, I decided to walk where this busy street was near a church and noticed a black car, tinted windows , only one thing is different with this car and instead of being straight it had a bump. I can’t quite explain it but it doesn’t matter it still had dark windows and the white stripes . There were many cars passing but for some reason that car in particular passed I watched it and it turned some place close , and I felt weird like I needed to go home now. So i ended up walking back on my street and I literally was like two doors away from my house when this black car that I swore was the same one I had a gut feeling about passed me slowly and parked at a house near by. I watched it and because I didn’t know what was real or not? Was this the same car? Am I just being paranoid? This car parked in a lot and few sec went out the lot and did a u turn and passed me again slowly. I couldn’t see faces but I’m pretty sure they were trying to get a view of me and my son.. two people. The driver had this old person shirt on skinny. And I pretty sure the passenger was a old man too who was fat. Anywyas they left. It was weird I ran inside torn that I’m pretty sure my stalkers were back or really never left. 
Now this is a scattered but about two weeks ago I went to the gym alone as usual and started working out. Beside me there was this old man and I front of me a skinny old man speaking their language, idk what, but obviously looked like creeps. They didn’t even looked like they were working out just there to look at young girls. The skinny guy was starring at me and talking to the old fat guy and checking me out and laughing and made me super uncomfortable. Probably making some sex jokes. When I looked at them they were doing the workout fast and with no weight and just talked in their language most of the time. The whole time I worked out they were always near me .. but I didn’t think anything of it just that they were creeps.. but rn I just thought about the fact that both of them looked familiar and it clicked! Those two old weirdos were from the group at the coffe place starring at me and my son making me feel uncomfortable. I can’t believe I didn’t realize that. And I knew there were two people in the car td a fat and skinny one., so it makes me think could it possibly be these two? I haven’t seen them really since tho? And if it is ., who was that weird skinny guy with the grey car ready to probably kidnap me? Could the fat guy and skinny one be the ones collecting info on where I live? My routine? What i do? And get sm1 else to actually do the kidnapping... 
idk I’m just so tired of all this :( now I can’t even go outside alone with my son because I’m scared for our safety and I have no prof other than my words. I don’t have a pic: or licence... and I’m pretty sure tdy they found out where I live because I ran inside and they saw me ., the police wouldn’t do anything without any prof. In a street they don’t have cameras which is why they prob show up where I actually live by! What do I do? Who do I go too.. should I just wait it out again? Never go out again? Am I being ridiculous ;( this is just so exhausting that I can’t have a routine , enjoy my time walking with my son outside around my own dam neighbourhood.. like what do these people want!!!",31Aug2019,1

108,"Okay so a tiny bit of background: my extended family is super close, like any time anyone needs anything they don’t hesitate to call. Once the word is out, they’ve got help from somewhere in the fam. My husband’s side of the family however, is a different story. He has two siblings, one of them is super close to his parents. They rely on each other for a lot and have a good relationship. The other sibling and my husband are not particularly close with their parents, no bad blood but they only chat once in a while. Because I’m attached to my husband, they never call me for anything! They don’t even tell me when big things are happening in the family. I enjoy being the go to person and it makes me feel good to help my family. It’s honestly driving me crazy to feel like they don’t think to call me. 

Example: my husbands grandparents moved into the state 2 weeks after his mom had surgery. They worked themselves to the bone cleaning and moving into the new house and no one called me! I literally have OCD and LOVE cleaning and organizing. 

How do I get them to think of me when they need something? I don’t think they dislike me.. I just think I don’t even cross their mind as someone to call if they need help.

112,"We’ve been together 4 1/2 years and most of that time I’ve been supporting us. It’s been a bumpy road and a lot has happened to make it harder for him to work but after all this time I’m getting tired of waiting. 

We don’t have a car, so I’ve let it slide for years but recently I lost my job and we’ve been living off unemployment that’s about to run out. 

He said before I lost my job, because I had been miserable, that if I had to quit we’d figure it out and he’d start working so I could have a break and find something part time or that I at least liked more. 

They never happened though, and my unemployment is about to run out. I’m just tired of him promising and saying he’ll do this or that, and he doesn’t. I’ve made mistakes which have complicated things but it’s been years now and he just isn’t doing anything. 

How long do I wait for him to fucking get a job? It’s hard when there’s guys throwing themselves at me, ready to take care of me but I love him. I want to be with him. And I don’t even necessarily want to be taken care of and not work, but I don’t think it’s fair for me to be the one doing it without any help. 

Part of why I was so miserable is because I busted my ass and still got no where by myself. No closer to a car, barely paying my bills. I couldn’t do it alone, paying for both of us! 

We’ve fought over it and he always promises he’ll do something, but he never does and I’m running out of time. I can do this alone if he’s not going to help, what is the point in having a “partner”? Without him I could at least get a roommate and get help with bills. 

I love him but how long do I tolerate this? He won’t listen and help me, no matter what I say or do, or how I approach it. I’ve tried just talking, I’ve cried, I’ve gotten angry. None of it makes a difference. But I love him so much. I just can’t do this alone, I’m tired of doing it alone...",31Aug2019,4
114,"I’ll start by giving a little background:

I went to my local public high school freshman and sophomore year. I had friends there, and did well in school. I really enjoyed my freshman year, but throughout my sophomore year I was feeling really depressed. I’m not sure the cause of the depression, but I blamed it on my school, which was pretty rough. Most of the kids in class didn’t listen and it was very chaotic. So in my first week of junior year I decided I couldn’t handle it anymore and moved to a local private Christian school.

Immediately after the switch I felt SO much happier. I felt like the environment was great, I enjoyed the religious message that the school provided and I like the smaller class sizes and the better quality teachers. My education at this new school was much improved. 

When I first switched I was immediately welcome into a nice group of girls. I’m an introverted and shy person, so making close friends isn’t easy for me. I went to the school football games, and all the school dances, and even got a boyfriend (who I’m still with). The only thing was I never really enjoyed any of the school events because I felt really awkward with these new people, except for a dance and prom at the end of the year with my boyfriend. But I thought I was new and probably will make better friends with the girls throughout the year. 

Now this year I’m feeling hopeless. First week of school, and a situation happened where I stood up to this mean girl in our grade, in a large group chat with most of the girls from the grade about something that was really unfair(it’s too complicated to explain). To my surprise no one in this group backed me up, and let me get attacked by mean girl and her friends. 

Now I’m feeling like no one really cares about me. Only one girl stood up for me out of like 10 girls. I’m feeling like I want to go back to my old public school because I don’t feel supported and want to actually have fun at school events and at school.

I’m taking some college classes so I would only have three classes at school anyways. My current school starts a week earlier than the public school, so I could technically start back up again on the first day. 

I have friends at my old school that would be happy to see me there again. I just feel like I’m going to school with a bunch of hypocrites who call themselves Christian yet don’t seem to do the right thing. 

My boyfriend graduated too, which doesn’t help. He was my only real friend at my current school.",31Aug2019,1

116,"Very typical question and I'll probably delete this later but here is the backstory first. I have bipolar II. I've been more or less stable for the last three years (a fact of which I'm pretty proud, I've put a lot of work into this). I've been avoiding dating for a long time because I was trying to figure myself out and finish school. By long time I mean from the time I first sought help till now, a period of about five years.

So I'm fighting an uphill battle in terms of stigma. When I do talk to guys and I think we might be getting somewhere, the fact that I'm a software engineer seems to be the final nail in the coffin because I'm independent and I'm not crying in a corner asking someone to save me.

119,"Title. For context, I’m male, 18, and straight. This is something that I probably shouldn’t be something I should be worrying about all that much but it’s slowly driving me batshit insane. 





The first clue I remember that people thought I might be gay was when my mom came back from a girls night out with a few other moms from our church. I remember her telling me about how they were talking over dinner and the topic fell to relationships and all the other ladies were talking about the girls that their sons would bring home and she had to just sit there and listen and when when they asked her if I had brought anyone home, she had to say no and change the subject. I remember wondering why she felt the need to tell me that. I think I know now.





At first I didn’t really notice, my friends would always go out together with their girlfriends and do shit around the town and ask me when I would ever join them. I thought it was just friendly banter. I remember in junior year of high school, I would talk to this girl from my fourth period a lot. My friends would always urge me to ask her out but I didn’t like her like that and I didn’t even know if she was interested. After a while we just talked less and less and I later found out from her friends that she liked me a lot. To this day my friends won’t let me live it down. They also ask me why I’m only friends with guys (I have a few girl friends but they’re more acquaintances if I’m honest) and why I follow mostly guys on my Instagram (which is mostly just former soccer teammates and some of my closer friends), which I really don’t know how to answer. 






I got tipped off again I was talking to my crush the other week, we were in a room alone just talking when she started asking me a bunch of questions like if I’ve had my first kiss, if I’ve ever had a girlfriend, if I considered myself loyal, if I ever felt lonely seeing a bunch of other couples hanging out and doing PDA , shit like that. Once the narrative was established that I’ve never had experience with romance of any sort, the questions started getting kinda awkward, like if I’ve ever found a girl attractive, if I’ve ever grabbed a girl’s ass, if I’ve ever so much as danced with a girl, stuff like that. I felt as if she asked me everything besides if I was straight. I don’t really know why but the questions kinda hurt, particularly the ones that seemed to be probing at my sexuality but that’s life I guess.








Last Sunday at church, a family friend asked me why she’s never seen me with a girl. I replied that I don’t really want to force a relationship. Then she goes rambling about how it shouldn’t be hard for me because I’m good-looking, I’m tall, and I have purpose in life. I asked her why she cared so much about my relationship status and she said she was curious. Since then I’ve been getting this question from various church members every Sunday. It’s getting quite annoying if I’m being honest and it’s making me not want to go. I talked to my mom about it and she said that I should be taking it as a compliment.







I think even my family think I’m gay. Nearly a year ago I decided to grow my hair into an afro, and to keep my hair in the optimal condition to grow, I regularly go to the beauty supply store to buy conditioner and castor oil. My friends found out because I encountered one of my friend’s mother while there one time. They still feel the need to mention the fact that I put “girl products” in my hair. Anyways, even though I’ve been going regularly for nearly a year now, my dad found out a few weeks ago and at first, he always used to mention that I took longer on my hair than a girl whenever I was in the bathroom longer than it takes to brush my teeth. My mom heard him the first time and gave him a real earful but didn’t respond when he kept repeating it. Last week he walked in on me applying conditioner to my hair and it seemingly set something off, he started not talking to me at all even though we would talk for hours previously about stuff like soccer, politics, and life in general and whenever he absolutely had to address me, he would do so in an aggressive tone. He would try and start arguments over the most minuscule shit and call me disrespectful when I ignored him. Yesterday he straight-up asked me if I was gay. I didn’t answer and I guess he took that as a yes because now he seems to have ramped up his shithousery. Even my mom and sister ask why I never bring a girl hole and when I tell them I’m not comfortable with that question, 







Those are just specific instances. Around the time I noticed I was getting the questions regarding my relationship, I noticed that people started treating me differently. My friends didn’t want to hang out as much, my phone dried up when sometimes I would have to be having multiple conversations at once, I started getting dropped for leadership roles when usually the church leaders would be asking me multiple times a week to fill them, and after church when everyone does fellowship I can easily make it into my car in under a minute when usually it would take me 15 taking the same route because of people stopping me and wanting to have a conversation.






Honestly, I have no idea what to do. I feel like the way people are treating me is unfair because I’m not even gay. I’m so fucking tired of having to watch all of my actions because they probably aren’t “masculine” enough and I’m even more fucking tired of having to reiterate the fact that I’m not gay to seemingly everyone I run into. The worst part is I have no fucking evidence that people are treating me differently because they think I’m gay or that they even think I’m gay in the first place so this could all be in my head, but my instinct has never failed me. What do I do?",31Aug2019,1
120,"He brought up going away for the weekend but we have a concert tomorrow night so he thought about maybe Sunday-Monday. 

His brother then mentioned having a party this weekend on Sunday at his house. I brought it up to my boyfriend about how it’d be nice to see everyone. He said he didn’t want to go because he was leaving Tuesday for a work trip and he didn’t want to be hungover and that he’d rather go away. The party ended up being changed to Saturday so I figured with the concert and his previous comment we definitely wouldn’t be going. 

I have to meet my sister tomorrow to give her her tickets so she invited me to a pregame at my cousins friends apartment. I tell my boyfriend about the invite and he immediately gets defensive and says “I told you we were going to (brothers) tomorrow” Then explained we’re driving an hour out of the way to the party going for 2 hours then leaving and driving 1.5 hours to make it to the concert for the start. 

He never once told me. He then starts telling me how we can “try” to make it to the pregame and about 5 minutes later says we’ll drive in and meet my sister in front of the gates and give her tickets.

I'm actually meeting him later with my other classmate (who doesn't know) to watch the movies and I really want to help him but I don't know how.",31Aug2019,2
123,"I also noticed that he would have separate meetings with the software developer and take him out for dinner, drinks, golf and what not and not invite me. I dont care about being invited, but I felt like they would discuss details of the project and made decisions without me. And when we are presenting to management, he would say I instead of we for things I clearly did or helped collaborate with.

Fast forward to now. My part of the project is great, everything works smoothly and I was able to learn enough programming to cut out the developer and my coworker. Reduce cost and exceed the delivery time by 3 months. And my solution was presented to a vp who loved it. And I didnt change anything, and stuck with what I thought was right.

His project is tanking. The developer is unable to deliver and management is frustrated. And he will miss his deadline. A few months back, I offered him a solution that will close out his project in time to hit his deadline, he rejected it.

But today, he came by my desk and offered help with my side of the project. I'm concerned about the intention and him trying to take credit. I'm confused why hes not addressing his project. And I'm not sure if I should accept it or not. With help I could do more but at what cost.",31Aug2019,0
125,"I’ve found myself becoming interested in other men although I’m in a relationship of 4+ years. I don’t want to and I feel awful, and I don’t act on it. But I feel like it’s a sign that things are over? 

I’ve realized it’s not the other men for who they are, but rather what they have to offer and i feel terrible for it. Emotionally, my current bf is perfect. I feel like I won’t ever find someone who gets me like he does. But at the same time, I find myself wanting someone who will take care of me. 

I’ve been supporting him for years now while begging him to work and he just “can’t” but I CAN’T do it alone. I’ve tried and it’s not working, I need help. Without him I could at least get a roommate and have some help with bills. 

And there’s been guys who are interested/have been interested in me for years that I wonder if I should give a chance? They work, are talking about buying a home, etc and are younger than my bf, closer to my age(8 yrs age gap between us). And it’s like why can’t I just have that with him? 

He has issues and lost his medicine, but I feel like my life is at a stand still waiting on him to do something. It feels like it has been, almost from the word “go” with him and it sucks. Dating someone 8 years older I expected him to be more mature, have more figured out than me but he doesn’t seem to. 

I’m 23 and he’s 31, if it matters. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m wasting my life getting nowhere because I’m supposed to have a partner but it feels like he’s just sitting back and watching me struggle. 

I’ve expressed this to him in many different ways—talking calmly, crying, getting angry. None of it makes a difference. 

Do I keep waiting or move on? Please keep in mind he means a lot to me, I just don’t want to wake up and realize I’m old and nothing has changed. I have big dreams about the life I wanna live and I feel stuck, like he won’t set and achieve goals with me. :(",31Aug2019,2
126,"I'm honestly a mess right now so I'm sorry about how jumbled this may sound. Also I'm on mobile.

I (20F) started a new job about a month ago and finally got my first paycheck today. We get paid every two weeks but my tax information wasn't in fast enough so I just got all four weeks into one check.

After work tonight, I stopped at the grocery store to pick a few things up. Before I went in, I was curious and opened my paycheck to see how much I had made and how many hours I worked and such. I spent a few minutes looking it over and then went inside the store, bought my things, and went home.

I get home and I'm getting everything out of my car to take inside the house and my check is just gone. Literally disappeared into thin air. I looked all around the car seat, under the seat, under everything, nothing. I drove back to the grocery store really quick, looked in the parking lot and went inside to see if it had by chance been turned in, and it hadn't.

I feel like everything is against me right now. This wouldn't be such a big problem but money is so tight for me right now that this whole situation made me break down. I'm in school and I'm moving on my own soon and taking my cat and dog with me because my mom is currently in the hospital after having emergency surgery last week. I've been paying some bills for her so that my little brother has a place to live. I've basically burned through my savings helping them. It all just feels like too much and losing this paycheck really sent me over.

What can I do? Can I ever get that money back? Like can I ask my work for a new one or will they not do that? I'm not exaggerating when I say I have less than $10 in my bank account. I was counting on that money to get an oil change, buy gas, and to start building my savings again. And now it's gone.

What do I do?",31Aug2019,1
127,"I met the guy I’m currently seeing while serving him at my waitress job. We talked a bit, made some innuendos, and i got his number. The first time we met up was at my house (stupid ik) and I gave him my virginity (i wanted that from the beginning). We went on multiple dates after that and as I learned more about him I began to see him as boyfriend material, but because of my mental illnesses and trauma from past relationships I refused to make that obvious in an attempt to “protect my feelings”. We had a few talks and decided it was too early to decide on a relationship... 3 months ago. Ever since he’s been dodging labels with me. One of my coworkers is dating a guy who works with him and has asked him about me many times. He usually gets upset about this because he “starts to wonder if he’s doing the right thing” ???? 

After a while i had enough and finally asked about it and he told me he “still wasn’t ready to commit” because he “didn’t know me well enough yet” but he also “doesn’t want me to see anyone else” i also told him that I didn’t feel comfortable with him seeing other people. alright. Gucci. But again this was 3 months ago at this point.

We have amazing sex very frequently and i think maybe he’s afraid to lose that. But then again, sometimes i think maybe he really ISN’T emotionally ready. And that would be sound, if he hadn’t told me he wants me to be his girlfriend but is unable to commit because he doesn’t want to “put me through” the burden of him being away for long periods of time and in dangerous situations.

I tried again to separate from him recently. I told him I didn’t want to be hurt again and that I felt like that was where this was headed and he responded to that with “why are you pushing me away?” Making me doubt my judgement.

Basically I feel absolutely horrible when people ask if we’re together because I don’t know myself. I don’t know if I’m just being naive or if there’s potential for a relationship here. I don’t know what he feels and I don’t want to continue to see him if he doesn’t want anything more than this.

Do you think he’s serious about me?

P.s. first time posting to reddit, sorry if its weird.",31Aug2019,1
129,"Back story: I'm American and speak English and from hearing my family speak Spanish I have somewhat learned it at the time. My ex-boyfriend (17M) is Mexican and understands some English but speaks Spanish so there is a language barrier.

My boyfriend at the time and I have been together for about 11 months now and we're in an on/off relationship, which isn't healthy, I know. It started when we were 2 months into our relationship. Before that he was always really nice, very compassionate and supportive. He started texting me one night that he thinks that he isn't enough for me and that I deserve someone better since I'm American. I told him that if I wanted someone else I would have left him already and I chose him for a reason. Things spiraled out of control and he broke up with me. We got back together the following weekend after talking things through, or so I thought. For the next month he would continue to bring it up but he handled his feelings better, which I praised him for.

On the third month, I was stupid and decided to lose my virginity to him. At the time I didn't regret it, I really did and still do have feelings for him, but it caused me to have stronger feelings for him. The next three months were ok, except for him getting angry out of nowhere and texting me at night. Nothing too harsh but harsh enough to make me cry to sleep. But it was always over the phone. Whenever we saw each other after a fight, he would hug me and kiss me as if nothing happened. He would say sorry sometimes but he would never elaborate.

On the seventh month, I was preparing a gift for our seven month anniversary. Little did I know that that night we would get into a fight. He got angry over a simple misunderstanding but he refused to listen to me when I tried to explain. He said I was always causing misunderstandings and I should be more clear. I lost contact with him for a few days but one evening I woke up to the sound of pebbles being thrown at my window, it turned out he decided to come by my house. I decided to go outside and see what he wanted. I still liked him, maybe even loved him, after all. We ended up getting back together.

The biggest, and last fight was on the 11th month. He seemed a little different when I was texting him so I asked him what was wrong. He said nothing but he continued to act that way so I asked him again later on during the day, he refused to say anything. When I asked him the third time he snapped and I told him to calm down. He started calling me bipolar and saying that I wasn't compassionate, saying that he doesn't want to be with someone as crazy as me and continuously blocking and unblocking me all within a few minutes. I tried to contact him through other social media but I couldn't. Eventually I just went to sleep, worried.

The next day we ended things. I'm still hurt and I hate to say it but after four months, I still would say yes if he asked me to go back together. I'm not sure what I should do. I've tried not talking to him but I run into him so often without meaning to. I'm scared of him yet I want to be with him. I'm starting to think I really am crazy",31Aug2019,1

132,"Sorry this is a bit lengthy. I'm just so unsure and uncertain on what I should do because everything is so last minute due to unexpected events. Here's some background info:

 I am an engineer that graduated from schooling last year. I was able to get a job working for a small company last October, and I moved away from my home city that is 10 hours drive away for this role. I got this job through my professor at the University that I did one of my internships with, and he had also taught me. With that being said, we have gotten to know each other well, and we have a good relationship with each other. You can pretty much say were friends.

During my months of working for this company, I realized that it is not in a good spot and that I needed to look for a new job soon. After months and months (started in January 2019) of applying, I had no luck of getting any offers. Fast forward to earlier this month, I've chatted with my old friend/professor about potentially doing a Master's for him. As I previously said, I've worked with his research group during one of my coop/internships, so I am familiar with his work. He told me all of the cool projects that I would get the chance to work on. I got excited so I took him on the deal and initiated my Master's application in early-August to start this coming Fall semester (September 2019). Mind you, he had to pull some strings to be able to let me start in September because I applied late. But I also had to do my due diligence in order to get the application process going. Anyways, so we were all set and ready. It was perfect too because I was going on vacation from Aug 15 to 30th to use up my vacation days at work, and then plan my drive and move back to my hometown right after and get ready for school to start on Sept 3 (next Tuesday)

Then suddenly, a company I applied for back in June got back to me saying they wanted to interview me (at this time it was mid-August). I had to refresh my memory about the company and the role. Looking at the position again, it got me excited because it's one of my dream job and it's very technical as well, which is what I like. The HR recruiter wanted to schedule an informal 30-minute phone interview with me. So I did. At this time, I havent told my professor yet about it because it's just an informal interview and I am not sure if I am going to move further in their hiring process. I wasn't getting my hopes up just from previous experience during the times I was applying. So we scheduled it on Aug 12 (Monday). During this call, I made known to him about my travelling plans from Aug 15 to 30th. The HR and I chatted and I talked about my credentials. He has really expressed his appreciation of my skills, and that his team liked my resume and experience, and how it is a really good fit for their company. So after the call, he got back to his team, and they immediately asked my if I was available to do a skype interview. They normally do F2F interviews for anything past the 1st round, but due to my travel plans (and the fact that they're a 4-hour drive away from my current city), skype interview had to make do. To me, this seems like they really want to get to know me and chat with me, and I feel like I have a good chance in this role. So I scheduled a skype interview with them on Aug 14th (the day before I travel). Again, I feel like it went really well, and they said they'll get back to me if they want to proceed further with me.

At this point, I made my professor known about this unexpected prospect. I told him because I respect him, and I want to keep him in the loop because of all the things he did to help me get my Master's application process going. He's pretty chill about it so he just told me keep him posted. So I did. While this was happening, I was also ensuring that I didnt have any loose ends on my part for the Master's application. I haven't told the company yet about my Master's application because that wasn't really final until I started the application for it, which happened after the 2nd skype interview.

In the middle of my vacation, the company reached out to me saying they want to invite me for a 3rd round of interview. We scheduled it and this happened via skype again on Aug 27th (Tuesday). Again, I think it went really well. At the end of the interview, I told them about this prospect of mine about starting my Master's. I told them that I gave my two-weeks notice at the company pretty much just after 2nd skype interview after I started my Master's application. I told them that I got the letter offer from the University to start on Sept 3rd (This coming Tuesday, AKA in less than 4 days). I explained to them that resigning felt like the perfect timing because I am just coming back from vacation (so I'm using up my vacation days), my rent ends on Aug 31st (tomorrow), and school starts in September. Again, this was my plan all along before I got the unexpected job interview. It was all set in stone (or so I thought) when I started my Master's application.

After I let the company know about the Master's, they said they'll get back to me on Friday (today), which they haven't yet. Also, I sent them an email yesterday morning explaining to them the urgency of my situation. And I just sent an email to my professor about this whole situation as well just to keep him in the loop. Yesterday I packed all my things, and loaded about 95% of it into my car today. Right now, I'm sitting on my bed typing this as I am slightly getting worried about this whole situation. I move tomorrow and I don't know if I am moving back to my home city (10-hr drive) or to the new job (4-hour drive). They're in opposite directions from each other, so it'll be around a 14-hr drive if I decided to go to one and then move to the other. Another problem is that it's the long weekend where I am from (Monday is a holiday), so they might take longer to respond.

I've been considering my options and talking with my family/ landlords if I don't hear back from them today/tomorrow. My landlords are Godsend and are super nice. They're willing to let me stay until Sunday morning (Sept 1st). They would let me stay longer, but the new tenant moves in that day too. I'm fine with waiting out a few days here for company's response, BUT the problem is school starts next Tuesday! And I havent enrolled in courses yet because I am not able to register them on my schedule (probably because I havent accepted the offer yet). I want to get back home ASAP because it's a long drive, and I have to unpack, and I have to get my ducks aligned for school in less than 4 days! Again, if it wasn't for the school situation, I'd just stay at some friend's house here while I wait for the company's response. Worst case scenario is I drive back to my home city early Sunday morning and enrol for courses, then later find out that I get the job offer later during the week, which I would gladly accept. I'd drop my courses and drive back because this is a good job with a good company, and I see myself  professionally growing with them in the coming years. It would just be the most exhausting route to take. 

I really want to call the company tomorrow and get an answer. But first of all, I dont think anyone will be there to answer because it's a long weekend. And secondly, I dont feel right about pressuring them due to my situation. Like I already told them about it during the interview, and I sent them an email yesterday as well. Honestly, I dont even know what to do or ask from you fellow redditors. I feel just so stuck right now, and that I'm totally flying by the seat of my pants. I'm not like this at all and I plan all my things in my personal life, work, career, etc. ahead of time. It was just something unexpected came up.",31Aug2019,1
133,"Hi! So let me give background for this. Me and this girl, let’s call her Eliza for privacy, have been friends since we were five. We are both girls, and both are seventeen now and seniors at our high school. 

Through our friendship Eliza has dealt with hardships like her home being foreclosed on when we were in elementary school, her mom cheating on her father but I’m not sure if she knows that and a lot of other stuff. I’ve never mentioned that stuff to her unless she relayed it to me first and I just tried to comfort her.

There’s been instances before where she would use me, early as sixth grade where she used me to rides to school events and then abandoned me once we got there. I was a shy kid, so I spent the remainder of these three hour events completely alone and sad.

But these periods didn’t always last and eventually she became close to me again. Around February of 2018 I began dating a guy, let’s call Matt. Matt was kind and looked out for me, but he picked up on Eliza and began to slowly draw me away from her before openly telling me the way she spoke to me disturbed him. I brushed it off, and spent more time with Matt since he was two years my senior and was going to college soon. Eventually he moved off, and we broke it off in November of last year. We remained extremely close since circumstances broke us up.

A few months before Matt Eliza started dating a guy called Allan. Allan wasn’t good to any of her friends and was incredibly possessive of Eliza, and when we tried to address this she shot all of her friends down and went further from us. Eventually the relationship (shockingly) went to shit and she “broke it off”

Flash forward to now. Eliza is engaged in a sexual relationship with a guy named Will, whose Matt’s friend, her ex Allan, a guy named Derrick who only wants to see her when he’s lonely, and a guy we hardly even know that she hooked up with when he came down to visit (he’s from Texas, we aren’t). She’s promising all these guys a relationship, and leading a few others on for whatever reason. She claims they all love her romantically when that’s not the case as half have girlfriends they are cheating on with her.

Recently she invited Allen over to a shared friend of ours house, without informing our friend. Why? Because she knew none of us wanted Allen around purely because of how he talked down to Eliza and us. She then left some with him for two hours. In frustration our friend group left without talking to her.

A week into our senior year she quit talking to me. I let it go as this is normal, she’s a drama queen but I love her. Eventually, I began to become concerned when one week became two and talked to our shared friend. She had no idea what was going on. This went on for three-four weeks before I had another mutual not in our friend group approach me and ask if me and Eliza where fighting. I said I wasn’t sure, and they told me she was majorly complaining about me in their shared classes.

They said she said I was too negative, and I was a whore for talking to Matt still while he was living with another girl. I was deeply hurt, but stored this information and I went on. I ended up confessing what I learned to our shared friend again, and in anger she confronted Eliza without my knowledge or consent. Eliza confirmed she said those things, and distanced herself from me because of those things. When asked why she didn’t talk to me first, Eliza I ignored it.

Eliza also quit talking to a mutual male friend of ours, assuming he was “on my side” even though I only told one person about this issue in an effort to prevent drama. She also began to become hostile to the friend who confronted her, asking that she “quit being on my side because I wasn’t going anywhere.” This made my friend extremely angry and tell her I never forced her to pick a side. 

She also screen-grabbed  their private conversation and accidentally sent it to her with the captions “what a annoying cunt.” 

Should I just end this relationship if she’s not willing to talk things out or even attempt to salvage things? This is fifteen years, and it will hurt. Should I try to salvage it, or is it beyond that point?",31Aug2019,1

135,"Roughly one month ago, I received an email from a man identifying himself as a Nigerian prince. He provided extensive detail about the corrupt military government currently ruling his nation and has requested my assistance in laundering his wealth to hide it from the authorities. The agreement was that I would provide him with my banking ID and PIN number, at which point he would deposit somewhere between $21-$23 million dollars into my checking account. Once he flees the country, he will withdraw around 50% of the money that I agreed to hold for him, leaving the rest as payment for my services.

Naturally, I sent him my PIN number and banking ID. Since then, I've been waiting for him to deposit the money into my account. After two weeks with no response, I sent a follow-up email asking about the current status of our agreement. Again, no response. You can imagine my frustration.

So far my best luck was with one hole and the gas and air mixed before entering.

144,"I'm a 20f college student in University. Last term I took myself to see a psychiatrist and finally got diagnosed with Persistent Depressive disorder &amp; Unspecified Depressive Disorder. I don't know how to explain this to my family as we are south Asian and my divorced single mother doesn't believe in depression or mental health problems in general. She'll believe my dad has mental health issues and some of my family members on his side of the family have similar issues but she doesn't want to see any on our side of the family, especially in me.

  
My depression is not a new development. I have done years of my own research into mental health issues online and I strongly believe that I had childhood depression and was not diagnosed or treated as my family chalked my symptoms up to me being a 'weird child' and I performed well in school &amp; didn't cause trouble so my school teachers didn't pick up on it either.

  
I had a really bad depressive episode when I was in grade 12 but my mom prevented me from going to therapy because she was concerned that a therapist would put me on drugs. We are in Canada, therapists cannot prescribe medication here. I was at a point where I think I could have really benefitted from antidepressants for a short period of time but unfortunately, I didn't get any help at all, not even a counsellor.

  
When I started University I started seeing a counsellor at school and she was helpful to a point but she should have referred me to a doctor when I explained the severity of some of my symptoms to her. I don't think she believed me when I told her how difficult some of my symptoms were. I didn't go to a doctor until my 2nd term of 2nd year as one of my friends told me to go get diagnosed because it would be helpful. When I explained what I was experiencing to the psychiatrist he didn't take me very seriously until I told him about my worst symptoms and then he did. I have had bad experiences with other doctors not listening to me or taking me seriously as well as I 'don't look depressed'. These other doctors did not even ask for details about my experiences, just survey type questions about how my mood has been the last few days/weeks, when really they should have also asked about how bad my depression has been over all the years not just recently. My mom will not take me very seriously either if I try to explain what I have. I don't have clinical depression &amp; I am still making my way through school &amp; life but I'm unhappy with a lot of stuff where I can clearly see depression has hindered my ability to perform as I should. In high school, my grades were in the mid-90s. In university, my GPA is 75 ( a B in Canada, still good enough to do a masters)  and it is definitely due to depression. I work hard but I don't take proper breaks and 'play hard' and it burns me out. I avoid socializing and end up very lonely which can make me sad. I also don't take great care of myself and eat enough because of loss of appetite and I get sick easier and just generally feel tired. I get anxiety and feel hopeless about how I'm performing in school and it causes me to procrastinate.

  
Last term my mood was pretty stable but I started experiencing worsening focusing issues. I would read pages out of a textbook and not be able to understand what I read and it was impacting my grades severely. I spoke to advisors about it and they let me drop courses and do school part-time for this upcoming term.

  
This fall term I will be enrolled in 1 fine arts course, taking a final exam at the end of the term for a math class which my prof let me differ when I explained to him what I was going through, doing a part-time job for 3-4 hours a week, volunteering for 5-6 hours a week, and trying to build healthy habits &amp; cook for myself &amp; do more physical activity. my mom wants me to enrol in 1 more course because she sees this as a 'Free term' where I'm not doing enough. She is paying rent for my apartment even though I have enough student loan money In my bank account to cover it and I have offered to pay. I'm not even sure If I am ready to tell her I have depression but I am 100% sure that it's not a good idea for me to enrol in 1 more course next term I need to focus on myself. I applied for 1 more part-time job but my mom wants me to take a heavy math course if I don't get it. She's very against me working part-time instead of doing school courses

  
I have a feeling I may not have gotten the job but I can still afford to go to school without it and I really would rather keep applying to more jobs than enrol in another course. I just want to let my brain heal for a bit but I feel so selfish because she has sacrificed a lot for me to be able to go to a good school 2 hours from home. When I see the amount of effort she puts in to be a single parent and work full time I feel lazy and stupid for wanting to take time for myself but I think I really need it. I think I get my depression genetically from my dad's family, my mom has been through a lot but her mental health is fantastic, and I think that makes it more difficult for her to understand why someone else might be depressed.

  
How should I tell her? and also if anyone knows any specific things I can do to work on my depression over my next term please lmk I'm open to advice on that too.",31Aug2019,1
145,"Hey thanks for taking the time to read this.  I finally entered the big corporate job world recently after many many many years of dead end jobs that never utilized my education.  I enjoy the work I do now, but I feel like a huge outsider.  The entire staff is made up of 50 year old white dudes who love God, Trump, guns, and most of all: booze.  These guys love drinking on the job.  Its like Mad Men up in here.  I'm a 31 white weaboo, not religious at all, not political in the least bit, and I don't drink alcohol at all.  I'm actually alcohol intolerant.  One drink will make my skin turn red, my head will start pounding, I become dizzy and hot, and my stomach will twist into knots.  When explaining this to two of my coworkers, they looked at me like I was a ghost speaking a foreign language.

I got called into the bossman's office today.  He was giving me the info on a big training weekend we are all attending in Vegas in October.  After the training, the entire office spends the whole weekend bar hopping, gambling, and hitting strips clubs.  Sounds like a good weekend, right?  Not for me.  I'm very much an introvert and would prefer staying in with my wife and kids. Long story short, the boss informed me that the past guys who didn't ""socialize"" during the past training weekends in Vegas never seem to ""work out"" in the long run.

So I guess the advice I'm seeking is: how in the hell do I make it through this upcoming Vegas trip without ostracizing myself?  I really want to stay with this job, so please no suggestions of ""find a new work place.""  It won't happen.  It's taken me almost ten years to finally land a job like this.

Thanks.",31Aug2019,4

148,"Hello, I work at a small Drs office, it’s the doctor, my coworker, and I. My coworker is cool and fun to be around, but she also has another side that is aggressive, bossy, and critical. She’s kind of a bully at times but it doesn’t take any sweat off of me, in fact I think it’s funny.  As I understand it, my coworker is intolerable in most instances due to her abrasive nature but magically her and I get along well. Seems great right? What could possibly be the problem? The problem is that she buys me food, a lot, and I don’t always have the money to pay her back because my money is being funneled into my first-car fund. I’ve told her this but yet she insists on buying me stuff. It’s been bothering me because I don’t know what the motive is... supposedly just kindness. Surmising: is it because she appreciates me putting up with her bossy and abrasive nature? What is a possible reason and what should I do about it?",31Aug2019,2

And there was this trend that everyone was doing where they started a random conversation anonymously with a random student of the opposite sex.

So i said whatever, what can i lose?
And i sent hello to a random girl that i liked her username.

We were talking for 3 days and i have to say.. it's been a good convo we shared some common interests etc.
I liked her personality overall to be honest.

Then yesterday i asked her ""do you think we are ever gonna reveal our true identities?"" 

She told me that she was thinking about the same thing that day and then she proceeded ""let's just do it right now""

We did, and then she disappeared like a ghost.

I mean... I can't judge her?

If she didn't like my appearance i can't do anything about it(i am pretty good looking), maybe not her type though

160,"Sorry for the format I’m on mobile. Okay so for the past week I have been looking for a new apartment for my boyfriend and I. I have been including him in the process, showing him listings and asking his thoughts. Today we viewed and apartment and he said he like it and seemed happy with the decision to move.  The new apartment has a lot of amenities for us like a pool and a gym, and each of our commutes to work would be about 25 minutes.

The reason we are moving from our current apartment is because our neighbor is a crack dealer, and about a week ago my boyfriend told me he’s smoked crack with our neighbor. I don’t know why he decided to do this as he’s never done crack before and talks about how he doesn’t like coke so I’m not sure what the point of that was.  But to get away from all of this we decided we should move into the  suburbs.  Personally I don’t really want to stay, I never liked our neighbor (even before we knew he was a drug dealer) and now I don’t feel comfortable staying (i hate doing laundry because I’m afraid I’m going to see the neighbor or run into someone looking to buy from him). Tbh I have a fear of my boyfriend becoming a crackhead if we stay and that’s not exactly the future I planned for us.  Now he’s saying he feels like he ruined our current apartment for us but likes this apartment and doesn’t want to leave. 

The thing is we’ve already put in our application for the new apartment and I just told my current landlord today that we’d be leaving by October 1st.  I have a lot of time off of work in September and my parents are visiting next weekend and they said they could help us move. I feel like it’s too late to cancel all of this. Also for safety reasons I’d like to move out as soon as possible. Am I being selfish for making us move? I’m trying to respect his wish to stay but I’m not really sure how to compromise here. Any advice on how to handle this situation?

TLDR: my boyfriend’s been hanging out with our crackhead neighbor, he wanted to move away from the city, we found a new apartment in the suburbs and informed our current landlord we’re leaving and now he wants to stay in our current apartment",31Aug2019,1
161,"I just don't know what to do...I've been with my bf for several years. His daughter Sara (not her real name) is 10 and is like a daughter to me. My bf has an acquaintance/friend Bob (not real name) who is in his late 30s that only comes to the house a few times a year. The majority of the time he comes over is for a game/fight night and usually those land on weekends when sara isn't around (her mother has her on weekends). However, sometimes she has been around and Bob's behavior is...well it just seems *off*. I can't tell if I'm overreacting, paranoid over too many terrible news articles, or just because a I'm prone to overrating sometimes...but this guy has never married or been in any relationship for many years, I don't think he's dated since his early 20s. He worked at a daycare center up until he was fired last year for inappropriate behavior with the children like letting them sit on his lap. No charges or anything happened, but he was fired and now works at an oil change place. Just tonight he was over and because of the holiday we still have Sara at our house and not her mother's. As soon as I opened the door to let him in things felt wrong. He barely said hello to me but walked up to Sara and hugged and kissed her head. She was weirded out and backed up and said ""umm who are you?"" It had been a long time since they've seen each other and she no longer recognized him. Once I reintroduced him she remembered him though. But it didn't feel right how he greeted her...but maybe he's just an affectionate guy and was excited to see her again?...I brushed it off. Then later, my bf started playing a video game with the encouragement of Bob saying he just wanted to watch him play. I was messing around on my computer and Sara was goofing off at the pool table in clear sight from where I was sitting but technically in the other room. Bob gets up and ""instructs"" Sara how to play, standing behind her showing her how to use the pool stick. I cough and make eye contact with him and he stops and comes back over to watch the video game. Maybe he was just trying to teach her?...I brushed it off again...I mean do I kick him out of the house on suspicion? He's not my friend and my bf was focused on his game and didn't see anything... Then Sara went off to bed and I followed upstairs to use the bathroom for better privacy. When I get out...a little while since I was reading on my phone...he was on her bed, inside her princess tent she has on her bed, watching something on her tablet. He immediately got up, joked it off and is now back downstairs watching the video game. I want to stand guard at her door until he leaves...it just isn't right, is it? Am I being crazy?? 
He's given me the creepy vibe in the past, only when Sara is around though. I've even talked to my bf about it and Bob's behavior. He says Bob's just always been real friendly with kids (red flag, right?!...or paranoia from too many stories of pedophiles, and recent Epstein stuff so it's been on my mind and what if I'm projecting??) 
This is a throw away account. Names are changed.

167,"Hi there

I just started my junior year as a transfer student at a four year university. I am originally from Virginia and moved to South Carolina and am living with my grandparents. I got a job about a month ago. And since this area is quite touristy, I have learned they are open on the two major holidays for my family, Christmas and Thanksgiving. Being out of state I am extremely homesick. I miss my boyfriend, my family, and my three doggies. This is my first time being this far away from any of them for this long of time. 

During my interview for the job I am currently employed at I told them I can work holidays, which is true for the most part. I don’t mind working Thanksgiving, Easter, Halloween. The some kind of major ones, I did lie just a tad though. My reasoning was that any other job interview I been to I feel like me being a full time college student plus wanting to be home winter break made me less desirable as an employee. Which is understandable. 

My question is how should I tell my employer I want to be home for winter break? I’m talking possibly 12/16/19-01/08/20 or 12/22/19-1/08/20. So between two or three weeks. In this case I would be missing Christmas and New Years in SC. I would love to use this time to be able to see friends, family, the doctor and the dentist. I am not planning on being a permanent resident any time soon, so I really don’t want to have to move any of my medical necessities unless truly needed. 

This time of year is also really important to me because I might have to go a whole five months without seeing them for my spring semester due to most likely having an internship , unless my family or boyfriend visited me.

My other question would be also how would I ask to be home for summer break? It’s their busiest time of year and I’m hoping to be gone from mid May to end of July. My only thought would be I would need to quit and reapply, but I don’t want to burn bridges if me bailing on them when they may need me most if I decide to apply there again. 

Thank you!

TL;DR How would of an out of state college student ask to go home summer and winter break? I didn’t tell them my plans in interview in fear I wouldn’t get hired due to also being a full time college student.",31Aug2019,1

170,"I am probably one of the most jealous people I know. I get jealous of people for their looks, abilities, talents, skills, opportunities, wealth, and hell, even the attention they get as well as their fucking personality traits I want. It seems I'm always jealous of someone for they have that I don't have. I get jealous of how many followers someone has on social media and how many friends they have. The worst example of my envy is getting jealous of peoples' attention.

I went somewhere last summer and a girl had a life-threatening asthma attack. She was so well known by everyone and everyone basically worshipped her and I was beyond envious of that; I was good friends with her and I even let her know that. Her asthma attack got so bad that an ambulance was called and I was secretly hoping she'd die because I was so jealous of her. She ended up living. She returned the next day, despite almost dying and everyone hounded her and I felt so incredibly jealous.

This summer I went somewhere and a girl got thrown off a horse and had to go to the emergency room. She had someone go with her to the emergency room and I had a crush on the person who took her. Since the emergency room takes forever, they basically spent the entire day together, getting dinner and shit and they must have spent about eight to nine hours together. I was secretly hoping she wouldn't return but she did. After this, my crush was always making sure she was okay and basically tending to her for the rest of the days we were there. My crush never really initiated conversations with me but would always talk to this girl and I could literally feel envy seething through my skin. Also, everyone there kept making sure she was okay and I was telling myself in my head, ""I bet they wouldn't do that if it were me."" She was more liked than me. 

I always seem to want to be fawned over for some reason. I am \*\*DEFINITELY\*\* a huge attention whore. Whenever someone is getting more attention than me, it makes me extremely jealous.",31Aug2019,1

I thought great and spent an hour there following that doing the necessary paperwork such as tax forms, direct deposit and all that stuff. Before I leave he tells me he’ll have the schedule together on Friday and that I’ll get a phone call for my hours next week. I think sure sounds reasonable and go on my way.

177,"I’ve been liking the same guy for the last two years. We went to the same school together and practically have known each other our whole lives. In middle school I never really liked him as more than a friend but I always thought he was cute and he told one of my friends that I was really pretty. After that we went to high school together for the first two years. Though I never wanted to admit it to myself, I always felt attracted to him in some way. We had a couple classes together. For some reason he was so hard to talk to, and , he would never come up to talk to me. There would be moments where while everyone else is talking and waiting for the bell to ring, him and I would just stand in the hall next to each other and not say anything; he’d be playing with his backpack or whatever and I’d just wait for him to say something to me bc I was low key shy too . I never understood this. He was never willing to talk to me like he was with other girls who haven’t been his friend his whole life. I’d often catch him looking at me while in class, or while he was in group conversations that I was not a part of. This made me confused bc I started to think that he may like me back. But If he was my friend why wouldnt he talk to me ? I was always the first one to say hi. I would try to be as casual as possible And ask if he wanted to hang out; he’d say yes in person and then completely avoid my texts until the day passed or just come up with BS excuses. More recently I tried asking him if you wanted to hang out and he lied about being busy and didn’t even suggest a different  time -which shows no interest in me at all. Sometimes while we’d talk he’s always thinking about his guy friends trying to call them so he can find out where they were at school (and therefore leave me, again being rude to me).

Always been mildly racist and unable to accept world views other than his own and I never really questioned it before because I was apolitical.

Ed and I were planning to sleep on the floor (in sleeping bags) of the two older guy's room and pay little to nothing. They decided later that the Hilton probably would not allow it and so Ed and I needed to find a new place to stay. I woke up kind of late one day to this discussion and told my friend that I would shower, get dressed and then look for a new place to stay with Ed. When I came back Ed had already found another hotel (Hilton was fully booked) and booked a Queen size room  for both of us to stay in. Since Ed booked it and insisted he did not want to share the bed with me, I said it was fine to sleep on the floor and pay considerably less. No problem.

Fast forward to meeting Ted and his friend and reaching the 2nd day of LAN, out of the blue Ted tells me that I need to sort out the money with Ed (I planned to pay him at the end of the stay) and that I am being ridiculous. He tells me to pay Ed half or almost half right now. I was not expecting it, nor had I decided on the fair amount to pay Ed, so I didn't know what to say. Ed got angry and say I would be sleeping on the streets if it wasn't for him and that I can't ""leech of people my whole life"". He also said that this was why I had left the discord call \*\*I forgot to say, when announcing he had booked the hotel, he had said (probably as a joke, we troll a lot) that I didn't sound very interested. For some reason, I got angry and left the call\*\*, implying it was to avoid paying him. 

I got very upset at Ed for saying those things and thinking I would try to con him after 15 years of knowing him. I was also very angry at Ted for getting involved and potentially ruining our friendship. I went very quiet for the remaining 2 days as it had completely ruined the mood. I didn't know what to think and felt like getting a train and leaving. They would later ask me why I've been so quiet and that was why...

On the walk back to the hotel Ed told me that he thought Ted was a c\*nt, being critical about everything, getting involved in the money situation and for calling Ed a ""pushover"" for not demanding me to pay for the hotel instantly. I agreed with him and realised that Ted's constant pressure on him about the money had caused him to snap on me and maybe brainwash him into making me pay more than what I should pay. 

I ended up getting a roll-able bed in the room for the remaining 2 days and paid around 43% of the total (including my bed), which I thought was more than I should have, but I was sick of it, so I just wanted to get it over with. He told me he was stressed when booking the room (there were few left) and that I shouldn't have left him to do it alone. I told him that he shouldn't have made me sleep on the floor. We are both not talking to Ted ever again. I realise now that I should have told Ted to f\*ck off. I know that I could have prevented this all by paying more than my share at the start, but I'm fed up of being the ""nice guy"" and wanted to stand my ground and pay a fair price. I hate how money can do stuff like this and I hate stringy people, insisting I pay instantly and accusing me of trying to scam them if I don't. Ted's friend was fine when I said I'd pay for the petrol after he'd driven me back home. No further questions, just trust. 

I don't want our friendship to be ruined over this. I'm just unsure how to feel.",31Aug2019,1

187,"So school recently started and right off the bat I knew that algebra 2 is going to be hard. I didn’t really like my teacher’s teaching style much and basic functions just didn’t click in my brain at all. I tried taking the correct measures to understand it fully by asking for help a lot, taking notes on almost everything my teacher said, setting aside 1-2 hrs a day to focus on the homework, using up my hour and a half free period to try and work out some practice problems. When the day before the quiz rolled around, I facetimed my friend who’s an accelerated math student for an hour to ask her questions since she’s already taken algebra 2. The day of the quiz, I made sure to ask questions about the stuff i wasn’t sure on. When i took the quiz, it seemed fair. I recognized all the questions and what they were asking, and i tried to answer to the best of my ability. I literally thought to myself after the quiz, “hey, that actually wasn’t too bad. i think i’m finally getting it.” Six hours later, i checked my grade online and i got an F. The only credit i got was from the extra credit that I did the night before. I’m in shock, I’m embarrassed, and I’m mad at myself. I haven’t gotten an F on a test or a quiz in my life. I’m really worried that this is gonna leave a lasting impression on my teacher. It’s pretty much a given that I have to go see my teacher before class so we can go over what went wrong, but what am i supposed to say to my teacher?

192,"My grandpa is currently at a nursing home as everyone in my family is often too busy to help him with his meals and such. This task used to go to my grandmother, however, she has stage four cancer and has to get chemo every other week.  He was sent to the nursing home after he got out of the hospital for breaking his hip bone as a result of tripping at home. My grandfather is a very picky eater, and almost always only liked consuming Korean food. He very disliked the food given to him at the nursing home, and I don't blame him. The food there is not good (in terms of flavor) and some parts of it are burnt. My family tried to bring him Korean food he liked often, but not often enough. However, on one day (2 weeks ago) he choked on one of the food items given to him, and he was downgraded to liquids only. I believe this has given him a trauma. He used to eat foods after this point when he was spoon fed, but now he just dislikes eating in general. If we do spoon feed him now, he seems to just chew or keep it in his mouth for a very long time, and we have to tell him to swallow. Whenever I go see him, he seems to lose more and more weight. He also has diabetes but the issue of him not eating has become so apparent that his nurses and dietitians have said to give him anything as at this point he has to eat something. Unfortunately, recently he has also developed pneumonia and has to take antibiotics. I was wondering if you guys had any similar experiences and could give me and my family advice on what to do/feed him. Please help me out, I appreciate it so much.",31Aug2019,1
193,"Throwaway account here. I need advice. My high school recently changed their volleyball uniforms. They're now requiring the players to wear loose shorts (they're like past mid-thigh) instead of spandex. The issue here is that the administration didn't even consult the players or students before they decided on this new ""policy"". They're saying it's because they want to be more inclusive to the others (such as LGBT, religious, etc). However, for the people who DO NOT WANT to wear the loose shorts... they are required to. We cannot just choose whatever we want. And to add salt to the wound, the shorts ARE NOT comfortable. Before the administration team decided this policy, we were given the option to choose between the two. But it was taken away after the decision. Yet other teams still have their tight-fitting uniforms. Is that a violation of my rights?

I come from a conservative background so I don't have much exposure to trans, lesbian, gay, or other marginalized peoples. I fully support them, but at the same time, don't force it all on me. Don't force me to dress like the others, or make them more ahead of us in the equality scale. I've been fighting this with the administration team to no avail. They're saying that it's irreversible. But it only took them like less than a month to decide this (it's a *MAJOR* decision). I don't give a crap about others wearing the shorts because they're more comfortable in these, I just want to be allowed to wear spandex to play volleyball. I've been playing volleyball for almost 10 years now, and I've always worn spandex. My only goal out of this is to be allowed to wear spandex so I can play my best in games and be comfortable in my own body. I feel like the administration is body-shaming us (my team's pretty fit) because we're in good shape. They also said that there were concerns about the *""shape""* that spandex makes our asses look like. But with the new shorts, it's just worse because the girls are rolling them up WAY past their ass lines, shorter than where the spandex would normally be. 

Sorry for the jumbling, I'm just trying to make sense of all this. This has never been an issue, but it is now. Is it worth fighting for and getting the parents involved? Or am I just selfish for wanting to have the right to choose, and to be comfortable in my own skin, along with being comfortable while playing volleyball? I'm real open to tips, advice, or feedback. Thanks.",31Aug2019,2
195,"Hi everyone. 
My girlfriend of 3.5 years is not happy with me anymore. She loves me very much, but I break her heart. And I break my own too. I used to have so much passion for life, but it seems like just after we started dating I lost all of it. I got my first full time office job and it drained everything from me. 
We recently have been having problems. She has stopped trying in the relationship because for years she was the only one.

Now we've come to a crossroads where if I don't start trying..  it's really gonna fall apart. She is so tired. And I get that. But I need help. I don't know how to be romantic and it's killing me because I know this should come naturally. I don't feel like I trust myself after realizing that I was so bad at it. And I know I need to... How the f*** do I fix this?! I'm so confused and quite honestly, sad.

198,"I posted this info r/relationship_advice as well, but this is something I really need help or something or anything really. 

My SO (19F) and myself (19M) have had a very rough patch in our relationship as of late. A lot of this stems from me, where I have a tendency to omit things, not on purpose but it is still something that has happens. For example we went to a drive thru and ordered, I recognized an employee as someone from HS who used me to try to get to prom and fool around with a friend of mine. During that, that employee and I talked about being in a relationship and everything but nothing came from it as I cut things off before prom due to finding out get intentions. While in the car with my SO I had said I knew her from HS and she was a horrible person and I left it at that due to being uncomfortable talking about that experience. It was later while on a phone call where I began to explain my past relationships in great detail (something my SO and I hadn't done) and it was then I brought up the prom thing and explained what had happened, but I ended up getting at fault. Another example is I went out a night with a friend of mine, we drove around and talked and whatnot. My SO saw I was near a bowling alley (I never went bowling that night) and told me I lied about what I was doing even though I wasnt. Another thing is the car I drove for a while had Apple carplay which is a program that allows the driver access to basic phone functions (texting, calling, music, etc) while driving. I had least work late one night and there was road work on the road to leave and I didn't move at all so eventually instead of using talk to text I put the car in park and just used regular text (I was still in the parking lot of the place i worked) and I never informed my girlfriend I switched over to actual text until I made a spelling error. Again, me lying/omitting.
Today, we had a class together in which we said we would work on a group project in a group together. Our class broke off into a meet and greet type of activity to help find group members. I began do talk to classmates just as she had, and eventually we both found groups but not one together. I feel as though this was due to a lack of communication on both ends, not just mine, but I don't understand why I'm again at fault. 
Later on, my roommate asked my apartments group chat if anyone wanted anything from the liquor store. Previously my girlfriend and I said we wouldn't buy any alcohol, which was fine. At this point due to the prior arguing and not talking I changed my mind and decided to ask my roommate for a cheap bottle. While I knew it was wrong, I changed my mind. I didn't think I lied or anything. 
In all I need advice. All of these issues keep me up every night, and frankly a lot of nights my thoughts drift off into things I don't ever want to think about ( breaking up, me beginning to harm myself again, and even suicide) and I know that may sound extreme, but to me it isn't. I've caused her a lot of problems and I want them to stop. I've had quite possibly the roughest year both relationship and personal life wise and I'm barely holding together at this point. I need help. I need to fix things. I am trying. And Ashley if you end up reading this I love you.",31Aug2019,1

Ever since she got in high school ,it's been nothing but drama and fights. She lies, sneaks, doesn't listen to my rules.

Lately she has undermined me by getting permission for stuff she knew I'd say no to by going to her dad. I'm overruled by family so can't get her to mind or folllow rules because they always give in to her.

I'm the one who pays for her Apple Music and and iPhone, her clothes, sports equipment. I'm the one who handles her school stuff, takes her on vacations, out to eat, to movies, etc. I'm the one who works all day, and sits through her sporting events all evening and don't get home until midnight sometimes.

I'm the one who helps with homework and buys homecoming dresses and everything else. I'm the one who pets her when she's sick, loves on her, hugs her.

I do ever single thing former for years only to get treated awful by her.

She recently told me when I told her she couldn't run around in the car at night with random friends, that she hates me, doesn't want me in her life, is sick of me, wants me to quit loving her and leave her alone. Told me her dad has chstodycpapers and custody so she'll ask him for permission and do whatever she wants,

My question is, would I be an awful parent if I cut her off..like stopped giving her money, buying her things, going to her sporting events? I feel like that would be abusive and mean but at the same time, feel like maybe she'd realize how much I do for her.

Should I cancel her phone? I. Sick of paying the bill, but at the same time, I can track her location and contact her in emergencies. 

I just don't know what to do with her..nothing j can do. I'm nit her real parent and no matter what rules I set I am overruled by her dad. Or grandparents.",31Aug2019,0

219,"So my girlfriend and I recently broke up. We were together for 2 years and 3 months. Our relationship was surprisingly flawed due to both of us having a lack of emotional strength. Meaning when she would go through a fit of depression she would completely shut down and I couldn’t even help her a little bit. We had a good connection but we spent too much time together. We worked together, we showered together, etc. even after spending all that time together our communication was very sub par. We could read one another and bond out in public but as soon as we got home we had nothing to talk about because we shared everything together already. Anyways so I found out recently that she cheated on me a couple days before we broke up with a “friend” she told me over and over I didn’t need to worry about. I knew something was happening during the relationship because I knew her well enough to know when she was hiding something. So of course I’m hurt but I also understand. She found the emotional connection with him she couldn’t have with me. She also found that their sexual chemistry was better than ours. He could do things in the bedroom that I was uncomfortable with doing. Moving forward we still live together because she still loves me and still wants me in her life because of how much we get along still and can have fun doing friend stuff together. Every once in a while she will go see her friend. I know they have sex because we are open enough to talk about things without any weirdness between us. However she told me something last night that concerns me as her friend. She is sleeping with him without protection and letting him finish inside her!! Now they have been buying plan B but I feel like this is a blatant disregard for her future. She wants to be single and go on deployment for the military and save up a bunch of money and get help with her depression. But if she gets pregnant than all of that goes down the drain. She told me they are both worried about her getting pregnant but have had unprotected sex multiple times and he’s finished inside her on those occasions.

222,"So I have a girlfriend who I am having issues with and I need advice on how to best handle the situation. 

I have a friend Megan. she was a bridesmaid in my wedding that coming up in November. In April due to money issues she asked me if she and her husband who was a groomsman could bow out and not be apart of the wedding, I was hurt but understood because weddings are expensive. 

In May I turned 30 and threw a big party invited a bunch of people. She and her husband didn’t show up, never really gave me a reason just didn’t come. But she did go to my ex’s birthday and our other mutual friends birthday at the same place mine was held a few months after. 

At the beginning of this month I had a bridal shower that she was invited to, right when it was about to end she texted me saying she was sick. I told her “I am really upset your not here” and she just said “I might have to go to the ER”. I didn’t respond back and now it’s been a month and we have not spoken. I know that makes me sound like a jerk cus she said she was sick but she is ALWAYS sick and there is ALWAYS something horrible wrong and I am was just over it at the time. 

When my friend Megan got married back in 2012 I basically stopped my entire life to make to sure her wedding was a success and I was the ONLY bridesmaid that did so. I threw her a bridal shower, I made about 300 paper flower, I went to all her vendor appointments with her, I helped pick out her dress, I helped picked out all the decorations, I made 20 cactus centerpiece. Day of her wedding I decorated her hall, and was her day of coordinator. I don’t want be an entitled bitch here and say “she owes me” cus I didn’t do all of that to get pay back. At the time she needed me, I love her, so I stepped up and got it done. 

Now it’s my turn to get married, I need her, and she is no where to be found. I know Megan is going through some tough personal things right now, but 2012 when she was getting married I was also trying to graduate college so my sympathy level is really low. Megan has told me that she will be my day of coordinator, like I was for her wedding but at this point idk if I feel comfortable with her doing it. She has not been to ANYTHING of mine that has to deal with my wedding, she does not ask me about my wedding, has not gone to any of my appointments with me, has no clue what’s going on with anything. Also after the shower thing we have not spoken to each other in a month. 

I want to sit her down and ask her flat and say you need to make more of an effort or we need to stop being friends. Either you come to the big things like birthday, showers, etc, or you do the Lil things like tue morning text messages just saying “hi I hope you have a great day”. You can’t not do either. I am getting feed back from others that this is a good idea and a horrible idea. What should I do?",31Aug2019,1
224,"TL;DR my wife is leaving my child and I to live in a nursing home.

The days ahead seem rather bleak and often times pretty dark. I'll attempt to provide as much background as possible without being overly lengthy and boring.

My relationship with my spouse is coming to an end over the next several months after a 17 year relationship. We've been together since high school, and she has been my best friend and for quite some time now my only friend. Unfortunately she was diagnosed with a disease 5 years ago that has progressed to a state of near paralysis. It has been an incredibly difficult journey for the both of us and our teenage child. As her disease has progressed over the last several years I have assumed the role as her primary caregiver which I long ago accepted the responsibility of, no questions asked. I care for her deeply and have done every thing I can to help provide for her and to ensure that she has had the proper and best care by any means necessary. I'm also self employed working full-time doing a low-payed contract position that allows me the flexibility to care for her as much as possible. Our teenage child also requires a substantial amount of my attention as their mental health has been greatly affected by their mother's illness. I'm responsible for getting my child to numerous counseling appointments every week and trying to manage their emotional outbursts and rebellious and often defiant actions. That has been a huge undertaking in and of itself.

Through all of this my spouse has always felt a tremendous amount of guilt in regards to me being her primary caregiver. She claims that she is ""holding me back"". As the disease has progressed, so has the amount of time my assistance is needed. While I've never once complained, she is aware that I'm under a tremendous amount of stress. I haven't been able to gain any meaningful employment. I haven't had the time for any social activities. Friends that I once had are now lost as I haven't seen them in years, and we've relocated. Since I'm self employed and work alone, I don't even have work to escape to for social interactions. I often neglect my own well-being for the benefit of my wife and child. All of this for the most part has been fine with me. I came to peace with the reality of her disease and how much effort and what sacrifices would need to be made years ago. Even though we've had countless conversations about her guilt and I've exclaimed until blue in the face that I want to take care of her for the rest of her life, she insists that the guilt is too much too bear, and she wants me to move on.

She has decided to essentially leave me and our daughter to live in a nursing home or an assisted living facility sometime in the next few months. She has talked about this on more than one occasion over the last year or so. She's also threatened suicide several times over the last several years. Currently she claims that she is not suicidal. I have tried again and again to talk her out of a nursing home, explaining that I  want to care for her for as long as she needs it. Last year I had one of her friends attempt to talk her out of it, and she explained to her how she will never get the level of care that I provide for her at a nursing home. None of this has mattered, and at best I've only been able to prolong the inevitable. So in just a few short months I'm going to lose my best friend and wife as she moves out, and our child will lose a mother to come home to everyday. My wife and I will not stay together, and will most likely file for divorce before she makes the transition. I can't think of any other way to convince her to stay without guilt-tripping her, and even if I somehow could, I fear that she may just actually commit suicide down the road.

I worry about the additional trauma this will cause our child, and this will continue to be my primary concern. I'm going to talk with my child's counselors next week about the upcoming events to find out the best way to mitigate the possible short and long term psychological damage that I'm sure this will cause. 

As for me... I really don't know. I'm still trying to come to grips with all of it. I plan on, when I have more time, to seek counseling for myself. Like I've stated in the title, I don't have any friends to lean on or seek advice. I don't know when I'll even have time to make new ones. Years down the road? I've been with the same woman since I was 16, and my mind can't even fathom dating.  I guess I'll have the time to really buckle down and focus on a career, even though it seems so uninteresting and pointless to me now.

I know this has been long, and that its a really unique and specific situation. My child is already suffering and struggling so much, and I'm greatly concerned for how they'll handle this. I'm looking for advice, one, from anyone who has experience with helping a child through a traumatic situation especially a teenager, and two, how should I handle all of this? The transition for my wife? Myself? I've never really dealt with any major loss before, and right now I can barely focus, and I feel so incredibly numb to everything around me. 

If you've read this far, I genuinely thank you for your time. I don't really know what I expect in the form of advice. I'm just scared and heartbroken and really don't know what to do. Thank you again.",31Aug2019,1
225,"So I'm in my university marching band and we are student run. The point is, is that after band ptactice some of the section leaders said some freshman messaged them saying they were uncomfortable with me. They also told me to watch what I say while I am buzzed/slightly drunk at a bonding. After that, they told me that the situation was not bad enough to involve the executive commitee for disciplinary action (executive committee are the students who hold the most important positions).

 Here is my frustration:
1. They did not give me exact details of what I did to make a freshman uncomfortable, a senior talked about a humorous hookup experience taking it up the ass? So Im not sure how I could have been problematic in any way. I never said anything racist or sexually harassed anyone?

2. If I feel like this is what I get for trying to make friends and be social, then I feel like it's not worth my time to show up to these things. This is the first bonding of the year :( 

3. The way I was warned came off as slightly passive aggressive and dubious to me. Why was executive commitee mentioned? That seems really off to me. The section leaders said, ""Oh yeah we don't belive you're a bad person but...""

I know this may come off as petty or perhaps dense but I just need some help. I do not want to feel like I'm not liked, you know?",31Aug2019,1
226,"Long story short my wisdom teeth first appeared when I was 17, so it was 2 years ago.

I didn't pay much attention on them at first because they didn't hurt that much when growing up and I was rooting for them to fit in well in my gum.

Turns out they're making my gum and cheeks hurt besides giving me light headaches. After these effects, I know for sure that I'll have to remove them. I know I need to but I'm afraid.

When my sister removed her wisdom teeth, she spent a week without barely talking like a normal person and laughing was a pain :p

228,So me and my girlfriend been dating for 4 months and she has a bestfriend thats bi sexual for 3+ years . I met her within a week of meeting her we fell in love and making love later happened. Throughout the relationship she had a fake brother (someone she calls bro but not blood related) that would hit her and she would be okay with it before she met me until I addressed her after he hit her again in a playful way right in front of me that I felt uncomfortable and wouldn’t want her to play fight with him since that’s kinda flirtatious in a way . One day she left n told me a hour before that she was going to go biking with him around 6pm  and later ended up at his at 7pm with pajamas on. At 8 pm I called her n she took forever to answer and as soon as she did her hair was in a pony tail n messsy . The first thing she said “it’s not what it seems” and I shook it off . So then later on that night around 8:30 something his little sister took the phone from me and my girlfriend went off to go see this new puppy that her “bro” got a couple days back and I heard a slap sound really loud. I held it in and continued. Later on she then explains she gots nothing to do in her house so she insisted in staying longer and told me she’ll call me back to take a quick 5 second video of the puppy . This all taken place in the living room but the video that was taken took place in a bedroom and she didn’t call me back 12 minutes later even after she posted the video so I called her back and she look like she rushed into the living room. I then faked going afk to fool her for thinking I gotten a missed call and we was on video chat she laid the camera down on the floor and twirled on the floor towards her bro while he was sitting down and he said “damn girl” and she then laid on her stomach and asked him with her legs kicked up “ what would your dog do if I was laying like this” . He asked her if I was on the phone but mouthed off and she said no . But nothing proceeded on afterwards. I confronted her about it and she denied him hitting her whatsoever and apologised and cut it off with him . Back to my girlfriends best friend during our relationship she told him that she gets aggressively horny when drunk and she would want to hang out with him 4 times out of the week to everyday if necessary. She even allowed him to say “ I’ll choke you” right in front of me towards her and get mad at me for saying that’s disrespectful. Should I trust that her loyalty is with me ? She also made new guy friends and instantly connected with them and now she calls them “close friends” via school. But tried to bypass a boundary with her but then she stopped it (she says) and they respected it (she says),31Aug2019,1

235,"Kind of a long story so bare with me. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 years - since I was 14 years old. We’ve had our ups and downs (stupid hs stuff and then transitioning to college 4 hours away from each other) but we’re in a really good place rn. Let’s call him Ben. 

I also have a friend I’ve know almost my whole life. We’ll call him Matt. Matt and I have known each other since we were little and we work together when I’m home for the summer (he’s kinda my boss now).

Matt was acting pretty weird this summer. Always seemed salty and like he was angry with me. I finally said something to him about it after I got back to college and after a very lengthy conversation he told me he’s in love with me and has been for about 4 years. He says he doesn’t expect me to leave Ben (also keep in mind Matt has his own gf of four years that I am not close with) and that we can just go back to normal and be friends. 

I told him it might be best if we don’t talk for a while and he drunkenly called me tonight upset about how it’s not fair that I don’t wanna talk to him. I was very clear with him that I love Ben. The thing is there are definitely some feelings there for Matt. I’ve only been in one serious relationship and Matt and I are super close so I feel like it’s sort of normal to have thought of him in that light. 

What do I do in this situation? I feel so lost about it right now. I love my boyfriend but I don’t know how to handle this without messing up my relationship or my friendship.  TIA and sorry for the long story.",31Aug2019,1

238,"So I'm a teenager in highschool and just got my schedule for this year. And find out that my counselor did not put me in a dance class this year, some context: (I have had dance since freshman year and this would be my last year in high school). The reason why was because the dance class I was suppose to have (Dance 5/6 or Advance Dance) was the same period as my French class(A 4th year class that only existed in this period only). So basically I either can ask my counselor to move me up to an even higher dance class(VERY Advance, more than my skills) OR stay in dance 3/4 or Intermediate dance(fyi have been doing for 10th and 11th grade). Now my close friend have the same problem as i did since we have the same french class, and she moved up into the VERY advance dance class. And encourage me to do the same...but..I'm honestly so scared to move up THAT much. I have confidence in myself regarding my dancing but I wouldn't consider myself to be THAT amazing to be in that class. But staying in intermediate dance AGAIN for the 3rd year seems stupid(it was so easy last year). I know how good the kids are in the VERY advance class and i think that i would feel slow or stupid for being in their class. I love dancing but at this rate i feel so conflicted that i might just drop it all together this year, which breaks my heart and i know that the dance teacher was so excited to have me in class this year.

Surprisingly the worst day of my life (I'll call it wdoml for short) wasn't when my grandpa died, or when I failed something, or when I had a break up. It started with my alarm not going off. I have a google home and I set my alarm for x hour, idk why but it didn't sound. My mom woke me up much later than I wanted to wake up but thankfully i didnt have the first class that day and would only miss one class. I woke up all stressed to be late, changed, ate, and headed out. On my way to school I crashed. I hit the car in front of me because I didnt stop fast enough.

Thankfully the guy was super chill and nice and told me how to deal with everything (I'm 16 and it was my first crash). He helped me call the insurance and stuff like that. In Mexico when you turn 16 you can get a provisional license from 16-18. If you do something like crash it'll get taken away for 3-6 months. So my license got taken away. 

In general it wasn't that bad but I was still super worn down after that. I went to school and nothing much happened. Just a normal day. I finished school and went to a show jumping competition I had. I did horrible. I had no energy because of the crash and felt super tense. 

My mom managed to get my license back early somehow (probably corruption since it's super common in mx) and I drove back home after the competition. (I just realized that I didnt metion this but the cop let me drive without a license to go to school, just to be careful)

On my way back home I got a warning on my car that said something like ""engine cooling fluid super hot stop car"". I did. Called my mom 4 times no answer. Called my dad 3 times. No answer. I turned it back on after like 10 minutes and it seemed fine. Drove back home. 

It may not sound too bad but I was super tense throughout the day and feel sick mentally.

After that I went to my friends house in my dad's car cos I didnt want to have my car explode. I drove there. Forgot my license and they ask you for it at the entry to where he lives. Went back home, drove back, tried to stop at oxxo to get some Boost but there was no parking. Went to his how finally and had a decent time. It wasn't bad but I was too out of it to enjoy it.

So I’ve got a friend who I’ve been friends with for a few years now and he’s always been there for me as I have him, however his problem has been that he doesn’t seem motivated and can be quite lazy.

For context, he works at one of his parents pubs as a bartender full time at 19 years, and the rest of us have gone to university. I have no problem with this, but he doesn’t seem motivated to further himself, and is content with the idea he might inherit his families businesses; even so he has made no attempt to learn how to run a business and just assumes it’s a big gravy train for cash and he’ll do nothing for the rest of his life. 

With his job at their pub, he regularly leaves early when bored or working with someone he doesn’t like, knowing he won’t be fired.

I tried doing a joint business venture with him a few months back as he convinced me he’d changed and was skilled in coding a website. On the day of launch, he had done nothing and the website was a shambles and I had to rebuild myself from scratch whilst he spent 5 hours designing a logo. Even then, I shut down the business today because it was dead in the water and a complete failure which he didn’t even pay his side of the invoices for.

As for the gym, I’ve been motivated for the last 3 years and gotten him into it, but he hardly turns up anymore and just says in bed until 12pm and lounges about at home.

It’s just sad because I want him to do well, and I thought as I’ve turned myself into an entrepreneur and all of our other mates are doing similar things he’d be up for it too, especially as he was telling us all how he wants to go Dubai and Maldives and buy brand new cars etc. 

Do I just leave him to be lazy and inherit his family businesses or try speak to him and find out what’s stopping him from working?",31Aug2019,1

Three friends are in a rental car going on holiday.

Only one of us can drive.

Another vehicle is parked awkwardly on the outside of a turn and we scrape our car against them.

Our driver is used to driving on the other side of the road, and they aren't used to the model of car.

We the passengers want to split the cost of the accident three-ways just like we're splitting all other costs of the trip three-ways because it could happen to anyone, however the driver is feeling guilty and wants to pay for the whole bill

Extra info:

total costs come to £1100 for accident and a further £220 for holiday house rental which we're no longer using as they're understandably a bit shaken up

Costs are too much for the driver to be able to pay immediately

250,"I have a very close friend who is who has struggled with a variety of mental health issues throughout her life. Earlier this year she has started cutting as a way to relieve her stress. She insists that it’s the only way she can feel any kind of relief from her own mental turmoil. She also insists that she’s does it in a safe way (doesn’t cut too deep, limits herself, etc.) While I can tell that her mental health is better when she self harms, I know that as a friend I can’t support that. And then she gets upset with me when I don’t support her self harming. 

Shes been to therapy many times but refuses to bring up her self harming issues to her therapist for whatever reason. I’ve brought the issue up with her parents but they’ve done little to help.",31Aug2019,3
252,"I was out walking in the middle of the night, as i sometimes do. And I am approaching this spot where a guy commited suicide, at least thats what i heard happened. So I always think about this when i walk past this spot, and i kind of ""jump"" when I see an old man standing there. I take of my headphones, and say that I got startled because some guy died here. And this old man started saying that he knew the guy who died, and was with him the night when he died. 

They had been together, with one or more people as I understood. And he said they split off, and this guy had fell down on some rocks. (the spot is a bridge above a rocky riverbed). So basically he said he had fallen over a rail.

I am kind of surprised, and I dont recall exactly what I said, but said something like I thought it was a tragedy. 

Then he tells me that the guy who died had a backpack with ""curly bills"" which belonged to him in it. So the police had taken him into questioning and then released him later. 

Next thing he starts talking about is lynxes in the woods nearby, entrance to the woods are like 15 meters away. And that he had seen many of them here. He had seen as many as 20 down by the river longer down from there. And that they come down to the river to catch fish this time of year. 

I dont remember everything he said . But at one point he pointed to the tree closest to us and asked if I could see movement up there, I said no. He seemed pretty convinced.

He brings up a flashlight, but I could still see nothing. I have lived there all my life and never seen a lynx, eventhough they are around in my county, far from the city this area i was thinking anyways. He also talked about drugs and was interested in my experience with it. He told me about his relationship with it and he basically told me it ruined his life. 

Could this be a guy returning to the scene of a crime? 

we then talked about animals and stuff, and after a little while i say i have to move on, he offers me drugs (amphetamines), i say no thanks , he says he was just testing me, and I walk away, checking if he is following me, and I go home.

Is this maybe a guy so much in denial and pain of guilt he is hallucinating killer animals in the trees around the area?  And maybe he never talked to the police? and maybe curled bills is crazy talk for he owed money or something. 

I think the guy who died was in his twenties from a neighbouring city.

I am aware I could be reading waaay to much into this, but ... I feel uneasy, should I just forget about this?",31Aug2019,1
253,"  My best friend hasn't responded to me in two months. We used to have a strong bond and kept talking for a while after high school. These past two months however, I have not heard from him except for one occasion.

I have four theories for why:
1. He feels guilty.
 We said we would open a business after school finished. But he was an active tennis player and participated in a lot of championships. The day he became mostly inactive I asked what he wanted to do before we decided we would open a business. He said that he wanted to be a tennis player but not really anymore. I asked what he meant by ""Not really"". I didn't get an answer afterwards.

2. I'm paranoid and he's telling the truth about being busy.

3. He doesn't want to be friends anymore. We've had arguments in the past. He says he doesn't want to play any more videogames (Which we bonded over in the first place).

4. Something happened to him (Improbable).

I don't know how to respond at this point. Whether to say screw it and just stop talking to him. To get in his face to try to get a response.
He reads the texts I send him he just never responds.

254,"I have a project of my own but everyone seems to judge me over the validity of that project... I lie to people often because I don't like to be judged but am really anxious about doing it with family...

That said, I just lied to my well-meaning but old-fashioned uncle about being in college. I am considering how to speak to him about the time off and I know he won't approve. And I rue the day I finally call him...

I hate being a people pleaser. It's not my default setting, I don't do it often, but there are some people I just don't wanna disappoint despite the fact that that may be detrimental to me. And the confrontation with them puts me through literal panic attacks, shaking, sweating and emotional pain. It happens so often that I've learned to live with them... I hate it. Everyone second guesses my decision and though I don't, I want to please them so hard it's unhealthy.

After depression, and suicidal thoughts and pills... I am not completely honest with anyone. My social life, friends and family; in general is wildly unstable... I already had to take some mandatory time off because I lost it and fainted in the middle of the College Campus. Taking this decision has allowed me to get some control in my life, emotionally too. I don't regret it one bit... but it bugs me how much being a disappointment does, though... so much I almost, too late too, changed my mind to please my uncle...

Am aware this is ridiculously unhealthy, psychologically speaking. And yet I tend to force myself into carrying the weight of expectations placed on me even if contradictory as well as the weight of my family and friends and everything that goes wrong in my life. I just carry that, despite it being unhealthy... I carry the role of mediator in family, despite knowing am unfit to do so (too young, psychologically unfit, etc), I try to keep my family from any kind of conflict because I don't deal well with family infighting.

258,"Hi,

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, I’m just in a crippling state of anxiety right now. I have a tattoo appointment in 3 hours and I’ve been freaking out since the day before yesterday.

I already have tattoos so I’m not worried about the pain or anything. This is a coverup of a largish piece that I had done during a time in my life when I was in a very bad relationship and wasn’t happy with myself. I’ve also become self conscious about the tattoo because it’s not as well-executed as it could be. In an ideal world, I’d just have it improved, but because of the size, this artist has recommended a full colour coverup. I was happy with this suggestion two months ago when I booked the appointment but now I am looking at the tattoo I’m not sure I’m ready to lose it altogether. 

I’ve already paid a deposit, and the artist has booked out a day for me. What should I do?? What can I say? 

My current feeling is that I should go, tell her I’m extremely nervous and having second thoughts about losing the original tattoo altogether. I’m also very nervous about colour. But I’m scared that she’ll be angry and annoyed. I know that someone being angry and annoyed is less bad than having a permanent tattoo that I’m not happy with, but I don’t know how common this situation is. Please PLEASE HELP!!!

261,"There is a lot to unload here, but I'll start off by saying that this account is a throw away because this is obviously a very sensitive topic. I might delete this after a while depending on how it unfolds. It is going to be an absurdly long post, but I'd appreciate any advice. I'll leave a TLDR at the bottom, but there is a lot to this question. 

So, a bit of background first. I live at home with my very Catholic parents. They aren't necessarily strict, but there are definitely things that are taboo to them and they aren't very good at handling it. (especially my father who has anger issues, is extremely stubborn, and very Catholic.)   I won't get into too much detail, but most of my many siblings live at home as well including my youngest sister who is 16. Her boyfriend is also 16. The legal age of consent in my state is 16, but you are still considered a minor until you are 18. 

My sister suffers from many psychological conditions including severe depression and an eating disorder. My parents are not good at talking to her about any of it without blaming or shaming her. This has lead to a lot of mistrust between them. Because of this, she has lied a lot to our parents, and I think it is getting a bit out of control. She has lied to my mother about being ""safe"". Which basically means that she was suicidal and told my mom that she was fine when she asked. Basically I think this mistrust is turning into a lying habit. 

I am basically the only person that my younger sister (I'll start calling her Jess) can confide in without feeling judged or attacked. I try to never force her to do anything. Instead I take the time to talk with her until she agrees to do what is best for her. I want her to make the decision that she deserves to be happy, healthy, and safe. Sometimes I spend hours and miss things that are important to me in order for her to just eat a decent meal, or take her meds. I just want the best for her, and I want her to decide that she is worth so much more than her illness tells her. She has trust issues because of our parents obviously, but also one of our sibling will tell on Jess for things she told in confidence. (One such thing was Jess having sex with her boyfriend.) I value the trust she has in me over everything, because in the moment it matters most, I want her to tell me the truth. 

The situation started the other day while I was at work when Jess got tattled on by our other sibling. I came home to find Jess arguing with my parents and insisting that she and her boyfriend were not having sex. (she had not yet told me that she had been. I'd never asked) I don't care that they are having sex, as long as they are being safe. My parents would probably crucify her. Jess asked me to stay for their conversation. At some point our dad wanted to look through her phone. She was digging herself into a hole of lies on why she didn't want them to look at it, and it was getting so absurd that our father was becoming furious and yelling. I calmed everyone down and suggested that I look through her phone instead of our dad. Our parents have extreme trust in me so they allowed it. I got Jess's permission before looking through her phone, and found videos of her and her bf having straight up sex. Here is where my decisions get a bit dicey. I did not want her to continue lying to our parents outright, but I wasn't comfortable with telling them about the videos. I knew that they may actually try to get her bf arrested for filming and possessing child porn. So I deleted the  videos, but left the regular nudes and shit. (even though it would still be considered child pornography, my parents would be more understanding of that than straight up penetration.) 

I made my parents promise not to comment until they had a group session with her therapist, then I let her tell them she had nudes and confirmed what she was saying. Obviously we left out the sex part. Our parents interrogated us about the stuff on her phone and did not hold back a few choice comments, but they did not blow up. 

So now, I am going to meet up with Jess's bf when I am able, and talk to him about the videos and pictures he has. I've only talked to him a few times, and I don't think he's a bad kid. I'm going to make sure he knows the consequences of having that stuff on his phone, and try to get him to delete it in front of me.  

So my issue can be broken down into a few different issues, and advice on any of them would be helpful. 

1. How do I approach her bf to get him to understand the severity of the situation?
2. Is it bad that we lied to our parents about this? They are her guardians and I feel like the truth is going to get out a lot sooner than Jess will be prepared for. I don't want to tarnish the trust they have in me because I have my own rainbow skeleton in the closet.
3. I don't want my sister to continue digging herself into holes of lies, and I want to teach her how to have the truth come out without feeling suicidal. 
4. I want to move away from my family within the next few years because of the toxic environment, but I don't want Jess to be alone. At the same time, I can't take her with me because I am not equipped to raise a teenager with severe psychological issues. It's also very draining and these past few days I can feel myself becoming more distant with my friends. I think I am having a slow-burning mental breakdown.

T.L.D.R: My sister made sex vids with her bf and we deleted it before our parents looked through her phone. I don't want her to become a habitual lair, and I need to approach her bf about deleting the vids he has.

I really appreciate any advice on anything I've said here. I just feel drained and like I'm about to have a breakdown. I know it's so much, but it is all part of a bigger family issue and I want to just run away from it all.",31Aug2019,1

263," I know many of you cant help me if you dont know the story behind our breakup, so I'll give you all a quick breakdown. We started dating sophomore year of HS, immediately connected once we had our first conversation and things took off from there. We hung out after school and went places on the weekends, everything seemed well so I popped the question on her and she said yes before I could even finish my sentence. We ended up being together for nearly 2 years and easy to say, those 2 years were the best years of my life. When I was younger I struggled with drug abuse that started at a very young age, I was a brawler, had a horrible relationship with my family and I was just a total loss, but she made me want to be a better person. I changed alot once we started up, I acted more like an adult and less like a troubled kid. Long story short, I lied to her about something stupid and that ended up costing me our relationship. A few months later someone who I considered to be one of my best friends hooked up with her and it destroyed me. I talked to one of my other friends about it and he ended up relaying alot of personal things back to half the school and ended up mortifying her. She thought I spread rumors about her out of jealousy but I didnt, so i got labeled as a liar. She blocked me on everything a few months later.

 Apparently she still thinks of me now and then because her friend told me she asked about me a few weeks ago, I saw her at her graduation and she locked up when she saw me while walking through a busy crowd and couldn't stop staring at me until her boyfriend literally pulled her away. I wanted to say something to her but I locked up as well, my stomach sank and my brain shut down so all I ended up giving her was a blank stare in return. I'm not sure if she knew it was me as I am almost 110lbs lighter with a full beard now lol. 

I want to pop my head back into her life even if it's for a brief moment to just give a genuine apology, it's been 3 years now and she hasnt heard a word from me even though I've thought about it nearly every day. I hate myself for what I did to her and I havent had the chance to make things right because I have no form of communication with her. I'll be honest, I genuinely love this girl. They say your real first love sticks with you and it sure does.

 So my question to you redditors, is it right for me to step into her life again? According to friends shes still with the same guy from highschool, in college and probably planning to make bigger life plans in the near future. I'm just not sure if it would be right, what if I ruin that.

265,"Hi! What's up?

I've been pondering about this these last few days, and I really haven't come to any conclusion.

For backstory: my gf of a year has been taking some medication that reduced her sexual appetite, resulting in her offering me to open up our relationship a few months ago.

Since, I've only asked one girl out, and she initially said yes but ended up backing out since I already had a partner and it was uncomfortable for her, which i understood. 

Post that, I've realized there are some potential partners whom, if asked out, I'm fairly certain they would say yes. On the one hand, unlike this girl I've asked out, these don't really raise my attention. I don't dislike them, but i wouldn't be really excited to go out with them. On the other, I'd really like to experience my sexuality. I'm quite young, and I haven't had many partners. I was looking forward to go out with new people and get to know myself sexually. 

The question that's been going around my mind... should I ask these people out even I'm not really that invested? It feels really shallow of me, but I'd really like to explore myself",31Aug2019,1

Hello there! I don't want to make an incredibly long story out of this, so I'll just cut it short. So, like the title said, I'm autistic, high functioning autism. It mainly affects my ability to be able to deal with new situations. For example, when going to the gym is completely normal for others, I get incredibly stressed out. I literally almost blanked out a few times in these type of situations. Because I'm incredibly afraid of situations I don't know any details of. And because of that, I now go to a special ed school instead. In this school, these things are alot less worrying, and everything goes at a much more relaxing pace. The thing is, I only have issues with stress, not with my behavior or maturity. And most children are incredibly immature in this school. Like, REALLY, Immature! I've been through alot of burnouts and depression episodes and I'm just starting to run out of ideas on how I would be able to learn. I'm motivated to learn! I'm a good learner!

I've been worrying about my cognitive abilities. My memory, my ability to reason, form opinions and focusing.

It seems I have troubles especially in social situations. Inability to be witty, charming and funny, inability to come up with relevant discussion points or stories which makes me a boring, silent person to be around, offering nothing to the group I'm participating in or creating an arguably even more uncomfortable situation in a one on one scenario. My friend told me that I know nothing. I often distrust myself and my opinions because I might be remembering things wrong. It means virtually no confidence which is required to succeed in any area of life.

I’ve always had soft muscle near my shoulders from wearing a bra and carrying a backpack everyday. It feels weird and uncomfortable when I apply pressure parts around my neck and upper back. However, I’ve been experiencing the same feeling when I press down on my shoulder joints

Anyways, I know the best course of action would be going to the doctor or going to a chiropractor. However, I want to know if I can fix my joint pain without going to the doctor. I know some body pains go away on their own if you just rest for a few days. So my questions is: 

Are there any exercises I can do or any external medicine I can take to help ease my joint pain? ... and Should I be worried about other underlying causes attributed to the pain? Eg arthritis? Or is the pain related to working too much and I should just take a few days off from work?

We haven't been together a long time but we have been friends for nearly 8 years, in which time we've always had a spark but never done anything about. Now, when we do, I find myself unable to think of anything but my EX.

I need help wording this.

279,"This is going to be confusing but might come off as arrogant as well.

I have this thing in my mind that makes my mind sure I will be someone big in this world.  Notice how I don't call it a feeling, this is because I don't acknowledge it as one rather I treat it as a fact that I will become successful. If I had to make an analogy I would say if I was hooked up to a lie detector and someone asked me if I thought I would be very successful in life I would say I know rather than yes, without a trace of doubt. I wouldn't call this dreaming unrealistically either, I refuse to ignore the obstacles or sacrifices and thrive knowing they will make me stronger. Does this mean something? Is there something wrong with me? How do I keep this mindset? 

Most importantly do many people think this way?",31Aug2019,1
281,"It's really.. annoying honestly. As soon as I go anywhere near here she starts talking. Like I can listen to her being downstairs and she won't say a word, but if I make one step downstairs and she hears it.. she instantly talks talking. Sometimes she talks with me, sometimes she talks with herself, sometimes she talks with the dog. But she talks, as soon as somebody is near her.

Same with my room. If I let my door open and she comes upstairs she talks talking non-stop. She doesn't even need to be in my room or near my room, sometimes she is in a complete other room. But if she knows that I can hear her she starts talking with herself or the dog, or she is trying to talk with me, which is really annoying because I barely understand her since she is in another room.

And this can go on for at least 30 minutes. That's usually the point where I say ""I will close my door, ok ? I need to do something for school"" and than she is like ""ok if you don't want to talk with your mother"" meanwhile she's been talking with the dog the whole time.

Any advice ? I don't think she is crazy, but she definitely has some issue.",31Aug2019,1
282,"Note: This is all 100% real and serious.

Hi, so i'm a 19M and i have no high school diploma or GED. Last month my older brother who is 28 charged into my room and shook me and yanked me out of my sleep and got me by my shirt and then accussed me of using his bathroom and leaving some pee marks on the toilet. 

I did not use the bathroom of his, it was likely my little brother that did that to the toilet(13 and stays near the bathroom!) and logically speaking. 

He then slapped me hard and pushed me back constantly then when i kept my truth in that I did not do it(he keeps saying just apologize you devil) 

then when i kept my truth in that i didn't vandalize his bathroom he went up to my computer and knocked open my monitor causing it to shatter.

I then phoned the police(like everyone else would if this happened to them as a wakeup alarm) then they arrived and apparently after speaking to them, I was shocked to hear that harrassment is allowed(the officer mentioned yelling and shouting things being okay especially in point blank range!). 

Then my mom came out and said hes a loser who maybe watches porn so you know hes wrong. wtf does porn have to do with me getting assaulted and harrassed! I'm also 19 so i am technically justified if i wanted to watch it.

Then I brought out my phone and was shocked to hear that if I have evidence of him harrassing/assaulting me from 2+ months ago then they don't accept it at all! What kind of police are they? 

Then after him lying and claiming he loves me and never would do that to his little brother. They said he's going off easy this time without jail or charges but they said if they had proof it happened then they would take him. LOL.

And afterwards, I was looked at as the ""criminal"" and my mom left me in the sun outside as I was shocked at what just happened. Then I went inside and my brother said look you can go upstairs and leave but u can also leave the house if you want okay? So now i'm a fugitive huh mr assaulter? Then afterwards my brother tells my little bro to disown me or else(yea he totally loves me! oh and hes forcing a 13 year old to do what he wants).

He constantly yells hard to my mother ""make me food mom! like a baby"" and has not been employed for 7+ months with a 4 year degree and just milk drinking my poor parents for food and sleep.

Now month later my dad came up and said i'm a fking faggot and a disgrace to the family then he grabbed me and said I should kick you out now! then dragged me like a kid to my older brothers room and said say sorry NOW and only if he accepts it then you can STAY dumb ass shit! then i was allowed to leave the argument and the trauma sticked to me. 

How can someone get so much hate for defending themself? 

Now i have lost 2 ""family members""(older brother and younger one who is forced to hate me). I cut them out.

oddly enough only my mom, dad, and sister show any signs of caring about me and are family.

284,"I've been best friends with a girl for almost my whole life, and it's been really bad for the past months. I've feel used, unappreciated and i hate how she treats our other friends.

Before, I always acted very cartoonish and different around her to entertain them. One day, I had enough of it, so I toned down, acting more myself. After I did that, I started to noticed how hard it was to talk to her. After awhile we didn't talk to eachother.

Weeks pass, we're hanging with a group of friends. She talks about how she hates one girl in our friend group, and how we shouldn't pick her up. She later asks the same girl if she could sleep over at their house because she has nowhere to stay over. That really, really grossed me out and made me think, ""is that how she thinks of me?"" Before that I was asked to substitute for her babysitting job, so that hit me. I was starting to listen to my friends on how they were being treated. I feel so horrible that I was blind to how my other friends were being treated

I need to break this off, I've tried addressing it two times and both times I stopped going further because I felt guilty. If I just dump this info on her, she'll just get angry and she'll start a rant. If I don't give this info, she might do it to another person and I don't want that.

She told her friends and family (none of which talked to him or even knew him) that we moved in together and about how our life is going. Apparently in his blocked messages, he knows every detail still. He lives in a different state and has been harassing her with information constantly. Apparently he has hacked accounts before.

294,"I'm worried sick right now. Don't know what else to do.

Ever since I was 8 years old (now going on 18), my mother has been an alcoholic. There have been countless nights of her becoming violent with my father and arguing—sometimes getting physical with him. It scared me so much. My family and I have begged her for years and years to get help. She kept refusing. ""Brianna, she has to want to help herself before anyone can help her."" is what my father always told me. I've always remembered that and just hoped that one day I could see her recover. On the nights where it got bad, I'd plead that she'd go to a rehab program, therapy, whatever it took.

At 11:30 tonight, my mom had a seizure. I've never felt this much fear in my entire life. She dropped to the floor, her muscles tensed up, she started biting down on her tongue, I felt useless. I felt like it was all over now. My sister had called 911 as soon as it happened and my mom was taken to the ER. My father, sister and I followed behind and stayed for about three hours.

During those three hours, luckily my mom gained consciousness and was able to answer some questions (What year is it, who is the President, ect.) which hopefully means that not too much damage was done. It is now almost 4:00 am and I am at home, as only one other person (my dad) is allowed to be with her right now. Results from a scan of her brain are being processed right now. I don't know what to expect at all. Whatever is going on, I hope it can be reversed or at least be prevented from getting worse.

I still feel so hurt right now. The face she made when she was realizing where she was and as she saw all of us standing around her broke my heart. I feel like I'm going to constantly be worried about what might happen to her at any given moment. What if nobody's there? What if she's driving?

Has anyone ever been in/seen a similar situation? Did things get better? Does anyone know about the correlations between alcoholism and seizures?

297,"Hey all. So basically my contract with employer says I make $100 per year (not my actually salary), which is to be split into equal fortnightly payments (standard employment language). 

They've accidentally been paying me as if I made $110 per year (I guess entered wrong in HR).  I hadn't noticed because I don't look at my paychecks -- they're just direct deposited -- and because there's so much going on with 401k/HSA contribtuions, I just figured my take home was the right take home.  

They just noticed this and for the rest of the year want to pay me at a rate of ~$80/yr so that at the end of the year I'll have been paid $100 total. 

Am I right to say -- sorry that you guys overpaid me but that's a clerical error you made and I don't feel responsible for ""paying it back"" to you. Go ahead and adjust me back to a rate of $100/yr, but I don't feel like I should pay you back money you overpaid me, so I'm not okay to have my paycheck being dropped to the $80/yr rate.

I had given her the ring back while she was on a guest service call and told her I would be back to get it from her because I had to lift some boxes into the stock room. so I tried to grab her hand and put the ring pop into it but she said that she’ll keep mine if I keep hers. so I told her when she gets off (9:45 PM) she should come find me and I’ll give her ring back and then she’ll give mine back. with this is mind I had thought that this was the perfect opportunity to ask for her number. when I went on my 15 minute break she was on her lunch and it was only the two of us in the break room. since I didn’t really know too much about her I asked her a lot of basic questions (what college are you planning on going to, hows your second week of school, how’s homework been)and then we got to the point where we had just been talking about life and I felt i really connected with her and how I could just talk to her without really trying to be someone else or trying to impress her. as the time for her to leave for sooner and sooner my anxiety started to kick in and I didn’t know how to exactly ask for her number. when it was 9:45 she came and gave me a bag of chips and we had both given each other’s “rings” back and then we had talked for 5-10 seconds and then she left to clock out. I was really terrified and I froze up when I wanted to ask for her number. I followed her into the team room and put the ring pop in my bag. when she left I asked when she was working and I was hoping to ask for her number because originally I hadn’t been scheduled on that day to work but they had asked me later if I could work that day so I said yes. as she was leaving I froze up.

306,"Well over a month ago, water came through my bathroom ceiling from the upstairs neighbor right before we went on vacation and was supposedly fixed while we were gone. But that was false because it happened again but worse. The plumber took a ceiling tile out of our ceiling and the maintenance person was supposed to replace it but didn’t because the leak wasn’t fixed. That makes sense but it’s been like 2 weeks. We have several water stained tiles in several rooms from heavy rain and then the upstairs neighbor’s shower leaking. We’ve been missing our ceiling tile above the shower for over a month now. My fiancé is getting fed up because there’s no reason why we’re waiting weeks for something as simple as one ceiling tile (they aren’t saying anything about the ones in the other rooms either even though they’re horrible to look at). But we can’t threaten to move out because we have nowhere else we can go right now. 

How do we approach the situation?

So, I had an Internship at my University. This is now over. Throughout the Internship I had a terrible communication with the other members.

Three of the members are dominating, talk incessantly, over me and always nominate themselves for the task. 

I think two of these people do not like me. Why? They talk over me, change the conversation when I am talking and never actually talk to me. At best they are indifferent to me. 

Also, at the end of the Internship my manager says to me that I need to improve my communication because they said that I don’t talk to them enough. BUT in reality, they barely ever acknowledge me when I am in the group and they themselves don’t talk to me. As in they don’t reach out to me at all.

So, we have an event at the end of this next week (that I have to travel to). The group chat is up and running. We’re back to the same nonsense where the two gals ignore me, talk over me and change the conversation.

312,"I’m a 16 year old in Los Angeles. I recently began to take an introspective look at myself because I noticed a lot of things about myself I wanted to change. I have issues with believing myself to be right and confidence, which I believe stem from my older brother constantly shooting me down and berating me for everything when I was younger. These realizations also lead to me ending a 5 year friendship after realizing this friend had been mistreating me and being super toxic for the past few years. Overall, I’ve just been working on my self image and confidence. With that short background out of the way, here’s the main reason I’m here.

A few months ago(last winter), I began to realize all of my friends around me were getting more and more romantically and sexually active. Important to note is I’ve never been in a relationship. Fine by me, except this started eating away at me. Not like an incel hatred towards women for not approaching me, but rather a “what am I doing wrong” feeling. I have a few female friends and I’ve asked some of them about what they think of me as a partner(all of those I asked are already in a relationship or asexual/aromantic, so this wasn’t a really weird question with the kind of environment established here), and I’ve asked a few times, asking for genuine honesty. I always receive something along the lines of “You’re a great guy, you just haven’t found someone who’s noticed it yet.” Charming at first, but again, this feeling of questioning the validity of that statement always creeps back in. 

Recently, I’ve been overcome with a crippling loneliness and I usually cope with it by just crying or squeezing a pillow really hard. Last week, I was with two friends and they both brought their girlfriends and although they’re awesome people, it cut deep and I hated that I felt that way. Even typing this right now, I still feel some of it. I guess the real advice question here is: Am I right for feeling this way? Am I just impatient?

TL;DR - I’m sad and I don’t want to be but all my friends are having fun with their gfs and it hurts. What do?",31Aug2019,2
313,"Mom here, married with a kid. I am the the one that pulls the financial weight in the family. I am not complaining, my husband works full time and contributes 100% financially, physically and emotionally. We are behind in our bills and I am surviving living paycheck to paycheck trying to pay everything off and just making enough to keep us a float. .. I know practically every american is in the same boat.

But how do you sleep? I find myself waking up after 4 hours of sleep and then i cant go back to sleep until I've racked my brain for 2 hours. I find myself waking up stressed because I know a bill is due tomorrow or the demands of my very busy job or the legit calander gives me anxiety. My husband sleeps so soundly and I find myself writing to you on reddit at 5am. I cant stop the bills from coming or my job from not being demanding and I cant stop having to be a mom and having to give myself to my family. It's a literal vicious cycle sometimes, but i keep all that panic inside and have a facade that everything is going to be okay.  Deep down I know that everything will be okay and i will be fine... someday. But for right now I need sleep. Without sleep I'm even moreeeee stressed. I cant think straight during the day sometimes because I'm so tired. Melatonin doesn't work.. knocks me out.. doesn't keep me asleep long. I dont wanna be a zombie and hopped up on meds.

314,"So here’s a backstory - I worked for this company for 3 years and during the end of my time I was signed off with depression as I broke up with my abusive ex and had the worst breakdown ever in which case resulted me moving from home to this apartment I couldn’t afford to rent in the city centre, abusing alcohol and weed and being overly promiscuous. I had then at that point told my work I wouldn’t be returning as I was earning money from making content and nudes and thought this is what I wanted to do because I was literally going through the biggest breakdown ever. 

Fast forward to today, I got evicted from that place on the 7th of August. I’m now back at home and unemployed doing odd jobs here and there and searching for full time work. I come home from a festival I worked last night to a second notice later stating since I failed to make the payment of £378.37 I have 7 days to make arrangements for repaying this by sending it to them via cheque or bank account. Also states that failure to make payment will result in them taking me to court for this. 

They aren’t even open over the weekend so I cannot contact them about it today. I am so so so anxious about this. Do you think they’ll be able to set up a payment plan with me if I tell them about my situation on Monday?

315,"What to do when you’re indecisive? Take to reddit!! Okay so basically I met a guy on Omegle and from the moment we were talking he was super into me. Stayed up all night until he had to go to school, and his compliments went from “you’re cute” to “I wanna fuck you, hard”. If I said everything he told me this would be a book, but you get what I mean. Super nice kid, so I gave him my snap and we kept talking after. Next day, I saw I was blocked which really threw me off. I knew something was weird about the whole situation but I wasn’t tripping over it since we live a thousand miles away. I mean sheesh I thought at least we might check in with each other and keep in touch, nothing serious.

316,"So my mother has multiple undiagnosed mental issues, resulting in an abusive childhood for me and my sister and a miserable life for my father. 

My father is enabling her. He used to be more protective of us, at least that's how I remember but in the last few years he always takes our mother side. He is almost as bad as her now.

I used to go to the school psychologist in secret and she convinced me about contacting my parents to talk to them. It didn't go well. They denied everything and said I was making it all up. They told me I have hallucinations and that I somehow make myself believe that they are true. The psychologist suggested family therapy but they refused. 

I already made up my mind about my parents and so did my sister. I don't intend to keep in touch with them after I can finally move out and my sister (who is older than me) already started to cut them out of her life. 

However, I still feel sorry for my father, even though I grew to hate him almost as much as my mother. I want him to see how toxic she is but he always says that she won't change and that we have to accept that. I don't even dare to breach the topic to my mother because I know that won't end well for me. 

I also just want an apology. They never once said they were sorry for the horrible things they did to me or my sister, they always make it out to be our faults.

I've been dating this guy for 3 months. We both came out of a long relationship and we are not ready to jump into another one, but it's somehow happening. 

My previous relationship (almost 2 years) made me go crazy because he never wanted to commit, after a year and a half, and after he introduced me to his family he told me we were not together and it was a casual thing. 

He had a way longer relationship (6 years) and said he can't get into a relationship now, but he behaves like he's my boyfriend all the time - exactly like my ex. 

Am I the asshole here???  Pls read the conversation below. 

Him - How's your night going?

Me - lol, I'm back to the office. I'll get my motorbike now

Him - You just told me you're drunk

Me -  Nah that was long ago
4 hours ago
😂

Him - Yeah 4 more hours of drinking!
Me -No I stopped at 8pm
 It's midnight now
  Hey why are we having this conversation
   You're not my dad
Him - Lol don't tell me not to care about you
 It's too late for that
Me - I do not want to justify myself.
Him - So you don't care about me? 😏
Me - ??
I don't get it
 I'm able to evaluate if I'm drunk or not
  And if and when I decide to drive is my own responsibility
   I don't want to share it, I told you before.. I'm independent and I don't want to be explaining myself
    Sorry :(
Him -  Cool, I'll stop caring then 👍
Me - 🤔🙄
 Sorry chicken wing I might overreact
  But I felt that you were more assuming I'm behaving like an idiot than caring
   Got home safe btw
Then he doesn't reply for 30 minutes but visualises the msg 

Me - Okk, Night night x
 Have a good night out 
 Him -  It's cool. Just a reminder that we're not ready for anything too serious
  It's a good thing you're holding on to your independence, Going out now, Sweet dreams xxx
Me - what do you mean???

Him- Well it's true isn't it?

Me -  I don't get what you're saying but it doesn't feel very nice
Him - Well I don't understand your reaction. We have lots to learn about each other still I guess
 It's not a big deal

Basically, I was with my friends and we all got drunk, except for one guy. When I’m drunk, I tend to be a talker, and my friends know this. I remember talking about some underwear I owned, because it was cute or some shit. Well, the sober guy kept bugging me for a description. And me being drunk I couldn’t refuse. Apparently I went into full detail many, MANY times because he asked for full detail, many MANY times. After the night was over and I slept off the alcohol, I woke up and sorta remembered what happened. Even from the small flashbacks I felt completely violated. I had to ask my friends for the rest of the story, and I felt disgusting. I haven’t spoken to this guy since, because I dropped all contact. I guess my question is did he violate or take advantage of me? I’ve never had any experience with this kind of scenario so this is completely new territory.",31Aug2019,1
324,"I’m not sure if I should post this in r/relationshipadvice or here but I might as well just go for it.

To start off I just need to confide in something right now otherwise I’m gonna go crazy, the past 48hours have just been the most terrifying sickening time that I’ve experienced recently and I’m still not 100 right up there.
So a little backstory as I know it since most of it is a blur so yeah. 

It was this Thursday that’s just gone and it seemed like a normal day I did some house chores etc just getting ready to see her tomorrow and yeah that’s pretty much it. Then I think we were just texting about the dinner that she was currently on about our pets and just really doing everything we always do. 
At this point I don’t really know what happened I just remember dull ache and confusion and I’m just gone in my head. Somehow she ended up getting a taxi to me (which is quite pricey as we live quite away) and just saying all this shit and I couldn’t make it out whatsoever but what I do know is that she blamed me for everything. And then the f bomb hit I was sat on the floor as I remember she was on the sofa and everything just went numb. She lied to me about going to a cinema with her grandmother and went for a drink with a man from her work. She was apparently drunk on arrival and somehow they’ve ended up in a hotel he’s staying at and he brought himself onto her and it happened. I just feel so disgusting I can’t look at myself right now I’ve been sick about a thousand times I’m fucked in my head and there’s just nothing.

It’s just I don’t know I’ve forgiven her but it’s sinking in and it’s fucking with me.
What I think makes me feel this way is that I was raped around 3 years ago. Since then I haven’t been able to trust anyone sexually, my sex drive has been really small since too and she never did mind it she always seemed happy with everything but apparently she wasn’t and I am the fault. I really don’t know what to do i am a right mess right now this post is probably even messier I just don’t know what do to.",31Aug2019,1

3 years ago I broke up with someone I thought was the love of my life. We dated for 4.5 years (from age 17-22). Things got complicated and about 6 months after our break up she realized she was lesbian. 4 years ago I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, missed a bunch of school and life experience because of it. After my treatment and after I split up with my ex, I went to Alaska for a year for school and tried to start a new life. It gave me a lot of new experiences, but my ghosts kept gnawing on my shoulders and I went back home after a year because I landed myself in academic probation and money problems. I have been home for a year and a half since,

Since then, I have been making my money online working from home working a remote position. I've made very few friends since that time (I really miss my friends from Alaska) and feel alienated. I just hung out with my ex again since I came home and it was honestly a great experience, she is the most genuine person I know and the only person I feel connected with. I met her gf too, who I really think is super cool and seems to treat her nicely. Im happy for her.

327,"So I (F25) recently reconnected with one of my really good high school friends (S, F25) about a month ago. We’re chit chatting and shooting the shit and then S asks if I want to join a DnD campaign one her other friends (L, F23) is DMing. I love DnD and I love getting to spend more time with S so I tell her “Of course!”. 
For background, I finished my masters degree last May and had to move from the city back to my home state, which is sort of suburban/rural and it’s been really isolating. I’ve just been job hunting and being sad at my parents house this whole summer so I’m chomping at the bit for a chance to interact with new people. But, everyone in the party ( Me, S, L, &amp; this other guy C) live in different states/countries, so we play with discord and roll20.
Now DnD starts and everything is going fine, the group is really nice and the dynamic is really fun. Pretty early on the character I play ends up getting into a romantic relationship with an NPC, as that plays out I get more and more nervous whenever we play. Finally, about a week ago, my character like really really confesses her love for NPC. As I was saying it my whole face was red and I could feel my ears burning, I’ve never been more embarrassed. I don’t really blush but it was full on during this session and I realized: “Oh no, do I have a crush on L?” And the answer is: Yes, probably. 
I’m really not sure what to do about it because we aren’t that close and feel like sleazy about wanting to talk to her more now that I like her. I asked S about her and she was supportive of my crush but suggested that I get close with another of L’s friends to find out more about her/get closer but that makes me feel even sleazier. I probably will end up friends with that person but I don’t want it to be just because I like L, if someone did that to me I’d feel awful. L and I also live very far away from each other and she’s in school so I always feel like I’m being a bother if I message her (about DnD or otherwise). I’ve also been out of the dating game for a *very* long time (I put all my energy and time into school and work).

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there.

Let me just cut right to the chase. I’m a 16 year old Danish boy, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve wished I was a girl.

Ever since I was little, I’ve felt uneasy with my body somehow. Being who I was just didn’t feel right. I’ve always been a very shy boy, never really had any of those ‘boyish’ traits. I just stuck to myself, my music, my books and my video games. When I was younger, I didn’t really know what to make of the feelings I had. Whenever I felt sad or angry with who I was, I shoved those feelings into myself to leave a blank facade. I never allowed myself to act on them. I’ve spent the last couple of years confused as to why I’m sad all the time. Every night I stayed up, just lying in bed and thinking about what was wrong with me. I figured it was just the fact that I was a teen, and I was supposed to have these feelings. That it’s normal to lie awake every night and wonder what it would be like to be someone completely different. During the day, I envied the person I envisioned at night. Lately I’ve come to realise that this might be more than just the teenage years talking. I’ve been really confused as to what I should do. 

Lately, the pressure from my mind has been becoming increasingly large. This thought of wanting to become a different person used to be something I was able to just forget about whenever I needed to. But now I think about it, *wish it*, every day and night. 

But this is all so terribly inconvenient. I’ve never really showed any signs of this to my parents. I know they both love me and wish the best for me, but throughout my life I haven’t exactly been honest with them about how I was feeling. Whenever they ask me how I feel, I automatically just respond that I feel good or fine or whatever. My dad is only home 2 days a week, as he works in a different city, so naturally I feel closer to my mom. But really, I have no clue how I should talk to them about this. What I should say, when I should say it yadda yadda. Besides, I’m not even sure *if* I want to talk to them about it. What if this is just my teenage mind playing dirty tricks on me, making me feel miserable about who I am? What if this all goes over in a few years time? How do I know for sure?

Another obstacle I have to get over is my education. I still have 2 years left, and I really don’t want to have to start over, but I can’t see myself undergoing treatment next to one of the most time consuming educations you can get in Denmark. 

Lastly, even if I decide to take the step into changing my gender, how do I even do it? Where do I start? What do I do? I haven’t been very active in my local LGBT community, and I don’t have any friends who have tried something similar. 

Honestly, I have no idea where I was going with this post. I suppose it was just a desperate cry for help from a desperate teenager. Thank you so much for reading, and I apologise for any incoherency or spelling mistakes I’ve made. If you have any questions, please please ask them and I’ll do my best to answer quickly.

About ten years ago, when I was 13, I had a nasty run in with depression. It got to the point where I was self harming and considering suicide. However, I got help and things got better. My parents never really took this seriously, as I was a teenager at the time. They thought it was hormones and that I needed to eat/sleep/exercise better. Mental health awareness is still lacking where I'm from, so they didn't think it was depression. They still don't really see mental health as a real, life impacting problem.

Anyway, now, ten years later, I've started receiving treatment for extreme anxiety. I also live in a different country than before. I feel like I want to tell them what's going on, but worried they'll just say ""move home and you'll be better"" or not take me seriously. I don't want to move, and I am set on receiving professional help. My problems are very real, and I'm dead set on fixing it.

Any advice on how to tell them? Should add when they found out about the depression it was from the school counsellor who noticed the self harm. So I didn't tell them then.

Since I myself suffer from mental health issues (Asperger, depression, anxienty with pretty frequent panic attacks), it was easy for me to spot it in seconds and I suggested them to do what helped me when I was at my lowest - seek the help of a professional instead of struggling alone. They don't want to and there is, in their words, no way in hell they could ever do that. And I do understand they fear the social stigma, but damn, this is a goddamn illness, not a bad mood one can heal with positive thinking, and I don't want my friend to suffer like they do now. I am always there for that person because I know the pain of needing help and everybody telling you they are annoyed, so I have sworn I will never let another person feel like this.

I just went to the ER for a possible heart attack on August 3rd. I was there overnight because I had a bunch of key symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, inconsistent heart beat, and lightly tinted blue nails ect). I had alot of blood drown and tests done during the night. I told them yes I did do Google searches and I have anxiety (my vitamin levels were so low). So everything went fine mostly but they were ultimately unsure about what caused these symptoms besides a potential infection around the area near my heart. I took my five new medications and have been and starting feeling slightly better, but now like 3 week's later I'm feeling worse than I did the first time. I almost threw up and have been feeling weak and nauseous and lightheaded. My problem is that I think this is serious and not just anxiety and want to get checked out before my September 16th appointment. I'm on my parents insurance and am broke. I don't want to be a inconvenience because I kinda threw it on my mom last time and felt terrible because she was with me for the entire night until the morning in my room in the hospital.

Moving back in with my mom wasnt an option and I dont have any other family I could ask to move in.  So instead I asked my bfs mom if i could move in  and she said yes.

355,"TLDR: Im tired of being in Illinois. Looking to travel the US. Any ideas or game plans to do it?


Im 20. My life has seem to go downhill since an Ex girlfriend cheated on me. My relationship with my family is weakening. My mother has essentially kicked me out of the house (""Im not kicking you out, but I need the housekey."") Ive been out of the house alot, meeting new people, and not being home enough to take care of responsibilities, or contributing to bills for the house. I watched and cared for my little brother for 2 years, but it seems as if redeeming that no longer holds weight. 

I work at a dead end job, not making enough to even cover bills that are relevant (Car, Insurance, Credit Cards, Daily Expenses, etc.), but Ive finally got a few lined up, and plan on getting two jobs. The idea is to dig myself out of the debt I have, sell off items I dont use anymore (Old Compound Bow for Archery, Magic Cards I dont even use anymore, Xbox One including games, and anything else that holds any real value that wouldnt be necessarily worth keeping), pay off the car, and save enough money to do this. I have a 1 year time frame. At the end of the year time frame, I'll properly quit by 2 weeks notice, pack up the car, paid off, and just head out into the US and travel. 

One job will start me off at $11/hour, and the other $15-16/hour. 40+ hours on each job, just working towards just leaving. 

I currently have a car note of $340 a month ($11,500 in total left over), $206 in insurance, and roughly $300 in credit cards each month (Minimum payment, I owe a combined total of roughly $3500). Gas right now floats around $50 a week, due to just going out and about. 

Im tired of being tied down. No one has ever batted an eye before all of this happened, and now its more prominent than ever. 

What should I do? How should I go about this? What's the best plan of attack?

357,"TLDR; my uni house mate wants to swap rooms with me because his it to space for him and his girlfriend but she’s not not paying rent or contributing. 

I’m just going into my second year at university and I’m moving in with my first year flat m8, let’s call him Garry and his friend Jim from his uni course. 
Garry has a girlfriend that he got half way through 1st year called Lucy which cause him to stop hanging out with me and Jim (which is fine, we always tried to include him tho) so between Garry’s girlfriend and his job we never saw him. 
Garry would never take the bin out or do his washing up and his excuse was that he was never hear so he can’t be making the mess. So I did his housework, Lucy would do it too like once a month. 

So me, Jim and Garry decide to move in together cuz we all get on, we go to see the house and Garry calls dips on the down stairs room by the front door because he works lates and would be getting back at about 1am. Then Jim calls the biggest room in the house as he went up first so I had the upstairs small room and the side room. Me and Jim then swapped as I offered to do all this washing up and iron his cloths and said he could use my ipad for uni. 

So Garry has moved in today and said that he wants my room because his girlfriend is now going to be living with us so there’s not enough space in his down stairs room. She’s not paying rent and the landlord doesn’t know she’s here. 
I said no we can’t swap rooms because I don’t want to hear them banging all night ever right (she’s really loud) and he’s never going to be there anyways between uni and working night shifts. Plus I don’t see why I should have to swap for the sack of someone who shouldn’t even be there in the first place.

358,"The title essentially sums it up. I was unfortunately diagnosed with depression-caused insomnia while back. I started on sleep meds that work fine, except for the problem that I don't always get them. My mom locked up all medications (for safety I suppose but it is a problem), and while she is diligent in giving me my morning meds, she often forgets my sleeping ones. With that in mind, I physically can't sleep at night without the medication. That means I have to pull a forced all nighter about once or twice a week on average. We had a similar problem when I wasn't able to access my anxiety medication when needed. I get that I am at partial fault for that, because after prayer (we have family prayers every night) I usually head off to my room to settle down / finish homework / etc. I even have asked my doctor multiple times to let me be able to have some control over my own medication, but they always refuse because of the safety aspect. But honestly at this point I just want to sleep. And I need my sleep especially with school starting up. But what am I supposed to do?

363,"I am in a relationship that was not always the best. My partner had been very depressed, was not working, did not have a car for majority of our relationship and I felt emotionally cheated on me (his girl best friend who he hooked up with in the past- although they are no longer friends). Sometimes I still suspect he physically cheated with other women as well. I broke up with him for a few months and dated someone quite different from him. It was going so great, I even went and got my ring finger sized because the new partner wanted to start having a jeweler create a wedding ring for me. But I could not stop thinking about my ex. Eventually I reached out to him and we ended up getting back together. Things have been much better, as he got a good job as well as a car, and seems to be more attentive to myself, but it's only been a few months. I can't seem to chill out and trust that he will be a good partner long term. I care for him deeply but I just seem to always have very paranoid and obsessive thoughts about him that are negative. I check through his phone without him knowing anytime I get the chance. I never find anything particularly bad, but I have seen him text with his friends where he canceled plans with me to hang out with them instead. Which he did not disclose. This has only happened a couple times but I feel upset about it. He lives a block away from this little pub that he frequents both alone as well as with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Which I also get anxious about. I have a 7 year old and feel like no matter what she's not happy. I haven't always been a great mom, and her saying she hates her life and that everyday is the worst makes me feel so discouraged. I am not very social and the only socialization my daughter gets aside from school or daycare is with her cousins who aren't very nice. We rent the basement apparent of my mom's house while my older sister lives upstairs with my mother and her 3 kids for free. I went to school for social service work and have been working at a nonprofit information centre for over a year. The office is not always very healthy environment. I feel burnt out and really don't like my job, but it's great hours for a single parent and I make $1100 every two weeks. I am financially not doing so great and have zero savings. But I don't know where else to go that would pay at least as much as my current job or be the Mon to fri 930-430 hours that allow me to have evenings and weekends with my girl. I am jealous as my older sister hasnt been working all summer and got to spend all the time in the world with her kids, while myself and my daughter's summer has been exhausting with work and her daycamps which she does not seem to like. I lost over a hundred and twenty pounds a couple years ago and still have lose skin around my stomach which I feel really insecure about. I was down to 138 lbs but while being broken up gained 22 more lbs and have been struggling to lose it ever since. The only thing that seems to help me is smoking weed. I have not been avle to go to bed for years unless I get high first. But I often find in the morning before work or right after I am getting stoned and I know that its been effecting my ability to maintain a squeaky clean house or exercise as much. I just feel really negative about myself and exhausted all the time. I find that I'm more motivated to clean my house and shave/do my nails if my boyfriend is visiting. But when he's not here I am a mess and just don't seem to care. I try to do positive affirmations in the morning and this last week have been exercising more. I just always feel exhausted in life and often think about just not showing up to work or disappearing altogether, although I know that's not going to happen. I constantly worry about the future, finances, my daughter, my relationship and about my self sabotaging behaviours. I feel I am ungrateful and should focus on the positives of my life.

370,"Lengthy post sorry in advance. 

I’m a 30 year old female dating a 35 year old male who has a son of his own. We will have been dating for three years in October. We met while working together, I will be honest and say I have very low self esteem and little to no confidence. I worry a lot. We have the greatest times together. 5 months into our relationship I told him I loved him, his response “are you sure?”. My heart shattered. We were great together. We laughed, we enjoyed the same things, we could lay around and do nothing and it was the most amazing time ever. What did he mean “are you sure?” Of course I was. He was everything I wanted in a man, he held me, he kissed me, he sent me sweet texts. We had an amazing sex life. It all seemed perfect. Taken back by the doubt, I gave it a couple weeks and told him I loved him again, his response “I know”. Heart=shattered. Why does this man not love me? I had realized I had only given it 5-6 months so far, I tried to not worry about it. But the longer I went without hearing it the more hurt and angry I became. Why?? Why does this man not love me. I cause fights, I texted him and called him non stop like a psycho when we’d fight. I know it was absolutely uncalled for and I should have never let him see that side of me. I was so angry we were fighting all because I wanted to be loved. What an awful reason to be mad at someone for. How could you be mad at someone for that? How? We continued our relationship, I’d think I was doing ok and then i would grow impatient. The more impatient I was the angrier I became. Why doesn’t he love me? I try so hard for him, day in and day out my day is revolves around what I can’t do to help him or make him happy. 90% of my belonging are at his place. The first year and a half we dated he had a roommate, his roommate had finally moved out! He told me I would finally get a key and that the only
Reason i didn’t already have one  was because of his roommate. Month had gone by, and he still hadn’t given me the key. Can you guess? .... yep.. another fight. 
I by no mean at looking for a pat on the back. This man has asked me for nothing, but i consty give  to him and his son. Whatever they want, they get. Vacations, baseball games, etc. and all I ask for in return is to be loved. 
We broke up last year in November. He told me I needed to get help. I did just that. I laid in bed sick to my stomach for weeks. Crying and not eating. I saw a counselor. I was put on an anti depressant. A few weeks went by and I felt good, more confident. We decided to work on things. I asked him if he was seeing anyone else, has feelings for anyone else, anything I needed to know. I was told no. We worked on things, we Christmas shopped, bought each other gifts, everything seemed great. 
I felt like I had been lied to. I went looking. The wrong thing to do and I admit that. I found condoms missing. I broke down and freaked out. I confronted him about it, rightfully so he was upset I went snooping, but made up a story that he used them to jerk off into. With that I felt he thought I had stupid written across my forehead. How could he? He said we were working on things, that there was no one else. I was heart broken. We moved past it. 
He left for a business trip and as he left I told him to be careful and that I love him. He in return said “I love you too”. I couldn’t have been happier. More than two years later and he finally said it! I couldn’t stop smiling. Couple of weeks went by and he hadn’t said it again. I brought it up asking why he hasn’t said it again, his response “don’t you think I got caught up in the conversation? Don’t you think maybe it slipped? Don’t you think if I loved you I’d say it everyday?” I had no idea what to do. I had never felt heart break like that before. 
Not long after that,  I slipped again. I went through his phone. I found the text messages in his phone. He has gone right back to his ex and some girl he worked with while we were working on things. One text from his ex read “ you told me you loved me last night” The tears. The hurt. More than two years with me and no true I love you, but you go back to your ex and within a couple weeks you tell her you love her? What? Why? What was so bad about me? What was I doing wrong? I immediately told him what I had done and how wrong it was for me to go through his phone. I had no problem admitting that. He told me what he did while we were working on things is none of my business because we weren’t together. Still telling me that the condoms weren’t used with anyone else. The chick from works texts “I can’t stop thinking about making out with you”...... the hurt. The pain. Why didn’t he love me? Why was he talking to other girls when we were supposed to be working on things? Why did he lie to my face? I was not ok, but I loved him and his done more than anything. We continued our relationship. 
I still “complaining” as he calls it, to be loved and to move in together. We broke up again in April, I was not allowed to come to his house, I had left my antidepressant there and was abruptly taken off of it. I went nuts, I said a lot of things for attention. It was rough. It we made it through. 
Since April, we’ve have still fought over me not being loved or us living together. I don’t think I’m asking for much after 3 years. I cook I clean I do laundry all of my stuff is at his house, yet he still needs me to go home to my parents house 2 nights a week so he has time to himself. I still have no key, do not live there, and still no I love you. 
He says he cares about me and enjoys being with me. That’s why he’s still with me. 
I’ve been asking him for three years to go on a trip with me alone, just the two of us, there’s always a excuse not to. I’ve been asking him for a couple weeks now what he wants for his upcoming birthday and he says nothing. Last Monday he told me he was going on a 4 day trip paid for by his parents and his sister for his birthday. I was not ok. Three years I had asked for a trip with him and always no, this trip will be the third trip he takes in 3 months without me. Wouldn’t you want to make those memories with your girlfriend of three years and not your sister? He says he was sorry for hurting me, I was still upset and not having it. 3 days I fought with him on it. Excessive, yes, I know. But I never felt he truly cared about my feelings. Had he, he wouldn’t have put him in the position to be sorry for hurting me. The thought of a trip with his sister would have never been entertained has he though about me asking for to go somewhere for three years. 
I was wrong. He kicked me out again. He can’t handle my bull crap anymore. He says he doesn’t love me and we don’t live together yet because I won’t stop “complaining” about it, I won’t stop fighting with him over it. 

I’m far from perfect, but I do a lot of good in our relationship. The only thing he looks at is the bad. How dare him hold what I want against me like that. I deserve so much more than that. I deserve to be loved. Why doesn’t he? Why am I letting this man have so much of me when I have so little of him? 

I’m so lost. So confused. Help.",31Aug2019,2

376,"Thanks in advance if you take the time to read this. I just feel guilty and just overall am a bit lost. I would appreciate “moral” guidance.

History:
When I was 15 I changed to a new school where I integrated with a group of 5 girls. Back then we used to hang out on the weekends often, go out clubbing and that kind of stuff.
Now we are all in university everyone links up during summer. 

—————

The problem is I’ve not spent so much time with them anymore during summer, which is the time of the year when we all can meet. Problem being I don’t go clubbing anymore because I don’t like it, and to be fair sometimes i rather stay home and do something else ( I live quite far away from town and I have a lot of hobbies that I do at home ).

I was going to meet up with two friends and they suggested going somewhere that’s pretty far for me. When I asked to relocate somewhere nearer a friend A called me out on not doing anything ever, and that I “for once” could “move a little”. Anyway this snowballed and we both got angry at each other.

377,"Please no ""See a therapist"" comments, I've been working about these with a therapist for a while but now due to circumstances in real life I'm not able to see one until the upcoming September/October. I'd also love a different perspectives people can give here.

**[Long and ranty warning, the general context ]**


Due to medical malpractice/misdiagnosis issues (it was also intentionally caused by my mom, who tried to shop for doctors to put labels on me. My first psychiatrist said i just needed affection) as a child. At 6 years old, I was misdiagnosed with Asperger's, ADHD and bipolar disorders. All of which I've later got retested in my life and turned out that **I do not have these conditions** I removed from school and haven't had a normal education until 17. And even after I entered school again that I was too socially stunted for not having opportunities to interact with kids or loving adult.


I was wrongly put on multiple antipsychotics growing up. Social isolation, not being allowed to leave house, form relationships, being physically abused by my dad etc. When I finally move out I have a chance to get myself retested out of my long doubt that I felt like I do not fit into diagnostic criteria of these conditions nor the 'treatments' helped. I don't really have these issues except that I have Reactive Attachment Disorder and PTSD from these wrong diagnosis and treatment and how I was raised itself. (The psychiatrist that my mom refused ended up right)

Now I'm 23 and in college, my grades are going fine and i am doing well enough socially and i hope for a better future that I can start again. At the front I look ok and normal. But deeply I'm frustrated when people are talking about their families and childhood friends, high school films made me sad and I hate how socially inept and emotionally unwell I used to be. I hate the ""old me"", the person I wasn't really am. I was expected to act weird and ""developmentally disabled"" by my parents and I mostly just dissociated my whole childhood... It was shameful.

For me, my memories anything before I was 18-19 when I moved out was very scattered and I'd rather not see any photos of me before I time. To me ""I"" didn't exist, it was just a shell made for lies. It used to be worse but I've healed enough to talk about it. Although anything that reminded me that there was life before the time I ""actualized"" myself was just awful emotionally to me

**Here's the real part**

Most of the thing about me now is that, I hope some day I'll be ok with my past. I wish I had something good about my past to talk about when my friends talk about it and not feeling empty and hurt that essential childhood life was taken away from me.

I'm upset that I didn't have a life in teenage times, group of friends in high school, going out, dating and parties **at the appropriate time**... The time is important to me for some reason, now I'm in college, I go to parties, but I always come back home thinking how vacuous it is. Fun, cool things become empty and i hate feeling this way. I hate that it's not enough to compensate my life.


And I want to know if there's any kind of ""silver lining"" to grow up through experiences like that? I want to feel good about myself and not something broken and inadequate. especially how my past was extremely rare thing to happen.. i don't know if there's any advantage to that?

How detrimental is it to not lived typical childhood and teenage life?.. even if life seems good now.. I feel to broken",31Aug2019,1

381,i know it is not worth loving someone who fools you but i still do which is really my problem. i’m aware his fooling me but i still love him. why am i like this? please give some advices. i feel so alone. i can’t afford a psychologist,31Aug2019,1
382,"Right so this is my first time posting on here, so I’m not completely sure about how it all works yet. But nonetheless I thought I’d share this somewhat strange situation. I’d also like to get some opinions on this - to find out if I am justified in feeling kinda creeped out or whether this was harmless and I am overthinking it.
Okay, so let’s start at the beginning:
3 years ago on Facebook I got a friend request. I clicked on the profile and it was some kid around the same age as me, maybe a couple years older, from Africa. I’d never add strangers back but I saw that this person was mutual friends with someone I know irl, so I added them back. I can’t remember any conversations I had with him, all I know is that we ended up following each other on Instagram, and that I had gotten him to download musical.ly (because I loved that app at the time).

So anyway, at some point I realised I didn’t want to talk to this person anymore, I’m not sure if this is because of where he was from - I know that a lot of people from there could be scammers, as my mum was scammed by one a few years ago. Or maybe I was afraid he was a catfish idk. But I remember he would also message me quite a lot, from what I remember he was always nice, but maybe a bit too nice. Like it was a bit too much. And I think he told me he liked me, or loved me, or something I really don’t remember I just know he liked me. But I also can’t remember the content of the conversations so I don’t know whether it really was as bad as I think it was, or whether I just got paranoid about talking to a stranger. But anyway I remember this one day I posted a photo on Instagram and he commented a compliment which is harmless but it make me feel so uncomfortable. I didn’t want anyone to see it so I deleted it. 

So as I said, he was always nice (from what I remember) but I just felt a bit suffocated from it and trapped and I wanted it to stop. So I blocked him. I can’t honestly remember whether I had told him that I didn’t want to talk anymore and then blocked him, or just blocked him with no explanation - but anyway I blocked him on Facebook, Instagram and musical.ly and that was that.

Now fast forward about 3ish years, I don’t remember how long ago this was but I got a snapchat request. And it was him. I was kinda unsettled, why was this guy SEARCHING MY USERNAME on snapchat when I blocked him years ago. Why did he still remember me? So whatever, I just declined and continued. Now a month and a half ago I get a follow on my 2nd and 3rd Instagram accounts. And who was it? Yep, you guessed it. It was him.

It’s important to mention that my other 2 Instagram accounts are both public. One is a beauty page where I like to post makeup videos and the other is an art account where I like to show my drawings I do. So this guy has just followed both and spammed me with loads of likes. I also get a request from him on my private Instagram. It’s weird because he was blocked on that account, but now I think about it I do actually remember unblocking him at some point - just cause I thought there was no need to have him blocked after all this time. 

So I’m freaking out, feeling extremely cyberstalked and like this person has been hunting me down or something. I block him from those 2 pages but then go and message him from my private. I realise now that this is NOT what you’re suppose to do if someone is stalking/harassing you but I couldn’t just leave it. Plus I think I’m maybe being paranoid to call it stalking? Like I really need someone to tell me whether I am completely overreacting or not. I can’t exactly remember what I said but I WISH I had taken screenshots so that I could have posted them here and got some opinions! But anyway I began and explained I didn’t feel comfortable with him following those accounts and his response was: “absolutely ya, I’m harmless tho, but it’s your decision.”

Innocent, I guess?

So I’m still feeling extremely uncomfortable and weirdly exposed and I ask why he followed me again, he said 
“I never forgot about you”
“You’ve been in mind since” (or something like that)

I guess he was trying to be flattering? As after I told him that is fucking creepy he said he had expected me to be flattered by that.  

EWWWWW!!!!

I told him how creepy and scary it was that he’d try and follow me again after all this time, AFTER I BLOCKED HIM

He did not seem to understand how that is such a creepy thing to do, or maybe I’m just being over dramatic?? At one point he said he understood but wanted me to know he was harmless. 
I asked how he found me and to my relief he said his brother was on musical.ly that day and he remembered he used to have the app, so he took the phone and searched my username. My instagrams were linked in the bio so he followed me from there (which is better than learning he had taken some weird twisted root into finding me)
He said it was a one time thing (despite him also adding me on Snapchat.. which I didn’t bring up) and that he never cyberstalked me. I mean I guess I believe him? Cause the thing is, it’s been 3 years. If he was obsessed or whatever and wanted to talk to me so badly, he could have easily at any point made a second account and followed me/messaged me, whatever. So is it safe to assume he isn’t some creepy stalker? Like I’m hoping he hadn’t been continuously looking for me, because I just can’t understand why he’d do that when he could have just made a 2nd account any time in these 3 years like most creeps do when they’re desperate. 

Anyway, I told him about my discomfort with it and everything and he just said “lol, you’re funny really”. Like damn, if he really wanted me to talk to him again - he should have recognised and at least have apologised for freaking me out at least 
But he didn’t. So anyway I wanted to let him know I did not want to reconnect with him but I wanted to do it in a nice way as to not tick him off. I said I don’t feel comfortable talking to people over the internet anymore” and he said

“Why somebody hurt you?” 

I don’t remember the rest of the convo but I told him I did not want to reconnect and his last response was:

“Well if you don’t want to give me a chance it’s fine. Nice talking to you again after a very long time. I’ll be good.” 
That last bit: 
“I’ll be good” freaks me out so much.
Like what, he’s implying there’s a chance he wouldn’t “be good” after this? I can’t understand it. I DON’T KNOW HIM. We spoke for a brief amount of time YEARS AGO and now this just makes me feel like he’s had some kind of secret obsession with me all these years or something

But anyway, I don’t know how to take this. He didn’t force me to talk to him, he didn’t threaten me, he didn’t try and “scam me” like I was afraid of. I should also say i checked his account &amp; he has grown up, posts family pics &amp; everything and so I see he isn’t a catfish. 

So idk I just left it there, but then a couple days later I notice something
Basically I have a YouTube channel and I noticed a new subscriber..
I immediately freaked because I thought it was him. It was linked in my Instagram bio so he could have easily went onto it. 

I freaked and messaged him to ask if he had subbed to me (stupid I know)
He said “And why are you asking? So you can block me there too? To answer your question I don’t know about your YouTube channel, that answers your question so you can go ahead and block me again now”
Obviously he was annoyed. I can’t know for sure whether it is him that subbed *sigh* but anyway I can’t exactly remember how that convo ended. 

So. I know I’m the biggest fool in the fucking world but, I messaged him again. Another TWO TIMES on two different days in the span of like 2 weeks. At this point all conversations were initiated by me. I know what you’re thinking, “why the hell would you do that?” Honestly idk I was just so paranoid and anxious and just felt horrible and like I was being watched. I just wanted to understand because I hate not understanding. At one point he said “I’m not forcing you to be friends with me. If you don’t wanna and wanna keep your life as private as possible from me I’ll simply go away and never come back again for no reason.”

I’m so confused. It confuses my head cause it makes me feel like I’m crazy or like I’m a bad person for “keeping my life as private as possible from him” as if I have a duty to let this stranger into my life or something😭

In our last encounter I asked him if he still cared to be friends and he said:
“Even tho u made me never wanna give a damn anymore, I still do care” 
And then he was like “there’s no harm in trying to be friends”
I said no I don’t want to be your friend because you creep me out. 
He said Fine
At one point I also said that making someone feel hurt by me (which is what he said he felt at one point) made me want to die
He said 
“So why can’t you just accept this one thing I ask? If it makes you want to die.”
That kind of felt like manipulation so I realised at this point this had gone on too far. I said “This is the last time I’m ever going to message you, I hope you do the same” or something like that. Blocked him and that was that

I’ve been so paranoid he is going to make a fake account &amp; message me, attempt to follow me, or whatever. But he didn’t do that in the past, so why would he now? I don’t want him to pop up again in a few years thinking I may be ready to be friends with him then or something. 
Again I know I made the situation worse by restarting conversations with him, cause this could have made the situation worse. 

But I just need some advice, from someone who’s been in a similar situation. Or someone who has been harassed/stalked. Does this sound like that? Should I be worried? Or is he just a bit desperate and thought he’d try his luck with me again? Help me please. 

Someone put my mind at ease please because I feel like I’ll never stop stressing over this. 
Also please don’t suggest I privatise my instagrams or delete my YouTube because I really don’t want to do especially if there isn’t any real threat. 

Just need someone to tell me straight whether I have reason to worry or not. It has been almost 3 weeks since our last conversation and I haven’t heard anything from him
I wish I had just left it at the first conversation after he followed me again, blocked him and moved on then and there - instead of deepening myself into this pit of paranoia. But anyway yeah, please tell me what you think",31Aug2019,1

389,"So I’ve recently had gotten meds for anxiety, and I’ve also got depression. But I’m also in a relationship currently as well as in high school. So the issue is that we don’t talk or hang out much during school. We have a total of 6 of 8 classes together and we have all our lunches together. But we only sit kind of close (right next to but at different tables) in our first two classes. I thought that it was just me not sitting next to him, but I’m always the first one in class and he sits somewhere else, and doesn’t sit with me and the friends we both have during lunch. Last year when we had a budding relationship we sat together in 5 of the six classes we had together, sat next to each other during lunch every single day, and we usually had at least a little bit of conversation for multiple classes and talked/read through stuff during lunch. But now the only thing we talk about is hi, hello, how much sleep did you get, are you ok, and that’s usually it. I tell him that I miss him, and that I want to be around him more but he switched for about a day (still without talking much and it was the day before a date night) but then went back to how it was before, sitting almost as far away as possible. I try not to smother him, I don’t switch seats in class to sit close to him but I avoid conflict a lot and my anxiety makes me overthink everything, he was paired (by a teacher) with the prettiest girl in class and I was jealous of how well they worked together. And then later had a dream that he cheated on me with her. They could laugh and talk and my boyfriend and I can barely say greetings. And when we have our weekly date nights, he goes straight to the sexual stuff (still virgins just doing outercourse stuff) and I just want more of an actual relationship than what seems like a fuckbuddy with a “boyfriend” title. I just don’t know if I’m being needy, or if I need to try and communicate my needs(wants?) a lot better, or if we should just break up, or if he’s in the wrong or if I’m in the wrong or both, I just don’t know, and any advice will be greatly appreciated.",31Aug2019,1
390,"Ok so I still live at home 18yo. My brother is a college dropout 21yo. He smokes weed a lot which is not unusual for people his age. He also doesn’t know what he wants to do with his life. Also not unusual. However lately he’ll become easily irritated if he’s not high. He got in my mom’s face during an argument. He’ll isolate himself. My dad was knocking on his door just this morning but he wouldn’t open. I knocked but he wouldn’t open. Sometimes he’ll leave and hang around our town. My mom &amp; I saw his car at the library. My dad said my brother will wander around town but probably because he saw my dad following him, lol. 

Idk I don’t think there’s anything particularly wrong with him but he is the type of person who’s after easy money (he doesn’t want to go to college but simultaneously doesn’t want a minimum wage job). He pretty much wants money to fall into his lap. My dad has been getting extremely worried/paranoid/concerned about him and it’s starting to affect my life. He went to a therapist and the therapist straight up said he’s a negative person (the therapist was out of line but correct). He’ll joke about being “a trash man,” say he has until he’s thirty “to get his life together.” Which is not wrong. But he doesn’t pay rent or contribute much to the household or communicate to my parents of his plans. He has gotten a misdemeanor before when he was in the military. He stole this boy’s debit card and charged $800+ on it because he was racist. He had a trial and everything. My parents cried over it. He’s typically a wise guy. He gives me a lot of great advice. But I’m afraid he’ll get himself into trouble in his pursuit of finding easy money. The reason I say that is because he’s been sending these sketchy postcards to various run down homes talking about how he would like to “buy the property” even though he has no money.",31Aug2019,3

If you don’t wanna and wanna keep your life as private as possible from me I’ll simply go away and never come back again for no reason.”

I’m so confused. It confuses my head cause it makes me feel like I’m crazy or like I’m a bad person for “keeping my life as private as possible from him” as if I have a duty to let this stranger into my life or something😭

In our last encounter I asked him if he still cared to be friends and he said:
“Even tho u made me never wanna give a damn anymore, I still do care” 
And then he was like “there’s no harm in trying to be friends”
I said no I don’t want to be your friend because you creep me out. 
He said Fine
At one point I also said that making someone feel hurt by me (which is what he said he felt at one point) made me want to die
He said 
“So why can’t you just accept this one thing I ask? If it makes you want to die.”
That kind of felt like manipulation so I realised at this point this had gone on too far. I said “This is the last time I’m ever going to message you, I hope you do the same” or something like that. Blocked him and that was that

I’ve been so paranoid he is going to make a fake account &amp; message me, attempt to follow me, or whatever. But he didn’t do that in the past, so why would he now? I don’t want him to pop up again in a few years thinking I may be ready to be friends with him then or something. 
Again I know I made the situation worse by restarting conversations with him, cause this could have made the situation worse. 

But I just need some advice, from someone who’s been in a similar situation. Or someone who has been harassed/stalked. Does this sound like that? Should I be worried? Or is he just a bit desperate and thought he’d try his luck with me again? Help me please. 

Someone put my mind at ease please because I feel like I’ll never stop stressing over this. 
Also please don’t suggest I privatise my instagrams or delete my YouTube because I really don’t want to do especially if there isn’t any real threat. 

Just need someone to tell me straight whether I have reason to worry or not. It has been almost 3 weeks since our last conversation and I haven’t heard anything from him
I wish I had just left it at the first conversation after he followed me again, blocked him and moved on then and there - instead of deepening myself into this pit of paranoia. But anyway yeah, please tell me what you think",31Aug2019,1

398,"So I’ve recently had gotten meds for anxiety, and I’ve also got depression. But I’m also in a relationship currently as well as in high school. So the issue is that we don’t talk or hang out much during school. We have a total of 6 of 8 classes together and we have all our lunches together. But we only sit kind of close (right next to but at different tables) in our first two classes. I thought that it was just me not sitting next to him, but I’m always the first one in class and he sits somewhere else, and doesn’t sit with me and the friends we both have during lunch. Last year when we had a budding relationship we sat together in 5 of the six classes we had together, sat next to each other during lunch every single day, and we usually had at least a little bit of conversation for multiple classes and talked/read through stuff during lunch. But now the only thing we talk about is hi, hello, how much sleep did you get, are you ok, and that’s usually it. I tell him that I miss him, and that I want to be around him more but he switched for about a day (still without talking much and it was the day before a date night) but then went back to how it was before, sitting almost as far away as possible. I try not to smother him, I don’t switch seats in class to sit close to him but I avoid conflict a lot and my anxiety makes me overthink everything, he was paired (by a teacher) with the prettiest girl in class and I was jealous of how well they worked together. And then later had a dream that he cheated on me with her. They could laugh and talk and my boyfriend and I can barely say greetings. And when we have our weekly date nights, he goes straight to the sexual stuff (still virgins just doing outercourse stuff) and I just want more of an actual relationship than what seems like a fuckbuddy with a “boyfriend” title. I just don’t know if I’m being needy, or if I need to try and communicate my needs(wants?) a lot better, or if we should just break up, or if he’s in the wrong or if I’m in the wrong or both, I just don’t know, and any advice will be greatly appreciated.",31Aug2019,1

My written presentation stated ""upon research, I have gathered that other Supervisors earn 115-140k annually, while I make significantly less"".

401,"Right so this is my first time posting on here, so I’m not completely sure about how it all works yet. But nonetheless I thought I’d share this somewhat strange situation. I’d also like to get some opinions on this - to find out if I am justified in feeling kinda creeped out or whether this was harmless and I am overthinking it.
Okay, so let’s start at the beginning:
3 years ago on Facebook I got a friend request. I clicked on the profile and it was some kid around the same age as me, maybe a couple years older, from Africa. I’d never add strangers back but I saw that this person was mutual friends with someone I know irl, so I added them back. I can’t remember any conversations I had with him, all I know is that we ended up following each other on Instagram, and that I had gotten him to download musical.ly (because I loved that app at the time).

So anyway, at some point I realised I didn’t want to talk to this person anymore, I’m not sure if this is because of where he was from - I know that a lot of people from there could be scammers, as my mum was scammed by one a few years ago. Or maybe I was afraid he was a catfish idk. But I remember he would also message me quite a lot, from what I remember he was always nice, but maybe a bit too nice. Like it was a bit too much. And I think he told me he liked me, or loved me, or something I really don’t remember I just know he liked me. But I also can’t remember the content of the conversations so I don’t know whether it really was as bad as I think it was, or whether I just got paranoid about talking to a stranger. But anyway I remember this one day I posted a photo on Instagram and he commented a compliment which is harmless but it make me feel so uncomfortable. I didn’t want anyone to see it so I deleted it. 

So as I said, he was always nice (from what I remember) but I just felt a bit suffocated from it and trapped and I wanted it to stop. So I blocked him. I can’t honestly remember whether I had told him that I didn’t want to talk anymore and then blocked him, or just blocked him with no explanation - but anyway I blocked him on Facebook, Instagram and musical.ly and that was that.

Now fast forward about 3ish years, I don’t remember how long ago this was but I got a snapchat request. And it was him. I was kinda unsettled, why was this guy SEARCHING MY USERNAME on snapchat when I blocked him years ago. Why did he still remember me? So whatever, I just declined and continued. Now a month and a half ago I get a follow on my 2nd and 3rd Instagram accounts. And who was it? Yep, you guessed it. It was him.

It’s important to mention that my other 2 Instagram accounts are both public. One is a beauty page where I like to post makeup videos and the other is an art account where I like to show my drawings I do. So this guy has just followed both and spammed me with loads of likes. I also get a request from him on my private Instagram. It’s weird because he was blocked on that account, but now I think about it I do actually remember unblocking him at some point - just cause I thought there was no need to have him blocked after all this time. 

So I’m freaking out, feeling extremely cyberstalked and like this person has been hunting me down or something. I block him from those 2 pages but then go and message him from my private. I realise now that this is NOT what you’re suppose to do if someone is stalking/harassing you but I couldn’t just leave it. Plus I think I’m maybe being paranoid to call it stalking? Like I really need someone to tell me whether I am completely overreacting or not. I can’t exactly remember what I said but I WISH I had taken screenshots so that I could have posted them here and got some opinions! But anyway I began and explained I didn’t feel comfortable with him following those accounts and his response was: “absolutely ya, I’m harmless tho, but it’s your decision.”

Innocent, I guess?

So I’m still feeling extremely uncomfortable and weirdly exposed and I ask why he followed me again, he said 
“I never forgot about you”
“You’ve been in mind since” (or something like that)

I guess he was trying to be flattering? As after I told him that is fucking creepy he said he had expected me to be flattered by that.  

EWWWWW!!!!

I told him how creepy and scary it was that he’d try and follow me again after all this time, AFTER I BLOCKED HIM

He did not seem to understand how that is such a creepy thing to do, or maybe I’m just being over dramatic?? At one point he said he understood but wanted me to know he was harmless. 
I asked how he found me and to my relief he said his brother was on musical.ly that day and he remembered he used to have the app, so he took the phone and searched my username. My instagrams were linked in the bio so he followed me from there (which is better than learning he had taken some weird twisted root into finding me)
He said it was a one time thing (despite him also adding me on Snapchat.. which I didn’t bring up) and that he never cyberstalked me. I mean I guess I believe him? Cause the thing is, it’s been 3 years. If he was obsessed or whatever and wanted to talk to me so badly, he could have easily at any point made a second account and followed me/messaged me, whatever. So is it safe to assume he isn’t some creepy stalker? Like I’m hoping he hadn’t been continuously looking for me, because I just can’t understand why he’d do that when he could have just made a 2nd account any time in these 3 years like most creeps do when they’re desperate. 

Anyway, I told him about my discomfort with it and everything and he just said “lol, you’re funny really”. Like damn, if he really wanted me to talk to him again - he should have recognised and at least have apologised for freaking me out at least 
But he didn’t. So anyway I wanted to let him know I did not want to reconnect with him but I wanted to do it in a nice way as to not tick him off. I said I don’t feel comfortable talking to people over the internet anymore” and he said

“Why somebody hurt you?” 

I don’t remember the rest of the convo but I told him I did not want to reconnect and his last response was:

“Well if you don’t want to give me a chance it’s fine. Nice talking to you again after a very long time. I’ll be good.” 
That last bit: 
“I’ll be good” freaks me out so much.
Like what, he’s implying there’s a chance he wouldn’t “be good” after this? I can’t understand it. I DON’T KNOW HIM. We spoke for a brief amount of time YEARS AGO and now this just makes me feel like he’s had some kind of secret obsession with me all these years or something

But anyway, I don’t know how to take this. He didn’t force me to talk to him, he didn’t threaten me, he didn’t try and “scam me” like I was afraid of. I should also say i checked his account &amp; he has grown up, posts family pics &amp; everything and so I see he isn’t a catfish. 

So idk I just left it there, but then a couple days later I notice something
Basically I have a YouTube channel and I noticed a new subscriber..
I immediately freaked because I thought it was him. It was linked in my Instagram bio so he could have easily went onto it. 

I freaked and messaged him to ask if he had subbed to me (stupid I know)
He said “And why are you asking? So you can block me there too? To answer your question I don’t know about your YouTube channel, that answers your question so you can go ahead and block me again now”
Obviously he was annoyed. I can’t know for sure whether it is him that subbed *sigh* but anyway I can’t exactly remember how that convo ended. 

So. I know I’m the biggest fool in the fucking world but, I messaged him again. Another TWO TIMES on two different days in the span of like 2 weeks. At this point all conversations were initiated by me. I know what you’re thinking, “why the hell would you do that?” Honestly idk I was just so paranoid and anxious and just felt horrible and like I was being watched. I just wanted to understand because I hate not understanding. At one point he said “I’m not forcing you to be friends with me. If you don’t wanna and wanna keep your life as private as possible from me I’ll simply go away and never come back again for no reason.”

402,"I understand attraction and lust and how someone can attract you through their looks but I truly don’t get how someone is able to ‘like’ you without knowing you.

Only two people have ever liked me or confessed it, at least. 

One, I met at a party and we were friends because their friends are friends with mine. I’m not good at social media so I never talked to them. Then they ask me to prom and I say yes cause our friends were going together aswell so its  cool. Now we have to talk about what to wear and how to match and its nothing deep or personal. Then after prom they then say that they like me. I was so weirded out cause they did not know me at all, not that I’m evil or anything. I politely decline and say we should get to know each other more. We don’t. 

Next one is almost the same. They’re a friend’s friend. We never talked at all. The only time we did was when they apologized about how they acted when they were drunk. Then my friend suddenly says that they like me. I’m even more weirded out. We only had one interaction.

Can someone really like someone without knowing them? I really dont believe in love at first sight. I also had crushes but I made it clear that it was just attraction or lust. This probably sounds so naive or ignorant. I’m so sorry but I’m genuinely curious.",31Aug2019,1

406,"This is a long story but I will cut the unnecessary details out.

My friend has recently told me that she was raped 2-3 years ago and that she’s only had the courage to tell me now because the person who actually raped her was her older cousin. She was 15 at the time and hasn’t told her parents. She says she’s afraid that it would break apart the family and that she doesn’t want the family to be ruined because of her. The day after the cousin raped her he said to her “this is our little secret okay?” And she hasn’t wanted to speak up since. Ever since then she hasn’t been talking to him at all and gets scared when he’s around. He doesn’t live in the same state as us and only visits around 2 times a year. We live in the west coast and he lives in the east coast. It saddens me because this ruined her relationship with her boyfriend at the time, they both had been planning to lose their virginity together and it became a rocky topic for them. 

Additionally, that same cousin attempted to rape her older sister a year later but failed because the sister pushed him away aggressively and ran. This was only recently discovered after my friend had come forward and spoke up.

So first time posting here but I just wanted some people to tell n get some advice to see what I should do.

This year alone has been a shocker. I've been ripped off so many times since the start of the year. From friends stabbing me in the back regards the buisness plans and ideas to literally the other day coming home to find out my housemates have stole 800quid from my room.

Like I've asked them all and no1 is admitting anything but why would they? There not going to give it back. 

This comes just after my step mum passed away a couple weeks ago. Plus I had an event over the weekend in which I also had 2000pounds stolen from my tent. 

Like I've just had enough of putting trust into people and getting fucked over, it seems in every case it happens. Everyone seems out for themselves n thats it. Wether its me being to trusting or perhaps just being a mug or being an easy target I don't know but nowa days I'm just getting super depressed with it and can't be fucked being friends or going out or being social as what's the point.

My dad even leant me some off the money for the event and now I've gotta go back and tell him I've had almost 3000 of that money stolen... Like he's guna kill me, as it is he's going though so much regards to his wife, he's telling me daily he wants to commit suicide and doesn't want to be here. And now mentioning this is guna piss him off even more. 

I dunno I just don't seem to have a break this year and I'm loosing hope with life n just everything.

415,"So, here is a little back story. I'm 18, I've only ever been in 1 other relationships, which last about 6 months. Both of relationships I have given the girl in the relationship multiple chances to prove that they care about me.

This is my second relationship.  Things moved way to fast.  After about 2 months of dating her and mother had a falling out. She had no place to stay, and if something wasn't done she was going to be living on the streets.  With this situation, my work, and my school, this was obviously very stressful. I got about 18 hours of sleep a week, most of it on the weekends.

 Things were pretty rough. It got to the point where I was falling asleep at the wheel. My parents took notice of this, and let her move in with us.

 Fast forward to now. Things aren't looking too good.  The spark died out. We don't tell each other that we love each other.  I haven't tucked to her in to bed ( I know, kinda cliche ) in a long time.  We haven't had sex in months. That's due to personal reasons that we already talked about, yet she has not done anything to fix.

 Now, we talked about this.  I got her to finally admit that she doesn't feel the same anymore. She told me that she still wants to love me, but she doesn't know if she feels the same anymore. After how far backwards I bent over for her, and she still doesn't know?  After how much money I spent on her, she still doesn't know? After how much time and effort I put into her, she still doesn't know?

 There's other guys that I've been suspicious about for a while. Other guys that she constantly hangs out with. She spends her time with literally anybody else but me. I'm sorry that I'm a full time student, working almost 40 hours a week, and having to contend with this bullshit.

 But now, she's over at her friends house because it's her birthday. The same friend that she hasn't spoken to in months. She's been gone the entire weekend. Going from one friend's house to another. I only have 1 of Her Friend's contact information, through Snapchat.   This is the same friend that had her heart broken recently, and asked if anybody could go to the fair with her. Shouldn't my girlfriend be able to go with her, if she's over at her house?

 I don't know what to do. I don't know why I put myself through this, but it's way too hard for me to break things off. Especially with someone that I put so much time, effort, money, and love into. I haven't felt this way in so long. It felt so good to forget about it, but then of course I had to be reminded of how it feels.

418,"We found out my (22F) dad died on Thursday. Not that he died on Thursday, but that’s when we found out. 

The story makes no sense. He has 4 children and him and my mom were separated but not legally divorced. All of this falls back on my mom since she’s his legal spouse. 

He was living with a girlfriend at the time who said she last saw him Tuesday night and she left for the night. Came back Wednesday and couldn’t get into his bedroom because the door was locked.  Left and came back Thursday and the door was still locked. She went to the landlords house on Thursday and got him to unlock the bedroom door. He was dead in the floor, between his bed and the wall. 

I’ve been told his body was swelling. And that they had to air out the room and the whole house because it smelled. I’ve also been told there was a dent in the wall next to the bed like he hit his head. And there was blood on his bedside table. And an unlabeled bottle of pills. My dad was heavily medicated for several health issues but he always got them from a prescription. 

My dad snores loud as can be when he sleeps. His car was outside the house every time she came by to get in the room. If the door is locked and he isn’t answering and his car is there and you don’t hear him snoring why didn’t she assume that something was wrong and call 911 immediately? Why did it take her 2 days to put the pieces together? 

I feel so guilty because I don’t remember the last time I saw him. Or the last time I spoke to him. Whether or not our last conversation ended on good or bad terms, or if I even told him that I love him. I held onto a lot of hurt and anger towards him during my teenage years that followed into my early adult life and now I can’t ever take it back. 

I was told one of him and his gf’s last fights was over food. They were hiding food from each other. Because they couldn’t afford much. My dad died alone, and his last months must have been pitiful, and I wasn’t there, and I didn’t even get to say bye or I love you to him. None of us had seen him in well over a year. And now he’s just.... gone.

I’ve noticed over the past few weeks that I’m starting to get more and more questions about my relationship status and questions that seem to question my sexuality by a lot of people that I know. I’ve also noticed that these same people are starting to treat me differently. 





The first clue I remember that people thought I might be gay was when my mom came back from a girls night out with a few other moms from our church. I remember her telling me about how they were talking over dinner and the topic fell to relationships and all the other ladies were talking about the girls that their sons would bring home and she had to just sit there and listen and when when they asked her if I had brought anyone home, she had to say no and change the subject. I remember wondering why she felt the need to tell me that. I think I know now.





At first I didn’t really notice, my friends would always go out together with their girlfriends and do stuff around the town and ask me when I would ever join them. I thought it was just friendly banter. I remember in junior year of high school, I would talk to this girl from my fourth period a lot. My friends would always urge me to ask her out but I didn’t like her like that and I didn’t even know if she was interested. After a while we just talked less and less and I later found out from her friends that she liked me a lot. To this day my friends won’t let me live it down. They also ask me why I’m only friends with guys (I have a few girl friends but they’re more acquaintances if I’m honest) and why I follow mostly guys on my Instagram (which is mostly just former soccer teammates and some of my closer friends), which I really don’t know how to answer. 






I got seemingly tipped off again I was talking to my crush the other week, we were in a room alone just talking when she started asking me a bunch of questions like if I’ve had my first kiss, if I’ve ever had a girlfriend, if I considered myself loyal, if I ever felt lonely seeing a bunch of other couples hanging out and doing PDA, stuff like that. Once the narrative was established that I’ve never had experience with romance of any sort, the questions started getting kinda awkward, like if I’ve ever found a girl attractive, if I’ve ever grabbed a girl’s ass, if I’ve ever so much as danced with a girl, stuff like that. I felt as if she asked me everything besides if I was straight. I don’t really know why but the questions kinda hurt, particularly the ones that seemed to be probing at my sexuality but that’s life I guess.








Last Sunday at church, a family friend asked me why she’s never seen me with a girl. I replied that I don’t really want to force a relationship. Then she goes rambling about how it shouldn’t be hard for me because I’m good-looking, I’m tall, and I have purpose in life. I asked her why she cared so much about my relationship status and she said she was curious. Since then I’ve been getting various forms of this question from various church members every Sunday. It’s getting quite annoying if I’m being honest and it’s making me not want to go. I talked to my mom about it and she said that I should be taking it as a compliment.







I think even my family think I’m gay. Nearly a year ago I decided to grow my hair into an afro, and to keep my hair in the optimal condition to grow, I regularly go to the beauty supply store to buy conditioner and castor oil. My friends found out because I encountered one of my friend’s mother while there one time. They still feel the need to mention the fact that I put “girl products” in my hair. Anyways, even though I’ve been going regularly for nearly a year now, my dad found out a few weeks ago and at first, he always used to mention that I took longer on my hair than a girl whenever I was in the bathroom longer than it takes to brush my teeth. My mom heard him the first time and gave him a real earful but didn’t respond when he kept repeating it. Last week he walked in on me applying conditioner to my hair and it seemingly set something off, he started not talking to me at all even though we would talk for hours previously about stuff like soccer, politics, and life in general and whenever he absolutely had to address me, he would do so in an aggressive tone. He would try and start arguments over the most minuscule shit and call me disrespectful when I ignored him. Yesterday he straight-up asked me if I was gay. I didn’t answer and I guess he took that as a yes because now he seems to have ramped up his shithousery. Even my mom and sister ask why I never bring a girl home and when I tell them I’m not comfortable with that question, they just say they were joking.







Those are just specific instances. Around the time I noticed I was getting the questions regarding my relationship, I noticed that people started treating me differently. My friends didn’t want to hang out as much, my phone dried up when sometimes I would have to be having multiple conversations at once, I started getting dropped for leadership roles when usually the church leaders would be asking me multiple times a week to fill them, and after church when everyone does fellowship I can easily make it to my car in under a minute when usually it would take me 15 taking the same route because of people stopping me and wanting to have a conversation.






Honestly, I have no idea what to do. I feel like the way people are treating me is unfair because I’m not even gay. I’m so fucking tired of having to watch all of my actions because they probably aren’t “masculine” enough and I’m even more fucking tired of having to reiterate the fact that I’m not gay to seemingly everyone I run into. The worst part is I have no fucking evidence that people are treating me differently because they think I’m gay or that they even think I’m gay in the first place so this could all be in my head, but my instinct has never failed me. What do I do?",31Aug2019,15

422,"Hello! 
Dear Reddit,
I’m in the management side of the live music industry. I work 18-20+ hr days, probably 60/40 on my feet and off - average probably 16-22k steps depending on the site and our build that day. 

In the years I’ve been in this industry, I still cannot find a pair of shoes where my feet and legs aren’t actively hurting at the end of each day. I’ve historically worn boots, but maybe now as I’m not physically doing ground work as much site overview maybe I should switch to a walking or tennis shoe? 

I’m mid-festival and my last Allegra boots (I was so hoping they could finish off the season) had a sole tack that began stabbing my foot pre-gates. Not fun. I put my Docs on this morning and they already feel more narrow than I remember and a bit flat. I’ve read about weight lifting shoes because they take an impact well? 

I’ll take any recommendations and thoughts you’ve got. 
Please and Thank You,

- Moderate to high population, but not massive like LA, NY, or SF.

Not required but appreciated:
- Coastal or Close to the coast
- Northwestern United States
- Temperate Climate
- LGBT Friendly
- Art Culture
- Electric Vehicle Infrastructure

426,"Hello, I'm currently set to study my masters at Uni in around 3 weeks and I've recently been offered to lecture part time at my previous further education college part time.
I absolutely do want to complete my masters but money is gonna be tight. The student loan should cover main costs, though I need to dip into my limited savings and the help my family has offered for food and other expenses. 
On top of that, I'm still waiting for accommodation. The uni is yet to allocate any for me, and they also don't guarantee it, and I'm struggling to find an affordable off-campus option.

If I were to take this work option I could save about £10,000 with the help of another part time job and afford basically any accommodation next year, as well as get a teaching qualification and some nice experience .

432,"Is this unreasonable ? Or because of the ocd ? 


I turn 18 this month. This year she gave me rules for the first time in my life, which is fine but I had a hard time adjusting to them cause I never had chores in my life 


2-3 weeks ago she gave me a new rule that I don’t agree with. I have OCD as well and this rule led to me almost crying cause I wanted to do something late in the house that I couldn’t. However I knew the crying was ridiculous for the situation and just became alone for a bit, not wanting her to see me cry over something so petty. 



I told her  today “ we share this house, I am fine washing the dishes before you wake up as I do every day as well as sweeping the kitchen and tables / counters/ stove, but this rule that u recently enforced we both need to agree on a time. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t have to agree on this rule” 

She said” “ I cried a couple days ago to you because of you not following the rules, this shows you don’t care about my feelings “ 


Then I said “ I almost cried a couple days ago because of your rule as well. Is stresses me out a lot. If I didn’t care about ur feelings I would not be doing them before the time I wake up cause it’s more conveninent for me to do them later  “


**keep in mind I have ocd as well, not the cleaning type**


Then she said “ u crying over xxx is ridiculous “ 


WTF. A couple days ago she was crying because I forgot to do my bed or something. HOW CAN SHE INVALIDATE MY FEELINGS LIKE THAT???? I would never tell her something like this. It’s upsetting to hear. 


I told her if we are not agreeing in the other rule I am changing the tjme I wash dishes. I will still wash them of course, they will probably and likely be later than when she wakes up. 


I told her this and she told me, completely serious ( and I believe her when she says this ) “ if you don’t wash the dishes before I wake up, I will not talk to you anymore “. 


I said “ I’m sorry, but if you’re not going to talk to me over something like this when we can both agree on a time for the other rule and I’ve been considerate of your feelings to wash the dishes / clean the kitchen before you wake up then that is on you, not me “ 




Btw washing dishes usually takes me at least an hour, sometimes 2 cause my ocd makes me clean them extra long. The other cleaning takes about 30 min. What do you think? 


Btw I’m 17 (turn 18 in September) and she is 25.

442,"As of yesterday I’ve lived in my new apartment for a week. Since then my roommates (who I got paired with after filling out a survey thing) have been awful. 

I have two roommates, and in the week I’ve been here some of things they’ve been doing include

1. Smoking. (Even though I put in the survey I wanted roommates who didn’t smoke.) Causing the entrance area, kitchen and living room to smell like nicotine smoke, which is making me sick to my stomach. I brought this up with them and asked if they could smoke outside, to which they responded “nah, I’ll just use more fabreze”. 

2. Asking me to put the electric bill in my name because they won’t let one pay because his credit score is bad and the other one can’t pay because he has no bank account. Only to then insult me when I said I wanted to have all of us discuss it with my parents (who were coming for a visit soon and were in charge of helping me pay for my bills, including electric) because my parents and I are afraid we’ll end up having to pay the whole thing, saying “why you gotta bring up your parents? Your grown.”

3. Not doing their dishes. Our kitchen has a double sink. They keep leaving dishes in both sinks, to which I  put them all in one so I’m able to do my own. In the week since I’ve moved in their side of the sink is already starting to over flow.

4. Playing loud rap music. The walls of our apartment are pretty thin and sound tends to echo/amplify. So them playing loud rap music (which uses the n-word excessively) is extremely annoying, especially when trying to focus on school work. 

5. Having loud friends over at 4 in the morning. Another thing I put in the survey is wanting roommates who notify everyone when they bring company over. But last night I was kept up until 5 am due to people upstairs having a party and my roommates bringing over a big group of loud friends. If I took a shot every time I heard the words “n-word” and “bro” in that hour alone I’d die from alcohol  poisoning in minutes. Not only that, they had their friends stay the entire night, so I wake up again to them loudly chatting about shit.

6. Eating my food. Unlike my two roommates, I’m no longer on my school’s meal plan, meaning I need to buy/cook all my food. While moving in, my mom left me a container of her (fucking godly) chocolate chip cookies, which I’ve been eating slowly over the course of the week. Last night I overhear their loud friends saying “yo bro are those chocolate chip cookies” and talking about how good they are. Last night there were probably 6 cookies left, this morning only 2.

7. Small shit. Walking around the apartment with their pants sagging. Not checking the mail in god knows how long (I check it out a few days ago and it was fucking packed, with multiple letters for the roomate who’s been lived here last school semester.) 


I’ve gone to the office to see if I could get transferred to a different apartment, sadly all Male apartments are booked, telling to ask again in a couple months.  Single apartments are an extra $300 a month, which me and my family can’t afford. Most other apartments that are in walking distance (can’t drive) of campus are either over priced or hella sketchy (gotta love urban decay.)

At the moment I’m thinking of possibly trying to get my roommates evicted due to smoking (I can’t remember if it was actually part of the contract or just part of the survey). I’m also thinking about apply for disability and seeing if I could use it to get a discount for a single apartment. (I was diagnosed with major depression near the end of last semester and I had a friend who did that last semester, actually paying less for a single apartment than the triple she was in previously, though in a different apartment complex).

450,"TLDR: I’m 20 and not sure if I want to go into a lot of debt for a degree in biomedical science or less debt to become an RN and ultimately a BSN. Also I’m  afraid it will be really difficult to get into a nursing program. 

Hello! 

So I am currently 20 years old. I participated in an accelerated program in high school and graduated with my diploma and an associates degree from the local community college. I then went to a larger university in my hometown for about a year before deciding I wanted to move out of state. I’ve since moved to Washington and worked over the last year to gain residency. I then applied and was accepted to the University of Washington in Tacoma and was planning on going back for a bachelors in biomedical science with an overall goal of going into clinical microbiology. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about what careers I would feel fulfilled in, and have recently switched from a position where I had a lot of clinical interactions with patients to a job in medical records and I am missing the patient interaction very much. 

With this in mind, I’ve been thinking about going into the nursing field instead of clinical microbiology. UWT doesn’t offer an RN program but they do offer a BSN program once you’ve become certified. I would have to finish up some pre reqs at the local community college (approx. 2-3 semesters) and then apply to their nursing program (2 years). I probably have about 2-3 years left if I chose to finish my degree at UWT as many credits did not transfer between state lines.

So the duration would be about the same in both cases (depending on how long it would take to get into the nursing program). Another main factor is the amount of debt I’d be taking on vs estimated salary. If I continued at UWT I can easily see myself taking on 30,000 in debt as their tuition is 10,000. While at the community college tuition is only about 3,000, which would in theory about 9,000-10,000 in total debt at the end of the program, and then maybe another 10,000 for the year program to become a bsn at UWT. Clinical microbiology salaries range from 35,000-75,000 per year in this area. While nursing ranged from 35,000-55,000 for an RN and 45,000-75,000 for a bsn. 

So, overall I would get into less debt and have about the same potential earnings in a field that is much easier to get a job in with nursing, but I am also all set and ready to go finish my current degree at UWT. And also I am very scared that it will take a long time to get into the nursing program and then I will have thrown away getting a bachelors in a decent amount of time???

I’m just very torn and unsure what to do!

Any input is appreciated, sorry this is so long lmao.",31Aug2019,1

However I always have to stop because I cannot get over my intellectual/spiritual differences, even extremely in the most open minded churches. I just am not interested in discussing spirituality. As much as I love and need that community and support, and find the services beautiful, I feel like a fraud. Yet I feel an urge to go back. What secular communities or organizations can you think of that provide a similar level of support and/or catharsis and/or aesthetic pleasure?",31Aug2019,1
453,"Hello,

I was recently accepted into two graduate programs in two vastly different fields, Software Engineering and Evaluation and I'm unsure which to pursue. I'm going largely to earn a better paying career and earn a graduate degree (being the 1st in my family to do so).

My current employer is willing to pay (75% tuition costs) for my Evaluation Studies degree which would cost me $2197.50 per year as a full time student(6 credits) or $824.06 part-time for 3 credits. Each credit is $1,465.00. I estimate it will take roughly 2-3 years to complete. This scholarship prohibits me from seeking additional funds from the institution or my employer(associated with institution) to fund my studies. I have talked with individuals in this field and they have stated it doesn't require a Masters to work in the field of program evaluation but can be helpful. A certificate would suffice.

Though this is a great opportunity, I do NOT want to continue working for my current employer. My family and friends think otherwise, as I earn a graduate degree at a fraction of the costs and don’t need to utilize student loans(currently $54k in student loans). However, I have not had a substantial raise in 5 years and this (scholarship) is the sole thing keeping me there. Current salary is $32,070 in public sector with a BS in humanities. I do not have enough in savings to cover the cost in tuition for this program. I’m in talks with my employer to reclassify my position to grant me an assistantship, however this may lower my current salary to 25k.

As for the Software Engineering program, it would NOT be funded by this scholarship(different institution) and would require me to take out loans or apply for scholarships to fund my tuition until I land a career in the field. Tuition costs for this program are $18,232 per year as a full-time student (8 credits), $47,859 for the entirety of the program. $1,139.50 per credit, courses are 4 credits. The director of the program has stated it takes students roughly 2 semesters to land an entry level position in the field. My hope would be my employer offers tuition remission.

In terms of return on investment would it be better to take a small hit with the Engineering Masters by taking out loans to fund at least 2 semesters until I land a new career or utilize my employer's scholarship to pay(75%) of my evaluation studies degree at a fraction of the costs? I was considering enrolling in an evaluation course this fall to see if the program is a good fit but I have this nagging feeling to drop everything and go the engineering route. I attended orientation and I was the only student in my cohort, I asked a professor in the program was this normal and was told it's a fault of the faculty for not advertising. Was also told they don't have scholarships or an assistant ship to offer me by my advisor aside from the one I receive by my employer.

I need to make a decision before September 2nd. :(

Sorry for the ramble, any insight would greatly be appreciated.

Thanks.",31Aug2019,1
454,"I got a new position at my job with a big pay raise. I'm still not actually doing the work my position is for so I work with my current coworkers still but I have the raise. There is this guy here who is always picking on me and making remarks about me. I try to ignore him and have not done anything to him. I work with his wife and he works somewhere else but is in sight at all times. Even though he and his wife have more seniority I have a higher position but I do what they tell me. I don't have to I just want to help out. 

So they were together at the end of our shift asking me to do something when I was going to do something else in a different room. I nodded no but I came back to do it after. His wife said ""thanks"" like i was a little kid. I ignored her did the task while they both complained about how i did it. Then the guy comes at me yelling ""I'm going to report you for slamming and trowing crap"". I was taken aback. I seriously didn't know what to say. I literally dropped something on accident and was trying to finish the task to go home. Anyways, I said are you serious bro? He continued to yell at me. Saying ""you think you can do what ever just because you got a new position?""... 

&amp;#x200B;

I literally did nothing to this guy and he hates me. We never talk and we do it's one sided with him harassing and laughing at me. I think he thinks I was non-verbally giving them attitude through my actions I did not mean. I'm socially retarded but I know I did nothing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

He knows I have no confidence and no friends but is always speaking down to me. What did I do anons and what should I do? Just wait it until I move to my position? I still have a couple months and will still see him sometimes. For some reason I felt so sad and confused. It made me think that maybe other people at work feel the same as him.

458,"I'm not sure where she got the idea that ""I don't clean"" (her words) but it's really hurtful. She's done it a handful of times now and it's starting to go from a harmless joke to verbal abuse. I'm not sure how to bring it up with her. I always feel like I am walking on eggshells around her because anything I say turns into a lecture. 

Ex: a bird got into the warehouse where I work so I sent her a picture. She suggested I take it home because I have pet birds. I joked that ""all birds are mine"" she decided to correct my obvious joke by saying ""No. They are God's but he will let you look after them.   Hahahaha"" I was hoping she was joking so I took it a step further and claimed ""all birds are mine, I made them"" obviously I didn't make birds but she took the chance to turn it into a lecture and saying that I ""shouldn't claim to be God"". I wasn't.

She has been over to my house several times and Everytime she acts surprised that its clean. I cannot tell you how much that ruins the mood. Everytime she has done this I just want to tell her to leave but, of course I can't.

I have severe clinical depression that I haven't told her about. I don't plan on telling her either. Over the last month it decided to hit me hard and I fell way behind on my cleaning routine. My house was a disaster. 

She called me yesterday afternoon and asked what I was doing. I told her I was cleaning the house. She proceeded to unironically laugh for close to 30 seconds. I didn't join in on her laugh. At the time I just let it slide but, today it is really bothering me. Enough that I'm posting about it on the internet. I'm sure she will say it's just a joke and that I shouldn't get offended. I'm not even sure if I should bring it up with her. Any advice?",31Aug2019,1
459,"A little context: I’m 17F and I will have to take university entrance exams next year, so I have to get a math tutor. I’m struggling with anxiety, which is a really important factor. I have two main options.

Option 1: 
50+ year old lady, reserved and strict, but not mean. Three 2hr long lessons a week, with a group of 2 other students, at her nice, quiet apartment. When I went to meet her we sort of clicked nicely, she thought I was smart and had a lot of potential. 
The schedule is rigid. Also, this is significantly more expensive than the other option. 

Option 2:
Also a lady, around 30 years old. More energetic, but kind of draining. Two 3hr long lessons a week, with a group of 4 other students. The setting is not nearly as comfortable, it’s not a home, it’s more of an establishment with a more chaotic aura and shittier building. 
Although we didn’t “click” as nicely, the lady is more approachable, more flexible. She’ll give me a lot of freedom with the schedule, which is important because I get sick often. 

Both are equally good at their jobs. They’re both roughly in the same area with the same commute. 

My parents tell me not to take the financial part into consideration, that they’re willing to pay whatever it is. But, realistically, this is a real financial investment that we have to be able to balance with other important things like my therapy. Parents tend to overestimate how much resources are reasonable to put into academics, and I feel like a lot of pressure comes with that as well. Even though the cheaper option is more stressful, the fact that it’s cheaper might turn out to benefit my general wellbeing more, allowing for more recreational spending. 

I feel more comfortable with the first option, but my anxiety tends to cloud my judgement, and a lot of the time it turns out better if I do the opposite of what my feelings are telling me to. I don’t want this to be another avoidance based decision where I go with the “safe” option and it worsens my anxiety in the long run. Maybe it’s better if I start getting used to more stressful situations, especially as I’m going to be starting university.

I know it would be more appropriate to discuss this with my psychiatrist, but I have to make this decision as soon as tomorrow because I’ve horribly procrastinated it. What do you guys think I should do?",31Aug2019,1

He’s quite overweight himself but all my life he’s body shamed me (I’m an average body type) and made me feel miserable about everything I’ve ever done. And the worst part is my mother always says he’s joking and tells me to let it go.

My father has made me feel so bad about my weight that I starved myself for a few weeks, only drinking liquids and one light meal per day. This wrecked my system so much that I vomited up everything in my stomach almost daily. Had a high fever that wouldn’t go away and I just felt nauseous at looking at food.

However, this co-worker was recently switched to a morning shift with me on Saturdays. I have maybe seen him on time twice now. 

I have headache/migraine issues, that medication doesn't fix (I broke my neck, and never stays aligned. Causes headaches occasionally.) I made a sort of joke about calling one of the other employees to come in early. What my coworker meant to say was, "" Well, there isn't much left in the shift. I know that I always don't feel good, but if I can do it, you can too."" 
What he actually said, Verbatim, ""Well, remember that time you couldn't stay over an hour for me? I had to tough it out. You should too."" So...I know their heart is usually in the right place. But you cannot convince me that wasn't a personal jab.

471,"I've always been the shy, quiet one in the family. I'm just a major introvert who likes their alone time and have gotten a reputation for being ""sensitive"" among my family members. A few years ago my brother started dating this woman who is the absolute opposite of me. She's extroverted, loud, and pretty much has no brain-to-mouth filter but we get along okay because underneath all of that she's a pretty good person. 

The problem is that I'm starting to dread family get togethers. My parents live in a rural area and I don't drive so most of the time I am relying on someone to give me a ride. Sometimes my parents will come and get me but most of the time my brother and his girlfriend will stop on their way out of the city to pick me up. 
The two of them think it's hilarious to tease me non-stop and I'm sick of it. 

They poke fun at everything about me, from my clothes and hair to my relationship status, and anything else they think is hilarious. I'm not a special snowflake. I can handle a bit of teasing but they're absolutely relentless, especially the girlfriend. The teasing starts the minute I get in the car with them, lasts all through the visit with my parents, and continues until they drop me off at home. It's just too much. 

I've asked nicely for them to stop. I've told them to shut up and leave me alone. My body language and facial expressions genuinely express that I've had enough and yet they continue. Even flipping the bird doesn't get my feelings across. Finally last night I lost my temper and called the girlfriend a cunt. 

Everyone acted like I was overreacting and being unreasonably cruel. ""You're too sensitive"" was used about a dozen times in conversation. I just wanted to hang out with my family and have a nice afternoon without having someone constantly talk over me with remarks designed to poke fun at me. 

Nothing I say or do seems to make it stop. I'm thinking about just simply not going to any more family gatherings but I really do want to see my parents and my nephew. If I drove I would just leave the moment I got sick of the situation but I'm likely not going to be taking lessons any time soon as I'm in a tight spot financially and can't afford them.

The 13th of this month I woke up with a 2 day hangover and this feeling that I just didn't wanna do it anymore. It was this sudden feeling in my gut that reminds me almost of Forrest Gump just deciding to start running. I just one day decided that I didn't wanna do something I'd been doing almost everyday for 3 years. Sobriety was difficult at first, but despite that, I just didn't care to drink. I found hobbies and had a few realizations about what I'd let my life become. I realized that alcohol had blinded me to alot of shit that needed doing. 

The thing is that no one will take me seriously because I've cried wolf too many times. I wouldn't believe me either. There was no single moment. There was no big thing that made me decide to force myself to be sober. I just woke up like this.

478,"Hi everyone,

Over the past few years, I've found myself stuck in a difficult rut that I'm struggling to cope with. I'll keep this as brief as possible - any advice or suggestions you have that may help would be amazing. I don't know who else to turn to...

&amp;#x200B;

So, with a job that pays just over £1.5K a month (about $1.8K) which, after bills/food/rent leaves me with only about £400 a month, if I'm lucky. I do enjoy the job but the pay is awful - especially as I've been there for nearly a decade. I'm also technically self-employed, so have no paid holidays, insurance, pension and any other perks. I work from home which is incredibly isolating as I live alone. There's always far too much work; I end up working 14 hour days about 3 times a week (sometimes more) for no additional money.

I have thought of finding a new job, but I have terrible anxiety issues which is stopping me. I even struggle with anxiety when I'm out with a friend. I can't focus, stomach cramps, throat clenches tight, psychically feeling sick and often retch when it gets too bad. It's awful (and so embarrassing/gross). The thought of even going for an interview, or working in an office just feels me with utter dread. I've tried lots of therapy - from CBT to hypnosis (!) but only medication seems to help, which I've been on for 10 years or so.

I would like to be more social and slowly overcome the anxiety, but working from the moment I wake to when I go to sleep means there's literally no time. I chat online to friends which helps with the loneliness but having time to meet up is near impossible. Especially with the constant stress from work and the money issues. I'd like to drive but no money, no time = no chance. If I wasn't working, I'd be curled up in a ball in bed.

It's incredibly frustrating! I've always been shy, but never this bad. I did well at uni with a degree in a field I'm working in (humanities - I know, it's hardly brain surgery) but I feel like I had so much potential which I've squandered like an idiot and now I'm in a job (which admittedly I enjoy on the whole) earning very little, lonely, depressed and scared to even leave the flat.

So much for keeping this brief! Sorry for the rant. I don't really know what advice I'm after (or even expecting any!) but who knows. It's worth a shot and from the other threads, you guys do seem awesome.

So what would you do?

TLDR; In a fairly low-paying job, with very long hours (which I do enjoy on the whole). Trapped by terrible anxiety, stopping me from looking elsewhere, beating loneliness and wandering aimlessly through live thinking 'What If'/'If Only'",31Aug2019,2
479,"Hi, so I know not many people believe in dream symbolism, but it’s something I grew up with believing because of my parents and their religion.

My sister, I’ll call her Dee, was so abusive and destructive that she was placed in foster care at 16yrs old (a decade ago). Since then, I’ve not had much contact with her, she messaged me years ago asking to meet up, and I declined at that time.

Now, to my dream, last night I dreamed that a skinny brunette (like Dee is) was bothering me to the point where I was physically fighting her off. She kept coming back to me, and after warning people to keep her away from me, I ended up losing it, resulting in me murdering her.

The next morning she messages me, asking to meet up again. Do you think my dream was a sign? I’m torn between giving her a chance and by staying away due to the red flags she’s shown by talking to my mother. I also have frequent nightmares about her and her abuse has had a lasting effect on my mental health.

So what do you think? Should I give her a chance? The only reason why I feel like I should is to give her a chance to acknowledge the abuse and to show she’s changed for the better. It must’ve been hard without a family, I can sympathise with that. But if she doesn’t acknowledge the damage she’s done, I don’t know how I’ll react

I chose a room at the top of the house as I have social anxiety and am quite introverted, and as this housemate is quite fond of parties (and I’m not) I want to be up and out of the way of any party noise. 

Housemate has decided they want to swap rooms, as last year they got ill due to sleep deprivation because they can’t sleep if there is too much noise or if everything is silent. Their mum is giving them anxiety over it because she’s concerned about the boiler noise and is unhappy with them being in that room because of it.

I have ADHD and would likely also be very much affected by the boiler noise (if it’s even noisy, we don’t know that it’s even going to be an issue), as I have auditory problems and it would distract me and probably stop me from getting decent rest as well. 

We had already discussed and confirmed which rooms we were using before, and they already know that I really wanted the room I’m in due to location.

It would be very awkward to confess while he's in the middle of his monologue about some random girl from school, y'know? 

So.. I would like to ask advice or even just a confidence booster. Please and thank you!!",31Aug2019,1
486,"Hey,

Two weeks ago I started working as a student associate and I assist a PhD student who keeps winking at me. After pretty much everything she says she winks at me. To me, winking has a very sexual connotation. I was thinking she might do it to reassure me as I am new to this and make quite a few mistakes. Still, I can’t help but see it as flirty. We‘re both females, I’m a totally obvious lesbian, she’s 29 and I’m 21. What’s your take on this? Do you want more information?

Thank you all ✌🏻",31Aug2019,1

But a while ago i met this guy and he makes me extremely happy.  I introduced him to my mom as she is the most important person in my life (because i don’t really have a connection with my dad me and my mom grew extremely close).

488,"This is going  to sound weird, and probably very ridiculous, but I've always lacked self-confidence, and I've somehow never been too sure if I was doing the right thing.

Now I'm (M) 32, married, with an okay job (not in love with it, and looking for something new, but also not stressful and with a decent income), so life is relatively smooth these days. And of course, my brain is kind of questioning if that's alright.

Mostly, I'm wondering if I should be doing more. I have hobbies I love - I play volleyball a couple times a week, tennis usually the same, I play video games, I like to read, I recently took up skateboarding (although I don't practice as much as I should). I also started volunteering, but I can usually only do it once or twice a month. But sometimes I feel boring.

I see some friends who always seem to have something going on, and I'm wondering if I should too. Yesterday for instance, my wife and I went to dinner, then went back home, and she studied for an exam, while I played video games, watched some Twitch, and read. Our weekends are usually not super eventful - we usually go to dinner one night, sometimes go to museums, gardens, something that's going on around us, practice our hobbies. But I still feel like I have so much free time, and that others are using theirs in more interesting ways.

I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people - and I'm working on it, I've been seeing a therapist for issues of social anxiety for a few months - but sometimes I can't help it.

The more I write, the more I feel stupid having to ask about this, but I'm just afraid of not doing what I'm supposed to do. And I also know there isn't anything I'm *supposed* to do... But sometimes it feels like there is...",31Aug2019,1

507,"        Hey! I just want to start this off by telling everyone that I am a 17-year old (girl). I am on mobile so I’m sorry for any formatting issues! 
        Long story short, I had my first kiss last night. However, this is the same person that one of my best friends (let’s call her Jill) had her first kiss with (Crazy, I am very aware). 
       Just to preface, I met this guy (we’ll call him Fred, he’s 19.) through Jill, and Jill definitely had very strong feelings toward Fred. Fred and I had been talking every day over the past week and gave extremely personal details about our lives and problems we were going through. We gave advice to each other every night, and we had both told each other things that we haven’t told anyone else. 
       He told me that I was the biggest factor in getting him over a breakup (3-year long relationship) and that the kiss she shared with Jill was due to him (and her) being heavily intoxicated, and that he immediately regret it after. He then proceeded to tell me that he had strong feelings for me, and hasn’t felt like this about anyone else before. I was asked out on a date this Saturday with him. 
        I was completely blindsided by all of this, and the last thing I want to happen is losing Jill. I love Jill with all my heart, and I am going to tell her because I will not go forward in this without her blessing.

She lives off of very little that she get from child support from her dad, money from her grandmother and an occasional work here and there, but only if it is put directly into her lap. Either she doesn’t request enough in loans or doesn’t even apply in the first place. I know she’s very broke right now and I don’t know how to talk to her about it. She’s my friend and I love her, but it’s hard to help someone who isn’t helping themselves.

Im posting it because im genuinely curious on your opinion. My family, police AND firemen told me I was an asshole and I so firmly believe that I'm not, at least not in this case.

I was out of battery and asked my friend to call an Uber for me so I could get home, he says it's all good. The car arrives and I get in, just 2 minutes later (I checked it) he tells me the ride was cancelled by who requested it. Thinking it was a simple mistake made by my friend, I ask him if he could just turn around and drop me back so I could sort this out, he says ""nah, you have to get out here"", keep in mind that """"here"""" was literally in the middle of the road, in one of the most dangerous parts of my town, which is already pretty dangerous, at 2AM. 

I tell him I had no money for public transport, no battery on my phone and wouldn't know how to get back to my friend's house by feet since I didn't know this part of the city at all. I was not asking him to drop me at my destination, because that seems unreasonable since I live about 25min from there, just to turn around and take me back where he picked me up. Two minutes of his time would have prevented me from having the worst night of my life.

He insists that he won't do it. I ask him if I could borrow his phone for me to call someone, ""no"", I ask him if he could tell me the way back to my friend's house, drop me at a gas station, beg him to help me in any way he could and he just flips out and shouts ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAR"". I was dumbfounded and told him I wouldn't get out just like that, in the middle of nowhere, and that it was really cruel of him to do this, he unbelts while saying ""let's see if you won't get out"", just storms to my door and starts pulling me from my shirt. You see, I've been boxing for the last 8 years and never had to use it ouside friendly competition before, but the minute he starts doing that I land one of the best jabs of my entire life, he hits his head in the pavement, and I, admitelly out of rage, kick him in the face one more time.

All this time we were in front of a fire station, and after that kick I just see a bunch of firemen running towards my direction and immobilizing me. The driver completely twisted the story saying that I just assaulted him out of nowhere and they call the police, the police arrested me and called my parents. I try explaining the whole story for ALL of them and ALL of them said i was a spoiled brat for acting the way I did, that it wasn't his job to help me out no matter how fucked I was in that situation and that he is too old (53) for me (21) to disrespect anyways.

I know, the ride was cancelled and it was no longer his job to do anything for me, but I believe there are some things that don't need to be written in law for a human to have a moral obligation with.

532,"Hello people! I (F, 21) recently went through a complicated relationship (M, 25). We started out as friends then we started sleeping with each other cos guy asked me if I wanted to and I said yes then it started going on regularly. Then I started liking him and he also somehow had an emotional attachment since we started living together before he left. But he stopped trusting me mid-way through since I was also going out with other men and I asked him if he wanted to be exclusive but ended up doing it again. Despite his lack of trust, we stayed together but basically knew that it's going to end, the guy was an exchange student and he already moved back to his country. After he left, we stayed in contact and started having online sex; It's been around a month since. But I realised that I'm going to stay attached if we continue this plus I might end up hating or blaming him for the attachment so I'm thinking of cutting him off and staying away from him until I lose my feelings. Then we possibly could become friends if I do get rid of the feelings. I think this is a bit far-fetched but some of our goals that we talked about before he left is that we never want any hatred coming up and that we always want to be able to joke around and eventually look back with a smile.

534," Dear everyone, I would like to share my story and get some opinion.

I am a 25-year-old male who has finished his bachelor’s degree and started studying a master’s degree directly after graduating bachelors. I had huge ambitions and passion to reach the top. I was previous a drop out of another bachelor’s program. II managed my second bachelors with flying colors and graduated with good grades. 

With a new goal and new motivations, I pushed myself through the years managed to meet a lot of amazing people and learn a lot of things. During my masters I enjoyed my lifestyle I studied and did a lot of homework at home. I studied daily including weekend and put about 10+ hours. Once the master thesis arrived, I had a hard time to convince my professors the idea I had for my thesis but over time they approved it. Our thesis has multiple checkpoints project plan, 50%, 80% and final examination. Each student must pass 80% of the thesis before their final thesis defense.

I started off well climbing my way up and passing everything along the way. Multiple professors have praised me for my work because I improved over the year in my thesis. 

I pushed myself beyond the limits and I managed to score and pass all the courses and even reach 80% of my thesis and pass. During my final defense my opposition was a bit critical about me, but it was nothing too harsh. Until my examiner started to destroy me. That day I was so broken I took the train home and even got fined because I l left my ticket at home for taking the train :/. 

I tried to reason with my examiner to give me a chance to ask me more questions, but he simply brushed me to the side and didn’t care. I decided to re do my thesis and I never got feedback from my examiner. I remastered my thesis and sent a new copy. It was denied. I got weak feedback, but I was still determined to finish this and got the power and energy to try again yet to get declined. I became heavily depressed and my mental health was in danger getting therapy helped me get my confidence up. I worked the whole summer because I got a full-time job now. I was determined to finish this thesis my re writing everything from ground up. Hiring a professional proof reader and have my class read it with a positive feedback I submitted a new copy 😊. I got the result recently and this is my 4th time I fail…… My examiner won’t even bother reading my full thesis. I completely lost it and broke down every inch of my body and soul hurts. I tried falling sleeping the whole day but failed because I simply had to many tears in my eyes I can’t believe that I worked so hard and failed 4 times in a row and was not even given a chance from all the good work and passing everything landing in complete disaster. 

I am going to be meeting my program director to try to see if I can get a new examiner but if I don’t get it I am planning on dropping out. I talked with my family and relatives and they support me the whole way. However, it just hurts every bit of my soul to drop out at the very end of the thesis. Because I passed my seminars, defense, presentation and failed the one only thing and that is the paper. What is your opinion?

Thanks",31Aug2019,1
535,"I’m still in high school and my freshman year I convinced my mom to start financing a trip for me to go to Europe with some of my classmates. The trip is taking place in June 2020, and the closer it gets the more I realize I don’t want to go. I’m horrified of being alone in a foreign country with my classmates and teacher. I’ve never been away from home without my family and it would be a 17 day trip. I’ve never even been on an airplane. I’m genuinely horrified at the thought of it now, and part of me wants to go, but I kinda just want to stay home. I looked into the cancellation fee,  and it would only not refund the deposit and $400 would be taken from what’s already been paid. I would feel horrible, but I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to even tell my mom I don’t want to go anymore.",31Aug2019,1

544,"I don’t know if it’s the right sub or not but I really need advice. I tried r/legaladvice but someone says it’s only for US and Canada. I don’t live there, but I’m trying to get some help for my nephew. It’s gonna be long. I apologize for any grammar mistakes or ambiguities or inappropriate words because English isn’t my first language. Bear with me please :)

I live in a country where law enforcement is weak. I mean suing people/companies is uncommon.

Last Tuesday my nephew (1 year 7 months) was rushed to the hospital at 7ish pm because he’d been throwing up and having diarrhea all day. We actually went to the same hospital to see his dr earlier that day. The dr said if he kept throwing up and didn’t pee at all within 6 hrs then we’d need to bring him to the emergency so he’d get better treatment and wouldn’t get dehydrated. He didn’t pee at all even after 8 hrs of waiting. He threw up everything he ate. So we rushed him to the ER. The people in the ER told my sister that he had to stay at the hospital so he wouldn’t get dehydrated.

I stayed at the hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday nights to help my sister because my brother in law had to work.

Fast forward to Thursday. He didn’t get better at all. His dr told us (my sister and I) that he’d need antibiotics (liquid) that would be given through the IV. It’s been 3 days since he first got his antibiotics. He’s getting better but there are times when his diarrhea gets bad.

I stayed at the hospital again last night (Friday night). This morning we were walking out of his room so he wouldn’t feel bored, just like we’ve been doing every morning since Wednesday. He was having his antibiotics in his IV. I carried the antibiotics container and my sister held him. I was like “oh I’m curious what’s in it(the antibiotics)” so I read the label and I was shock when I read “Single dose container - destroy any remaining solution. Do not reconnect partly used container.” Before before telling my sister what I just read, I asked her if he always gets new antibiotics every time. She said no. He only needs 15ml dose every time, 3 times a day. So he gets 15ml of antibiotics every 8hrs.

So I told her about the label. Then we decided to ask to the nurses at the nurses station about it. They seemed confused so I had to explain the simple mathematics to them 🙄🙄🙄

I told them “it says ‘Single dose container - destroy any remaining solution. Do not reconnect partly used container.’ why do you do exactly the opposite from the label? They said “it lasts 24 hrs and we keep it at the fridge, so it’s fine.” I was like “then why does it say DO NOT RECONNECT PARTLY USED CONTAINER? They make this antibiotics, don’t they? How could they not know that it lasts 24 hrs?”

I kept calculating how many times he’d gotten antibiotics since he first got it. I was hoping that I was wrong. The bag contains 100ml of antibiotics and it was almost empty when I read the label; probably less than 10ml left. So he’d gotten 9 times (due to the medical notes or whatever they showed me about medicine my nephew has gotten since the first night) of antibiotics.

9x15 ml = 135 ml. One of the nurses came to us to explain but it just made them cornered because their calculations were wrong. I’m so damn good at math but I was hoping that I was wrong. We calculate it together. She said she discarded the first bag and got the second bag after giving 3 times of 15ml.

I said “So 15x3 = 45 ml. Then on the notes has 5 or 6 more times after that. If I remember correctly, it’s 6 times. Let’s say 6 times. So 15x6=90 ml. But why is the second bag empty? So y’all gave him more than he should take?” She looked confused. Then she said yeah, the 10ml left is still in the IV -hasn’t entered his vein yet. I was like “duh but it is entering his vein, so it’s still more than he should’ve taken. I think nurses should know about it more than I do, but why don’t they?

My question is..... is it really ok for them to reuse the used container eventhough it says on the label “Single dose container - destroy any remaining solution. Do not reconnect partly used container.” If it is, then why the company that makes the antibiotics says it’s a single dose container? We’re worried that this is the reason that my nephew is still at the hospital -he’s immune to it. We’ve never sued anyone and we’re not sure if we need to let it go or take it seriously.

It’s antibiotics. It’s not something you can mess with. They should follow the instruction on the label. I’m an engineer, so I know nothing about medicine or law. Please help. I appreciate any advice or explanation. Thank you.",31Aug2019,0

546,"I work in a very busy, hectic environment. I started out as a kennel technician and am now being cross trained as a tech assistant. I am always early to my job, I dont call out unless I have to, which is pretty rare, and I've been told that I am appreciated but every working day seems to speak the opposite. We are always short-staffed and I constantly dread interacting with a lot of my coworkers. I will ask questions or make mistakes to which they shake their heads behind my back and I feel like I am constantly a burden when all I do, I do to help. I hate speaking to my manager because she's a very snippy person, and she gets irritated quickly/does not seem to handle stress well which sucks for me because that's basically our life at the clinic. I feel like the more you do, the more you get blamed, it's so hard to explain it without actually getting to experience what I mean but the people who do the bare minimum seem to make out better than the over achievers. We get used, abused, and blamed when something gets overlooked because we were busy trying to do 80 different things. I honestly believe that we do so much more work than most of the staff and we dont get any respect, instead I feel like we are looked down on and I am absolutely sick of it. I love what I do, but I feel like I am in a toxic hell and I dont get paid what I should. If it weren't for competent kennel staff, there wouldn't be a clinic. The turnover rate is outstanding, just wow. Anyhow, I cant live like this anymore and am looking for a more ""normal"" job and would love to hear recommendations. I love working with animals but I won't be a slave to this hospital any longer. I just cant handle the stress of doing my best all the time and not being appreciated for what I bring to the table.

My grandma and mom were living together for several years, but both my mom and grandma are difficult to live with and ended up arguing often and moving away across the country from one another. 

Now my mom is incredibly lonely. She does work 4 10's, but on Friday, Saturday and Sunday she sends texts every few hours, sending me pictures and always asks if I'm up for a ""quick conversation."" It is never quick, it typically lasts for at least an hour and she rambles on about what she is doing and how her life is going, etc. Which is fine to some extent because of course I love her and want to hear what she's up to, but not for an hour every week. 

I realize I am being selfish, but I work 5 days a week and work a ton of overtime and talk to people ALL DAY LONG. I also go to school full time and am married.

550,"Hello r/Advice, recently I feel I have gotten more stupid. Not in the sense of I feel a bit more tired than usual or something, I genuinely feel something is missing, like a mental barrier or something. 

The best way to put it is my mind feels like it's older than it was, it's like it used to be a brand spanking new engine, and now it's rusted and barely functions. My thoughts are more like mumbles now, whereas I remember having a decent amount of headspace. 

I did an online IQ test, (which I know isn't accurate) and I got 9/10 questions right and it said I had an IQ of 125+. 

I don't know the correct term to describe it, it could be brain fog, but the difference is it feels like something is missing, like the ceiling has been lowered on my capacity of thinking. 

I've never thought of myself as dumb, but when comparing myself to others I'm so much slower and not really with it if that makes any sense, like I'm not in the present moment, everyone seems sharp and comfortable and I have no idea what the fuck is going on. It seems I don't even have the mental capacity to be able to fully take in the environment, and just sit in my little world.

554,"I was woken up to a family member(not going to say who in my family for anonymity purposes) that she was raped in her bed last night while after she had drank. The two ""gentleman"" that came over last night were some dudes she and her friend met at a bar, I knew something was off about them because I personally in my past used to hang out with gangsters and low-lifes of that sort(Never hung out with someone who would commit rape though, usually just drug dealing and tagging that sort of thing)

They acted nice and I was already really drunk when they came back to the house with my family member, but again I could feel that the vibe was a little off I thought at first I thought they were going to try and swipe some of my shit or its because I have trouble hanging out with new people, but I brushed it off as paranoia. However, I did take pictures of the guys car's plates and the model and trim type of the car, just in case before I went to bed. I don't know the year of the car, but I am assuming mid 2000s to early 2010s. The plates are out of state.

Apparently after I went to sleep, one of those motherfuckers proceeded to rape my family member while she was going in and out of consciousness, she says she tried kicking him away but couldn't scream because she was so exhausted and drunk and could barely get anything to come out of her mouth and he was holding her mouth and body down and I was already asleep.(I hate myself right now for this, I could've stopped this god fucking dammit. I wish she told me before they left and especially before she deleted their numbers.)

When I woke up the next day she was in tears saying how one of those guys raped her last night, they may have been working together because the other dude tried to make a move on one of my family member's friends as well but luckily for her she got that individual to stop.

The guy who owns the car I took pictures of the plate and back of was the one who didn't succeed in raping my family member's friend, however he did drive the guy who actually raped my family member so I assume they are friends. By the time I woke up and I was being told all of this my family member already told them to get the fuck out of the house and also deleted the rapist's number and everything and we can't undelete it.

I only have the plates, color and make and trim of the car. How do I find this son of a bitch? Me and 4 other buddies of mine are ready to go look for these guys. We can't go to the police because generally when there is alcohol involved nothing ever gets done about it(This has happened to her in the past unfortunately)

These guys could also possibly be using fake names, my friend was over with me and he went to bed at the same time I did and he told me their names were different from what my family member said.

She said it wasn’t hers either, and the guy at the house next to hers ended up taking it since it sat there so long. That was that and I thought it was weird but I didn’t think much of it. 

A couple days ago a blue bike was propped up against the stop sign on the corner at the house to the right of me. Since it had been a couple days, I called the non emergency line and told the police station everything I just told you.

I hated art, didnt find beauty in it, but I love computers. Found 3D art, and I did it for quite a long time (about 1.5 years) and to become good at it, I also tried to learn traditional drawing and came to respect art overall.

I didnt get better at any of them. I'm bad at all of it.

Took a 1 month break, not voluntarily, its because I had cram school. I will graduate from high school next year and I have to study to get in a good college. I felt really down so I tried to get back in 3D art, just to be reminded how shit I am at it.

Now that my school is also starting, I have to study a lot. But studying and doing nothing else productive makes me very depressed and worthless. My family told me that I should stop all my hobbies and only focus on studying. But, I realized in that 1 month period that it just wont work. I'm already seeing the burn-out signs and I dont want that to happen to me.

So my question is, should I listen to my family and only focus on my studies? Should I continue my hobbies?

572,"Hello redditors, this is a temp account as this is a topic I can't risk anyone linking to me.

My sister just called and sent us pictures of my 3 year old niece, she said she was feeling uncomfort in her private area, so my sister checked and it definitely looks irritated and open, she even sent pictures for us to check, she was taken to the doctor immediately and she is there right now.

When asked about what happened she said it was a cousin of us with whom she's never been left alone, literally ever, not even for 5 minutes, but he is close enough that she knows his name, and besides her dad and grandad, he is the only other male around her.

After asking why she didn't tell her mom if it was something that made her uncomfortable, she said ""because dad told me that is my job"", here is where we are puzzled as to why she would said that when clearly pointing to the cousin.

Now as I said, cousin is never around her, and when he is, she is never alone with him, he has no record, no shady story, 20 year old, videogames, girlfriend, normal stuff.

My niece's dad however, has another family, constantly cheating on my sister, beats her, punches her, and at some point he even threatened with divorce if she didn't agree on participating on out of the ordinary sexual practices (we've tried having my sister leave him but she's made it clear she won't).

Another thing, she began preschool this week, and she is actually just been attending for 3 days. That is another thing to add, change in her routine and the people around her.

We live in a country where reporting to the authorities will accomplish nothing without literal proof, and even then, it's most likely they won't do anything.

She said whoever it was they used their finger and it was multiple times (I don't think she would know the difference of what they used tho, but that means there is no evidence, as in DNA)

My sister is at the doctor's right now but I'm afraid she is going to tell her husband, and I'm almost sure it was him, so she is going to ruin whatever could have been accomplished. She won't let me or my mom go, and if she shut us out my niece will be totally with her dad all the time with no way to prove or do anything.

I'm confused because of what she said, and I also know that at times she's called other males by my cousin's name, being that they are neither dad not grandad, it's possible that in her mind they must go by my cousin's name.

What do you suggest should I do in my position? What do you make of what she said?

I used to be a avid reader back in grade 5 and used to easily read books from the front cover to the last page in one go. Roald Dahl and classics like Invisble Man to name a few. I loved reading.

Unfortunately as i grew up i stopped reading. Why that happened im not so sure. 

Recently in my last year of highschool i tried reading a roughly 80 page book about the 2008 Financial crisis and i found myself lost somewhere else 5-6 pages into the book. I just could NOT focus. Although i was reading to make myself more knowledgeable because it related to my potential subject i want to study in university I just kept on swaying away and thinking about other things while just staring at the page. Giving it some thought i realised it could be because maybe im not interested in the topic as much. 

Heading into adult life and university i know that reading books will only make me better. 

I guess what im tryna ask is how do i start? What do i read? How much do i read? How do i find something that is appealing to me?

Also if you have any book recommendations and absolutely any other advice, id be more than grateful.
Thank you in advance.",31Aug2019,4

579,"So my brother has aspergers (idk where on the spectrum or whatever I really dont know).
And you can pretty much tell if you just talk to him for a couple of minutes, he will basically only engage with you if you go first, he will then only give one word answers, if he does engage in conversation its only about a subject he takes particular interest in, if he doesnt like the subject he'll just randomly interrupt the convo and start talking about the subject he wishes, he will constantly interrupt people yet complain so much about being interrupted, if your opinion disagrees with his then he will dismiss you ridicule you and he will just make people really uncomfortable with stuff hes saying.

Now these all make being around him somewhat unpleasent but you can more or less work around it by either completely agreeing with him or being very optimistic and happy (although not too optimistic, that for some reason will piss him off even further), the cherry on top of this however is that hes fucking ripped af and does Jiu-jitsu, meaning i'm sometimes his venting ""thing"" I guess, and despite me or generally everyone telling him to please stop it hurts and im uncomfortable he will just continue on.

I can deal with all of this alright but today he did something that idk how to handle.

He asked our grandparents to gift him throwing knives for his birthday (they already bought them fyi, his birthday is in 6 days)

Now this wouldnt be a big deal considering that he also actually does collect knives but theres 2 things about that. 
1. Throwing Knives are Illegal where I live and are considered weapons.
2. This is not the first time he tried to get his hands on throwing knives, he tried ordering some a year ago over amazon and got our mom into pretty deep shit cause the order was in her name and she had to pay a hefty fine.

Now to add to point 2, he ordered these knives without knowledge of them being illegal however claims he googled it before (which is bs i searched it up because if you google anythibg related to laws regarding knives or throwing knive laws you will get as a first result a PDF from our laws stating that throwing knives are illegal)

Now I know my grandparents are also aware of this dilemma with the knives, unfortunately they straight up dont give a fuck because they have a ridiculous, and unconditioning love for my brother.

580,"**I'm so sorry that the post is all over the place. It's just that I'm so tired and in high fever, but I can't not worry.**

**For clarity:**

* I'm a male (17 and in highschool) and in a fever.
* My little sister is 13 and her friend is 14 and a female, she is also a year ahead of my sister so they can't be in the same class.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some info explaining things:**

The bullying is verbal, not physical and has been going for a few years now.

My sister's friend has her parents divorced. She lives close to us with her father.

My sister's friend has had suicidal thoughts and she has tried to cut herself, but not to the point of going to the emergency room (details like when or where is unknown at the moment). My sister cut herself once, but in the school a year ago (12 years old then) with a pencil sharpener, because she had a mental breakdown from the verbal bullying she received. My little sister is an introvert if you will, so **she kinda got away from the bullies** and kept friends to a small number. She has never been physically harmed and nor has her friend been.

I'm in a crucial part in my highschool, because I'm going to take the final exams within a year that I need to graduate so I really don't wanna deal with this right now, but I must.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister's friend came asking me about my experience on bullying. In short I said: I never gave up and I became friends with my bullies and got them to stop bullying me and others.

**I am not suited to help. Not only, because I'm a boy and the bullying between boys and girls is somewhat different, but because I don't know how.** **So I'm asking for advice on what the next moves should be.**

Then she asked me for help on how to stop her and my little sister's bullying. I told her to go see the student counselor or the school therapist, because I'm sure they can help. She told me that she has already seen the counselor and the principal of the school and nothing really changed other than the principal having a talk with the bullies and bullying continuing. **I ensured that the school staff can and will help.** Could the counselor recommend a therapist that can help her? I also told her to talk with her dad about things. She then said that her dad's solution is to punch her bullies so she is lost at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Worries:

Will her friend somehow get my sister to kill herself? I'm having thoughts about my sister and her friend possibly committing suicide further down the line if the bullying gets too bad, but that may be the cold that's talking. I'm quite sick when writing this so I understand that I may be stressing things too much, sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

* My first thought is to get her and possibly my sister some professional help through the counselor. People that are literally paid to help in these problems.
* Her friend has anxiety going to school and can't focus in the class. Though she isn't being bullied in class, just between the classes and any time in the school.
* Thankfully my sister isn't being that affected by the bullying, but I still fear the worst when she is with her (possibly suicidal) friend.
* But don't get me wrong the friend is a great kid with a bright personality, I just fear what the bullying is doing to these kids.
* My parents are busy with work, but I've informed them of this.
* I am talking with my sister and comforting her. She says that she just ignores the bullying. I think I'm going to talk with her friend too once I'm healthy again.
* They still have 2-3 years of that school until they move to highschool. That is the same highschool that I go to and that place does not accept bullying in anyway. Some people even got warned that they were going to get expelled from school if they kept bullying, even if it was just a few words.

Edit: and of course I forgot to mention this: A kid that is my good friend's little brother said to me that my little sister's friend that this post is kinda about has talked about suicidal things in the school so I'm getting red flags from everywhere.

581,"So some context, I’m 21 and worked two part-time jobs this Summer and am starting back to university next week. My one job is at a grocery store, I get half decent hours and I like the workplace. My other job is a kitchen, which I also enjoy but my coworkers drive me crazy and they’re really just a mess. Plus, something about the kitchen job makes my hands swell up...? So I’m sure you can see that that is the one I’m looking to quit. My concern is the money I’d be losing even if I only have a couple shifts at the kitchen but it’s just draining me. 
It really just boils down to me being scared to make the decision myself to just bite the bullet and leave, I guess I really just need someone to tell me it’s not the end of the world if I lighten my load a bit.

584,"This might sound stupid. I’m a very insecure person and hate confrontation, and I am kind of a pushover with people I don’t really know that well. I applied for a job at this bookstore, as a regular retail person. I got called for an interview and was asked to sit in the cafe for over an hour until the manager came over to me to talk to me. She interviewed me in the same room as some girl who was doing her orientation paper work, and it was a bit odd. She kept asking me about working in the cafe and in front of the girl asked me if I would work there. I said umm, maybe, and she said okay and she was going to call me if I got the job. She called me and then told me that I got the job as a cafe worker and if I would accept. I felt I was so caught off guard I said yes again and then a few days later when I went in for orientation, I was again asked to wait in the cafe for over an hour before she figured out she hadn’t sent any of the documents to me that I needed to sign and we would just do it tomorrow. While I was in the office, she called the other new cafe hire and told her she was supposed to be here today and the girl was like “I was?” and the woman said “Yes I left you a voicemail saying I hired you and the orientation is today” and I just sat there thinking “you didn’t talk to her on the phone when you hired her? you just figured she would come in?”.

While I was there, an employee came into her office and gave her quite an attitude over how she promised him a promotion and how she hasn’t delivered yet. She promised him soon and he sulked out.

So next day I show up for orientation, and when she asks if there’s any questions about the job, I ask if it’s okay that I have a trip planned. She said yes, and where. I told her that I had a trip planned for 2 weeks from now for a weekend and my cousin’s wedding in December. She said “Oh... December is busy” and I said I could work the day I left for a few hours just if she needed anybody and she said “I mean, I just want to let you guys know I can’t give you any day off you want all the time.” 

I was a bit shocked, considering it’s so far in advance and it’s for a family member’s wedding.

She then scheduled me for 3 days in a row at the worst times for shifts where it wouldn’t be too great for me.

[Warning some things arent SFW]


Ok, lets get to the point, for privacy stuff lets just call me Mark. I am Mark i am 23 years old and i been in a relationship with my best friend Jessie(thats what we will call her) shes the only girl i ever had sex with. She had one other partner before me but thats fine, idc. We known each other since we were 13. In our first year of dating she actually got pregnat with our first son, and rencently with our second one. We dont live together because money is a little tight being im the only one working. Now heres the real problem. Jessive have major insecurity issues. When we first started to date she notice i watch porn alot (i mean i was a single man what else should i do) she still holds a grudge that i watched porn even when we were dating. To me porn is just porn just to get off a quick one, to help ya sleep faster. The weird thing is that she hates the fact i dont really have a type i like everyone i dont see weight as a issue either. She constantly thinks that im looking at other girls when we are out with our sons. She thinks that porn means i wanna go out and have sex with other girls its all too much. She doesnt even want me to touch her or even kiss her because she thinks ill think about any other gitl thats overweight due to my past porn searches that happen over a year ago. Even if i tell her shes beautiful everyday i kid you not i can do it all day everyday no problem but she throws a left hook and tells me im lying i really do not know what to do. Im a good father i have a job i pay bills im doing all i can for us qnd and its hurtful to see the girl who i love with all my heart doesnt even beleive me.",31Aug2019,0

591,"I'm going into my junior year of high school in a couple days, and I'm scared that I won't do well. I remember starting my freshman year and getting great grades, maintaining good study habits, and finishing things on time. I liked school and it was the thing that was important to me. 

During my sophomore year, I didn't do so well. I ran into distractions that took my focus away from school. My grades slipped and I stopped meeting due dates.

This summer, I spoke to a friend and we came up with a plan to improve our study habits. We plan to implement these goals and rules in an attempt to improve our performance at school. 

I still have this fear that I'll fall back into last year's habits, that I'll never recover and I'll be an unmotivated lazy fuck who can't hand in an essay on time. There has to be some other way to approach this. How can I begin to like school again?",31Aug2019,1
592,"TLDR, I've caught myself in a situation where I'm lying about having a boyfriend (even though I'm allowed to have one and they like him as my friend), I haven't signed up for my school loans yet (which I need to ask my parents for their taxable income for), I don't have any of the classes I need for medical technology in uni, a course that I don't even wanna take, and I've found myself getting dangerously close to suicidal thoughts again.

For the long story lengthened, I know the root cause of why I've been so incompetent. I'm an honor student from an academic high school, lead of the school play, and I was even asked to speak at our graduation banquet in May even though I wasn't the valedictorian. But while I'm impressive in my performance, language skills, and arts, no matter how many nights I don't sleep or how many nosebleeds I get, I still barely get the grades I need for math or sciences. And my parents are Filipino. They had to move to Saudi Arabia, and now to North America to give me and my siblings a better life but I'm not good enough for them.

I've been honest about not wanting to do medical technology, even though I got into university, because I know that my mental strength and mental ability just is not prepared for the studying and eventually the actual job for the rest of my life. But everytime I'm shut down and they call me a coward for not stepping up to the challenge. I don't think I'm a coward although I see why they'd say that. I just don't want to be in denial of my shortcomings. I don't know what to do. I'm lying so much just to keep seeming like a perfect child but I'm nowhere near close.

Turns out that even though I got into uni, because I wasn't accepted into the faculty of sciences, I can't even take some of the prerequisite classes I need for medical technology, so right now I'm signed up for the following year with courses that I need and courses that make me a full-time student. The problem is that if I tell my parents that, they'll be upset that I didn't tell them earlier, and I'll have to transfer to a lesser known college to continue with medical technology, if I'm even qualified there.

My other problem is that I should have applied for my school loans already as school starts on Monday, and the applications opened on August 1st. To submit the application I'd have to either go through their documents when they're not at home and l'd have to find their income tax forms myself, which is honestly against my morals but might be an easier way out, or I'd come clean and tell them, which would lead to more yelling.

My dad already has so many doubts and wants to take us back to the Philippines because he has that old-fashioned thinking where if you aren't in school for law or medicine, you're doing it wrong, so I'm in for the biggest hell of my life if I come clean. But I know I should. Because I would deserve every consequence to come.

I know it's odd for me to come here to ask for advice but I come here because if I go to anyone who actually knows me, I would hate myself even more. Please. Thank you.",31Aug2019,2
593,"Ok, so for a little context, I am a 19f, most of my friends are 19-20m. One of these friends is basically like a brother to me, and is currently living at my parents house (another story for another post). He is a part of the 2 friends I talk about in this post, his boyfriend being the other one. (My brother would remain in my life regardless, he’s family. I just worry because of his boyfriend what will happen to our relationship)

This group of friends and I are really close, seemingly until very recently. We have all been mutual friends/Acquaintances for years. Some friendships even spanning a decade. We all started hanging out as a group, however, in 2015 and have been inseparable ever since. I’m talking hanging out every weekend, DND nights, game nights, feelings jams, etc. We were like one big family. We are all pretty mature people, a lot of us have tragic backstories that have aged us physically and mentally, so we never really get into spats or petty drama. So this is why I’m unsure how to really handle the (perhaps perceived) rift that is starting to form? 

3 of the 5 friends (myself included) are college sophomores now. My boyfriend (also one of the 3) go to school across the country, and decided to temporarily get an apartment together to cut dorms costs. The other friend goes in state. The 2 remaining friends in the group (who are dating) have had really bad runs in life, and cannot go to school. Year one of school (when I was still in the dorms), I came home for the summer. Everyone seemed happy to be together again, and gatherings resumed. Seemingly normal. We had all kept in contact in that year through a group chat that has existed since we were Jrs in high school (with two or more of us being active on it consistently almost every day). 

Of course, life gets busy when you become an adult. Most of us got jobs, and with school our schedules tightened. But during our freshman year of college, all seemed well. It wasn’t until the summer I came back I noticed things seemed off. The two friends who couldn’t go to school worked generic retail jobs- which they hated. It sucks seeing someone you care about go through stuff like that. And there’s a sense of guilt knowing that I can go off and go to school while they are stuck. But I digress. 

It’s hard to describe, but I sense almost an animosity/distancing from these 2 friends. My boyfriend isn’t really active in the group anymore because of just life obligations, and the remaining friend is in a similar boat. When I was back home, when we would hang out, the 2 friends would make snide comments about me not having to work. Ok, ouch, but privilege acknowledged. I get how unfair it is. But it seems to be deeper than playful jabs. I feel as though these two friends are projecting their insecurities and failings on to me. I am the only woman in the group, and I am the one who tends to initiate a lot of conversation in the group, and I think subconsciously for them it’s easy to target their feelings and project them to me. 

One of the things this friend group is pretty much built on, is we ALL love debate. We have a group chat specifically for it. I can’t even tell you how many gatherings and night conversations were spent in friendly argument/debate. Sure, we all get worked up about our passions, but our passion is what made it so fun. I know for a fact that these friends loved it, because we talked about how much we enjoyed friendly debate with one another all the time. However, one of them (one of the 2 friends) I guess told ‘brother’ “I don’t feel like telling minzor anything anymore because she’s just gonna tell me I’m wrong.” I had noticed this friend becoming distant, and was deeply saddened by this. And I had a talk with my “brother” about it, who I asked honestly if he had noticed me being berating or going to far in these debates. He said no. (He is usually very honest with me). So I was very confused at this sudden change in attitude.

I talk to this friend later, not wanting to reveal that I knew something he had said about me in private, just asked him if things were ok and if he ever needed me to talk, I was there. We spoke briefly, and I started talking about how I was concerned that people seemed upset with me about something, and he assured me that he had no problems with me (or anyone for that matter). Ok, I get people sometimes say things about friends when frustrated with them, so I just let the comment go. Besides, he just assured me everything was good. So why hold onto it? 

But these 2 friends got more and more distant. The other (in state) college friend is hardly active anymore in the chat, but all together pleasant to be around in person. It’s getting to the point where (it seems) when I enter the group chat, the conversations stop. People talk over me at gatherings. Previously friendly “roasts” seem to cut at me deeper. And I honestly believe it’s because they were looking for someone to be angry at because of their situations, and I was the easiest target. 

And I’ve been trying to just not let it get to me. I still go out of my way to try to initiate conversations, usually just ending up with me being left on read. I get people are busy, but I just feel like I don’t matter anymore. 

The thing is, my school is extremely competitive and rigorous, and I can’t afford to be stressed out any more than I am. I’ve debated just telling them I need a break from people for a while, and leaving the group-chats. Im just worried (because I do have anxiety) that maybe this is all in my head, and I will be damaging friendships needlessly. Part of me also feels like, I just took a major life step with my boyfriend and am focusing on school and just can’t afford the distractions. But they’ve been such a big support for me all these years, and I don’t know if I could really connect with people like I have them. We really lucked out on finding each other. But right now, no matter what I choose, I just feel exhausted and stressed.

599,"So I basically need money for therapy.

I am a scholar in my college with half scholarship. My college doesn’t offer allowances or any of that kind, I just basically get a discount for my tuition. I also can’t do side jobs so I can’t really earn for myself. (Mom is out of the picture btw) Now my dad doesn’t pay attention when it comes to details like school rules and such, so he doesn’t have track of what my tuition fee is every year (since it changes yearly).

603,"I just had a heart to heart with my sister (I'm the oldest male with 4 younger sisters, let's call her number 2. I'll refer to the sisters by the order they were born) and I'm worried about her mental health. For a bit of background, she got fired from her last job because of an issue that arose due to her mental health, and has been unemployed for a while. 1 always has an abusive partner and can't hold a job for more than a few months before coming home with her life in boxes, number 3 is setting up her own business and number 4 is still in school.

She says she doesn't see any point in living because she's missed the boat with further education and will never find a job she likes, and can't just get through on the little occasional happy moments. Living at home with the parents is really bad for her mental health, but she thinks that if she moves out she'll end up killing herself and the only thing stopping her doing it now is the guilt of other people finding her. So she won't leave home, but also can't live at home. She doesn't have any friends and feels like she's stuck in retail, and anxiety and depression stop her from leaving the house or taking any risk at all, like moving away or applying for any job there's a less than 100% chance she'll get. She's not happy with how she looks and has never had a partner. 

I've suggested going to uni, even if through clearing process and taking out a student loan to pay for it, if not for improved job prospects then maybe just for a few years of her own space and maybe making some friends in halls. I've suggested joining social clubs, and I've tried to help motivate her with fitness and job applications, but it seems like she can't see or doesn't want to see the options she has, and can't take steps towards doors as her mental health holds her back. She's tried to kill herself before and I caught her self harming the other day, which I thought had ended years ago. 

I love her and she's my closest sibling. I don't know what to do. I feel like she's spiraling and I'm losing her and that she's going to do something stupid. This feels more like a rant that asking for advice, but I don't know what to say to her or how to help her.  I'm moving to another city with my girlfriend in a month and I have nightmares that the day I leave will be the last time I see my sister. 

Has anybody else had siblings or family with similar problems? 

What has helped?

606,"TLDR at the end.

This friend is one of the sweetest people in the world, it is hard for people to not like her, and she can make friends wherever she is. Considering the amount of times I've wanted to punch her dad in his fat throat, she grew up incredibly well.

She got kicked out of her house after standing up to her dad, and basically got disowned. Things were slowly getting better, despite tension and some arising of old behaviors when she spent the year away for college, then again for a well paying summer job. 

Recently, she accepted a year long job in the town where she went to school. When she got offered the job, she basically needed the people she rents from to be there so her dad wouldn't yell at her, and his initial reaction was ""WE'RE not interested"". Quick reminder that this friend is 20, and legally an adult. When her mentor/the homeowner stood up to her dad saying he legally had no say, her dad just asked why they couldn't let her go. She said there was basically a group of people with the look of ""ironic coming from you"", and from her description, she could tell he was struggling to stay civil. She told her family that she accepted the job over the phone. Her mom shouted at her for 10 minutes, and the dad basically disowned her again. 

As if that wasn't enough, she is working one month at her old, seasonal job before it closes. I talked to my parents, and if the situation comes to this, they said she might be able to stay with us for that month. But she needs to get out of that house for good. And that is hard for her, especially because she has siblings. She told me her youngest sister (~9 or 10 years old), would literally pray that she wouldn't get the well paying job or her soon-to-be job so she could come home, she volunteered with youth, and was torn on leaving them, and she does similar things in the town she's currently in. So choosing was hard for her! And I think  her siblings think they need her. She is the most stable adult in that family, and even she isn't the most stable because of cases like these, and other incidents. I dread her month back, because I miss her a lot, but she needs to get away!

One last thing, we took an anti abuse training course to prep for volunteering one summer, and she had to leave early for work. When we got to signs what constitutes abuse, I had to keep myself from looking at her when they discussed emotional abuse. And after that section ended, she had to leave, and we noticed she left rather quickly. So she got the wakeup call that she was abused, but either she forgot about that, or she just feels trapped.

This is one of my best friends. I have been so concerned that I was tempted to write to Dr Phil (I haven't, and I won't, it's not my place to write such a public platform with a story that's not mine), I tried looking for adult protection services, and only saw protection for elders and seniors, but I feel helpless!

I know I can't solve this problem, but I feel like there's got to be more I can do. I don't know what that is. I've reminded her that I'm here for her when she needs to talk, again with my parents considering taking her in for that one month, but I  feel stuck because I don't know what else I can do.

Is there even more I can do? We're both broke 20 year olds, so it feels hard to do anything. And no way in heck can I stand up to her dad! Especially when my older sister is trying to do more to be a role model and mentor to one of this friend's siblings.

TLDR: Adult friend has garbage dad who can't accept not controlling his kid, she's leaving for a year to work, he disowned her for the 2nd time, I need to know if there's anything more I can do than listen and offer her my time and my (parent's) home of she needs it.",31Aug2019,2

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",31Aug2019,0

619,"So here's the story, in 2014 I finally got a girlfriend who I've had a crush on for like 7 years, only to find out in a game of truth or dare (yes childish ik) that my best friend at the time liked her as well (not a sole in school knew either of us liked her) it was chill because i trusted her but then she would kinda get insanely jealous if I talked to girls who were with me in school since the first grade, but she would literally talk to him to a worrying amount, this is were i start to get jealous because IK for a fact that given the chance he would throw me under the biggest bus ever.

After graduation, she turns so cold with me and says some pretty mean stuff. I did mess one thing up which was a big big one where i would lie about going to the hospital everytime she wouldn't talk to me, and yes very childish move but this was the first time I ever felt anything of the sort. Moving along we broke up and a month later my friends tell me they are a thing now or just talk a lot lot more (call it whatever)

So 5 years later, I'm super annoyed at how it ended because I did lie a big lie, but I do still love her like I would meet girls that were amazing, but she would still be number one on my mind.

I think the two aren't a thing anymore or whatever they were but i have absolutely no clue.

623,"Long story, but it’s all relevant. 
Not married but LTR “in laws”. 
 A brief history:
For the last ten years his parents have struggled with...everything. His mother has alcohol dependence which has led her into trouble. It caused violence in the home while her kids(my SO) were young adults. His mom got his dad arrested wrongly accusing him of abuse. Then his dad got really sick, almost died. They lost their family business and all resources. He helped handle both parents when things got out of hand. Then he lost his toddler nephew to cancer which tore the whole family apart. His parents are separated but have IRS troubles and can’t divorce unless his father files bankruptcy. 
Currently: his grandfather bought his father a house and care- so he has the essentials but works odd jobs. His mother is on disability living just outside town and after burning seemingly all her bridges my SO is her only lifeline. 
Recently my SO has had a lot of phone calls from his parents asking for everything from relationship advice( about each other and close family), money, dinner, gasoline, tools, home renovation help, help with grandparents, buy the house so we don’t lose it, watch the 5kids(nieces and nephews, watch the house, feed the dog, check if the garage door is closed, explaining bills, set up the phone, “your mom is crazy because__, your dad is crazy because___ , find a lawyer, buy and bring me a washer and dryer, it goes on and on. We’ve been together 3 years and the list only seems to be growing. through it all SO has never failed them. 
I want to help them so badly. And I want his relationship with his parents to get better. But they treat him like he’s THEIR parent. For the record he feels the same as I do, he wants to be there for them but feels too much responsibility for them as a young man(we’re both in our 20s) and he desperately wants a family who isn’t constantly in strife. 
We are just now in a position of disposable income after years of struggling, but we are also trying to plan for a house, possible children, car repairs, you know, our life. 
My question is, how do we as a unit, approach them with reasonable boundaries about how much we can help, financially and emotionally while still supporting them?
I’m a worried about the guilt and anger he has after seeing them (every visit he gets quiet and pensive) and I don’t want us to be their only support, they don’t have any retirement and I can only imagine they’ll need and expect more from him as that time comes. I told SO I support whatever he wants to do in regard to them but he seems genuinely confused about how much he wants to give. We want to move cities but fear abandoning family that needs us. 
What do we do without being terrible people?
How do we start our lives when people constantly need him?

625,"Long story: 
Okay I need some advice on what y’all think I should do about this very shitty situation!

So last night mine and my husbands room was SO HOT, me being 34 weeks pregnant I’m dying so of course I strip down! it’s like 2 in the morning so husband suggests cracking the door for a minute to let some air flow. So I cover up my goods and close my eyes and sure enough we pass out (even though he was supposed to close it after a little) I end up
Waking up still half asleep forgetting the doors cracked and before I closed my eyes I saw a bright light go throughout our room so that wakes me right up I see the doors STILL cracked and of course my goods are hanging out cause I moved the blanket off in my sleep! So now I am almost positive someone took a picture of me! 

My husband is now just telling me that his brother has had issues with their other brothers girlfriend like grabbing her boob while drunk
One time and says he’s a bit of a weirdo and I NEVER knew this! I don’t want to accuse anyone but I am almost positive that light was a phone flash and when I take a picture from where they could have been you get a perfect view of where we sleep! So should I just be cautious from
Here on out or have my husband question his brother and the other people in the house? I hope at least my face is hidden the only thing they really could have gotten was a boob and some belly but I just feel so violated and don’t know how to go about this!",31Aug2019,0
626,"Here's the situation: This doctor consults for the residents in my facility. He comes in every few days to check on them. Well, I recently asked him for advice on treating my PHN. I had been having severe pain on and off for three years. But right up to the point of talking to him, I had pain non-stop for two solid months. I was feeling depressed. I wanted to die. I felt like I would never be pain free again. I felt like no doctor I had seen understood what to do or how to help me. I live in the US and trying to find help meant hundreds and hundreds of dollars of medical debt in the 6 months I really started to decline. 

Well he asks me more about my symptoms when I pull him aside in my facility. He told me to go with him back to his office and we did and he gave me Ztildo patches and told me to increase my Gabapentin. He listened to me talking about how I had to drive 45 minutes to a low income clinic to see a doctor that didn't seem to understand PHN and that I still had to pay $40 each visit. 

He said that was ridiculous and that he would be happy to treat me free of charge. 

That same night was the night I had been completely pain free in two whole months. I cried. I felt like I could maybe have more moments of no pain. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, my Gabapentin is definitely helping but I gained almost 15 pounds because the meds made me hungry all the time. I asked him for help.

He gave me a better regimen and dosage for my Gabapentin and gave me a prescription for phentermine, 

This week, I've lost 5 pounds, walked 10,000 steps yesterday ( I haven't been able to walk much at all before I change my meds!) and could think clearer than I had in a long time. 

I am just tearing up writing this. I so badly want to do something for him. This doctor has been a blessing to me. 

My dilemma is I don't know if what he's doing (treating me for free) is allowed? I want to thank him so badly. But I also don't want to draw attention to what he's doing to help me. 

My boyfriend who has also been really struggling with seeing me decline is also thrilled about the progress I've made. We're both so so grateful for this loving and compassionate doctor. 

What do you think is a good way to show my appreciation for him? I was thinking a card with a gift card for Amazon or something from myself and my boyfriend. But I don't know how to give it to him without drawing attention. 

I don't go to his clinic for treatment. I just see him in passing and ask to talk to him in my office.

I’m currently getting an AA in business administration, my plan was to get a BA in either business administration or marketing. I haven’t been feeling the same passion I had for it before and I don’t want to continue pursuing a career that doesn’t interest me. 

There’s a few things that really pick my interest but I’m not sure what I should pursue, what major would fit with it, or what career I could actually have. 

My current interests are:
1. Environment. I would love to be able to do something relating to conserving the environment, making eco-friendly alternatives such as different energy sources, or implementing plans on how to make it better such as cleaning oceans, rivers etc. 
2. Animals. Not medical related like a veterinarian, just more of caring for them or protecting them? Like endangered species. 
3. Travel. This is a pretty big one, I would love to have a job that would allow me to travel the world. It doesn’t have to be a job that always consists of travel, I would like a job that I could maybe go on business trips in and just stay there for a few days and go back home. 
4. Language. I am fluent in English and Spanish. I learned Portuguese (although I am far from fluent) and am currently trying to learn Japanese. Language has always come a bit easy for me and I like the idea of being connected to a culture via language. 

To be clear, I suck at math and I especially suck at science. I have looked into many majors in the fields mentioned but most if not all consist of a large amount of math and science classes, plus the job itself involves math and science. Please no one say that if I really like it I will just have to stick it out so I can do something I love, that’s not me and I will definitely quit long before I can graduate. I also wouldn’t have the patience to teach another language, already thought of that. I have thought of working for a cruise line or an airline (not on board or as a flight attendant) just so I can get the benefits of discounted tickets, but unfortunately I have not been able to land a job in either ones. 

My dream job would be to work for National Geographic’s, travel to different countries and take photographs and write articles about the places. However working for them is 1. Extremely hard to do and 2. Only free lance. I have anxiety and would probably die of stress if I had to work free lance and didn’t have a stable income. 

I’m currently in the construction/real estate field. I actually really like it and wouldn’t mind doing this for many years however this field is extremely fragile and any tip of the economy would potentially leave me unemployed. So, anxiety.",31Aug2019,1

I tried to let it go because we are new friends and I know relationships come first (unfortunately), but a couple of things became very apparent and concerning.

\-Her and her boyfriend are completely attached at the hip and together 24/7

\-She told me she is very needy in her relationship

I was really excited, because like I said, we clicked and have a lot in common. She messaged me last night and said her boyfriend was going out of town today so if we wanted to hang out today, that would be great.

This alarmed me, because what it told me was that I was just a filler for when her boyfriend would be busy. Again, I tried to look past it, because she's in a committed relationship and we click, and friendships are about compromise, right?

Soooo, I texted her at about 8pm last night and asked her what time she wanted to hang out today. No answer.

So I waited and never got a response. I texted her again at 2pm today and asked what time she wanted to hang out today.

Two hours later she replied that she ended up going out of town with her boyfriend. She said it so casually that I was absolutely baffled by her lack of social awareness. This sucks on multiple levels:

1. She thought it was okay to bail on our plans without notice.
2. She thought it was okay to bail on our plans without notice for her boyfriend.
3. She thought it was okay to bail on our plans without notice for her boyfriend, which shows me that she is completely inconsiderate of my time and the plans that we specifically made with each other.

I refuse to be a filler friend who is bailed on as soon as her boyfriend wants to hang out. That's rude as fuck. Do I just cut her off as the friendship is so new and this probably won't ever change? I thought about discussing it with her, but honestly if I have to tell someone that a CLEARLY rude action is rude, why would I even waste my time? I haven't been in a situation like this in a while, and it's so outlandish that I'm completely at a loss on how to deal with it.

TL;DR: Friend casually bailed on our plans (with no heads up) for her boyfriend.",31Aug2019,1

642,"We have a stray on out block everyone takes care of. We just all know and love her. She has at least one almost-grown kitten and at least one adult family cat that stay back from humans but will occasionally come eat.

We noticed she has tics right now. Someone else worries she may have previously been underweight due to worms, she is now gaining weight thankfully. 

I am not going to take her off the street and separate her from her life and family. She resists anyone’s efforts at adoption, picking her up, trying to get her inside, and I dont want to leave any kittens abandoned.  Overall she is happy and healthy.

However I would like to help her medically if possible. 

I dont think she would ever let me near her again if I somehow forced her into a carrier and took her on a bus to a vet.  So Im just not sure it is even possible or a good idea...

but I would like to get her spayed, shots, whatever if I could. 

I wonder if I could work out a way to at least treat the ticks without scaring her away from me for good. 

Am I wrong to let her do her own thing, afraid to interfere,  is it best if I just keep feeding, watering and petting her and let go, let her live her life? Or am I morally obligated to try to get her and any other stray adopted? Is there a way to do some things to help without making things worse?

646,"so my best friend, we'll call her A, gets super mad at me for not sugar coating things. idk if this is important but we're both F 16.

the thing is, as well as teenage mood swings and dramatics, we have other issues that sometimes cause a lot of conflict. you see, we were both diagnosed with depression. however i also have severe ocd and anxiety, while her psychiatrist suspects she may have bpd. this means that im an anxious mess all the time, and she can often worsen it with her extreme black and white emotions. in the same way, some of my coping mechanisms like isolating myself can make her feel abandoned and betrayed, causing her to lash out at me or generally be cold towards me.

the reason i mentioned all that is because although our mental illnesses sometimes cause us to clash, for the most part, we bond over our struggles and help each other.

however, sometimes she will text me to comfort her. but when i do, it never seems to be the correct response. for example, tonight she messaged be because she's feeling awful and i tried to help her. but she
says she can't get better and just puts herself down. basically trying to get me to sugar coat things, but i can't do that. im a blunt person and i tell her when she's in the wrong, but that's cos i care. i don't say it rudely, i just don't encourage her to victimize herself, which is what she always does. so here she is being cynical and stubborn, and here i am getting frustrated because im exhausted myself, im also struggling with my own illnesses.

i send her a text ""stop it A, stop sabotaging yourself""

she leaves me on read then a whole later texts ""stop making me feel fucking worse""

what the fuck. im so tired and frustrated with this. i also have problems and i understand what its like to feel hopeless. but when a friend is trying their best to reach out and help, why the fuck would you blame them?? i just don't know whay to do. im so sick of her always playing the victim and never admitting when she's wrong, and getting mad when i try to help. its always ""pity me, give me attention, say im the victim"". i don't know what to do anymore. i dont know what to respond to her message. im tired, please help",31Aug2019,2

652,"Dear Redditors,

I really need some advice 

It's probably best that I start off with a bit of background. My mum has MS which unfortunately is getting worse as time goes on. I moved back in with my mum in 2011 when I graduated from University as I did not want to be too far away should something happen/she need me. At this time, my sister was living at home but shortly moved out to live with her boyfriend. They split up a couple of years after and she moved back in with us, had a breakdown and couldn't work for six+ months... I was paying the mortgage and she obviously wasn't contributing but hey, we're family, we are supposed to help one another out when in need, right? However, we were living in a two bedroom flat with two dogs and there just wasn't enough room for us all. I offered to move out to a room share and agreed that my sister would look after my dog until I could get a place with a garden so she could come live with me. Fast forward a year and the flat was sold and my pup finally came to live with me. I have suffered from depression since I was a teenager (was really bullied in school which resulted in a suicide attempt) and last year was particularly bad... I had a breakdown and was signed off work for 6 weeks, was feeling suicidal and had a plan but didn't go through with it because I knew how much it would hurt my family. I ended up moving back in with my mum and my sister when my dog died suddenly, in most part because I knew my mum needed more help at home. My sister likes to think she does a lot for my mum but in reality, she does nothing. She didn't cook, she didn't clean or clear up, get my mum up in the morning, provide basic care etc. This is something I have been doing since I came back. I'd like to point out that I've been sleeping on a sofa for a year as once again, there isn't enough space. I was paying a small amount in rent whilst looking for a new job. I should also point out that my sister also suffers from depression.

Fast forward to June this year, my sister and I had been arguing a lot... mostly due to the fact that she does nothing. Literally, if I didn't cook, my mum wouldn't eat. If I didn't get her a drink in the morning, she wouldn't have one. If I didn't clean and clear up the house, it wouldn't get done... my mum really isn't capable of doing much bless her, so I try to do what I can to make her life easier. This was obviously causing a lot of tension in the house. This all came to ahead when she started threatening suicide and culminated in her picking up a carving knife, saying she was going to slit her throat, walked out with the knife and drove off. No one knew where she had gone and I was genuinely concerned that in her state of mind, she might do something (I know, I've been there)... so I called the non-emergency medical/police line to get some advice on what to do. They said they would try and contact her but if she didn't answer her phone, there would be nothing they could do. I asked if I should call the police because she had a carving knife with her and they said yes. Before I did this, I spoke to my friend who works as an emergency dispatch operator and she said to absolutely call the police as not only is she suicidal, she is now considered a missing person. I spoke with both my mum and dad who both told me to call the police. So I did. They arrived at our house within minutes (she is impressive as we live in the middle of no where) and took a full statement and had cars out looking for her at the known suicide spots. From what I've managed to gather, four cars surrounded hers and pulled her over. She was arrested and taken to a police station and had to spend the night in a cell. She was also given a minor conviction for possessing an offensive weapon and because of her job, she could have been sacked and never allowed to work in that area again.

Following all of this, she refused to come home because I was there and would only pull up to speak to my mum in the car. She wants nothing more to do with me because I called the police. I genuinely had no idea that she would be arrested... I thought they would take her to a hospital to get help. Around this time, I went down to Cornwall to visit a friend I hadn't seen in nearly ten years and whilst there, I was told the locks would be changed and all my possessions would be thrown out the house. Luckily this didn't't happen, however, when I came home I quickly developed cellulitis in my face and had to be hospitalised for IV antibiotics... I was so so poorly. I ended up going to my mums when I was discharged as I needed some help - I couldn't even get up to make myself a drink. When she came home from work, she completely flipped out - threw my mums walking stick at me, taking the piss out of me, following me around and being generally abusive. My mum tried her best to calm her down but I didn't work so I took to sleeping in the conservatory to avoid her. My sister then proceeded to call the police to get them to remove me from the house (and make me homeless) but they wouldn't as I'm a guest of my mum's. As you can imagine, this made her even angrier. When I had recovered enough from the Cellulitis, I went out on my motorcycle to do some shopping for my mum and ended up having a nasty accident (car pulled out and hit me) and I was taken back to hospital... the only plus side was that I got some morphine haha. Was on crutches for two weeks - nothing broken but some ligament and muscle damage to my knee. Whilst I was recovering I because really unwell and was rushed to hospital via ambulance in the middle of the night was suspected meningitis... luckily it wasn't but had a serious C-Diff infection and was hospitalised AGAIN with IV fluids and IV antibiotics. I have never been so poorly in my life. During all this time, my sister didn't once come and visit me in hospital, didn't bother sending me a text... I felt so so alone and shed a few tears between the vomiting and the machines beeping all night. I am only now getting back to my normal self and am in the process of applying to join the police (its taking ages) but we still aren't talking. It's at the point that I hide from her when her gets home from work so I don't have to risk seeing her and vice versa. I genuinely feel bullied by her and she is regularly vile and derogatory about me to my mum, the anxiety is unreal. Apparently I make her life a nightmare but I don't even interact with her? She has said for years that Im the lucky one for getting to move out but I've given her this opportunity and she won't. I told my mum this and she confronted my sister but she just called me a liar.

I literally don't know what to do. Our living situation is untenable however I am not in a position to move out and even if I did, I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my mum with her. My sister literally goes to work, comes home and goes to her room and you won't see her again until she goes to work again. She emotionally blackmails my mum into trying to get her to either kick me out or move out with her. I've expressed to my mum that I want her to live with me, she needs company and care - neither of which she gets from my sister. She was threatened to kill me and to be honest, the way she has been, I wouldn't put it past her. I currently don't have any transport and we live in the middle of nowhere - there isn't even a bus route. Until I can get into the police, I feel trapped. Ideally, I want us all to leave this property and for me and my mum to get a place and for my sister to get her own but I can't even have a conversation with her about it. I wrote her a three page letter, apologising for what happened to her and that it was my intention but she just ripped it up.

What should I do? What would you do if you were in my position? I need some help :( I'm so sorry for the essay but felt I needed to explain everything in order for you to understand my position. I feel so alone... I have lost my sister and my best friend.",31Aug2019,1

654,"I didn’t really come here for advice, I just wanted to express my story. Also, I should mention I am female.

So when I was around 6 or 7 years old, me and my sister would have a mini sleepover every Saturday, where we would sleep in one another’s rooms for the night. At the time she was around 10 or 11 years old.

Initially, they were fun. We would be able to watch the TV and talk. But then, she started to do things, things I now realise were unacceptable.

She started to kiss me, and not just a little peck as sisters do, she would basically make out with me. Bare in mind I’m only 6-7 years old and I had no clue that this was wrong. Thinking about it now actually disgusts me. This would go on every week.  Now me being young and learning, I thought that this was okay and I started to enjoy it. It felt good but I knew it was something I couldn’t tell other people, which was why I was so confused.

I started looking forward to every Saturday to do this (thinking about this now actually disgusts me but I didn’t know any better). She would initiate it every time. I also remember her being interested whenever something remotely sexual occurred on the tv, and would insist on rewinding it back to watch multiple times with me, acting as if she didn’t see it and wanted to watch it again. I understand at the time she was only 10-11 years old, but she knew exactly what she was doing to me, meanwhile I had no clue what was going on and that it was wrong.

This went on for months. Her basically making out with 6 year old me every Saturday and me letting it happen because I didn’t know it was bad. Until, I started thinking. How uncomfortable it made me feel. How she tried to hide it from our parents. And I wanted it to stop. I even thought I was going to get pregnant, that’s how young I was. I had no clue about sex or periods and thought I could get pregnant from kissing.

So I started to push her away. Telling her to stop. She would try a few more but eventually gave up. I told her I didn’t want to do it anymore and she complained and whined, asking “why” and saying it was fun. But I wasn’t having any of it. I eventually said I wanted to stop the mini sleepovers and after around a month they stopped. Imagine, a 6 year old having to end such antics.

The worst part is I don’t even remember the extent it went to. I blocked these memories out for years but as I got older I realised how wrong it was even if it wasn’t my fault. I do remember once she took my pyjama shirt off, so I was exposed. Then our Dad was coming to say goodnight and she made me hide under the covers. But the fact she did that, scares me Incase anything else happened I don’t remember.

Once I realised what she did to me. I started to resent my sister. I started to treat her like utter shit because of what she did to me. I realised she knew exactly what she was doing and maybe she was going through puberty, so decided to take advantage of me. I started treating her awfully when I was around 13 and it’s 3 years later. Eventually, I forgot why I started being horrible since I was so used to doing it.

She was confused why I was acting the way the way I was, but I will never forget what she did to me. Even if she was young, she had enough conscience to know what she did. She was older than me and was at an age to understand her actions. 

I never told anyone about this. Not even my parents. Honestly, I wish I did.",31Aug2019,1
655,"A few nights ago, my (now) ex-girlfriend and I broke up, which has left me wondering what to do next with my life - we'd been together since I was 15 and now I feel like I'm back to square one.

We just drifted apart - I grew resentful waiting around for her and her change in attitude towards life; she didn't like the person I was turning into, and how I was growing more selfish. We both agree we had our faults, and we came to a joint agreement that it would just be better for the two of us to have a clean break.

We did everything together like travelling, gigs, meals out etc and we devoted a lot of time to our relationship, meaning I didn't invest much time in my own life - making friends, building up a career, or pushing myself further.

I'm now stuck in this mindset where I don't know what to do next with my life - I have a stable job, a degree, a couple of good friends, live at home (always have) and I was waiting for her to finish her degree before we could make the next step in our life.

The next step for us involved saving up enough over the next year whilst she finished university so that we could relocate to somewhere new and exciting, live a lifestyle where we would be surrounded by people our age, in an exciting city and could have a life of our own. But it has been 2 years since she started her degree, the wait was bringing me down family issues came in the mix, and every day since 2017 has felt the same.

Now I'm just looking at the lifestyle I'm currently living and just don't know what to do next to make myself happy, or to make my future seem less.. Bleak?

The job I'm in now doesn't have many opportunities in the kind of work I want to pursue so I don't want to stay there; I am eager to live independently, away from my home town (working/travelling abroad is a huge appeal to me); and part of me just wants to drop everything around me (car, possesions, job etc) and just break free from the monotony.

I live in Scotland so it's irregular to see spiders over an inch in diameter but recently I've seen some whoppers.
Take a (I measured) 2.5 inch in diameter spider crawling about my roof. That's been the biggest of the bunch. 

I've had at least 6 spiders bigger than 1 inch in diameter in my room over the past 2 weeks.

My room is fairly tidy and no food laying about so absaloutey nothing that I can think of to attract them. 
I do have a loft (attic) but there's no gaps in the trapdoor leading up to it so it can't be that and I keep all windows firmly shut. 

I have no idea where these are coming from, seriously, these things are big enough to be exotic pets...

666,"For context, within the last two years I have moved out of my parents’ house with my boyfriend, who is now my fiancé. Up until about a year or so ago I had been going to a Non-Denominational Christian church pretty much every Sunday for my entire life; my mother has been going since she was little as well, brought by my grandmother who also goes to the same church. I know the people there very well, and some of them are even distant relatives of mine.

Recently my parents and siblings have been pressuring me a lot to go to church, and about the fact that I haven’t gone in about a year now. I haven’t gone because how I see things and my belief system has kinda shifted from what it used to be, but my family is really sensitive about the subject and I’m not sure how to tell them my beliefs have changed without ruining my relationship with them.

I wouldn’t be so worried about it if it didn’t come up all the time, like at family events, and weekly family game nights; even at my youngest brother’s birthday party. The preacher of the church I went to was even there, and he was civil to me while everyone else in my family was being really rude about pressuring me; my sister’s best friend’s dad is an elder at the church and came to the party too, and said to me “you’ll go to Hell if you don’t go, hahaha” as a joke.

It was, and always is, so embarrassing and frustrating. I just don’t know how to tell them to stop. It’s not like I don’t believe in it anymore or anything, I’m not atheist, I just hate the pressure going to church puts on me. It’s a weekly commitment to going to a place where I constantly feel judged and don’t really feel like myself, not to mention the ever-looming crushing anxiety that even if I try to be the very best person I can for my entire life, I could still end up in Hell for eternity. I have so many problems with anxiety already and honestly thinking about it does me more harm than good.

 I really like the people there personally and have some great friends I’ve made through it that I haven’t seen in a long time now, but together as a group talking about nothing but God and preaching about things I don’t necessarily agree with anymore is all just too much. I just don’t know how to tell them that without breaking their hearts. 

I know faith is very important to my mother and even more so to my grandmother, and it’s important to my siblings and even my father who has only just started going recently. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with them but it all makes me so uncomfortable and anxious. I don’t know what to do.

I understand that this is very long winded and I apologize but honestly I’ve been struggling with this for a while now and I haven’t been able to come up with a good way to break it to them. I thank and greatly appreciate anyone who is willing to read this all the way through and possibly offer some advice for me.",31Aug2019,1
667,"I recently got a new serving job, I’m an experienced server with 6 years behind me. I know what I’m doing and I’m very good at my job. I’ve been training the past four shifts to be allowed on the floor by myself, I don’t mind training it’s just a part of the process of a new job, however the last two shifts I’ve taken all the tables my trainer and I have received completely by myself from start to finish and all has gone totally well. 
Due to training guidelines I don’t receive any of the tips from these tables so basically I’m doing all the work and the trainer is getting all the tips. My boss has me scheduled for another training shift tomorrow and I’m wondering if it’s inappropriate for me to text him and ask him if I can take tables as a server not a trainee. The trainers I’ve been under have all given him great reviews of me as well, I just don’t know if I should ask him if I can stop training of if I should just suck it up for a little while longer (today I pulled around 150$ that went to the trainer)",31Aug2019,2

671,"Last night my dog ate my food that I left on the table for a bit and my mother was rightfully angry towards her. I expected my mother to yell at her and hit her like normal, but this time she went all out. My mother took off her sandal and slapped my dog to the point where she almost bit my mother. My mother went downstairs and yelled for my dog to come down but obviously she was afraid. My dog peed herself and went around the house in order to get away from my mother.

I ended up giving my dog a bath but while bathing her I realized that it was my fault since I left my food on the table by itself. My mother cleaned the floor downstairs and after that wanted to keep her in the laundry room closet for the whole night even though my dog has issues with confined spaces. I tried arguing with my mother to let her out but she said she was “grounded”. This morning I let her out and cleaned the top floor, but when my mom woke up and saw my dog, she yelled at her to go away and said she didn’t want to see her. She even threatened to hit her if I didn’t get her off the floor and upstairs.

I asked why she couldn’t be downstairs but she didn’t really answer it. She instead said that she can either stay outside all day or stay in my room. My dog’s not an outside dog and it’s pretty hot where I am so I decided to keep her in my room. As soon as I brought her water bowl upstairs, she jumped up and started drinking it immediately when I put it down. What can I do to keep this asshole from being a dick to my dog?",31Aug2019,1

 Eventually I asked her if she wanted to go out and she said yes. Then we stopped taking for a bit and we're just sending pictures (Snapchat) back and forth with no text. I asked again and said ""when were going on our date"" and she said ""Hopefully next week!"" That was on Tuesday. But when I asked her what day worked for her cause she works and I didn't have class all week. She just left me on read on never responded. Now she just keeps sending me pictures and I'm not sure what to do.

673,"I’ve talked to my therapist, my dad, and my sister about this, but I feel I have nowhere else to turn to. I have a terrible past. My parents got a nasty divorce when I was in first grade. My dad moved far away (back to where we originally lived before the divorce) and I was stuck with an emotionally abusive mom, along with my sister. My older brother went with my dad. My mom told me some really vicious things that made me suicidal. For my own safety, my sister and I moved in with our dad who is a very kind man. While I am no longer with my mom and I now live with a nice dad, my older brother is just as bad if not worse. My brother has severe ADD and OCD, plus some other mental health issues we’re not really sure about since he refuses to acknowledge he has them. He didn’t go to college, and has been living with my dad since he was 15. He’s 23 now. He’s an alcoholic, often coming home drunk, threatening to fight my dad, causing huge fights and screaming all the time. Due to his terrible behavior and issues, he’s been fired from over 10 different places he’s worked in the past year and a half. He has a terrible personality, and he only has one close friend who is also an alcoholic with issues. My brother has bullied me for as long as I can remember. I have had a long history of being bullied in school and by my mom, so being bullied at home by my brother makes me hate life even more. My sister and I can’t stand him, my dad can barely tolerate him. I ask my dad all the time why he won’t throw him out, but he always says the same thing. “He’s got mental health issues, he’s got low self-esteem, he’s an alcoholic, he’ll wind up either dead or in jail and I would never be able to live with myself knowing my son is in prison.” I understand where my dad is coming from, but it’s still not fair for me to have such a shitty childhood. I’m a junior in high school, and my brother doesn’t respect me in any way. If I don’t do anything when he bullies me, he does it more. If I defend myself, he laughs and also does it more. I’m at a loss for what to do. I feel like nobody cares about how I feel, I’ve struggled with depression for many many years, and people just seem to brush that off(My sister is always there for me. She’s amazing, I love her). My brother bullied me all the time (especially in front of other people) and my dad, although always defending me first, always uses the excuse for my brother saying “he has low self-esteem.” I also have low self-esteem and also severe depression because of how much I’ve always hated my life situation. And I’ve never said a harsh word to anyone to embarrass them. My sister is now in college and she’s who I could always talk to. But now I’m stuck with this bully of a brother alone and I just have no idea what to do. I don’t want to be a grown man looking back saying I had a shitty life. The point is, my brother causes my dad and I extreme frustration, he exacerbates my problems with depression, and he is just ruining my life. I’m sorry I know this was long, but I felt I just needed to vent somewhere. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",31Aug2019,2

676,"I’m posting this to other sub forums like r/decidingbetter, please lmk if you have other places I should also post this at.

The school year is starting again for my sophomore year as an international student in Taiwan and from what I heard from my upperclassmen is that this semester is the busiest of all 4 years. I really want to try to get into a schedule and have been slowly forcing myself to sleep earlier and wake up earlier the past few days since school starts in a little more over a week.
I’ve always kind of had a messy typical millennial schedule with procrastinating throughout college although I did land a good college in Asia that’s top 50 globally for computer science. Obviously I don’t want to ruin that for myself (despite multiple midlife crisis occurring about changing majors or going back to the US).  Anyhow I want to make the most of it this semester.
My rough schedule so far has 15 credits (15-25 credit requirement per semester) as I might still add or drop courses. All except for one day at 9am, my classes start at 12~ and last about 2-3 hours. I do have on day with 2 classes so I get out around 8pm for that -_-


Some information about me:
I enjoy exercising 2-3 hours a day (2 days of mandatory 4hour practice with my school volleyball team), which I alternate with cardio (volleyball, swimming, basketball, hiking) and going to weight training my entire body.
My meal plan is kind of crappy but enough to help me lose 20lbs in 3 months and am around 18% body fat and hoping to lose more. I’m simply only going to certain restaurants and buying some canned food or protein powder to maybe replenish some things I haven’t gotten to eat that day, while tracking my vitamin, protein, and calories intake each day.
Unfortunately I’m not really your typical computer science nerd which surprises everyone when I tell them my major in person due to my appearance and that I’m sociable and hit up bars and night clubs every once in a while. I’m curious if I have a set schedule that I would base off of variable room with slight margin of errors due to my class times and exercise that if I were to party maybe 3-4 times a semester that it would throw me off a lot or maybe I would crash?

Anyhow, I hope to get at least 8-9 hours of sleep since I am an athlete and of course my schedule can’t be entirely strict since some occasional nights I might have to study more or am socializing with my friends. Please leave any suggestions or rough schedules and tips below. Any advice is appreciated!",31Aug2019,1

685,"My parents had a quasi-arranged marriage, ""lived together"" for till they got divorced earlier this year.

I've always known that my dad was dodgy, but I didn't realise that he was a Certified Grade A selfish freeloading asshole, cream of the crop.

Want to know why I think this? Here's the story. 

When I was about to be born, he forced my mom to quit her well-paid job at the Defence Ministry, took her to his ancestral home and left her there with his family. He took all her money with him, and the in-laws stole her possessions one by one, including her gold jewellery which she couldn't take inside the theatre while giving birth. 

They were mean to her and made her do all the household chores including cooking, cleaning, and even the laundry of the 10+ people house even when she was heavily pregnant, and after she gave birth.

She even ran the family shop while doing everything and taking care of me. My Grandma would check the accounts and not give her even an allowance. She made short-eats in addition to all of the above to pay for her expenses.

She got sick of this and moved to a small four-walled shack that had been built on the plot of land that the Government allocated to my dad. She went there with 100 Maldivian Rufiya (about $10) at the time and she used that to feed me and to make short-eats and snacks which she would sell at a nearby shop.

So, they moved there, and he went to work in a resort. He would send her a third of his salary for all of her (and my) expenses, and with that she kept everything running and helped settle the thousands of Rufiyaas of debt that he had. They expanded the shack into a proper two-bedroom home, and my mom started a successful fish-processing business.

This is where I come in. I was always an easy kid, I never cried, I rarely demanded anything (except for a rather cheap basket when I was 5, which I didn't get because my dad thought ""he will start asking for things"", and the occasional ice-cream for special achievements).

I went to school, studied hard, always got straight A's, even when I was in the first year of Elementary School, (known here as Grade 1). I was the over-achieving introverted nerd who loved reading (I knew the library better than the veteran librarian), and believe me I got bullied for it, not because I was skinny or short (I was the tallest, most muscular kid in class), but because I was usually quite pacifist (unless someone pissed me off, which is incredibly difficult to do).

So, I loved school, I loved my teachers, and I eventually came to like most of my classmates by the time I went to high school. By this time I had a clear vision of what I wanted to achieve in life. I wanted to study Chemistry, and become a college professor, learning, teaching, and researching. This was my Elysium.

I completed my IGCSE's, graduated top of my class, got A*s in all the subjects except Mathematics in which I got an A (which was quite the surprise to everyone), and even a ""Top in the World"" Cambridge Outstanding Learner Award. 

I spoke to my mom and she said that she would try to pay for my college within her means (and I loved her for it). Since no one in my immediate family had attended college before, I researched the process, and it was pretty straightforward, I needed to ace my A'levels. 

Everything was going smoothly until my dad threw a curveball. He always lurked in my life, but he didn't really care about me. He would scream and curse at me if I tried to hangout with him, but he would always spend time and do things with my cousins as if he were their father. He didn't even know that I performed well in school or in basically everything I did (except football), until the year before my IGCSE's.

As I'm not a particularly materialistic person, there are only a few things I asked him for, every single thing well within his means. 
- For a cheap basket when I was 5, he said no. 
- For a computer when I was 13, he said no. 
- Class trip when I was 17, he said no, I was the only person who didn't go. 
- University when I was 19, he said yes, but do you didn't follow through with his promise. 
- To spend time with me, all throughout my childhood. He never did. 

Sure, it hurt, but I didn't care much for it, until he forced me to. During my IGCSE exam season, bragging about how he was going to marry someone else, and my friends related this to me, but I just brushed it off. 

He liquefied all the assets that (mostly my mom) had accumulated (including what she saved for my college expenses) took it all and went to India to marry some Hyderabadi lady. Did I mention that he also rented out the house that we were living in while we were living there? 

To save face, he made up a semi-plausible excuse as to why all this was ""the only way"", and as I was one of the most watched graduates of the year (and his only child, not that he cared the least) enrolled me in a school in Trivandrum. I joined the year that they switched from the usual June exam to the new March exam. No worries, a few months can be made up with some old fashioned hard work and determination. My dad, as you expected, barely gave me and my mom anything, so we moved out and he gave us even less. 

So, my mom and I, we started doing some odd work. I would be in school during the mornings and afternoons, she would do a variety of things, and both of us taught during the evenings, she would teach Religious Studies (in which she was reasonably qualified) to Maldivian students living there, and I would teach science and mathematics. 

Although some of her friends would help from time to time, we were barely afloat. During the most difficult of times, I would sometimes have only enough for a one way trip to school, so I would walk six kilometres home. I also remember walking half a kilometre further because short-eats were one rupee dearer at the shop there.

I was diagnosed with major depressive order in my final year of school. My doctor thought that it was mostly hereditary. I would also have bouts of diarrhea here and there, including a stint at the hospital at the height of exam season.

After all this, I barely passed my A'levels, and my dream of studying Chemistry at college went out the window. No Maldivian college offers pure science courses, and I could never get a scholarship to study abroad with these grades, at least from the Maldives.

So, with my head hung low, I returned to the Maldives, barely got a job that pays peanuts (so did she), and started to live in Male' (the capital) with my maternal family. I barely saved anything. 

My dad returned, promised to pay for my studies, so I quit my job and went abroad with him to realise that it was only a mirage. 

So, I came back, unemployed, applied for more than 40+ jobs, called for 15+ interviews, all but in vain. Who would've thought that a 20 year old with two years of proper work experience, an impeccable work ethic, and who graduated at the top of their class, would struggle to find a job? The job market is extremely challenging for us. The last job I applied to got about a hundred applicants.

Anyways, my maternal family are going their separate ways, and my mom and I will be homeless of we don't find a place to live, and I, a job. 

I am at the my wits' end right now. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO?",31Aug2019,1
686,"Okay so I have worked at a supermarket now for almost 4 years. I am quite comfortable in saying I have always put in 100% to my work there and it has greatly helped with my confidence as I have had to deal with all sorts of customers. About a year ago we had a big change in management where all managers and team leaders who were there when I started had to move on and we got a bunch of new managers. These new managers are not the best and are far from the quality of our old managers and team leaders. 

Recently I was close to applying to a new job which I got an interview for but backed out of with hopes of progressing my career at this supermarket and a few weeks after that it looked hopeful and positive with meeting saying I would get trained on a variety of things  and get help to progress forward. But fast forward around 5 weeks and I have yet to gain any training that i was promised to get within 4 weeks. With my manager constantly avoiding a good reason for not doing so or acting all defensive over the mere thought of me trying to find out when I will get trained acting like I'm trying to force him into something (heck I'm the one going out of my comfort zone to approach him about it). 

Now recently a colleague of mine who I work with we have a specific role where we check dates for products and lower the prices to try sell them off before they expire which is common in all grocery shops. But they missed a product, which everyone who does it including me do quite regularly as there are a variety of reasons as to why this could be, ranging from us making the mistake or another worker putting it out or a customer dumping it somewhere we don't catch. But they got threatened to be disciplined over this, which has not happened before. Now this was a shock to me as they were really upset over this and it made me think if I make this mistake will I be next. I mean we are only human we can't see everything within our time limit. 

Now I know this is a long winded story but my question is should I move on from this job? I have felt comfortable here for so long and only recently have I felt that I am falling out of touch with it. Is this me overreacting over small pieces of protocol?  I don't know where I should look for a job either, I wouldn't want to stay in retail id rather try go for IT job or an office job of some sort. I don't know if they would be interested in me though, I have two college courses completed to do with IT (English College not Uni) and I feel I am one of the better workers at my job. What job should I look for? I am lost.

689,"They have taken my past, present, my ability to look to the future with hope. 

I feel like I slug through everyday. I wake up and do the bare minimum before leaving for work: get dressed, brush teeth, feed dogs. 

I do the bare minimum at work and have used all my sick days. I am constantly worried I’m going to be fired.

I am always tired. I can’t muster the energy to do more than sit on my phone and watch TV. 

My anxiety keeps me awake until 2-5AM, but once I sleep I just want to sleep forever. I can sleep for 15+ hours if I have the opportunity.

My body is physically exhausted. My house is unclean but I can’t clean it. My sex life is nonexistent because I have no libido. 

I dread every social engagement. I may end up having fun, but it drains me until I feel like a ghost of myself. 

I tried to find a therapist and she was bad. She only wanted to do phone sessions ($75 each) though I asked about meeting in person. She told me to buy adult coloring books, “The Happiness Project”, and weirdly latched on to the fact that I told her I bought a bread machine - she would ask me constantly if I made bread to the point that I’d have anxiety and feel pressure to go home and make bread so I could tell her I accomplished the task. She also advised drinking wine to settle myself, but I am teetering on the edge of a drinking problem (which she didn’t know about as we hadn’t discussed anything like that). 

She never sent me a bill and I had to cancel after 3 sessions until I saw an invoice. I couldn’t commit to multiple sessions a month until I saw exact prices. I saw no invoice for 4 months. I texted my therapist and she blocked me without answering (my first text went through blue and was “read”, my next was green and the 1 call I made didn’t go through). I called probably 6-7 different people trying to pay and cut ties; I finally was able to pay and was told my therapist no longer worked at that center. 

I also tried seeing a psychiatrist who charged $150/meeting and wanted to meet twice monthly to check on dosage and how I was doing. I was given Buspirone for my anxiety and Mirtazapine for my insomnia. 

She told me point-blank that she didn’t think I had depression or anxiety and asked me several times if I’d been tested for ADD. 

I had to stop going because it just cost too much and wasn’t going anywhere. 

That was in Feb-May of this year and I just feel defeated. I want to get better but I’m tired and everyday feels like treading water. I’m barely keeping my face above the water. 

Sometimes I wish I would get into a car accident or come down with some illness so I could just be in a hospital for several weeks and rest without guilt. I know that’s ridiculous.

692,"Last night I very stupidly forgot to lock my car before going out. I parked in a parking structure with pretty heavy security. I came back today and noticed that stuff was thrown around in my car, and my backpack with my work laptop was gone. Security came and said they caught the guy in the act and they had my backpack. He got another unlocked car too, but they recovered everything and I got way too lucky. At first, I figured it was some younger person trying to get some extra money, but it turns out it was a vagrant in his 40s who is currently in jail because of other warrants. So I'm having big doubts about pressing charges since I can only imagine an extra felony on his record isn't going to help him. 

On one hand, like I said, it's probably not going to help or deter him.. but on the other, it feels weird to pretty much let someone get away with a crime that I despise and is a big problem in the area. The hassle of pressing charges doesn't matter to me, but whether or not pressing charges is going to help or even worsen things is what I'm confused about. 

What would you guys do? I'm leaning towards not pressing charges because a vagrant in his 40s in Detroit probably has enough problems to deal with",31Aug2019,2
693,"Basically my family runs hard with alcoholism

My sister is 2 years sober so can’t be around my mom, and I don’t want to enable this behavior any longer either.

694,"I'll be starting my last year of my BA course, I'm studying translation. I'm good with languages and learning them, all my life I've been told I'll be translator by everybody around.

I don't mind studying this much but after studying this for a few years I've realized I don't want to work anything related to translation, not my thing. 

I've always been passionate about music, been playing in a lot of bands, I keep learning every day, I play a few instruments and sing and I wanted to be a musician since I was a toddler, well, a very polar opposite comparing to what I do to improve my translating skills and such.

I know that after studies I will have to get any first job, but that unsettles me. My parents are disappointed in me not wanting to be a translator, my partner is sad too since I'm not bad at it, just feeling it's not my thing. I'd rather work as a musician or do anything but translating, but there's no chance I'd get much income in my country. Sadly, I can't leave the course now.

Is it really stupid to not want to force myself do what I dislike? What should I do then?",31Aug2019,2

696,"I'm in a state of slight disbelief right now. I'm not angry. I may be a little sad. But I don't know. I'm just confused.

There's this friend that I've been taking to for a year now. She's great, at least up to the point of this incident. She would listen to me, and help and support me. She was great encouragement for me during my latest year in college.

One of the expectations I have for my friends is that I must be able to trust them. This usually comes in the form of me divulging secrets and private details about me or other things I think are personal/wouldn't want spread. And of course, I return the favor.

During a recent night, I told her a secret regarding a theft that happened at the dorm I lived in last year. Someone took a sign from our floor, and it was a beloved sign to the residents and staff. I told her who it was, because someone else had told me who did it, and the person who had told me about it wasn't concerned if I told other people. It was brought up casually, so I thought I'd oblige her with details, on the usual condition that she not spread it.

The next day I get texts from the RA on our floor last year regarding what I knew about the stolen sign. She had been told what I had told my friend. I told her who I heard it from and the RA promised me that I would not be on trouble.

I confronted my friend about this and asked her if she told her. She admitted she had told her in a casual conversation. Her reason is that it went against her morals, since this was a more serious-ish crime than alcohol and drug use, so she told the RA.

To me, this felt like a breach of trust. However, I do admit that I am partly to blame for spreading the gossip.

My dilemma boils down to this: I feel upset that my friend told someone else something I did not want her to tell others. However, I can empathize with her need to do right by her personal moral code, and that I am at least partially to blame.

Is this whole ordeal my fault for spreading it to her? Did she do wrong by breaking my trust with this?

Should I apologize to her?",31Aug2019,1
698,"Not fishing for sympathy or trying to make myself sound like the most miserable bastard on the face of the Earth, but... The last couple years of my life have been overwhelmingly hard emotionally. On this day 3 years ago, I would've just started my time at a trade school, learning to fix computers. I still cite the year I spent there as the best time of my life. It was the first time I was away from home on my own, and it was the first time I really had friends I talked to face to face regularly, and I formed bonds with them I fear I may never form with anyone again. I would've died for them, no questions asked! I got my first kiss there. I was in my first relationship, rocky as it may have been, but it was what it was. I never had sex there but I came really close once. There was an immediate ejection policy surrounding it and while people got away with it literally everyday, I cared too much about what I was doing with my education to risk it. I really enjoyed and still do to this day, building and fixing computers, and learning everything I could about them. \*cough cough\* PC Master Race. I graduated in June 2017 and went back the following October to take a specialized driving course. (I have Cerebral Palsy, I need hand controls to drive. My legs are the only part of my body my disability has ever affected.) By the end, I'd made out with three women, only one of which I regret. I still talk to only one of them, and we're really good long-distance friends. She was the last girl I kissed. It has been a LONG two years, friends. When I got back home for good, I had to continue with the driving courses, as per the recommendation of my first instructor. I became licensed April of last year under heavy restrictions (No interstate, no night driving, and a 10 mile radius.) I still have these restrictions today. I started looking for a job as soon as I could drive. Interviews came quickly at first, and it was easy to brush off the bad ones. As time went on though, I had put in far more applications than gotten interviews and it became harder not to be disappointed when an interview was less than stellar. Of course, even when I felt they were, I never got a call back. Now, there's next to nothing in my radius left to apply for, and what little there is, comes after months of nothing. It kills me to sit in my room and watch TV everyday. Don't get me wrong, I have friends. Most of them are long-distance, due to meeting them at school, and my only IRL friend is a school teacher. He doesn't have time for anything beyond school when he's teaching. Hanging out, going to punk shows here and there becomes not hanging out. I've fallen out of touch with a lot of those friends from school, and there's a lot of guilt on my shoulders for it, along with a lot of pain. I miss them terribly, but talking to them online feels lifeless and stagnates quickly. In fact, a lot of the things I used to enjoy doing have severely stagnated and are no longer as enjoyable as I once found them. Playing music, writing, video games, the occasional piece of art, they all just don't appeal to me. Most of them make me feel like I'm wasting my time. Porn was the last in a long line of things that gave me an outlet to fade into a dull activity. I feel hopeless most days, and I don't know what to do to pull myself from the funk. I go on walks 2-3 days a week, but it only helps for as long as it lasts, and the issues I have are still waiting for me when I get back... I could really use some solid advice.

TL,DR: My life feels stagnant, things I used to enjoy, I don't. Can't find a job, can't relocate. Lost a lot of dear friends, haven't been romantically involved with anyone in 2 years. Seeking advice.",31Aug2019,2
699,"Ok so first, yes she does know that I have misophonia and I have expressed it to her countless times to no avail.  So I’m gonna put like a list here or whatever about what noise and then I’l type out what I’ve tried 

1. Chews very loud with open mouth, think gum smacking but with all food not just gum 
2. Constantly breathing heavy and loud like she ran a marathon or something
3. This is the one that gets to me the most so, anytime that she moves she ALWAYS does a grunting noise. Every time she turns her head, or scratches her head she does it. If she even CONSIDERS moving she does it. 
3 part 2: at the end of literally every sentence she does the grunt. It doesn’t matter how much or little she says. She does it even just saying something like hi/yes/no etc. and I’m not exaggerating. 99% of the time when she talks she does it. 


Okay so now here’s the problem, she knows about my misophonia and she knows what all my main triggers are. I’ve brought it up to her recently in a round about way by just complaining about what my triggers are but I never told her that she is doing them.

702,"I’m 19 years old and have been through hell with my family. 

In summary 

Sister.  Physical emotional and sexual abuse. (If angry enough would still hit me or throw things at me. Once attempted to throw a tv at me and when she failed hit me and pelted me with remotes. Last incident was early this year. Sexual abuse lasted for five years and ended when I was 13).

Father. Physical abuse emotional neglect. This was up until sixteen.  He once punched through a door to hit me. Hasn’t hit me in years and has apologised profusely. Changed man in that respect. But has failed to protect me from my mother and sister and seems bewildered at the idea I could be in anyway affected still by them.  

Mother. Emotional abuse and general passive aggression. (Still the same but I’m better at sucking up now so she’s nicer. She attempts to understand me with poor outcome). 



The issue for me is that I feel like because they aren’t as crappy to me as they were before I would be an a hole for upping and moving country and not talking to them again. 

Especially because they are well respected by their community people love them and trust them. I genuinely believe that they are better but I can’t trust them again. 

I’m aware that we do not have a healthy relationship by far. But I feel like we’re approaching the normal level of toxicity that exists in parent child relationships. 

so would I be an a hole?",31Aug2019,1
704,"Hi guys, need some advice or confirmation of my own thoughts on an incident. 
I was out the other night at an open mic night, read a bit of my poetry, got a great reaction from the crowd. This one girl (Hannah) came upto me and congratulated me, told me how what I read really touched her, smiled and walked away. This smile was wow by the way! 
Later in the evening I see her again with some other women in another bar. You could tell these other women were lesbian. Eventually Hannah and I talk again, the conversation gets flirty and we get a bit handsy. Again she goes off, toilet or whatever and I head to the bar. The thought pops into my head that maybe she is also a lesbian or maybe just swings both ways. 
One of the other women Hannah was with earlier is standing next to me at the bar. Without wanting to make a fool of myself by trying to pursue Hannah when that may be a lost cause, I asked this other women if she was a lesbian or bisexual. She says she is a lesbian, she likes to lead men on sometimes for fun. I state how that is a shame as she shouldn't do that etc whatever. This woman then offers to play a game of pool with me. I say yes, I loose of course.
Later on Hannah and I happen to be outside in the smoking area and get chatting again. The beauty of this girl makes me loose all thought of what her friend said earlier, alcohol may have also helped a little. Her friend from earlier and another come upto us and drag her away because something funny just happened and they really needed to tell her. 
Last orders are called and everyone starts to leave the bar. I get outside, light up a smoke and contemplate the journey home. Who comes upto me asking for a cigarette, Hannah. Again it gets flirty, we get close, I ask for her number. Bam! The lesbians are back, but this time more of them. They drag Hannah away down the road quick sharp stating they have to get a taxi home blah blah bullshit. 
I will be honest with you I was not that bothered. I came to the conclusion that she was just leading me on for fun and she was a lesbian and I had no chance.
Now it's been a few days since this incident I have been looking back at it and I have been thinking, was Hannah being prevented from hooking up with me, a man, by these lesbian women friends? Was she not allowed to leave the cult of lesbian? Is there a conspiracy going on? Has anyone else had this experience?",31Aug2019,2
705,"So I moved back to my hometown recently and moved in with my dad and step mom. They’re letting me stay with them temporarily until I can’t find my own place. I had a part time job. I hated it, but I sucked it up because money is money. I found a full time job and wanted to quit my part time job, but my dad insisted that I keep my part time job to help with bills even though I would only be working there  one day a week and only gettin 8 hours a week. So I quit my part time job and they both still think I’m going to work there but I’m really just driving around wasting time.

707,"I love my dog more than anyone else in the world. She’s a terrier mix I got as a rescue about four years ago. I live alone so she’s my only company. I talk to her literally all day, we run in the mornings and walk in the evenings. 

I’m asking for advice because I’m really struggling. She’s extremely reactive, and I live in an apartment (which I don’t see changing anytime soon) in a city and we’re getting to the point where I can hardly take her outside without her barking and lunging and something or someone. I’m terrified she’s going to harass one of my apartment neighbors. She’s already scared a few of them when I couldn’t get her under control fast enough. I run a lot and want to run with her but she’s so crazy that it’s difficult to take her anywhere. 

We’ve been in reactive dog classes and I’m trying so hard to train her, but I feel like I’m failing her. I work long hours so it’s challenging to get her exercise, let alone train her, but I try to train her every day if I can. I just feel like we’re getting absolutely nowhere, and I’m wondering if after four years it’s time for me to accept that I’m not going to be able to give her the life she needs. I love her so much, so I can’t think about rehoming her without sobbing. But I’ve had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety, and while I got her to help with that, she makes it so much worse. I worry we’re becoming agoraphobes. 

Does anyone have any advice for exercise, training we haven’t tried, etc? I started using a clicker and that’s helping. I know about counter conditioning and we’ve have a whole handbook from a trainer. It’s just difficult because if we’re outside she is always tense and it’s challenging to get her attention at all. And I know I should be exercising her before we train but it’s almost impossible to tire her out. We run a few miles and an hour later she’s back to being crazy.

711,"So I work for a well known coffee chain in my country (if you're really curious you can check post history but it's not totally relevant) and I have been here since May. I am registered for my first year of college starting next week. I've been heavily debating leaving my job to focus more on school but I'm not sure if I should. I'll outline more details below. 

My job has a history of being extremely unorganized and understaffed. I've been working basically 6 days a week my whole summer. My bank account appreciates that, but not so much the rest of my body. My manager also seems to conviently forget everyone's availability when she makes the schedule, as well as booking people for every minute they don't request off. I have shifts before and after all my classes next week and I don't know exactly how I'm going to manage it. Plus the job is pretty grueling to be honest, I'm always so beat afterwards.

Another reason I'm thinking of quitting is because my boyfriend (who I live with) is in the military. We already knew he was going to be gone for a month around November. But he was just told he may be sent away on the 16th this month for 5 weeks. We just got a new puppy, and I'm worried that he's going to be alone too much if I'm at work and school constantly. 

I know this seems obvious, but there are some reasons I feel like I should stay. I never gave my manager a set amount of hours I want to work, so that could be why she's taking advantage and I feel like I should have that conversation before I quit. I also don't have many friends and I'm going into college as a mature student, and my coworkers are the closest I have at the moment. With my savings and student loan I have enough to last me for a bit, but I'm also worried about income to a lesser degree. I also have a pretty bad complex about failure that's what this feels like.

Now, I am 23 with 3 jobs. Full time at this job, part time at walmart, and contract work for a tech company. I wanted to keep my job at Walmart for the discount and because it's the only job I've managed to hold for close to a year (lived in an area with no jobs where companies were quick to replace people because unemployment was like 20%, recently moved to a bigger city).

He's been battling Alzheimer's for a while now, and we learned today that he's in hospice care and might not live much longer

My parents are the only ones I've told about my childhood. My dad grew up close in age to him and they spent almost all of their time together in their youth; so my dad loves him like a dear brother and refuses to believe his uncle molested me. He says I imagined what happened. As for the recent incidents, everyone in our family excused it based on the fact that he has dementia and ""doesn't really know what he's doing"". My mom, however, believes me and actively hates him. The rest of my family (both sides) absolutely adores him and have been calling us almost 24/7 asking for updates about his health

But on the other hand, I can't help but feel angry and resentful that my father doesn't want to acknowledge what happened and still loves the man who destroyed my childhood

He moved up here but doesn't have any family or friends up here, he just goes to work during night shift at the local casino doing janitorial stuff and the rest of the time he just spends doing stuff with my mom.

He works night shift so he takes naps during the day and gets up to go to work at 10pm. He told my mom he was going upstairs to take his nap, but my mom kept hearing him moving around upstairs which is very unusual for him. Eventually she decided to go up and see what he was doing. 
When she got up there he was walking around with the remote in his hand. She asked what he was doing and he just said he was trying to find something to put on TV but couldn't see from far away, she said ok. She sat next to him on the bed and noticed that his eyes kept fluttering, he said he had a headache. But he continued to act fidgety. She looked down and saw that his foot was bloody and when he went to clean it up she looked next to the bed and found an emptied syringe in his pants. 
She started questioning him but he was already high so he was stupidly arguing with her. My mom ended up just leaving for a few hours.

My mom found the syringe, but didn't see anything inside it so she doesn't know what he did. He said that someone from his motorcycle club gave it to him to try, but the people he's referring to are about 3 states away. He said they sent it to him to try, but obviously we don't believe that. I think he got it from someone he works with, our town is pretty drug infested. He said that was the first time he's done it and my mom does kind of believe it because he's been showing no signs of regular use and they're always together.

724,"For about 18 months I would abuse something called the “dab pen” , basically a weed vape. I live in an illegal state so that means the ‘cartridges’ are filled with things that the user is not 100% sure of. There could have been added pesticides and other dangerous chemicals. 

I had the mindset of “whatever got me high” which turned out to be my biggest regret. I quit due to my lungs physically feeling like they would hurt after deep breaths. Scared me enough to drop it completely. 

As time went on (2 months), I decided to try real marijuana. Not the dab pen. My ideal situation was to use maybe 2-3 a month at most; to use it when it would appropriately fit in. 

After my first smoke, my lungs still felt a little odd. Not painful, but they just did not feel 100% perfect. 

Since this kind of scared me again, I want to ask my parents if I can “get my lungs checked” by a doctor. I’m a little worried that my lungs are seriously damaged and if I continue to use they will worsen. 

My question - is it appropriate to ask? My parents understand I have used before so it’s no surprise to them.

TLDR; Abused dab pen for a year and a half. Picked up smoking weed, lungs felt off, want to ask parents for permission to see a doctor.",31Aug2019,1

As I was trying to find suitable medicine in the house through intestinal cramps and nausea, I remembered that my parents would have known what to do. What am I even going to do without my parents? 

Today I found photos of me and my best friend from 5 years ago. We were always together at school and had common extracurriculars. We were inseparable. But now we will be hundreds of miles away from each other and knowing that she won’t be there anymore is so, so upsetting. She’s flying away on Thursday. It feels unreal. 

Starting anew at a place 2400 kilometers away from home scares me so much and I can’t deal with being separated from the people who have been there for me for so long. It was my own choice to go to college abroad and I was very chill with it but I guess the emotional impact hit me a little too late.

736,"China is flooding every state in America with droves of fentanyl. I don't know if this is coming from the dark web, but it would not surprise me. I also don't know if China's government is peddling it here on purpose so we pay them back our debt that we have royally screwed them on for a long time. What is it with Americans and wanting free money they have to pay back. So 200,000 people have overdosed on opiates since 2016, I'm sure that number is actually a lot higher now, but that is an insane number of people that are dying to something that not only is destroying them, it is destroying entire families. Where some families all use together, even kids are subjected to the extremely graphic scene of mom or dad falling out in front of them and not being responsive for 20 mins while they struggle to take a breath and stay alive, or worse they turn purple, seize up and they overdose because the heroin was laced with fentanyl, that fentanyl can be exponentially stronger than the tolerance even a heavy addict has.  Then the kids are left horrified having no idea why they lost there parents and are put into foster care where their only memories of how to live were taught by watching mom and dad being addicts and in some cases cause them to be very awful parents. 

Either through wanting to get high, or numb the physical or emotional pain - doesn't matter why you're using, anyone can be a victim to this deathly addiction.  We need to stop blaming the user and help them.  If we don't stop them, in 20 years a lot of your kids will be addicted in some form.  I have been on opiates for a lot of my life. I've seen the devastation its caused in every city I've been to in the last 10 years but this is the worst it's ever been, and we need to do something about it. I'm posting to find answers and make a plan to move forward to build treatment centers across America, possibly funded by perdue (they really should but I doubt they would) ... then have licensed practitioners assigned to help anyone come in and help them through the withdrawal process easier and get some support to get their lives rebuilt. I know we do have some services available to get clean with varying degrees of success. I would love to find a way to give them enough structure and desire to beat the addiction and a new path that they can get excited about and put the addiction behind them because they now have a structured fulfilling life that can replace the drugs.  Most of us that have gone through years of daily opiate use, we have destroyed the trust of everyone around us, beat our own relationships with our SOs in ways that haven't ever happened in this country before.  Trump isn't doing anything to make America great.  Its falling apart by drugs being brought in and killing us.  That wall won't stop it.  We need to fight the addiction to stop the need and hopefully get it to dry up.

I propose something that starts to help end this faster, because fentanyl is flooding in. I do wonder if it's the Chinese government secretly using a very good weapon to desimate our nation. Could just be Chinese gangs. I am unsure but I do know we need to take some responsibility for our own actions in not stopping when we know we should. It's extremely hard to quit a heavy addiction of any drug. There's places that have let people come to rehab clinics to get clean and they secretly after a few days of them being there, have a drug dealer ask them if they want to get some and of course they won't say no, they feel terrible being in heavy day 2 withdrawls and saying now to that when you feel awful is impossible.  I promise.  So their urine is tested and on day 3 they fail and they are forced to stay longer which brings them even more money from addicts who initially made a choice to do this, and then greed takes their choice to get clean away. That breaks my heart and I'll never allow that sort of thing to happen in any rehab center I'm part of.

I need ideas to make this work, this will take a lot of money and a lot of effort but if we dont, the future of America will be a very different place.   structured home where everyone has their own rooms and security is keeping people honest. Give them some things to reduce the intense pains that is such a huge part of why people can't quit. You hurt a lot everywhere, and you'll do anything to stop the war that's happening in you. Then rinse repeat. Let's make it super easy and not something they fear. Get them a few gabapentin, plus clonidine, maybe some sort of sedative to calm them. I'm in Oregon so if they want weed they can have it but there will be rules and structure. 

I would love some ideas to how to fund this idea and push it to other states and cities that need it yesterday. Provide services to anyone of any race any color any background. We have to stop this and we have to make everyone see what is happening and get it to end. 

We could build a system where our clients can work through structured learning centers like Khan Academy or some structured online classes where they feel like their lives are going in a better direction. These services would be free to anyone anytime anywhere for free, and we could have teachers helping them to continue to succeed. Even higher education could be provided for people who are at that point and could start to take on a structured education that would actually be good for them and be something they really enjoy to rebuild our own economy that has been torn apart by so many people unable to work because they are out chasing something that will most likely eventually kill them but at the very least destroy everyone around them and push people to be dealers instead of becoming actually useful members of society. Let's slow it down! We can provide counseling and give them raw facts of how many people are dying for nothing. Give them something to live for because if you don't, they'll go back to the one thing they've been living for for however long it's taken hold of them. This service should be able to provide a way for families and couples to mend from the chaos that it caused in their relationship. Teach them that drugs cause you to not be the person that you were before the drugs took everything and turned you both into very different people, where you made choices and destroyed trust and the thing you actually had a desire for originally can start to heal. 

Maybe crowd funding would work to initially start enough capital to build treatment centers in areas that need it the most. Government assistance, businesses could donate to help their own communitiesp. Maybe have 5 donations a month at each location from local businesses that provide full support for any service to anyone that has no money or insurance. I know that in Oregon you can get OHP if you have low to no income. That's great, that does support addiction and counseling. So I hope they would support this. Some people may not have that, but we may be able to give them it if they apply for it. Should be absolutley no reason to deny them, we need to fix our cities and there's a lot of personal responsibility in this. But people are dying in droves and our cities are becoming death traps, and we are doing nothing about actually stopping it right now. Please help me figure out how to move forward. I'm very passionate about this, it destroyed my life for a long time, and I'm stepping up to take responsibility for my own choices, and I want to make this easier for people because no-one did that for me. I rode this train so hard and damaged so much that I really don't know how I survived. But maybe this is why. It's time to make amends. Please help me figure out a way to fund this and build it in a way that has extremely high chances the addict can break free by getting the day they arrive. We will do a good enough job, using whatever pharmaceuticals that are helpful with the withdrawals and make it easier on them. Keep the cravings at bay, give them healthy ways to cope and change their normal patterns of thinking to positive things.  This is a very doable thing and if we don't stop this faster, we will lose.   Perdue gave me great pain relief for a long time but none told me that 3 years after I started I would feel my pain come back sooner and sharper as tolerance builds and over time it's all I chased and my life was empty. I took the right amount of pills and some amount of pain relief for me in the beginning, not abusing. Then tolerance and time played their game and I had to get more to feel enough pain relief and eventually half my script was burned through in a very short amount of time. I changed myself by choosing to help others.  It's time to take our lives back and help each other get out of this, if we are really Americans that love this country, love the people around you that need help desperately. We need to fight this! Lets do something that matters, it will only make our country better by helping addicts get out of the loop. Find good pain relief options for chronic pain patients that wont lead them down this road and actually fix a problem that we have blamed the addicts for for too long. If you've never been a junky dont tell me that it's easy they should just stop. You have no idea the depths you will go to not feel that pain and it traps you, and many are starting to see that and want to actually help. Thank you!",31Aug2019,0
737,"Im 17 and my time is running out before I need to have my entire act together or I might end up homeless. I’m not going to college most likely unless I find a major that interests me soon; even if I did I wouldn’t have a home over any of the holiday and seasonal breaks. In June 2020 I graduate and then turn 18 a month later so are there any jobs that I could go apply for right out of high school that allow me to work many hours for at least 14.50-15 an hour? I wanna work 60-70 hours a week if possible. I live in New Hampshire and come from a rough background, I haven’t lived with my mom since 16 and haven’t talked to my dad really in years. I take care of myself mostly, I rent a room and am just hoping for the best. This room thing is only until 18 though, so I really need to find a place soon. Thanks everyone",31Aug2019,2
738,"So I'm currently 17. I believe I've messed up quite a bit with my friends, parents, school choices. I currently work 15-20hrs a week and take all my courses at a community college instead of high school. I have around $3k saved up but I'll likely have $6-7k by the time I turn 18.

Long story short, I really made some bad relationship choices in the past few years. I love the time I spend away from my family and most friends. I look forward to leaving for work and school. Ever since I confessed my past drug use to my parents, it's been very stressful to attempt to leave the house to hang out with old friends who made me feel comfortable. I don't have my own place and my parents keep track of every move I make.

For the past few weeks, I've been daydreaming about buying a plane ticket to the Netherlands or another European country and having a fresh start there. Today, the dreaming is shared with a few other friends who are interested in getting a fresh start.

So far, the plan is to buy plane tickets 3 months in advance, once we all are 18 ($500 each). Throughout that time, we sell our valuable assets and save up atleast $5k each. Start learning Dutch (if needed). Work out a cheap apartment (none of us mind sleeping on the floor in a small place). And then, when the day comes, we'll get our birth certificate/passport and everything we need, clothes, etc. Write notes to family, friends, bosses, etc. And take off.

20k split among 4 people living together should be enough to last us around 5-6 months, right? That should be plenty of time to search for jobs and have enough left to abort and move back, right?

We all want to pursue school and work full time professional jobs and we will keep living frugally while doing school and work (I have experience doing this already) until we get real jobs.

So right now I'd like some input. If I'm gonna carry out this plan with my friends, what should we look out for? Are we being too naive? And are we safe with the amount we're saving up? I trust that my friends are just as motivated as me. We are all hardworking people with a dream to get a fresh start.",31Aug2019,5
739,"My current problems as I see them:

Lack of discipline such as keeping a basic daily routine (get up at X:00, run at X:00, work, then lunch, then back to work, then get home at X:00, then read at X:00, and so on...).

My home is never routinely kept clean. I clean sporadically.

Not looking after myself physically the past month. The past three weeks have seen me not go to the gym even once, and I used to regularly since March. 

Romantic inexperience. I am very shy, very insecure about my body and my past and make self-deprecating jokes too often. Even I am disgusted by my whininess? I've only had one girlfriend, and she was Catholic, so I never got my virginity out of the way. I learned to try and please her in every other way I could, but still, I am very unsatisfied with that aspect of my life. 

Some friends hang out partially because of pity and I can tell. Others think I'm wonderful. I don't know which it is. 

I can't get over the bad and abusive things that were done to me in the past by my parents and friends from high school and college, nor can I get over the bad things I have done to others. I'm depressed, anxious, and stressed most of the time. I feel like I'm a real piece of shit.

I always complain about my problems, but I'm too scared to do anything about them. I've been that way my whole life and I hate myself for it. I need to stop, badly. 

I'm a little socially clueless, and some people seem to regard me as weak for it.",31Aug2019,1
741,"I don't have any friends, and I haven't for some time. I would like to improve my dismal social life, and I think a contributing factor would be to alter the way I act around people, to make them feel more welcomed.

Over the course of my life, I haven't done particularly well obeying social conventions and norms. I'm on the autism spectrum and have slightly debilitating social anxiety. I tend to speak in monotone and have a bad case of RBF. My posture is rigid and my pace is brisk. Not one of my muscles is ever relaxed. I remember people in high school saying they were intimidated by me, to my surprise (It was ME who was afraid of everyone else!) and that I looked like ""I wanted to kill them"". 

I don't know what it is I should do about my behavior. I've heard, often, that smiling is good -- but my fake smile is so stupid-looking and forced that I genuinely prefer not to do it. Perhaps I just need to loosen up a bit.",31Aug2019,1
742,"I’ll try to keep this concise, as I’m a repeat offender of getting off topic. Anyway, for the story’s sake I’ll call him Bryan. I met Bryan freshman year in high school. He was the new kid, straight from NC going to a brand new school in FL. Didn’t know very many people of course, but he had such bright personality and everything about him drew me in immediately. I got this feeling that I absolutely had to know him and experience him and have him in my life or I would spend the rest of it wondering why I never got to know him. I called this epiphany/phenomenon a “friend crush.” 

In time, my awkward jokes and conversational tactics won him over and we became great friends. We spoke everyday, always sat with each other in school, had the same friend group, always went out to eat or go party or whatever the case, we just experienced a lot together. Heard about his good days and bad days and flings, and girlfriends, the whole nine yards. I never thought about him as more than just a friend but I couldn’t ignore that he was different. I felt almost responsible for him and nurturing towards him and I just want him to be happy, as cliche as that sounds. 

Towards the end of senior year, he completely stopped talking to me. I mean absolutely cut me off. I did not exist to him anymore. Of course, having the same friends, this not only made our friend dynamic a little awkward but I was absolutely completely torn. I hate to get deep but I can’t even begin to explain the hurt and confusion I felt. I had no idea what I had done to him to make him feel this was necessary but I was willing to do anything to change his mind. I spoke to him once about it, I asked him why he pushed me out and all he said was “We just don’t really talk anymore.” 

He kept this up for 3 months, but to me it felt like forever. I was sad, but I got over it. I was doing really well, I hadn’t gotten any closure but I took the whole thing as a learning experience and it taught me a lot. I felt stronger, sure of myself. That is until late July, when I got a message from him. 

Mind you, this was the first time I had any sort of communication with him since he cut ties with me. I was so confused. Upon just seeing the notification, my stomach dropped to my asshole. My heart felt like it was going a mile a minute. He sent “I was taking Tony home from work the other day and he lives really close to you so naturally we drove by your house. Made me realize how long it’s been since we’ve talked and I wanted to wait until the right time but I never knew what to say to you so here’s me trying to talk to you.” 

Part of me was angry and confused: why now? What changed that made you want to talk to me again? But the other half of me had already forgiven him. I missed him. I was questioning if I missed him more than I could put up my strong front. Truth is, he has always been my soft spot. And he knows that. 

Since that message, we had been talking everyday, like old times. The only thing that was different was that he had a girlfriend. But I didn’t mind at all, in fact I know her personally and she’s a sweet girl. I was just glad things were back to normal. Until at one point when Bryan and I were talking about the dumbest shit, but those conversations with him are my favorite, admittedly. He asked me about my virginity because it was something I had expressed to him in high school that bothered me a little. Just the classic “I’m still a virgin and all my friends aren’t, I can’t relate.” I told him that I indeed was still a virgin, but I was in no rush to lose it. I am not the relationship type, and certainly wasn’t looking for one at the time. 

Maybe 3 days after we started talking again, he called me and told me he broke up with his girlfriend. I was shocked. Everything between them was seemingly going so well! He explained that he wasn’t happy in the relationship and lost feelings. I felt terrible for his ex, because I’ve been in her position before and it’s terrible. Part of me felt guilty. In the back of my head I had hoped that he didn’t break up with her because he reintroduced me to his life. Mind you, it felt that the virginity topic was looming so we came to a conclusion. 

Here was the deal: we both agreed we were comfortable with having sex with each other because we’re best friends, right? And I wouldn’t be a virgin anymore, so essentially killing two birds with one stone. Perfect! What could possibly go wrong?

Long story short, we had sex and it felt fine, normal. My genuine only concern was after the matter. I was scared he would treat me differently or leave me again or get cold feet. It’s been about a week and surely enough, he’s done just that. We don’t talk like we used to or really hang out anymore, it’s different. It feels different now and I hate it. I really don’t even know if you could consider what I feel towards him feelings or maybe just emotional attachment, which is half the reason I’m so conflicted. Help.",31Aug2019,1

I have dreams of being my own boss while also improving other people or our environment in some way, it's so frustrating because I can see where I limit myself but still do it.

744,"I live in Austin. My apartment management has repeatedly treated neighboring units with methylene chloride (MC), a toxic chemical. Since we have shared ventilation between units, this has frequently resulted in toxic MC vapor wafting over into my apartment at levels that are over 30 times higher than what is safe to inhale over the course of a day. This in turn has forced me to vacate my unit and live elsewhere in hotels or elsewhere on multiple occasions. Since I do a work-from-home job and am not allowed to work from hotels, this has cost me many hundreds of dollars in lost income.

I thought that she had mixed her up with another family member and was just confused as my Grandma had fostered a lot of kids over the years, so I laughed it off.

She said it like it wouldn’t matter to me that the people around me went from family I had never met to strangers I had no good reason to be around. I haven’t grown up particularly close to either sides of my family, especially this side who live on another continent, so it really hurt knowing that my uncles and cousins who I had spent fleeting, but precious time with were actually in no way related to me.

754,"5 years ago I decided to move to San Antonio, TX with my mom and I adapted to living in the city. I eventually come to love the feeling of being in a large place where nobody knew me. It felt liberating. Now, in the present day time I had the idea of moving back to a small town in Illinois thinking it would be beneficial.  I can now see that isn't true. I cant go out in public without being recognized and without the creeping fear of judgement. I literally can't breathe in this small town. 

Now I'm trying to find a good excuse to give my family so that I may leave back to San Antonio where my mom lives. 

So, what's the best way to tell my family I want to go back to San Antonio?",31Aug2019,3
755,"A bit of a weird circumstance, but I'm being honest here.

I'm a junior in high school, and through a few incidents during freshman year most people in my school know I have a foot fetish. I used to be rather impulsive regarding this, but over the past year or so I've learned to control myself. However, every couple of days I'll still get called out for it - someone screaming ""feet"" at me, asking to suck my toes, et cetera. I don't really feel like reporting this since I admittedly kinda deserve it and it doesn't cause me much harm, but what I am looking for is some comebacks or quips to use when this occurs, that don't make me seem even creepier and that I can use instead of just becoming embarrassed. Any suggestions?",31Aug2019,1

757,"I’m 22F. I’ve been growing my hair out for months and it was above my shoulders (I had a pixie cut for years) and I went to get it cut today since it’s incredibly thick. I asked the hairdresser to just trim it and keep the same style (longer in the front, shorter in the back) and she completely butchered it. I have a SHORT pixie and pretty much all of my hair is gone. I don’t know what to do... I’m contemplating getting a wig or hair extensions but idk how any of that works. I’m so upset, I feel so terrible about myself I cried the whole way home.",31Aug2019,1
758,"I don't know if this is a type of condition or if I'm just a classic Grammar Nazi, but I think I have a problem. I physically struggle when someone makes a grammatical error and it drives me round the bend, and them round the bend after I correct them. Obviously, I'm fully aware that I do it, and I'm aware that it annoys people. It's just some phrases or misuse of words such as ""what was"" instead of ""which was"", or ""your"" instead of ""you're"" drive me absolutely insane. I've actually gotten so bad, I've lost some friends by doing this. Any advice?",31Aug2019,2
759,"So I’ve never really asked for help because I always thought nobody’s supposed to help you with this kind of stuff. Especially the fact that I’m pretty young. And my mother told me I’ve looked for these problems.....So for the past 5 years I’ve been bleeding from my rectum (I know why now) and I will probably need surgery in the upcoming weeks. 

My second surgery stems from a broken nose that’s caused me many breathing problems since it broke 5 years ago. I think it caused my erythema. It feel like I’ve had a collapsed lung for years now. 5 seems to be my lucky number eh? 

Since my mother told me not to get any health care until i can afford it, i didn’t. She also told me it would all be very expensive. So the past 2 years i worked in construction in terrible health causally bleeding and out of breath. I always felt fatigued and never really gave it much attention. 

After i saved up enough to pay for everything my mother still told me to wait until she signed me up. I eventually ran out of money earlier this year and after looking like death she unwillingly signed me up to the cheapest hmo (30$ monthly).

Now that I’ve had both surgeries scheduled she persists I have job, which none have hired me because of my doctor scheduling. She’s threatening to stop paying because I don’t have a job. She told me not to tell the employer about the doctor scheduling until the day before the appointment. But how can I not tell them I cant work for 1 day my first week because I have a doctors appointment. It’s not like doctors have open schedules like that. At least not the doctors I see. Plus jobs won’t tell me they’re not hiring me for any specific reasons. They just tell me they’re interested but not at this time. 

How do I keep a job in this condition? I don’t live at home because my step sisters constantly bully me and call the cops on me. I never get arrested because I start video recording them, so I can show the officers. The step sisters end up telling their father a twisted story so he just gets angry and doesn’t care about my side of the story or the video evidence. Not only that he tells some of his followers those same lies, so i get dirty looks all around. My mother tends to believe them too. I’m not allowed anywhere near “their” house. I was never welcomed in the first place. 

My step father is a pastor at a local church. My mother organizes fundraisers, funerals, etc. for the church. They’re well off and i don’t receive anything a month. I’m threatened with homelessness, &amp; no health care  everyday. I know it seems like I’m victimizing myself but I feel like i really have no options. I don’t have reliable transportation, due to unpaid fines. Im constantly treated like a black sheep. What should I do? ELI5 

Any advice helps. Thank you. 

Pretty sure there are errors everywhere, just bare with me.",31Aug2019,1
760,"I’m ( 21 F) staying in an Airbnb in flushing queens for the next three months. I have an internship in New York starting Tuesday and had to relocate quickly. Yesterday, I checked in and the hosts were extremely nice. There was a language barrier though because they don’t speak any English and it was fun to communicate through charades and I was really looking forward to my stay here. However, last night I went to the bathroom and when I turned the light on there was a huge cockroach infestation in the sink and along the walls. I contacted airbnb in the morning, not sure how to handle it and sent a message to my host. However, I did find another suitable living situation today- that I might like better. Is there anyway I can cancel my Airbnb and be refunded with out loosing my first month ‘rent’ in their cancellation policy? I wasn’t planning on roaches and I know it is not the hosts fault but this place might not be the best fit. I would hate to upset them but I’m going to be living here for 3 months by myself- and it’s already a hard transition.",31Aug2019,2
761,"Throwaway because this is a fucking weird question to put on my main.

So I’m in high school, and I was talking to my dad about how the freshmen girls were obnoxious, and he told me that they were beautiful. Does that count as pedophilia?",31Aug2019,1
762,"I want to take in a cat from the shelter that I have worked at for a year. 

The little girl is very meek and despite her fear of humans doesn't scratch me, simply pushes my finger away. She is a sweety) I try not to get in her way, simply be in the same space and wait for her to be calm enough not to run out of the room.

I really love her, but I don't really want to go in completely blind. The people there explained a bit on how to take care of her and what to so that a shelter cat can feel at home, but she is a special case.

She doesn't have her left eye(possibly abuse or a fight) and her right eye sees worse than most cats, so that is probably why she is so scared. She was also a bit feral in the beginning. They can't even take a picture of her so nobody else knows about her but me and the other workers. Any advice on how to socialize her and make her a happy kitty?",31Aug2019,1
764,"5 years ago my crush liked me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore

766,"This really cute asian girl I’m talking to who I want to hang out with/be with and get to know is makin it impossible for me 
 we cant even carry on a texting conversation for 5 mins 
Before we met and had sex she responded within reasonable time usually and actually wanted to talk to me we would FaceTime and talk but now it’s like I’m getting the cold shoulder",31Aug2019,1
767,"My mother is the type to never want me to see her vulnerable or in pain. She had a major surgery yesterday but decided to come straight home and not stay at the hospital, so she is going through waves of pain at home. Essentially, she doesn't want my help because she doesn't want me to witness her in such a debilitated state. The procedure she got usually takes 3-6 weeks to get back to a manageable state so I feel obligated to at least do something.

I understand that it must be embarrassing for her to be weak because of her strong mom mentality, but this is a case where it shouldn't get in the way. She wants me to stay out of her situation and let her do what she needs to do with my dad occasionally monitoring her. 

I'm not sure if I should honor what she wishes here, because my dad has been asking me to help him even if my mom says no. If anyone has been in this position or has any word on it, it would be greatly appreciated.",31Aug2019,1
768,"I have a super close group of friends I’ve known since childhood. Even when I moved cities for uni we stayed close. I’ve been home for about a year now and I’ve noticed my friends really don’t like doing much anymore. 

We used to go out for dinner, drinks or to a nightclub every other weekend. I get everyone grows up and most of them have long term relationships now, but they are very content so sit at home every night and I’m really not. Occasionally we might hang out in someone’s flat and watch Netflix but that’s about it.  

I’m very extroverted, I love going out, I love clubbing/dancing and all that jazz! I’m paranoid that maybe I’m too old for all that stuff now (I’m 23 f) and maybe I’m just not mature enough to realise.  I’m into a kind of underground club scene, and there’s a lot of venues for that in my city, so I have been thinking about going to a nightclub by myself one night.  Would it be creepy if I did? I wouldn’t drink much (scared of being roofied lol), but honestly I just want to dress up in a nice outfit a d dance! Is there anyway to do this without looking weird? Am I too old? Am I overthinking all of this???",31Aug2019,1
769,basically there’s been kinda an ongoing thing in my mind where i feel really bad about this one big insecurity i have constantly. it’s always bringing me down and recently something happened to make it kinda worse. i feel like i shouldn’t be upset over this because it’s just one thing but it’s dragging me down so much and i should be like over it by now. all my friends are telling me i shouldn’t be upset over this so i just gotta know if it’s reasonable to be so down over one thing all the time? or if i’m just being super unreasonable?,31Aug2019,1
770,"So I’m 15, Russian and I have pretty good English,
From a young age I asked my parents and grand parents to buy me on guitar, when I believed in Santa and wrote letters to him about guitars and snow boards, or when I directly said “I want a guitar” when we were going past music store. Despite all this, I was never sent to music school or got a guitar.
At my 14th birthday I finally decided to buy 100$ acoustic, but was ultimately scammed by music store and got a guitar that’s worth 50$. I’ve been playing it for a while.
As 9th grade approaching, I have to decide which job I want, so I take same exams both in 9th and 11th grade, because it’s easier. And I’m expected to be a translator, linguist or any language related job.
I have never revealed to anyone my passion for music, even my own brother probably thinks it’s just a hobby, so I don’t know what to do. Do I drop out in 9th grade to pursue music career, so I become a translator that knows only 2 languages, do I tell my mom that I want music lessons, I don’t know. Reddit help.",31Aug2019,1
771,"Right, this has been bugging me for at least several months and has been messing with my relationships with my parents in general as well so..



My mum has 2 main sides to her, a caring, nice mum who is gentle and calm (generally) and a stressed out shouting mum who yells at you when you move too much. When my mum is on the stressed out side she wakes me up with a loud voice and gets confused-angry when I tell her to stop shouting, and she says it is because she is deaf (she has hearing aids and even without them she can talk normally, and is only a bit deaf, just enough to be a pain at times for her) and if I move too much in a room, or go to her when it is 7-9pm and/or other people have entered before me, she gets angry and either tells me to leave or won't let me leave until I have said what I needed to say. This can be easily described as walking on egg shells and it can make things very tense. However, when she is gentle she is generally very nice and sweet. These changings are random and not based on where she/we are. Whenever she is nice and I have been thinking about her being bad, it makes me feel fustrated or guilty. Usually I act she is never bad based on habits. As well as me thinking that maybe its just her autism being the issue.


My mum also tends to talk about my sisters or about other mums to me, since about 11/12. She has said on multiple occasions about how my sister went out with some friend's friends and found out they blocked her 'because she was so rude', which a, I doubt is the story and b, is my sister's personal business, and she also said generally that the moral of the story is not to be like my sister, and my sister is an adult now so its even worse. She has also said about how she hates people venting online, and how one of my primary school classmate's mum bullied her, when I don't want to be vented to and never asked for it. She has also talked about me to my sisters, which, as I am young, is understandable at least. (She has also told me about my sister's struggles with food and eating, depression, etc) she has also fought physically with my sister, with shouting and screaming and it being verbal and generally being brutal on all fronts. (Alot of crying, and I hate hearing my sister cry, it upsets me).

She has also touched my butt ever since I was little, like I would do it to other kids and stuff, and only stopped when she said that it was wrong. But I can't exactly go against it or it'd make me a hypocrite as I do it back to her on habit.

I believe this is everything, and I'm happy to explain further if anything is unclear or not mentioned, and please don't assume things too far or take *any* action. Currently I am 13.",31Aug2019,1
772,"I’ve been terrified of bees my whole life. I have absolutely no reason to be afraid of them. When I see them, I think I start a panic attack, but I’m not sure. Does anyone have advice on how to overcome my fear?",31Aug2019,1

774,"For those of you who've seen 'The Good Place', I am Chidi (except I'm white, female, and British). For those that haven't, Chidi is a character who cannot make decisions, to the point that his indecisiveness sends him to hell as he makes those around him miserable. 

I've always been like this. I can make big decisions just fine, because they have some weight to them that makes the correct decision clearer. But when it comes to small decisions, i.e. what do you want to eat tonight?, those can fucking break me. For me, everything needs to be rational. And some decisions just don't have a rational reason behind them, and those I cannot understand and that is what leads to a complete mental block and a sort of feedback loop. 

I've gotten around this mainly by planning ahead, particularly when it comes to food. I normally have a clear idea of what I'm going to eat for the next week, and a rough idea of what I'm going to the week eat after that, in terms of meals. In terms of treats and cravings (i.e. sugary or calorie dense foods I want but reasonably know I shouldn't eat but want to) I often know weeks in advance when I'm going to eat them because I've had to move some stuff around in order to fit them in to my intake plan. The problem comes when I'm faced with a situation I wasn't expecting, or if, say, I'm planning to eat something but then can't obtain it (i.e. I'm going to go to this location and buy this food but they're out of it and now I don't know what I want). There are other instances where my decision making is challenged, but truthfully, food is the main crux of the issue, since it's the most frequent thing I'm asked to make a decision on. 

For an example (and the situation that prompted me to ask this question) this morning my mother went to get coffee and cake. This has become a weekly ritual so normally I plan ahead. This week, I decided I wanted a cookie (most logical for reasons I won't get into since they're fucking stupid to be honest) but arrived to find they didn't have any, so I had to decide on something else. I completely froze. I told my mother to just get her thing and I'd leave it but seeing I was upset she suggested we leave to do our shopping first and we'd come back, so I spent the next hour with my mind preoccupied with thought of cake, and how I could possibly rank them into best and worst options (in the end I went with cheapest and lowest calorie, since I figured at this point I wasn't going to enjoy it much either way). 

For anyone wondering why, I'm pretty sure this is because I'm autistic. I don't really have emotional responses to things, and I need everything to just make logical sense. But I don't really want to get into the why of it now. What I want to know is how do *you* make a decision. Specifically a small one. Even if it's totally at random, I just want to know your thought process.",31Aug2019,2
