0,"Title is the tl;dr. 

My dad just told me that my mom confessed to him last night that she has been thinking about suicide. She just started new medication to help with depression so that may be the cause, but I have no idea how to help her during this time. 

I also suffer from anxiety and depression and I've been in her position before, but now that it's her in that position, I'm terrified that I'm going to leave for work one day and she won't be here anymore. She's literally been my rock for my entire life.

For context, I still live at home. 

She says she's going to see a therapist on Monday. But goddamn, I want to support her more, other than just doing my part around the house but it's tough because I work six days a week an hour from my house. 

I don't know what to do. Help me, please.",14Jul2019,1
1,"I went to a overnights camp for 3 weeks and I loved it there. I made many friends and I was social which is out of the norm for me. Also I had time away from my mom and that made me happy. She’s not social at all but when I try to be when I’m at home it isn’t good. She caused my relationship with a girl to fail because she freaked out over it. 

She legitimately hasn’t had that many relationships and she also flipped when she found a picture of me shirtless( she went through everything on my phone). What I mean by she hasn’t had many relationships is in romantic and friends ways, but when I do stuff she acts as if she knows more about it than me. When I was hanging out with my friends once I had to call to go into a friends house and I had to confirm that there was an adult in the house. I wasn’t allowed social media for the longest time besucase she was afraid of me being bullied or someone sending me nudes. I can’t have a computer in my room. I didn’t text her for 3 days straight at a camp and she took my electronics. She caught me watching porn once and took my phone because she quote “wanted me to share that kind of stuff with her and discuss it with her” she got angry I was using incognito as well. 

I feel uncomfortable around her and I don’t know what to do. Is it bad that I legitimately felt sad to be back home. That I was angry at her for some of the shit she’s put me through. I want to be social and free but it’s hard with her. Any advice?",14Jul2019,2

3,"My coworker (26F) is in a toxic marriage, and every other story is about how shitty her husband and/or extended family are. 

All of my coworkers eat lunch and take breaks together in the break room, and she dominates the conversation- and is the type of person to not take any advice regarding the things she talks about.

I (26F) have been wearing and earbud and listening to youtube lately, and I don’t want to seem asocial with my coworkers; but her constant complaining about things she refuses to try to fix is really emotionally draining (and i’m personally trying to recover some self-esteem from prior trauma) 

Is there any advice anyone has on how to “mmmblock out the haters”?

6,"When my sister got her boyfriend, my family and I were quite excited. He seemed like a nice person. Unfortunately, he graduated in a degree that suffered because of the oil economy but that did not matter at first. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward around several years later. He still has no stable job. My family has tried to help him find a nice job but none of that has worked and he ends up being fired/ he quits. He comes to every family dinner but contributes nothing.  He stays overnight at our house a lot, using the guest bedroom. He uses our things and I honestly don't like him for invading what I would consider the family safe space. But that isn't the biggest problem, it is my sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

She gets angry every time we try to give advice for her to give to her boyfriend. When my parents ask about the jobs that they had pulled some strings to get for the boyfriend she tells them that it was never his fault. She defends this guy and is highly dependent on him.  I believe that he might be manipulating her perceptions of everyone around her. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is a quiet guy. But I've heard him talk poorly about others while they were not here-including my parents. And he is able to frame situations that it has always been the 'other' at fault and not himself(which is how he excuses his poor job performances for my dear sibling).My parents have given up and only pray that either the dude gets a semi-alright job to support my sister or she wakes up before they(if they even) get married.  My sister would never accept any advice from me because I am much younger than her and I only get called for being too serious or being stuck-up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if there is anything I can do about it. But I would still like to ask for another opinion or maybe some sort of way to deal with my emotions. Sometimes when he's over lounging around doing nothing I feel like I could pop a vessel.",14Jul2019,1

19,"Hello! I am at a loss of what to do in this following situation::

I used to have an amazing best friend. We become friends just over 5 years ago. We used to talk quite often but now she's saying she doesn't have time to even say hello. We also haven't seen each other in over a year. When I try to talk about meeting up she ALWAYS says she's too busy, has too much on her plate, doesn't have money, etc. I used to be fine with it, but then a few days later she posts vacation pictures, time out drinking/partying, and things she told me she didn't have time for. I messaged her 2 days ago about meeting up and she said she swamped and overloaded right now. Like she doesn't even say a simple hi anymore. 
Most recently, as in today July 13, 2019, she went on a hot air balloon ride and then randomly went to a dog shelter to get another dog (she currently just has 1).

Am I being unfair in wanting nothing to do with her now and unfriending her, or am I being a crybaby about it? I just feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick and I am low on her priorities. 

Advice either way is much appreciated. TIA :)",14Jul2019,1
20,"You know, one thing attending to death teaches us is that life is finite, our choices are finite. And in the end, it’s just the end. Maybe heaven, maybe hell, maybe nothing. But it’s the end here, the place where we can no longer influence the living with anything other than our past. And there’s a great movie that talks about life and death and meaning, and my takeaway was this: it doesn’t matter; we are matter, and matter cannot be destroyed. So, heaven, hell... I don’t know. But reincarnation is real; if matter cannot be destroyed, then we live in a closed system. Which is to say that none of our loved ones are truly gone. They’re here, they’re there... it’s hard to tell, but they’re somewhere, and that is known. Living through loss is inevitable, a defining moment among many along the way. It’s what we take away from those that we lose that allows us to strengthen our resolve or break our spirit. But we choose. Our perception dictates our reaction. While you mourn, I would encourage you to celebrate. Celebrate the life of someone who has raised such strong women, who have gone on to raise amazing children and grandchildren. I am so sorry this has happened, but you are a close family and I know you will get through this. My thoughts are with you all.",14Jul2019,1

23,"Hi r/advice. Let me start of in the beginning. 

I am in high school. This is the type of high school where you pretty much know everybody. If I had to estimate, around 900-1000 students, so it's not terribly huge. This girl (that I don't know that well, but I know exists) added me on snap chat. Assuming the users of this Reddit know how snap chat works, you can add people from the ""Quick Add"" section, these people are recommended because you have common friends in the system. I know her general friend group so I know that this is a negligible occurrence, because I myself have added people via the ""Quick Add"" section. So I add her back, no big deal. Assuming further that you know how snap chat works, we start a streak. A streak is when two connected users send at least one photo or video ""snap"" once a day. The days are counted next to the person's name. It's another common practice. So, we continue the streak for three weeks. But then randomly, I start having dreams, with her in those dreams. And then I start to care when I open her snap chat streaks. I'm not sure why this started, or what it means, if anything at all. That's the whole story. Not too romantic or exciting, just need some advice from real people. Thank you people of r/Advice , hopefully you can help me.",14Jul2019,2

25,"Just like the title says:  my first and last names are relatively common. I'm one of about five or six people in my city alone (over half a million in my metro area) who share that combination.  I've been confused with them quite often.

One person is a reporter for our local newspaper. I'm also an amateur writer who's been published before.  I get approached occasionally by people who know me (who know that I don't work for a newspaper) who still have questions or comments on a particular story they think I wrote.  When reporter-guy wrote a book, he held a signing at a local indie bookshop, and a friend of my sister's actually showed up to the signing expecting to find me.

Another person with my name is a medical doctor at one of our local hospitals. A coworker came back to work one day laughing about the connection after that doctor had performed her mammogram.

Yesterday, ""name-sharer-number-three"" showed up in a news report after having committed a robbery.  I've had just a couple of people checking up on me (through my wife) trying to find out if I was actually in jail or not.

26,"Hey there guys, first time on r/Advice. I've had a problem for quite a while, years even (I'm currently 20 years old). I often bounce back and forth between projects, and it is bad enough that when I start something, I do it with the expectation that I won't be doing it for long. Maybe a week, maybe a month or two, but not much longer than that.

It affects everything from games I play, to creative (especially this) projects I do. It *isn't even really burnout*, though sometimes it can get to that point. More often than not, I stop to pursue something else. I'll sometimes come back around to the project or game in another half-year to a year though - but more often than not, I'll just scrap my previous work and start from scratch.

Anyone have any advice with this issue? I'd like to be able to set my mind to something and continue it long-term - not get burnt out (out of nowhere) or take a detour to another project. It's really apparent to my girlfriend, who accepts it somewhat (she doesn't want me to waste my time doing something I won't continue for very long, which I understand and agree with).

30,Hi so high school just ended and it feels like the end of my purpose. I don’t mean this in a negative way like the world is over but it feels like my life kind of ended in some way. All the friends I know are leaving to go to different colleges and the whole structure of school is completely gone. I feel is if my goals and dreams have stopped and I have nothing left to chase. The summer has just been a bunch of nothing. I find no reason to really do anything anymore. The real world just sounds pointless. I don’t want to slave away for years at a job just to survive. I don’t want to continue to age and watch my health slowly decline. I wish I could be young forever and have all the fun that comes with high school for the rest of my life. It feels as if my world has been taken away from me. I have so many things I regret and wish I did in high school. There just seems no point in this life. Did anyone else feel completely lost after high school and did anyone find a reason to keep going? Thanks,14Jul2019,1

I have a very comfortable life.I have a lot of friends I made on my times of recruitment, and from them I learned to see the world from other points of view.But meeting a lot of people my age has show me how much of a man-child I am. A lot of the guys I met had already made their lives.I am talking about living alone, paying your own bills, working by yourself, to sustain one self.And now, I am almost 20 and I have shame to tell my parents of whatever I am going to do. The thing is that I feel ashamed to be very childlish among people who I see as ""true men"", and that leaves me very upset. It gets even worse by the fact that I am a soldier.I passed through months of severe training to toughen up, but in the end I come back home to be a momma's boy. My best friend works and goes to university, and he works really hard, and sometimes he does not have time to go out with me.And in those times i think ""Oh, well, he is busy cause he is, you know,A FUCKING ADULT"" while I am here home alone doing nothing like a pathethic childish loser. I only want to go out, and live my consequences, live by myself, by my own efforts, cause most of the time I just feel very useless, very dependant.

32,"I made a post a few days ago describing a situation and whether or not I should end a relationship because of it. I got some great feedback but I want to update it and see if anything changes. Here is the copy and paste of the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I’ve been dating this girl (20) I’m (21) for three months now. She just got out of a divorce that lasted a few months and she has some sad times here and there but I always try to help her. It’s no big deal at all. But she’s amazing. Makes me very happy and we have a ton of fun together. Unfortunately she has some anger issues. So if I say something wrong or make a mistake it gets blown out of proportion. She is also a Latina (I’m not racist she’s told me that Latinas are more “spirited” women). Well the other night she got drunk and went into a bit of a rage calling me by her ex husbands name (like she didn’t know who I was) and threatening me with a knife. She hit me in the head and called me every name under the book and tried to say what she could to emotionally hurt me. Understanding that she was drunk I kept trying to get her to lay down and go to sleep, she wouldn’t listen to me. So after 6 hours of trying this it was around 3am at the time I decided to just go home while she was calling a guy that she had slept with when we first became a couple....I know it’s a lot.....so I left. I went home and passed out. I woke up to 60ish text messages and 20ish missed calls. All containing her calling me a coward and not a man and stuff like that for leaving her. Now I try to put myself in her shoes. I get it maybe leaving wasn’t the best idea BUT I didn’t drink nor did I ask her to. I didn’t ask to take care of someone all night. I did what I could but my life was being threatened by weapons and her telling me she was gonna call the cops because I bought the alcohol she was drinking. (Few months away from 21) Now we’re at today. I woke up and went to her house. We went out and got food and hung out and it went alright she was hungover. Gave me a lot of crap for leaving her the night before. She didn’t seem to understand why despite me telling her what she did to me. She didn’t seem to care at all. Then we got back to her house and she went to run an errand and she came back with an entire bottle of wine that she got from the guy she cheated on me with (same one as before) she told me it would be ok and she would just drink to relax. Boy was I stupid for believing her. She drank the whole bottle and fell asleep. So I thought that was cool and I was kicking back watching some YouTube videos. I got a text from a buddy asking if I was down to meet and chat for a bit. So I left her a note that said I was going to a gas station to get some drinks for when she was hungover the next day. I was at the gas station and she called and asked why I was gone so long. I told her a buddy wanted to chat and that I’d be home soon. She then gets very angry and goes back to name calling. So I start getting worried and tell me friends I wanna go somewhere else because I don’t want her to pull another knife on me or push a fork into my neck like the night before. As me and my two friends went to leave she comes out of nowhere and tailgates me. Keep in mind she is plastered. And she is less than a foot from my bumper going 55mph and she has been calling me non stop and I’m ignoring it because I’m focusing on not dying. She passed me a chases after one of my friends. Hits a turn going no slower than 60mph cause she sped past me. My friend loses her and we regroup. I’m panicking at this point and about to lose my mind. I’m scared of her because of the Vietnam flashbacks I’m having of the night before and I’m scared because my friends are not going to hit her but they aren’t gonna let her hurt me. I’m not a man of conflict. I’m a very calm laid back guy and I just want everything to go back to normal. I just want to go back to being happy with her but I’m scared that it’s done. At this point I’m hiding away at a friends house typing this out in a desperate attempt for advice. I care a lot about her and I don’t wanna lose her but she is acting way out of line? I really have replayed the past two days in my head and I don’t see that I did anything wrong besides leaving the first night I guess??? I feel like my only options are to leave her. Or I can go to her house tomorrow and tell her if she wants to be with me she isn’t drinking anymore and she is blocking all of these “guys” she talks to and she isn’t gonna treat me poorly anymore. No more name calling and anger issues. I’m gonna prepare it and not be rude but be firm. Again I care about her but I’m lost. I hate making decisions like this I need help. I’m exhausted. Plz someone give me some advice. I don’t wanna lose her but I don’t wanna be hurt. What can I do? I’ll appreciate anything thank you in advance for taking the time to read this novel and help out a stranger :) 

&amp;#x200B;

So that was three days ago. And before I talk about what has happened since then, I want to explain that she is the type of person who has a lot of pride, so apologies come rare with someone like her. The past three days she has called and texted me begging for me to take her back, saying she will never touch alcohol again. She has begged me, my mom, and today my sister. My mom and sis told me it seemed a bit manipulative that she was making their own opinions sway because they thought I should break up with her but after hearing the things she says about me and seeing her cry, makes them reconsider their original opinions. Now i am starting to do the same thing. My friends never got to know her very well but they hated her from the start and one of them told me they would lose all respect for me if i got back together with her. Im not going to lie it is throwing off my decision making because i dont want to lose my friends but i also really miss her and wonder if i can work it out. If i did i would be more firm with her and not be her puppy dog. I would make her stop talking to guys that she would talk to to make me jealous. I would tell her that the games were over and she was to make changes since she has been begging me to come back. I just hate making these decisions because we really have had A LOT of fun together. Its been the most fun relationship i have been in. So i dont know what to do at this point and i am terrible at making these tough decisions. And if i do get back with her and have that talk i worry about what my friends will say and think of me. I dont want to be a bitch to them but i also want to be in a serious relationship and i dont wanna throw away a perfectly good one because of a mistake. Because of something that could have been worked on and fixed.

35,I harass my female friends and punch them jokingly whenever I feel like it. They get mad for a few seconds but go back to normal immediately afterwards. They never punched me back so i automatically assume they are okay with it. Am I wrong for this?,14Jul2019,1
37,"Ok, this is a complicated and long post on an anon account because I have to get some shit off my chest and need advice. Thanks for any help in advance.

Over the past week, I (36M) have been on a family vacation with my parents (both 70s), my brother (25, MID/adult dependant), my wife (30s), and our two kids (5 and 1). We are visiting a new summer home that my dad acquired as part of his retirement from a 45-year career. 

During this time my mother has been mean and rude towards everyone in the family, especially my dad, and it’s made things quite unbearable. She is always difficult to get along with, but on this trip I have had to limit my interactions and mostly avoid engaging with her at all because her every statement has been toxic. Every time she speaks it is a stream of micro-aggressions, gaslighting, bitterness and miserly criticisms. Every comment is premised around something going wrong and someone being at fault. She left today but the rest of us are staying longer—this schedule was planned from the outset as she doesn’t like travelling, and so my dad got her a separate return ticket (in business class, while the rest of us went economy).

I’ve spent the week cooking great dinners for everyone and doing all the dishes, but she can only talk about how we shouldn’t spend so much on food (she isn’t paying and we can easily afford it), constantly implying leftovers will go bad (even though I’ve managed the food so there is practically no waste), criticizing my dad for drinking a full glass of wine (literally one glass), making constant vocal criticisms of my brothers weight and forcing him to take smaller portions, scolding my kids for being messy, and so on. On day trips, all she can talk about is how long the drive is (most distances are ~15-20 min which I consider very reasonable), how dangerous the roads are, how bad my dad’s driving is, how dangerous wherever we go is, how boring it is, etc. We’ve visited some incredible places and had some amazing meals and at no point has she acknowledged any of positively, beyond one or two “Thank you for dinners.” She also has taken no visible pleasure in spending time together as a family, including how special family time is now with two grandchildren growing up quickly (and they will be the *only* two).

Her worst scorn and the primary issue is the house itself, which was purchased by my dad without consulting her first. This was not a good idea on his part, but I can also understand why he did it: she has been acting this way for 20+ years now to varying extremes, and sometimes refuses to speak to him for weeks at a time. Their interactions and communication are consistently terrible or non-existent and they are basically separated but living in the same bedroom—something which I simply cannot comprehend. The only reason this has been possible, I suppose, is because my dad has focused on working his job since they got married, and an additional binding factor is that they both care for my younger brother, who is an adult dependent due to a mild intellectual disability. Anyway, to return to the issue of the house: it is my dad’s retirement project, a labour of love, but also a smart investment because it is located in a sought-after conservation zone where absolutely no new building permits are allowed. Now that he is retired he wants to spend more time there, but my mother hates it and refuses to consider any other position. We hoped that all of us coming there on a vacation would lead her to enjoy it, but instead she doubled down on her position and alienated everyone in the process.

I have felt for over a decade that my parents should probably divorce. My mother sometimes tells the rest of the family that she has lost the will to live, and she doesn’t seem to have any close friends and has alienated her two sisters entirely. I think she sort of looks forward to seeing her grandkids but otherwise she is entirely filled with doom and gloom and no longer has any passion or fun. She is becoming increasingly frail with body issues like a broken hip and kneecap in the last few years. I have tried to talk with her about her issues but get nowhere with it, because she always denies responsibility for any negative interactions and places the blame on others like my dad and brother instead (this is where the gaslighting comes in). I have encouraged my dad to see a therapist or marriage counsellor and he told me that he has previously proposed to her but she refuses to consider it. I am starting to feel that I need to issue this to her as an ultimatum because her mental health issue—I don’t know if it’s depression or anxiety or ocd or what—is becoming intolerable for others and for herself. She has a beautiful house and a successful child (me) who is married with two great kids, and yet she has no joy in her life and remains obsessed with the fact that she grew up poor and that the world has somehow done her wrong. She seems to lacks any genuine empathy towards others and has no real perspective on how good her circumstances are compared to the rest of the world. My dad and my brother deserve better than this, and as my kids get older I will have to start pointing out to them that parts of her behaviour and speech are unacceptable because I don’t want to normalize it. I don’t want to cut her off and having kids of my own is a major reason that I haven’t completely shut her out of my life—I have an increased appreciation for how much work it is to be a parent, how much respect is deserved, and I also want my kids to know their grandmother. However, I have also had to work hard to deprogram and distance myself from my mother’s traumas in order to build a happy marriage with my partner that is based in solid communication and trust, and modelling this for my kids is super-important to me.

Sometimes I think that my mother must have ended up this way due to the stress of parenting my brother—I read [an article](https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/11/10/autism-moms-stress/6121/) that states mothers of autistic children experience psychological conditions similar to soldiers’ ptsd—but, to be honest, I can recall so, so many incidents of her being shitty to me before he was born (we have an 11yr age difference). As a little kid I fantasized about suicide on a regular basis and realize now it was likely because of the guilt and blame she continually thrust on me, despite the fact that I was a good student, athlete, artist, didn’t get into fights or much trouble, etc.

Anyway, before I wrap up this post, I want to raise one additional complicating issue... almost all the shit is now on the table, so I might as well include this final detail because it’s on my mind: when I was a teenager, my mother revealed to me during a fight that she had another child before she met my dad, and that this child was given up for adoption. I’m my parents only biological child so this was/is a big deal. But because this disclosure was made as a threat—she claimed she was going to go find this child and start a parenting relationship with him because she was going to disown me (I can’t even remember what for)—I was never able to ask any further questions about it. I haven’t ever had the guts to ask my dad whether he knows about it. And I want to find this half-brother, but after checking info about adoption disclosure it seems impossible without her written consent, which I doubt she would provide.

This past week has been a tipping point in my relationship with her and stuff needs to change. Basically I’m looking for some advice or support on how to proceed— I’m thinking I may need to make some sort of intervention, either by demanding that she attend therapy with my dad, or supporting my dad to go his own way, or I don’t know what else. I also want to find out if it’s possible to track down my half-sibling to see if he’s real and find out about his life, but I’m worried about what could be unleashed if I were to ask her about it.

Thanks for reading all of this... whether this post gets any responses or not is almost secondary to the catharsis and clarity of writing it all down... but I will be grateful for any perspectives 


tl:dr: my mom has an undiagnosed mental health issue that is destroying all joy and relationships in her life,l and I’m not sure how to address it; my dad is building his retirement without her and I’m not sure if I should encourage him to file for divorce; I’d like to find a way to contact an unknown half-sibling who would have been adopted from an orphanage sometime in the late 60s/early 70s.",14Jul2019,1
39,"I'm pretty sure I am/was a compulsive liar. I lie about stupid things whenever I meet people. I've tried to do this less, and it's really working out for me! (I think this largely worked so well because it was a phase and way of coping, which I don't need as much anymore). But I still do it, but they're all small lies. 

But, the main problem is, I'm really not sure how to come clean about all these lies I've already made up. I don't know if I have much of an option but to keep them up. I made a few close friends who especially in the beginning of our friendship, I lied a lot to. Such as about my ethnicity and an ex girlfriend (who was actually just a one sided crush, I made up that we dated), and a lot of other dumb things. I'm scared of how they would react or if they would shun me. However, I also know keeping up these lies can't be good for me.",14Jul2019,3
40,"Hey y’all. I’m currently an undergrad student on a summer research internship. I’m in a hotel suite with two other students from my university who I’ve never met before this but they’re good friends. The first few weeks I was very clingy with them, which is my fault, because I have issues with social anxiety and was given advice to be more assertive in making friends. Tried to follow that advice which ultimately lead to a nervous breakdown a few weeks after the program started. Today I overheard them talking about me to a stranger they met today (on Tinder) and calling me annoying, insensitive and basically regaling this absolute stranger about me. I don’t know what to do. 

After that nervous breakdown I was distancing myself from them and really don’t care for their friendship anymore. I just want to get this internship over with.

I say ""Im tired, and my arm/shoulder/ect is sore, I think Ill go take a shower and get ready for bed."" They have always been like this since we were really little. 

Common example: I have had sports conditioning for the past month or so. I get done with the last day and Im understandably sore. We spend the rest of the afternoon out on a lake fishing/swimming ect. We get home, eat dinner and its like 7:30. They ask me if I want to go bike riding to the local park. I politely regect them. They whine and complaine like ""UGH! WHY NOT HUH?"" I answer them with ""I just dont want to go, thats it. Im tired"". And they fucking yell at me- ""HEY GRMA!

49,"I'm not good at titles so it will have to do, this situation is not about me but my friend but I'm trying to help him and I'm not at the camp thing.

The short version is, my friend  is at a summer camp which I think is supposed to improve his confidence, he was forced to go and is currently trying to get the counselors to let him go home, he is there with like 40 kids, they are staying in a hotel (what my friend said). He has made two friends there, one he thinks will help if it gets bad and other one he thinks is to scared to help. My friend is the youngest there everyone else is 16+ and this is Scotland. There is a group of boys there who are picking on people, so far they have stole at least £100+ worth of stuff from my friend (earphones, loads of sweets, some fancy torch and other stuff he did not mention pacifically what), they have assaulted my friend and I don't mean like a shove or slap over the head but for example one of the boys came over and twisted my friends arm behind his back (not sure how to describe) they did this and made it worse until my friend told them where his stuff was, they also shoved him down a flight of stairs and chased him just so they could beat him up. They have also harassed him, kinda like your typical ned. 
The counselors are apparently useless and my friend is not the bravest.

I'm working on limited information, so far the best option I have given him is call the police, I currently have him recording or voice recording everything they do to him. He doesn't want to call the police and I don't know where he is and neither does he (he didn't listen much when he was told about the place). I need ideas to help him.

54,"It sounds like a movie story but unfortunately it’s not. 

I don’t know what to do from now on, if I leave my work I worry about the kids missing me and that being bad for them, and his wife thinking it’s so odd that I left, she loves me and I love her too. Do I tell my boyfriend/best friend and ask for help? I feel like cheating on him for not telling him that. I can’t keep this to myself only. 

Background story: 
I’m a nanny, I work for this family for 2 years now, I absolutely love them, they are nice, pay me well, treat my like a family sometimes as inviting me for dinner with them, wanting to know about my life, caring about me. I started working for them when I was 19 and I’m 21 now. 
I never noticed anything about his crush, I always saw him as a great dad, serious, someone who would never cheat his wife. I also always thought that they had the perfect relationship, always treating each other nicely, kissing, hugging. I have a boyfriend and we live together since I started working there and they know him, we went out with the kids a lot of times, oh they have two amazing kids. 
He is 43 years old. 

How he told me:
 He texted that he wanted to talk to me and that he was going to the park for a walk with the dog and that if I was available, I said yes. Thought that they were going to divorce or that I was going to be fired, anything but this. 

I got there and we started to walk, he said that some of the things that he was going to say were either going to scare me or get me mad or that were going to be bad or that were going to shock me. And that the priority is always the kids.
I thought ok, divorce. 
He started saying that his wife told 4 years ago that when she was a kid she was sexually abused, and that changed everything in their relationship and that it was a terrible time and that he almost took the kids and started a new life.
Not only that changed everything but they thought they were cheating on each other and didn’t have trust anymore but things eventually got a little better. 
He said that he changed who he is, that he can’t be happy like he was before, that they talked about everything with a therapist, that he miss being innocent like he was before about life and sees that a lot on me. 
He said “It will probably sound weird but I have a crush on you, it’s been for a while now, every time I look 1 second more at your eyes it hits me, that when a part of my shirt shows of a little bit he sees that I have a hot body, that you have a hot ass, that I don’t see you the way I used to anymore. “

I was shocked. Didn’t know what to do, I never could imagine that, wish he didn’t tell me that so I could live my life normally and fuck what he thinks, but I couldn’t do anything. 

He kept on saying a lot, that if/when I break up with my boyfriend and wants a fuck he is there. That he notices how my body is looking good lately. That he imagines me sleeping on the bed with him. That I’m not his type but I look so nice. He asked me if I have a crush on him too and I said “no, I never even thought that you had a crush on me. I think it will pass, It’s just a crush.”
I asked if his wife thinks about the possibility he said absolutely no, she’s always working. 
He said that I shouldn’t tell my boyfriend and just keep this to us, that it’s something exciting and if I see him staring at me I should give him the finger or say fuck off. But I thinks this is exciting for him and I hate to feel like I’m being too “exciting” for him. 
I don’t want that. I just really want to work and I love my boyfriend. 
He asked if I think it’s disgusting, I said yeah, it sounds funny and weird and I never thought about it, there’s a line that I don’t want to cross, I am a nanny and want to work professionally. 
I forgot to say that he’s usually home working around 2-3 days a week, he goes to the office or the bedroom. And he goes to the gym around 3-4 days a week. 
He said that he is going more so he won’t be home at my face and thinking about things. 


What should I do? Please help me, I’m so innocent, young, I have nobody to talk to about it. I love my boyfriend, my job, but how am I going to keep working everyday knowing that?
Thank you!",14Jul2019,1
55,"My entire house is rotten, moldy, small (2rooms+living room) I've been trying to convince my mom to move but she won't for the next few years due to no money, she claims: this house is good, we don't need to move.

So for like the last 3 weeks I’ve had about 20 ish dreams. The first one was at my house. Basically it’s the same as normal but everyone is gone and everything is dead. It’s like everything was getting overgrown by plants, and then the plants died. Everything seems abandoned.  Like usually pictures/picture frames are gone. I’ve never seen a animal or human. And I’ve never seen any corpses like everything is just gone. 

There’s no people my family is gone. There’s no animals. Or even bugs. Like there’s no sign of life. The grass is dead the trees are there but no leaves and are rotten and brittle. 

also there’s no wind/breeze/weather of any sort. And the sun is stuck it doesn’t move it’s always stuck at sunset.  And it’s always really quite the only sounds come from me.   I can walk around and go outside if I choose.  

  There’s also a since of like I’m not supposed to be here when I have these dreams. 
But that was just the first one I haven’t had a  reoccurring dream.  It’s always in different places there’s been about 3 in places I recognize. 
1 at my house 2 at the end of my street 3 and my grandmothers old house.   All the others have been in areas/ buildings I don’t recognize. 

I feel so unnerved by them and but my curiosity for what’s happening keeps me from freaking out.  

Another note when the dream starts I’m usually lying on the ground and then I have to stand up to walk around, and before I wake up everything is fuzzy like when you stand up to fast and your eyes go blurry.

66,"basically, i have these really short and minute fits where i feel like i basically lose control of my body for literally like a second. i’ve been having these ever sense i can remember. this happens to me mainly when i am in a new or unfamiliar place, but seems like it can happen anywhere. it’s basically like a wave of dizziness goes over me and i get real light headed for a very short moment, and i kinda lose control before i’m back to normal. i have never brought this up to anyone because for a long while i thought it was normal, but i’m not so sure anymore. i’ve fallen down once to it happening, and every other time hasn’t lasted long enough to really harm me in any way. the best thing my mind can come up with to explain it is that they are some sort of really minute seizure, but i’ve never had an actual seizure so i can’t say that as fact. it’s a weird one but if anyone knows what’s happening it’d be much appreciated lol",14Jul2019,1
67,"My good friend is in a long distance relationship of 2 years with a guy from another country. They're a solid couple, but physical intimacy is obviously lacking and I think her needs are starting to show....

EVERY time we hang out WITHOUT fail she touches me. It's not just a slight touch on the shoulder either. It's long hugs, touching my arms ( I'm somewhat in shape) head up against my shoulder,etc. Yesterday, when we were hanging out,  we were walking (she's 5'0 and I'm 6'2 ) she comes up to me from the side and wrap her arms around my waist and leans up against my chest and said ""this feels nice"". I instinctively put my arm around her which was definitely inappropriate ( my bad ). There are times where we'd be holding hands will walking. SHE INITIATES ALL OF THIS. There's A LOT more examples but I think you get the gist. 

Whenever someone thinks we're dating ( which pretty much everyone in my life does ) she never seems to have any qualms about. She never mentions her boyfriend and even said ""let them think that"" she even told me I was attractive before. 

I honestly think she's attracted to me because a lot of these signs seem legit, but I'm aware that me making a move is inappropriate so I won't do  it. Besides, I could never replace someone of 2 years. They have so much in common and whatnot ( you guys know how people in relationships are) regardless, my question remains is it a good idea to tell him or should I drop it? We're actually decent friends and we talk pretty much everyday. He's a cool guy with a good heart and I'm not sure if his girl is promiscuous and might one day try something so I should warn him, or am I blowing this out of proportion?",14Jul2019,3
68,"Let me start by introducing the matter. A friend of mine goes on a vacation every year with his parents, and 2 siblings who are in their 20’s. 


This year, neither siblings were able to go due to responsibilities. So, my friend was allowed to invite 2 friends to come on this vacation. Out of our friend group of 8, he chose me along with another friend. 

The problem is, we don’t know how we are going to explain to the rest of our friends why we went on this vacation and why the 2 of us were chosen rather than anyone else without making them mad or upset. Lying or just not saying anything is unrealistic because they’d suspect something is going on (we are going to be gone for 10 days). 


We would be okay with modifying the story a small bit. For example, our parents pooled money together (this one wouldn’t be believable for certain reasons). If anyone had a suggestion for how we could handle this, it would be greatly appreciated.",14Jul2019,1

71,"Please bare with this long post, I just feel I need to be as precise with my issue as possible.

I have an issue where my mood fluctuates with the day, somewhat like bipolar disorder. Specifically, I have days where I'm happy, and feeling a lot more social and outgoing, and take every opportunity I can to make that day productive, which I've been calling up days. Other days, I'm either very prone to anxiety, depression, or an unholy cocktail of the two, which will henceforth be called down days. I've done some research, and believe that I have cyclic disorder, a lesser form of bipolarism, as I don't get into manic happiness (other than 1 time that I still don't know the cause for) or soul crushing depression. 

I bring this up, because I'm faced with a dilemma. Normally, I'm able to ignore those down days by occupying my mind with gaming/youtube, but lately I've been needing a job. I got one a few days back, only for my first day to be a down day. The work was very monotonous, and required me to move around a lot, meaning the only thing I could do was listen to music. However, I was told to stop so I could listen and focus on my work, and being in the state I was, I was feeling too meek to protest. I eventually finished the day, having a small panick attack over a small mistake with an inconsequential piece of paper halfway through the day. This didn't make me look good already. The next day was an up day, and I was trucking along, working very quickly. However, I'm not sure if this is a thing that only happens to me, but whenever I stand for too long, my feet start to hurt like hell. This only applies to standing, as when I'm walking, I barely notice any pain. This was a problem, however, as they wanted me to try a job that required me to be in a single place, and for whatever reason, they didn't like chairs there. I have another thing where I'm overly truthful without thinking about it, and thus told my boss, who was training me for the job, about my foot pain. After he finished training me, he asked what I thought of the exact area he was training me for, and I said it wouldn't work with the foot issue. Then, he asked me about how I felt about the place in general, and with the previous day still fresh in my mind, I made the mistake of saying I didn't much care for it either. He then asked if I just wanted to quit right there, and I said I'd at the very least finish the day. I went back to what I was doing the previous day, and I started to actually enjoy myself with the work that seemed boring the day before. However, there were times I had to wait for things to happen, and so I would find a place to sit while waiting. This apparently was the final straw, as a few hours before closing, they decided that I had to go. They told me that manufacturing wasn't for me, and to call the hiring agency that I used to find them to find a job more suitable for me. (I do deeply apologize if it sounds like I'm complaining, I just want to be honest)

My father found out, and berated me on how I should've just withstood the pain, and how he knew a woman who withstood similar foot pain to the point where she lost her big toes. He's now on my back about how I have to get a job, now! However, I'm scared that I'll have a similar experience the the previous one in terms of a down first day that then leads to an up second day that leads to me telling my boss I don't like it there. I know a psychiatrist could help, but my dad is very adamant that I spend every second I have available to getting a job, and I fear having a day a week where I see someone to help with my cyclic disorder would make me less appealing to jobs.

I guess the essential question I'm asking is I'm being pressured into getting a job by my father, but I fear that if I don't see a psychiatrist about my mental issues, every job I try to get will end up with me being fired.

An extra note is that my mom says she'll fund me until I get a job that sticks, but I feel terrible about it.",14Jul2019,1
72,"Story is, me and a girl who I met in tinder planned to meet on the weekends next week. It just so happened that she already booked the hotel, and threatened that she'd release my ""intimate"" messages to everyone I know if I didn't give her assurance that I will show up. She already had two people ghost her you see, so I kinda get why. But it was just so sudden and kinda unreasonable. The assurance she asked for is me transferring the payment for the hotel + more and she said she'd return it when we meet up. I know, I've been stupid and didn't think about the consequences of sending it. However, I feel like the girl is just on her desperate throes of making sure I actually show up (of which I really plan to). But now she changed her image in my head, and I don't know if she actually already deleted the photos and or managed to back it up (She showed me with a video of deleting it as well from recovery files of the cloud I think).

73,"Hey everyone, advice time. 

I'm 31, took over the family business when I got out of college and my brother followed me into the business as well. Now me, him, and another person own the business. My brother is 29 and has been ""right-brained"" for as long as I can remember and this is a very well known fact between our family and friends. He is not detail oriented and wants to move forward with things before they have been tested or set up fully. I lean more ""left-brained"" and analytical and prefer to plan out basically everything down to the last period.

We have had our issues owning the business together over the years but it had gotten to a point where our duties were separated enough that we didnt work together daily, but recently it's continued to get harder and harder to just get along. A recent trade show trip we made, just the two of us, has given me the feeling that I may be making a mistake staying here long term and attempting to own a business with him.

I ""run"" the business; oversee the books and payroll, finish production on orders and logistics, bookkeeping, tax stuff, as well as basic IT. It isn't glamorous and it's not that I dislike it, but I do sometimes feel like I could be doing something more rewarding with my time. Whether that be with the current business or not remains to be seen. He handles the ecommerce side and warehousing/shipping side of things and isn't very vested in the ownership side of things.

I've tried for years to help him become more professional and easier to work with, but myself and others still have issues working closely with him. He takes things personally if any of his work is ever criticized. I probably am harder on him than I mean to be or than I would be with someone else, but I think I justify it by thinking he will learn from criticism and adapt to being a better employee and coworker. He instead takes any criticism to heart and thinks I'm picking on him. I'm not the only one who believes he is difficult to work with at times.

I think the business would be hurt more if I left than if he did (and the other owner has stated the same), but I also feel I would have a better chance of rebuilding a career somewhere else than he would based on our degrees (mine is mechanical engineering with a minor in business/math and he majored in Business Management), plus he liked what he does and is good at it.

I really love him and want the best for him. I want to get along with him and have a good relationship in the future, but I'm at a loss for how I should approach this going forward. He knows my feelings on all of this and I know that he also feels that we have issues working together as well. Do i stay and we figure out how to work it out? Stay and try to separate our jobs even more? Do i leave? Does he? I know there isn't a right answer, but any advice would help tremendously.. thanks.",14Jul2019,1

76,"I’m a soon-to-be college student, and I’m in desperate need of a job (gas, textbooks, class payments, etc.) I’ve been job hunting lately, and I need advice on which job to choose. 
Job A - a coffee shop I really want to work at.  I’ve had a background of culinary training and I’ve always loved coffee (more for the process of making it but also for drinking it lol. In my spare time, I like watching cooking videos and coffee brewing videos), but I put in my application and just recently went in and asked about it, and they said the manager would be back in 2 days to meet with me but they’re still hiring people.
Job B - a local craft store. I applied about 2 days ago just for the hell of it, and I went in with my resume and got an interview and offered a job all in the same day (today). The only thing worrying me is the fact that it’s terrible hours. I will be working 3am-10am, which is fine, but they need me thursday and friday, and i have class ALL day on thursday. So, once I start classes (a month from now), I’ll be having back-to-back work, class, work. On top of that, I live about a 30 minute drive from my college, so I would waste a lot on gas to go to work, go to class, and then come back to work. 

Overall, I would be a whole lot happier working at the coffee shop, but I’m not promised a position there yet. I don’t even know the hours I’ll be working there or if they’re even considering me. At the craft store, it’ll be poor hours and I really won’t enjoy stocking shelves and driving back and forth, but I’m promised a job there literally by next week. what should I do?

78,"Long story short, I recently quit at a company I’ve been with roughly 7 years. I was a high level manager, with good pay, benefits, and was very good at my job. However, I was working the latest shift at 50 hours per week or more. I’ve got a one year old son that I wasn’t getting to see because of this job, and when he fell ill and was hospitalized, I felt that I shouldn’t continue working with this company because I felt that I’d failed to be there for my son as I should. (He’s doing absolutely wonderful now, as a side note. Took 3 surgeries like a little champ!) The manager overseeing me and my schedule at this time would not budge on my schedule as he enjoyed his day shift position and said that he’d done his time working late nights. He could potentially offer me maybe a mid every now and again is what I was told. Now, about 3 months later, I’ve been contacted by one of the even higher level managers offering me my same level position at a separate location where I’d worked when I was 16.  I know the majority of the veteran staff at this location, and the manager overseeing me is a very long time friend. As of right now I’m struggling to find work since, and know that I need a job in order to support my family, but really, should I return to this company that has let me down in the past, and may severely restrict how much I see my son, or should I hold out and hope that something different will come my way with more flexibility? I know it will be a different overseeing manager, which makes a massive difference in some cases, but I don’t want to be stuck in the same loop over and over as it’s insane to do so. 
Note that my family will absolutely be livid if I return to this job, even if the money and the benefits are wonderful. They’ve nagged me about this job for the better part of 5 years, so I’m also hesitant to receive the backlash. 

Anyone been in this position before? What did you do, if so? I want to be able to provide for my family, but not at the stake of never seeing them.",14Jul2019,2

82,"I work in grocery. My boss isn’t exactly the most compassionate fellow. He often speaks about politics and some of the negatives that come with it...race, language barriers, the types of people he dislikes, etc. We get along well, I guess  because I’m kinda of a “yes man”, and hardly disagree with him solely to avoid a potential argument or awkward moment.

Well, today I decided to try and have some fun. While stocking shelves I fashioned a little hat out of a ranch dressing box, kinda resembling an old fashioned British soldier hat. I just wore it throughout the day, and even lent one to a customer who kinda danced with me for a minute. It was fun and garnered a few smiles, which in turn made me feel good! 

One of my coworkers is...well, she’s one of those “quirky” people. Kinda awkward and nerdy, overall nice but can be a tad overbearing. But she at least means well. I gave her a box and she went about her day with it. My boss comes by and kinda good-naturedly tells us the “hats” have outlived their purpose. I didn’t disagree, they could be a tad distracting from work and possibly inappropriate for the time and place. But after we took them off and my coworker went away my boss whispered to me that he doesn’t mind if I wear it, just not around “dipshit”, as he called her. I know he’s voiced small grievances about her in the past but can’t remember any in particular. 

It made me feel bad. This seemed like a bias of sorts. If she can’t wear it, I shouldn’t either, right? I didn’t mean to cause any negativity; it was just supposed to be a little fun to brighten up peoples’ day, maybe give them a little laugh. But I can see how it may not have been the best time or place for such revelry.

So turns out, the guy lives in the same building and parked right next to us. Hubs gets out and is acting tough, saying ""Is this where you live? Let me catch you one night."" 

The dude just says ""I wouldn't be making threats like that, we're neighbors."" He was calm and basically saying y'know.. its illegal to threaten someone or at least you should make peace with neighbors. My husband took that as a threat in itself as in ""I'll fuck you up if you threaten me"".

I try to calm them down and explain to the guy that my husband was just scared because the break checker put us in danger. The guy says we were flyin down the street, we were going the speed limit but whatever.

85,"Hello everyone. On a burner account today and feeling a whole mix of emotions. I'll detail what happened below to the best of my ability. 

Last night, I was invited to a friend's party, we'll call her Jess. Jess and I are really good friends but haven't seen each other in a while, so we were both pretty excited.  I go there and I meet a lot of new people, and hit it off with a lot of them. The party stays lively and fun into the wee hours of the morning.

At some point, Jess and I started catching up about life and what's been new, and things started to get a bit heavy. We excuse ourselves to her bedroom (mostly she) starts pouring out a lot of pent up stresses and emotions. We both had a really hard time growing up, for various reasons. I'm showering her with compliments, listening and intermittently hug and hold her for comfort. 

Eventually more people start to leave, and we finally realize that it is no earlier than 5 am. She asks if I planned on driving, and I said no. I've been drinking a pretty steady supply of alcohol, as had she. She offers me to sleep in her room because she doesn't want her roommate to know I slept over. We are both getting ready for bed and I ask if I can just sleep on the bed. She has a sleeping bag, but it's very hot outside.  She says that's fine and makes a joking comment about how I better not try anything. 

We both lay in bed, and we keep talking. She mentioned being super horny recently, so I ask about what her relationship status has been like. She is curled up to the side of the bed, and I'm in a spoon-like position, but with space between us. She tells me about being nervous for her plans to get back together with someone she previously dated. I put my hand on her arm as she sounds noticably stressed talking about it. I casually bring up that my room mate was flirting with her at a past event, and she sounds interested. I warn her about him being a Lady's man, but she keeps talking about how hot he is. 

She starts to fall asleep mid-sentance, and I move my arm and roll over, finally ready to sleep. I pass out pretty fast, and wake up only a few hours later (930) to her telling me she has to take care of some stuff and needs me out. I notice she sounds a bit cold, and doesn't get up to hug me or say goodbye.  I drive home and pass out. 

Later I tried to figure out what was wrong, and I text her. She doesn't respond. I send her another message, this time asking if I was a little too touchy for her liking. I realized that I was drunk and we were having a conversation that made me want to comfort myself and her even more. She replies that she was pretty uncomfortable with the the touching, and I apologise sincerely, stating that I wasn't trying to get with her or be sexual. I love this girl like a sister. 

We are both working and I try to apologise and clarify as best I could. It doesn't really go anywhere and she eventually says she doesn't want to talk about it anymore, or in the future. 

I'm very anxious, concerned for our friendship, and angry at myself for not catching any hints. I feel a void with not being able to talk to anyone about this, and I hope that she doesn't tell all her friends that I did something terrible.  I have a girlfriend, and I didn't do anything with Jess that felt particular wrong in the moment, and frankly I've done those same things with anyone from my girlfriend's friends to my own gay friends. 

I'm just at a loss for words. I acknowledge that even though I was comfortable with what I did, she felt differently, but I really didnt get the sense that anything was wrong. The only options I feel I have at this point are to do nothing and see if my relationship with her and her friends gets destroyed, or to message one of Jess' friends and try and get some insight into what happened.

86,"My boyfriend, roommate and my dog all live together in an apartment complex. There is a kid who lives here that is probably 10 years old, and every time I see him he loves to say hi to my dog. He recently asked my boyfriend if he could take him for a walk sometime so we said sure, what could it hurt as long as his parents know about it and are ok with it, and he is kept on his leash and away from the main road.

My main issue now, is that this kid WILL NOT LEAVE US ALONE.  He comes over every single day now, multiple times a day, and will ring the doorbell over and over until someone answers it. If I say today is not a good day,( i.e I will be leaving the house, taking a nap, generally wanting my dog to stay home with me etc.) he will just stand there and ask why not.

I bring my dog with me to work every day, and he has asked me multiple times to “just leave the dog with your boyfriend for me” I have tried to explain that all of us work, and my dog has some separation anxiety from me so he goes where I go for the most part.

If I am not home he will ask my roommate, and when my roommate says no because it is my dog and I am not home he will ask my roommate to call me. 

Yesterday I left my apartment to run some errands. He actually chased my car down the street until I saw him, and asked me to go back and give him the dog while I was gone. I told him I wasn’t going to let him have the dog while I wasn’t home. (My boyfriend and I have had to tell him this several times) and he sat there and begged me until I said sorry I can’t and rolled my window up. 

Don’t get me wrong I feel for this kid, he’s very sweet and loves dogs but can’t have one. He told us his mom is scared of them. I know he just wants a buddy. But I can’t deal with the constant doorbell ringing, begging and being hunted down every time I leave my apartment.

To not go into incredible detail of the months of falling out. I believe a friend Joey, who use to love her, was jealous that Jane and I were getting closer and started the whole drama with Jane and I. Jane is not a confrontational person so when I asked her what was off, she said she was emotionally maxed out and didn't want to have deep conversations for some reason.

•He has explicitly told her and made a list of the things about her, both physical and personality wise, that he would like better if she changed.

•He’s openly sexist, and racist and uses harsh vulgar words (fag, retard, nword) 

•he has broken up with her upwards of 20 times in their duration together - I wish I was kidding.

This guy just wrecks my best friends, and breaks her heart over and over. She is an incredibly beautiful and smart human who deserves so much more than him.

They broke up again about 2 months ago and she said she done for real and we had this huge heart to heart about how he brings out the worst qualities in her, causes her to stress over everything and genuinely in just a bad influence on her life and she has been SO so so amazing and back to her old self since then
BUT her crappy EX reached it to me and her parents trying to get back in her life and she’s jumping back into it with him head first.

I genuinely don’t know what to do. I have tried supporting her, embracing the relationship and trying my best to see the good in him. Trust me-there is NONE. I have been honest with her, as has her family and other friends about how this guy is toxic, and that works for a few weeks until he comes back. 

If she keeps trying to make it work with him I don’t know how I can continue to be her best friend - and trust me that’d be the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. But I can’t keep giving her advice when she asks, only for her to ignore it all for 5 years. I can’t keep seeing her turn into an insecure shell of herself, or have her heart broken. I feel like I need to be there for her, but I genuinely don’t know how when I don’t support this.

93,"I’m a software engineer

So basically I was in an incredibly toxic work environment for the last 3 years or so. The kind of place where people quit after a month. The kind of place with 1 star on Glassdoor by multiple reviews.  I was recently fired, the reason being that they felt I wasn’t being as efficient as normal. This burnout has effected most engineers, with a solid 8/10 engineers leaving. I’m wondering if this job just broke me. 

Now I’ve officially been away from programming ANYTHING for a month and... well... I don’t miss it at all. I feel no compulsion to return to it, no passion. I enjoyed creating something, and I knew I was very good at it, but I just feel... uninterested anymore. I know I used to get excited seeing new tech coming out and looked forward to learning it. I would read about it on the train and look forward to doing it. I also never had a problem getting a job. 

But it feels like things have changed. 

When I go to interviews there’s just this... disconnected feeling. The vast majority of the time I would get “no” as an answer which feels like such a change from before. I’ve never gotten a no before now it seems like it’s a 9/10 times thing. 

On top of that I just feel like I’m not “part of the culture”. More often than not, I feel like they have a specific “ideal” person they’re measuring you against and points are deducted for how far you deviate from that. 

I think that’s part of the reason the tech sector is seen as homogenous — they’re biased against different personalities and backgrounds. I have been talking to two female friends who have been searching for MONTHS with no results. I honestly feel like the whole industry is toxic af. 

Now I have a few offers in hand but I just feel... not excited to start again. I feel like it’s gonna be another miserable, unhappy slog. More of the same. 

Am I just severely burned out, or is this a sign to do something else? What should I do?",14Jul2019,1

So I was wondering how much money can she ask for from the hospital for this situation?",14Jul2019,1
95,"Hey there. This may sound long and stupid to some people, but here it goes anyway. I feel like i have to tell a bit about my mother's relationships before i begin talking about the issues that came with her last one.

My mother had quite a tough life. Got her first child when she was 17, married the father and he dumped her after a couple years - barely supporting her financially with the child. 

Later, when hit 20, she dated a men in another estate who said that wouldn't take care of her kid, so she left her son with her mother.  She got pregnant again and had to leave him after he physically abused her and the kid more than a few times. She flees with the kid and starts living with her mother in a third estate. She is a single mother of two and is barely making ends meet, even with her mother and father helping her as much as she can.

Then my father comes in a year later, he takes care of both kids, she gets pregnant twice - this is when i come into the picture and, five years later, my little sister. 
 
Now, both my parents where present during my early childhood. We lived in a small city, they both had good well paying jobs that, even though i spent most of the entire day alone with my brothers playing ps1, we always went out to eat, had family parties and all that dream stuff most kids can't even imagine. I was happy. 

Then, my father gets fired for no reason and we move out to another estate (with better opportunities) while he sues the bank he worked for years. My elder brother decides to stay with his grandmother, so only my other brother, my sister myself pack pur bags. My father starts working at a more time-demanding job in a local paint factory that went bankrupt a few years down the line, my mother works on telemarketing to help paying the bills. 
They manage to get a fully paid, built from zero, home together due to some saved up money they had in the past and life goes on again... Until my mother cheats on him. 

Now, i'm not dumb. My father wasn't the best man ever - he was a distant,  sometimes workaholic, self pity bastard back then and he still manages to pull that behaviour sometimes nowdays. A divorce was coming sooner or later, but it really hurt when i, a 15 year old boy read all those messages in my mom's phone and email saying explicit things to other men (yes, i investigated) . 

My father found out, got the divorce and she got full custody along with the house (his choice). I hated my mother for what she done and hated even more when she placed a stranger man to live with us just a few months after my father left. My brother was already a difficult person to deal with, so when he finally clashed with her new boyfriend, they BOTH kicked my BROTHER out when he was still underage. My father helped him with a place to live.

When i reach 16, i get a job and start spending most of my time away from home due to pure disgust of my step-father. I spend most of my free time with my girlfriend and her mother, only going home to check on my sister and to make sure my personal things were still there. Years later, the guy dumps my mother... Who kept most if not all of her money after they sold the house a year before and built his dream job (yes, she signed everything to his name). 

That was 3 years ago. I'm 23 now and only see her once every a few months because she is still taking care of my sister.

I never told her how i felt, never said a mean thing to her, but i also never said a good thing either. I walked away and i don't plan on making friends with her.

Lately she has been trying to talk to me, saying that she loves me and misses me a lot... In phone conversations, she even throws a occasional sorry here and there with no explicit background to it.

My elder brother has no opinion on the matter, my other brother hates her guts even today, my sister thinks i should talk to her... And i don't know. I think i need the opinion of internet strangers.

Me: “what the fuck are you doing”
Asshole: chill were just fucking around 
Friend: yeah it’s okay

He takes this chance to leave.
I catch up to him after talking to them for a bit.
He tells me that he’s been being bullied for a whole year, how he does there hw and he forgot so they were kicking his ass. I told him to report it obviously, but he said he has and they ignore it/tell them to stop but don’t actually do anything about it. My friend is around 5,2 very small and frail so he can’t really defend himself from them.


So essentially I’m thinking of kicking there asses next time it happens, there’s 4 of them but I’m about 3 inches above the biggest kid(five eleven) I do power lifting and kickboxing and I got another friend who does powerlifting with me who’s down to fight(this kid is massive 6 feet muscular, 16 years old)
We r obviously not gonna run up to them and kick there asses, were gonna tell em to fuck off and if they say something retarded like “I do what I want”/or keep bullying my friend, were just gonna jump them.

I’m in a very trashy public school, even if we do start the fight, the biggest punishment is at the absolute most a couples days suspended, most likely scenario 95% is that nothing happens and the kids fuck off.

I’m really not sure if I wanna go through with this plan I’d appreciate advice

I got the job, finished the training, and have just finished my third shift. The shifts are 5-10 hours long and 3-4 times per week. It's a sizeable waterpark and I have a lot of jobs. I really enjoy the work and I get paid above minimum pay but there's a problem: the sun.

118,"Ok so I'm a 14 year old boy fresh out of middleschool. And around seventh grade I got a crush on this girl. We were already friends since sixth grade so I kind of realized I liked her. We only talked in school until eigth grade when she asked for my phone number. I texted her for like the first time a month after I got her number and it was on from there. Even though she rarely text me first I still feel like she actually wants to talk to me and have conversations because she always replies immediately and doesn't just give one word answers. So when school ends we still text a lot.

I've wanted to tell her that I like her or something since the end of seventh grade but I could never bring myself to do it. I kind of hinted at with this text convo in its glorious cringeynees:

Me: I got a question would you date yourself?

Her: I would

Me: I would date you too.

Me:I mean I would date myself.

Me: yah that'a totally what I meant

Her: Lol

*One hour later*

Her: I have something to tell you

Her:So I'm first I want to tell you that your a good friend. I hope that we can continue to be friends. I might be reading things wrong, and if I'm not, just pretend I didn't say this part.

Her: I understand if you don't reply

I don't reply. But this doesn't shake our friendship at all. I know I should've replied but oh well. After that I should've been fine with just be friends. But I couldn't I still had this huge crush on her.

Now that school is over we can't see each other because she's not allowed to so we can only text and call really. And we'll be going to different schools so I might only be able to see her like once a week because of a program.

But I still had a crush on her I couldn't shake.

It's been over a month since school ended we've talked a lot and still have a strong friendship.

But I still like her now I'm stuck whether I should tell in a proper way (as proper as it can get without being face to face) or I should just keep it in wait for the crush to go away. I just don't want to leave my only shot at that lame ass text and asking her if she could hang out and she isn't allowed to.

120,"So I graduated last June with a Master's in physics, and wasn't too sure what I wanted to do so I went on a working holiday visa in Australia. I've decided in this time that I want to pursue a PhD since I remember really loving doing experimental work and learning new things in lectures (to the point I would learn things beyond the scope of the course).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling for a bit now with landing a PhD but I've finally managed to get an opportunity. I'm not too sure whether to accept it or not however. My girlfriend has asked me to move to Canada with her (I am from the UK), and I absolutely love her. She's amazing and we get along together as though we were best friends. Doing this PhD would very likely mean the end of our relationship. Normally I'd side with focusing on my career, but during my interview for the PhD, I got the impression that the supervisors were quite unprofessional. They kept testing my knowledge in physics, which is fair since there is a lot of money invested into finding someone competent, but it was to the point of exam-level questioning. I kept saying it had been a year since I studied physics fully, and that my knowledge was a bit rusty. I was able to answer their questions generally and follow what they spoke about, but I wasn't able to answer the very specific elements of their testing-questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been thinking about working in Canada (on a working holiday visa) and I think I would quite like to do that too. The issue here is that I've really struggled to find work in Australia. I've only managed to land one interview since January despite handing out 5-10 application a day to a variety of roles. It's difficult for me to pinpoint exactly why this has been the case, but I think this might be because I'm only allowed to work for a maximum of 6 months with one employer on the Australian working holiday visa, but I also think it might be because I'm not a very competitive candidate. This time of not succeeding in finding work has really ruined my confidence in being able to find a PhD or work, and I'm scared that this might happen to me again in Canada (although Canada doesn't have that 6 month limit at all). I've tried looking for PhDs in Vancouver but I have absolutely no responses from any of the potential supervisors there (I've contacted about 15 and researched their work before introducing myself to them).

&amp;#x200B;

Doing a PhD would let me pursue my passion in learning and research but I am doubtful of the supervisors in that one opportunity I have, and I would have to give up a relationship that makes me very happy. Going to Canada lets me be with someone I love very much (I can see myself being with her in the very long term) and I could finally make a living for myself, but I am scared of not being able to find a career that will let my follow my ambitions since I am just not as competitive as local citizens.

I'm still very iffy about how I feel. I never felt this way in my last relationship, but that one was unhealthy and he used cancel dates all the time so when I actually saw him I was excited.

&amp;#x200B;

It's different with my current boyfriend. We see each other every Tuesday and Friday. I usually go over to his place, have lunch, have sex, watch something or go out on a date. I just don't get excited anymore when I see him anymore. I don't feel like my 'i love you too's"" are genuine anymore. Or even when I kiss him. Even when we have sex, it's enjoyable for me in the beginning but eventually I try to get him to orgasm faster so it can end faster. I get so tired after seeing him the whole day now. When before, I never wanted to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I have felt this way with my current boyfriend for a few months now. That feeling of butterflies started occurring less and less a while longer than that (ever since we have gotten more comfortable with each other). But I was okay when it happened because I knew I still loved him. Now... idk anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I actually saw him on Saturday instead and I did get excited to see him again at first. But it went away after an hour. We tried seeing each other once a week but he told me that wasn't enough for him so we started doing twice a week.

&amp;#x200B;

He really is my best friend. We can still talk up a storm. I've never had so much in common with someone. And I enjoy hanging out with him. It's just that... the feeling is empty now.

&amp;#x200B;

We would talk about our future together a lot. He really wants to move in together a few years after graduating. And I really did too, at the time. But considering how exhausted I get after seeing him, I don't know if I can see him everyday if we actually did. I don't know if I want to feel this way everyday for the rest of my life. Does that mean I don't see a future with him? I've started to wonder what my life would be like without him.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a one week trip planned in a few weeks. We're gonna be staying somewhere else in the city together the whole time. I was thinking that, depending on how I feel about the trip after, I would decide whether to break up with him or not. But I'm not sure if I should still do that, because I don't want to waste few hundreds of our dollars (considering we are broke college students).

&amp;#x200B;

When I think about breaking up with him, I do get sad and sometimes I cry. But to be fair, I get emotional like that when anything emotional is happening because I'm sensitive. And the thought of leaving a healthy relationship just sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

This may be terrible.. but I've been wondering what seeing other people could be like too.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to throw away a healthy relationship but I also don't want to realize that I have fallen out of love a little too late.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the possible situations that I think could be happening right now and what I could do:

1. I'm actually not in love with him anymore. I should break up with him.
2. What I'm feeling is normal. I'm taking him for granted.
3. Seeing him twice a week is making me exhausted. I should talk to him about seeing once a week. If he can't then I don't think it will work out (because he said he couldn't do once a week).
4. He is my best friend and honestly my only friend. I'm relying on him too much for 100% of my support. I could also be feeling that I'm not letting the other social aspects of my life being fulfilled.
5. We're stuck in a routine. But if this was the case.. how would I even go about it... aren't we going to be in a routine if we move in together in the future anyway?..

Please tell me what you think :(",14Jul2019,2
125,"So, I'm going to be as specific as possible here without risking my identity being revealed. This issue is incredibly fresh and very painful for me. It's a crossroads I'm ashamed I'm even at, so looking for advice within my personal circles has proven to be especially terrifying. So, I suppose it's all up to you guys what I should do in this scenario.
I am a 17 year old ftm male from oklahoma. Yes, oklahoma. Naturally, i faced a lot of pushback there in regards to my identity. But that's when I met person A. We began talking over the internet years ago, chatting and venting and having all kinds of fun. He just so easily took the pain away from me. He guided me through arguably the darkest times of my life so loyally. There were some points in time I could say he was my only friend, so it just sorta made sense when about two and a half years ago we started dating. He was my first boyfriend. At first it was incredible. Every moment was bliss, every hour i just fell harder and harder for him but the thing is.. he's 26. I'm a minor. He also lives in new hampshire. That's not the issue though, just part of it.
I can trust him with every single one of my secrets. I know he's legit, we take extreme precautions with our relationship to maintain healthy dynamics and make sure both of us are feeling good about everything that is going on. We have plans for the future too, we want to move in together and build a family in the next two years and it sounds perfect. It's a logical, safe, healthy decision for someone who doesnt really make those decisions... He is perfect in every way as a boyfriend. So why do I want to leave?
Why is it so hard for me to stick with this man who means the entire world and more to me? He is my best friend, he's the only person I really text or feel the urge to communicate with... But now another man came into my life. He's a coworker. He has a daughter, he's a grown man, and he lives in an rv. He's covered in red flags, he coaxed and coaxed and coaxed until finally i started sleeping with him. I feel fucking terrible. I hate myself for being in that situation but whats even more terrible is the fulfillment I get from him is tripple what i get from my boyfriend. He fights for me, he takes care of me as best as he can witb what little he has and he's honest. Every day he makes me laugh, he makes me smile. But now im finding when I text my boyfriend, I'm only feeling sadness and stress and like I'm trying to solve another puzzle as to why he's upset. But.. he and I still have so much history. We have miles, man.

I know it's fucked up in every way that I'm even feeling this way, but i cant make it go away. Person A wants a garunteed stable, apple pie life together and person B wants a nomadic entanglement of living paycheck to paycheck with a stepdaughter I'll be connecting with at 17... So what do I do? How can I get out of this mess, who should I choose, and jesus christ am I a monster?",14Jul2019,1
126,"We’ve been on quite a few dates, and I didn’t hate to say it in the beginning but now that I know I was his rebound I hate to say I lost my virginity to him. All these important things happened between us, he admitted he was getting feeling for me more than just liking each other, as stated we had sex, and in the beginning when I warned him I was going to college he said it would be okay if we stayed together well over summer we’d try to do our relationship from a distance while I’m in college. So I think it’s real, I asked him what was happening in our relationship to be sure and he said that he might not be okay with long distance but we’ll know when the time comes. And then tonight after a couple of days that seemed awkward and today a full day of silence I asked him if I screwed things up by asking where our relationship stands and he says he wants to be friends because his recent breakup with his ex is still troubling him. I won’t go into detail but the way he said is was basically I was a rebound. I’m sad but not mad at him, what can I do to get over it?",14Jul2019,2

130,"First and foremost i should mention that i am a 16 year old female,since i feel like that’s pretty important to this story. 
So recently i’ve been doing a precollege camp at a college in NYC and it’s the first time i’ve ever really been in the city by myself. I was on my lunch break and going to get something to eat (I was alone,which was pretty stupid of me to do now that i think about it) when suddenly I was approached by a young woman. She claimed to be 19 and told me that she needed help to feed her two young children. I dont remember the reason she told me why she needed money but she kept reassuring me that she wasnt homeless and that she had nothing to hide from me, so me being a gullible teenager i felt bad for her and believed her. She told me that she needed money to buy baby formula and groceries, so i agreed to help. As we were walking, she kept asking me somewhat invasive questions like “do you have a boyfriend?” and “are you christian?”She also asked me where I was from and I said new jersey and she said she was also from nj too. She then proceeded to give me her name,address,phone number,and ssn.
We then went to a nearby market to look for groceries and formula and the place ended up not having the right formula she usually buys so we left to go to a cvs where they also didnt have it. When we left,she asked me if i would come with her to buy the formula where she usually bought it and i immediately felt uncomfortable (i already was feeling iffy but it was at that point where the feeling doubled tenfold) and told her i couldnt since i would be late to class. It was also then when I asked if i could tell my parents about this and she insisted that i told nobody. 
I ended up giving her somewhere around $50 and gave her my name and phone number and she left,i never saw her again after this.
I left some stuff out just for the sake of brevity,but i just wanted to know if anyone else has had an experience like this and if i should be telling the authorities about this since now that i look back on it,everything about the interaction was strange and idk if this is common behavior for sex traffickers. thanks for your help.",14Jul2019,3
131,"This is gonna make me sound like a sociopath but I’m talking about my parents

How annoyed I am at their behavior and also the entire environment of this household in terms of the fact there is pet hair everywhere goes up and down with time but apparently I’ve hit that point, yet again, when I want to move out as fast as possible instead of “when I have the money”.  There is a lot of history behind this but I am also trying to make myself less of an internal asshole about this. These are mostly petty complaints but I don’t see my therapist for another month so I need help. 

In a month and a half I drive with my mom and my brother to a wedding that’s in another state. I do not want to ask for time off, prepare clothes for this wedding, ride in a car for hours with someone that I don’t like talking to nor the topics they talk about, attend a wedding full of people I don’t know and hope to god I don’t mess up, and then stay in a cabin overnight before heading back. 

I tried to opt out and was given the choice because we needed someone to stay at home with the cats and then my aunt called and was upset I wasn’t coming, and my dad has made it subtlely clear that he does not want to go either by listing off a variety of reasons why I could go or should go, so I said I would, and I regret that badly.

132,"So my girlfriend(22) and I(23) started dating 3 years ago. we were not having sex in first 6-7 months since she wasn't feeling ready. But we were making out all the time, having a foreplay and  leave it there. everything was good then, I didn't mind not having sex because she wasn't ready I respected that. and she had no problems with us making out all the time. so anyway, we started having sex, and she had no problem at first 2-3 months.(at least that is why I thougt.) then she started acting weird whenever we have sex. She says that she always in pain when we have sex. (I dont know if it is true or she is just lying to make me stop) recently she told me that she doesn't like having sex at all.

136,"Lately everything has been a downward spiral and I have lost most semblances of meaning in my life. For a long time, my goal was to be a good person, and I've been more in touch with religion. This worked for years, but as of late, life seems harsh and meaningless. 

My grandfather, a wonderful man who has been there for me my whole life, has a cancer of the jaw, and it's hard for people his age to fight that off. I'm hoping for the best. My cat of 7 years passed away from a cancer related illness about a month ago as well, and my grandmother on another side of the family is waiting to see if her cancerous optical illness stays in recession. 

This all has culminated to give me a crisis and made me scared. I built my belief system on there being a right and just God in my religion and that being a good person could carry you through a good, long life. I thought maybe good people might get a gentle, easy death. (I know this is idealism and totally false, but it provided comfort to me.)  But it seems like there's no natural justice of any kind, and that it really doesn't matter what you do.

In the end, we all end up in the ground from a random, brutal cause. I still want to be a good person for the sake of it, but I have no cause, and my system of beliefs has been wiped out. How do I find motivation and meaning to keep going in such a randomly harsh world?",14Jul2019,1
137,"For the past year or so, I've been struggling mentally (on and off in severity). I haven't really told anyone other than my boyfriend. He is always very caring, considerate and willing to help, but I don't want him to take on the role of a therapist. 

I feel like, although my life seems great from the outside, I am somewhat always anxious and dissatisfied with things and with myself in particular. I'm going to use bullet points because my thoughts are just so over the place. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Career and academics: I am in a high-stress educational program (post-grad) that was a lot of work to get into. I am doing well academically here, but I still constantly feel like I am somehow not reaching my potential or that I am holding myself back. I find myself in spirals of negative thoughts, worries about the future, and feeling like I am not good enough. 

\- Body image and eating: this has been occupying a large amount of mental space, and frankly, I'm exhausted. I've always eaten healthy and worked out and been thin, and I am on the lower end of what is considered a healthy BMI. However, it still doesn't feel enough for me. I have been struggling with restricting and bingeing episodes, and I feel like it has become so mentally consuming for me, and a channel of control. I have no need to do this - I used to eat completely normally and was essentially the same size. I just feel like I can't stop now. It has become an outlet of control. 

\- Relationships: I have been so busy with my program and program-related job lately that I haven't found the time to connect with people, even though I'd like to. I'm in a serious relationship with someone who goes over and beyond to make me feel loved, supported and secure. However, I still find myself obsessing about what is going on in his head, and I have this deep-rooted fear that he will wrong me in some way and I will never find out about it. I know it sounds paranoid, and he hasn't really done anything to make me not trust him. I just know people are not perfect and I fear that we are not on the same page about something and he will do something disrespectful toward me. It's stupid because he is a very respectful boyfriend and is always respectful about my boundaries, but I cannot help but have these stupid obsessive thoughts that he is going to fuck up or that he isn't ""good enough"" in that sense. 

\- Intense fear of making mistakes: It is hard for me, sometimes, to start new tasks or to get through tasks because I have a fear of making mistakes or doing something wrong. I find myself reading things over and over for spelling and grammatical errors, thinking about things too much, and checking things over and over. I look at my stupid fucking alarm about a million times before I go to bed to make sure it is set right. I check to make sure I unplug my hair tools and other appliances multiple times, and I will only be satisfied with how I've ""checked"" it if I have given full attention to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I'm mentally struggling a lot now, and I don't know why or what to do. I feel like I am losing control of myself, and my life. I have no idea how to get a hold of all of this. This all makes me feel like I have low self-esteem - I don't trust my own judgement, I feel like I am ""not enough"" and even when someone is showing me they love me, I still think that it MUST be too good to be true because they will fuck up at some point.",14Jul2019,1
138,"Some days ago, a one friend of mine sent me the nudes of a girl, asking me what was my opinion about her (not about her body, but about her personality). I rarely lie, so I told him that I honestly think that she's very cute and that she's a nice person overall - the fact that she sent her nudes to some asshole that then sent them to his friends doesn't make me think less of her. I'm not planning to tell her who sent me her nudes because the guy that sent them to me didn't do it maliciously, he did it because he likes my way of thinking and that stuff, so I guess he wanted to know what I would say about it (as I said before, he asked me about her personality and my opinion about her, not her body; plus, he didn't say nasty things about her and I know for sure that he isn't the guy that she sent her nudes to).

She's been very nice to me when I was having a bad time, and I've showed her my support when she was having a bad time as well. The thing is that even though I usually can handle these things effectively and that I've never failed at speaking or conveying ideas accurately, I still feel like I can't do it.

I still haven't deleted them, because maybe she can recognize who was the one guy that she sent her nudes to (in case that she hasn't sent the same nudes to different guys, of course). But I feel incredibly uncomfortable just by thinking how we both would feel if I send her her own nudes for her to remember.

What are some things that I should take into account? Any advice you can give me will be welcome. If you can at least tell me how would you feel in her situation it would be helpful, then I could act to make things easier for her

139,"I’m so incredibly lonely and bored with my life. I know the first thing that pops into people’s mind that do not exactly understand, is either “wow what a loser” or “that’s their fault” which not gonna lie I guess is kinda true. But that’s not the point here. I’m not posting this for pity, in fact I absolutely hate pity and I don’t want people to feel sorry for me. I just want someone to understand and give me advice. That’s all I want.

Honestly, I’ve lived a pretty hard life. I’ve never really had a lot of friends or rather, people that I could actually call a TRUE friend. When I was younger, I did have friends but that honestly didn’t last long because eventually they moved away, then I moved away and we lost contact.

After that, I lived a pretty isolated life. I’ve always been really shy and as I got older, developed extremely bad social anxiety. Which makes simply going out in public, or trying to make friends a true pain. And I absolutely hate it. But this isn’t the only reason I don’t have friends. I personally feel like I’m a huge waste of time, I’m not worthy of friendship or love whatsoever, and honestly I just don’t think anyone would want to be friends with me. Nobody ever comes to me first. It’s always i either hit them up first or we just never talk. Which obviously means they don’t wanna talk to me in the first place.

I do have a few internet friends but they all have become I guess... too busy for me nowadays. They all have a lot of real life friends, jobs and just better things to do. and I kinda feel like I’m the last resort to them. They also live hours away. People only text me when their bored or horny and I’m so fuckin’ tired of it.

Most people my age have a lot of friends, are always invited to things, have really exciting lives and everything. I envy them so much... why can’t I have that? I scroll through social media all the time and see all these happy people my age hanging with all their friends and just truly living their best lives. But I’m just here doing nothing.

I’ve really ran out of options here and I’ve fallen into a deep depression. I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I’m a really interesting person and anyone should be glad to be my friend.",14Jul2019,28
140,"So, I’m 17 and going to be 18 in two months. My driving test is scheduled in two months also. I got my first driving lesson around two weeks after I hit 17 and things went smoothly, I certainly didn’t like driving and avoided it at all costs but my mother would force me and I’d have to, albeit reluctantly, get behind the wheel. But it was fine for a certain while but...
The more I drove the more I started to absolutely hate it, I’d make a small mistake and someone would put their middle finger up at me, or they’d pass me really rudely, honk at me, etc. But they were right, I was making mistakes and not being a good driver but there where times when I could just cry behind the wheel. Now, I’m not that bad with criticism but for some reason when I’m on the road it just really, really gets to me and it eats at me for hours. 
One of the last times I went driving two cars in front of me got into a fight and the drivers stepped out of their cars and got physical. I had no idea what to do and around five cars behind me started to honk and yell at me. My mom told me to just ignore it but I was freaking out and eventually cried and found some way to get out of there. 
My mom would always play off things as being easy, I presume to soothe me but it just makes me feel pathetic. We’d have to do this weekly trip to the same spot and there was this extremely narrow road (think 11feet/3.5m wide) and other cars would pass next to me and I would absolutely sweat bullets.
Then exam season of school arrived. And because I was so busy I didn’t have to drive for around three months, I’d make up excuses if she tried to persuade me or just give empty promises of postponement, 

Now my mom wants me get behind the wheel again, with my usual driving school but I just don’t want to! I’ve already told her I don’t want to fricking learn it and I don’t care, I don’t want it! I quit! She says driving is essential and necessary but I just don’t want to because I’m really fucking scared!! 

I thought my fear wasn’t that bad but after a yelling match with my parents and angstily retreating to my room I was served my very own first panic attack!! Wooooohoooo!! Oh man, not being able to breathe is a joy, isn’t it? ...Every image I can think of involving driving and me behind the wheel creates tears in my eyes and a shortage of breath, my heart’s literally pounding typing this and thinking of driving. It’s mostly parking, parking really scares me...

I really don’t know what to do... Every time the word driving and me get together I start crying and I don’t want to cry in front of either my parents or driving instructor. I’m pretty sure if I were to go behind the wheel I’d spontaneously lose breath and freak out. Everything about it gives me anxiety (which I’ve never had before up until now). I don’t want to embarrass myself in front of anyone or disappoint my parents by not driving and failing my test... I absolutely have no idea what to do...

Background: I am a 13yr female, and my parents are divorced(this is important) and my dad lives with his mom(this is a sensitive topic for me, please don’t judge)

GM = my dads mom, I don’t like calling her grandma because my grandma on my moms side is so sweet and this one I’m talking about is a awful person.

So, because of my age, I’m starting to mature and obviously it’s showing. Around 6 months to a year ago my GM has been making uncomfortable comments. At first, it was just comments like= did you start yet? I hate talking about this subject and said no. She responded with something like,”why are you lying?” It doesn’t matter if I’m lying or not, for me it’s a very private issue! She continued to make inappropriate remarks and I started to tell my dad. He would yell at her and then it would be fine. Then a couple weeks later she would continue. I haven’t told my mom because my mom and dad used to always argue but they are finally getting along. This all changed for me the other day when I went to my aunts pool. A lot of people were coming over(all on my dads side) and so I went outside, where GM and my aunt( GMs daughter) we’re standing. We were alone and they were talking. Eventually GM said,” (my name)’s growing boobies.” She and my aunt laughed and I told her to stop. I told my dad later about it and he said he would yell at her. I don’t know if he did but I think he forgot. I really don’t know if I should tell my mom. I want to but I feel like she would be mad at me for not telling her sooner. I also feel like she doesn’t do it enough we’re it’s a actually problem.. I hate my parents fighting and I don’t want to cause a problem.

148,"My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. We met in college and after graduation we decided to move in together. It’s been going great so far. We’re both very busy with work but we still find opportunities to spend quality time together. He’s a kind, thoughtful, and caring guy, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

However, there is one thing about him that bothers me. In college my boyfriend was a big “gamer”. In fact, we met each other when he came over to play video games with my roommate. At the time I thought nothing of it, but in the back of my head I always kind of assumed he would stop once we graduated like most people. Unfortunately, he didn’t. 

Needless to say, I think it is kind of lame for a grown man to be playing video games. It makes me uncomfortable and a little embarrassed that my boyfriend is into something so childish. In some ways, it even makes me less attracted to him. Last night before bed I called him into the bedroom, hoping to initiate some sexy times. He replied “in a minute”. I could hear he was playing his xbox in the living room. Ten minutes later he comes into the bedroom and gives me a kiss, but at that point I was no longer in the mood. He could tell something was upsetting me, and when he asked I was honest with him about the way his gaming habit made me feel. I told him I wanted him to get rid of the xbox. He said I was being unreasonable. It escalated into a fight, and we both went to bed upset.  

Is it really so crazy that I want my boyfriend to act like a grown man? We’re not teenagers anymore, and it’s time for him to act the part. I want to give him some sort of ultimatum, but I’m worried it will lead to more fighting. What can I do to get him to stop playing video games?",14Jul2019,0

150,"Before we begin, this is going to be a lot tamer than the typical post on this sub (from what I have seen anyway),

I HATE reading, but I don't want to, I wish I loved reading, and I cannot find anything useful on the internet, let me explain my situation a little bit...

This is not really tied t anything that happened in my life, since I could speak (I started speaking at 4 years old), I have had no interest in reading. I did not like school, or math, or really anything, I was kind of a lame child. I always sort of liked learning, just not 'important' things. Towards the end of middle school (grades 6, 7 and 8), I loved learning about science (I always loved science tbh), and in high school I began to take math more seriously. I am now a college freshman, and I have a shakey basis in math (it is now my favorite subject). I wish to re read textbooks and mathematical books to acquire a deeper understanding, and I love the content. I can watch hours of math content on you tube, and I can do many tasks like programming, drawing, studying for HOURS on end, with no issues. but within 5 minutes or so of reading, even for topics I care about, and find interest in, I'd rather do something else. That SUCKS, because there are so many good books and authors out there, and I wish I could enjoy reading, I really do, but I don't. Does anyone who was in my position, who disliked reading, end up finding a way to enjoy it? If so, please help me achieve the same :)

155,"I originally wrote this thread for /r/AmItheAsshole , but they blindly deleted it because ""it incited violence"" so I'm turning to you for advice.

throwaway for obvious reasons.

so here's the background story, my dad was very abusive when I was a child, he'd hit me and my sisters constantly, we dread the time he comes from work because we know we will be slapped and hit for the littlest reason, he sometime would lock me up in my room for days so much that I've established a ""pee corner"" to do my business, I got the most of it out off all my sibling and I'm glad that he didn't take most of it on my sisters (I'm the middle child out of 6 and only male btw). he even threw me out of the house for the night I don't remember why, so I walked to my grandma's to spend the night, when I arrived there my grandma called him and asked him why I was at her house at night alone, so he came and got me and beat the shit out of me for embarrassing him by telling my grandma that he thew me out, and made me sleep inside by the front door.

Mind you all of this shit happened when I was 12 or younger, and there are many many stories I don't have the opportunity to share today.

as a teenager I started standing up to him and sometime hitting back, I'd get the shit beaten out of my but I'd get my share, he stopped the hitting for the most part. through out high school we didn't speak a word to each other and I wouldn't even look at him when I walk past him, after high school I got out of the house and went to college in the same city just to be close to my sisters whenever they needed me, and in that time he got diagnosed with cancer, got an operation to remove it and that's that, after that our relationship was much better considering the past, we weren't on the best terms but we were on speaking terms, two years after the cancer came back very aggressively, so he started getting Chemo without positive results.

now here is the point of the post, he wants me to take him to his appointments, take care of him when he's at home etc. I said no I won't and he wasn't a good father to deserve me taking care of him and I bounced, I started getting calls from my mother, my uncles, aunts and all sort of family and family friends, telling me that I'm a bad son, and how my poor dad needs me in his time of need, mind you these are the same people that knew of my dad's abuse and decided to not get involved, so I changed my number and they started showing up at my door, it got so overwhelming so I found a job out of the country and left there without telling anyone but my close friends.

but being in a foreign country made me reflect a lot and even doubt myself on the decisions I made, especially thinking of my sisters and how they must feel abandoned by me.

157,So I met this guy almost 10 years ago. We’ve stayed in touch on and off since then. Since the first time I met him I felt this super strong connection and that feeling has never left me.

We’ve also talked about a possible future together a few times.I would drop everything for this guy. I would move and do anything to make it work. I’ve always thought about him and the connection seems to be stronger now than ever. I’m not sure if he feels the same because like I said even though we have kept in touch we don’t really know each other that well.

161,"I am an incoming Sophomore and I am thinking about transferring to another university. I am studying molecular biology and both schools are relatively at the same 'prestige' with my major. There are great research opportunities at both schools so I am not transferring for that reason. At my current university, I have thought about transferring from day 1. I had a horrible experience with move in and I didn't make a lot of friends in my first year. I had a certain expectation going into college and my school doesn't offer it--mostly due to the lack of diversity. I tried to join clubs and went out and did find friends, but the friendships didn't feel genuine and I expect to lose contact with most of them soon. I couldn't stop thinking about my high school friends ( I still see them when I go back home and travel to meet up with friends that went to college nearby).  And by the end of the first semester, I was ready to go back to home state uni--since I was attending an out-of-state college, but realized I couldn't overcome the family problems I left -- the reason why I left my home state in the first place. My main reason why I am attending this university is that my mom didn't want me to go too far for school--originally debated on So Cal, Boston, and NYC ( I applied to roughly 26 colleges because I was desperate to go out of state for college). But I ended up in the middle of the US. I don't hate it here, it's beautiful. And there are many out of state students who pay a lot of money to go here. But I don't really relate to their first world problems as I worked my ass off in high school to get scholarships since my parents couldn't pay for school. But now that my little sister is applying for college this year, my mom said that she regrets stopping me from going to the school I really wanted to go to because she knows how much my first year sucked. And I know the first year usually sucks for everyone but I had a really hard time because I felt so alone and unmotivated since I couldn't adjust to the school. And now I don't really see a point in trying to stay at a school I attended to be closer to my home state since I moved out and got an apartment in the state of my out-of-state college because of the family problems. But I did find some good friends here and that's the reason why I declined my guarantee transfer offers--I was scared of transferring and the thought of having to start over was overwhelming for me. I just wanted to settle for what was available for me here. And I thought transfers rarely happened but I was wrong. It turns out a few of my fellow out of state friends are not coming back this fall and that changed my perspective again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that led me to look for other colleges. One of my friends go to a university pretty far from my home state, and that's the college I am thinking about transferring to. He tells me that there is more diversity and that there are a lot of people who I will get along with. 

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that I have a full-ride scholarship to the university I am at right now--basically getting paid to go here. But if I transfer I would have to get a small loan to cover my EFC. But is it worth staying at a university where I will constantly wonder what it could have been like if I went to a different school but leaving debt free, or going to a university that frankly will match more of the diverse experience I was hoping to find but leaving with a debt before going to graduate school. I am torn because I don't want debt if I have the option to finish my undergrad debt free, but I also don't want to constantly wish I was somewhere else. And if the academic prestige is similar in both university, is it worth transferring just for diversity?",14Jul2019,1

However the first school I worked at the senior management made my life (and other people’s lives) hell.

167,"Is my band teacher racist?

Okay. So I am a 15 yr old (Freshman) African American female and my two friends, (I’ll call them S and C,) are respectively both 15 (Freshmen) and are white females. This might be relevant later on.

So we have two different band classes in my school, The Symphonic band and Wind Ensemble. Me and my friends are both in the Symphonic band. In our band, I play the trumpet though we already have several other trumpets in the band, (Around nine of us, and the Wind Ensemble has five trumpets?) Anyways the alto saxophone section in Symphonic band has only three alto saxophones, (And the Wind Ensemble has four alto saxophones.) S and C both play alto saxophones in the Symphonic Band. 

Anyways around the last few weeks of school, I decided that I wanted to play the Euphonium for the 2019/2020 school year, so I wanted to try it out before the 2018/2019 school year ended. Especially since we’ll only have two Euphoniums in the 2019/2020 school year, I thought my switch would make sense seeing as I only play third trumpet, and my presence wouldn’t be missed in the trumpet section. However when I asked my band teacher to make the switch, he just instead told me to play my trumpet.

However several days later, (very close to the end of the school year) S and C ask our band teacher if they could switch to play the Bari saxophone for the next school year, to which our teacher replies with pulling out some Bari saxophones from the back of his office and allows them to practice the saxophones in a practice room, while the rest of us get free time to study and etc. 

I don’t understand why this is the case? Our teacher allowing them to try out the instruments doesn’t make much sense considering that if the two of them DO make the switch, then we’d only have a couple saxophones (because the incoming ninth graders automatically join the Symphonic Band) in the Symphonic Band for the 2019/2020 school year. My switch (in my mind) actually seems to make more sense than S and C’s switch. 

Is there something I’m missing here, because I really don’t believe my band teacher is racist, however everything else doesn’t add up. Plus he’s one of my favorite teachers and I want to see things from his POV, before I make any assumptions. I just need some opinions, please!",14Jul2019,1

Also when I start conversations with people I really want to get to know I'll never remember the main points of conversation and it's almost like it never happened. I won't even look them in the yeys sometimes and just look behind them and doze off EVEN if I dont want to do that because I started the conversation. Sometime I dont even know I'm doing it!!!

I asked my dad about this but he refused to believe that I have adhd and that he use to do that too so it's normal. He even joked that as a kid his mom brought in someone to see if he had some sort of problem because he couldn't pay attention. Its almost like he refuses to believe that ADHD exists.

Further more even though I'm ranked 2nd in my class and everyone thinks I'm smart, in reality I feel like I struggle the most to keep up and my work ethic is the only thing I have going for me. Homework for one class can take me 6 HOURS. IM NOT EXAGGERATING.  Especially English because I keep reading the same lines over and over for like 3 minutes before I move on.

I just am at a loss for what to do and if I should ask someone or if this is normal behavior or idk. Even if I was to ask a specialist how would I go about doing it. I'm 17 to keep in mind. This is something that has been bugging me for awhile and I just reallyyy need help guys

Normally this woman is callous and seems to hate me a great deal, so when I heard that come from her mouth I almost started convulsing in shock. But, with a few drinks in me, i dry humped her like I was a PBR champion, and rode her till she bucked me off when my father in law met up with us.

190,"Apologies if this is unorganized, poorly formatted, or hard to read through. It was kinda rushed.

My sister is 9F and I'm 16M. She's a brat and annoys me constantly. I can't get a break.

Some things she does are:

\-Flinging Boogers on my wall

\-Licking my limbs or Spitting On Me

\-Jumping On my Bed

\-Rushing Into My Room Then Closing and Locking The Door and refusing to leave

\-Blasting (often inappropriate) music that I hate

\-Taking my belongings and often licking them as well

\- Jumping on my bed (Classic)

\-Using My Computer without permission

\-Doing things that she knows are pet peeves of mine, like sticking her feet up in front of the TV while I'm watching it.

\-Rubbing her feet on things I put my head on, like pillows

\-Manipulating   me and my parents. For example, she'll say she wants to do something,   then once we set the thing up and start it, she (says she) doesn't want to do it    anymore, wasting our time.

\-Hiding and rearranging my stuff

\-Saying that she did something else gross to a piece of food I ate, then won't confirm if she actually dd or not.

\-Physically hurting me (or at least attempting to)

\-Throwing food at me or in my room

\-Crying when she doesn't get her way or faces retaliation from me

\-Being a hypocrite

\-Copying me

\-Getting sensitively angry over petty things

\-Doing little manipulative things throughout the day that go unnoticed by my parents (they add up, causing me frustration)

\-I can't tell when she's telling the truth or when she's lying

Keep    in mind she does these things frequently. She does almost everything    I've listed and more at least multiple times per day. She's the most    gross entitled brat I have encountered and I have to live with her. I'm    not depressed or anything, but I used to be, and she's on the brink  of   bringing my depression and suicidal thoughts back. I have a  constant   headache when she does these things. Thank god she  goes to a   school-run summer camp for most of the day. I actually feel  bad for the   staff and other kids that have to deal with her. But when  she's here,   she either raises hell or plots something mischievous in  secret. She'll   be the most innocent inconspicuous little girl one  moment, then the  next  be the most annoying Problem Child you'll ever  deal with. She's  nearly  on par with the kid from that movie. My  parents attempt to  punish her  with minor physical punishments, but  physical punishments  rarely work  from my experience and from what I've  heard. I've suggested  giving her  psychological punishments to my  parents, but they just  dismiss it and  tell me I don't know anything  about parenting. They're  right, I barely  know anything about  parenting, but psychological  punishments make the  most sense in this  particular situation, at least to me. I  could be wrong though.  Also, I  do try to spend time with her, but every  single time I spend  time  with her, she does at least one of the things  mentioned on the list. I  do try my hardest to give her positive  attention, so the ""you're only  giving her negative attention"" argument  isn't valid here. We play  Minecraft and Jackbox frequently, but it's  getting harder to force  myself to play games with her in general because  she responds with   bratty annoying behavior no matter what kind of  attention I give her  and we often end up arguing. My parents attempt to  ""resolve"" our  arguments by making us not talk to each other instead of  letting us  explain our sides and getting the full context. How is that a   resolution? That's preventing us from reaching a resolution. 

Side note:   I'm a musician, and I think her constant state of behavior is    indirectly causing me to have writer's block and lack of motivation with    music and in general. Her level of annoyance and mischievousness has    been increasing for as long as I can remember and I don't see it going    away anytime soon. She finds exponential joy in annoying other people    and causing misery, it seems.

What    can I do in this situation? How do I avoid her or at least her    behavior? What can I do to stop/discourage her behavior? Is this even    normal behavior for a 9-year-old girl? Are my parents going about    dealing with this the wrong way? I'm powerless and her constant    annoyance is causing me constant misery and headaches. I don't know what to do. Please help.",14Jul2019,1
191,"Throwaway because I don't want this on my main.

I'm also on mobile.

Jim moved in a year ago. He brought his dog (12 years old) with him. She was his first dog and he loved that dog like she was his child. sadly, she died a few months after they arrived. not a month later and he wants another dog. we told him to wait and give himself more time to grieve but low and behold he gets the dog anyway. this dog looks JUST like his old dog. they both are the same age and have the same  history of abuse. and I'm all for adopting dogs of all kinds but him getting an identical looking dog a month after his first dog died worried me.

 as soon as it was clear to him that this dog is actually nothing like his old dog personality wise, he began to say some pretty awful things about her, like ""are you dead yet?"", ""we should give you back"", ""im gonna let you run away""  and the most recent when I let her out of her crate when he got home (we arrived at the same time) 
Jim : ""who let her out?"" 
me: ""I let her out because she's happy you're home""
Jim: ""I wasn't ready to deal with her yet. I guess it's time for me to pretend to love her!"" ( which he then proceeds to not even pretend, and ignore her)

there was one time where the dog had jumped up on the couch, which would have been a good time to like, tell her to get down or something non violent. but he full force kicked her off, and she hit the wall. he immediately got up and comforted her and apologized and she was fine but what the fuck. i was shook and couldn't really say anything but ""oh my god is she ok""

Jim works 10-12 hours a day, with 3 days off a week. his dog gets little to no attention even on his days off. he doesnt walk her or anything. bf and i take her to the park sometimes but she's hard to handle, and shes not our dog. 

the dog also has skin problems that bother her constantly. she licks herself raw. and she looks awful. he's taken her to the vet but he either  isnt great at distributing meds or the meds arent working. he has yet to take her back. and he has a job and income that he could spend on another vet bill, but instead of the vet he has bought a shotgun ""for protection"" amongst other things that could wait until his dog is healthy. i hate seeing her like this but i dont have the funds for any vet bills. 

now, we got her from a rescue in a city about 45 minutes away. she was very active and happy with the rescue when we went to visit her, much unlike the dog that mopes around and sleeps in her bed all day long. the lady who took care of her LOVED this dog. she cried when we took the dog. and she said if anything came up then she would take the dog back. besides his pride and ego, theres no reason to not give her back if he truly doesnt like her. and from my perspective, how could he if hes treating her this way? i feel she would be much happier with anyone else at this point.

bf has tried to be neutral through all this because hes known this guy for years and theyre friends. im lowkey very upset about it but i hate confrontation. bf spoke to him a while back about at least taking her to the vet, which was what sparked him to do so. 

i dont know what to do. i feel like a giant asshole because i cant really do anything about it. i want to talk to him but i dont know what to say and i dont want to come at him wrong and upset him.  i truly feel this dog is being neglected emotionally and physically (the lack of a vet and the kicking) by him.

193,"I have only told one person this story, but I remember a girl, let's call her Jane, who would play a game with me when I came to her house for playdates. I only vividly remember the game, but I can't erase it from my mind. I get chills just from thinking about it. We were both probably between the ages of 8-10, I can't remember very well . So I remember the game going like this. 
The game called ""Doctor""
1. I would strip down to naked
2. We would both get under the covers
3. She, as the doctor would begin to touch me all over. The most uncomfortable and disturbing part I can remember was her checking my butt. 
4. Finally, we would get dressed and continue our day.
The reason I have kept quiet for so long was because I have no idea if any of this actually happened. I hope it was just some weird dream but then again, it feels so real. Even if it was a dream, how did I imagine something so messed up? Please, tell me if you think this actually happened. Ever since Jane joined the public school system (she used to be homeschooled) every time I see her I can't stop thinking about it. 
PS: I also remember an incident where my little sister and Jane's little brother were getting ready to play the game. Mom caught them and told my sister she couldn't get in a bed with a boy.

That’s no something I’m up for so this relationship isn’t going great. 

Now to the main subject. I have a group of friends I hang out with and while spending the night at my boys house I got bunked with this girl who liked me (call her B) and I had a little alcohol in my system... we only made out, not that that’s ok but it’s better than us getting it on. So the worst part is I’m good friends with B and I am just now realizing I like her a lot. Falling asleep with her in my arms was one of the best feelings I’ve ever felt. But I know I’m an awful person for it.

Meanwhile my girlfriend had been ignoring my texts for four days, can’t lie other than her hatred of electronic communication she’s fine, maybe a tad weird, there’s just not a connection like I feel with B.

I have a complex situation and I genuinely don’t know who to turn to about it.

Two friends of mine that I’ve know for, well almost as long as I can remember got together about 18 months ago after only meeting a couple years ago. One of the friends, my best friend we’ll call D and the other person will be N.

N has always been, well to put it nicely a bit open with their body to just about anyone. This actually becomes important.

D is just an amazing person, compassionate, loyal, funny, caring, basically one of the few good people I know.

Anyway they started dating and everything was going great for them.

But about ~12 months ago, N began to show their colors. They asked for an open relationship so they could sleep with a person who was about 5 years older than us all. And D did it because they love N.

N wanted D to spend their very small paycheck 100% on them and nobody else. D did it because D was completely consumed by love.

N brags all the time about how they scam people on tumblr with fake sob stories and constantly begs friends and even my fucking mother once for cash so they can buy a FUCKING ALBUM they can get for free on Spotify which they also convinced D to pay for.

N then turned up the heat.

Recently they “caught short term feelings” for a friend of mine. N became completely consumed by the “need to resolve these feelings” AKA fuck this friend. They joined a play to get closer to them and started spending all their time with this friend.

After the performance the play went to a diner where N asked this friend to smack Ns ass right in front of D, this friend immediately became confused and said no. N talks still about how it was “Ds fault for being to loving around N” and how D “ruined Ns chance”. D is in a manipulative, abusive relationship and they don’t want to admit it. It’s horrifying, N has done a bunch of other terrible things to demand attention and financial support from random people like draining a friends paypal etc. this is just some of the mean things N has done. I want to get D out of this relationship but I don’t know how, D says it’s whatever and it’s okay because “I know N loves me” but N is just using D.

One day Steve and I are talking because I had to return some of his mail misplaced in my mailbox. He tells me he is deploying (we spoke earlier about him being in the reserves).

All in all, we have a good friendship. We are seen as a bit of a 'duo' but the behind the scenes I am picking up all the slack.

At 18, they went to Uni and I started working. Professionally and personally, I suppose I have 'progressed' a bit further and have a great relationship, house, dog and job - important for context. They are often moving between jobs, struggling for money and not sure on their path.

I help because they don't have a great home life and struggle a bit with their mental health.

However, it is beginning to grate on me that I put time, money and effort into helping a friend that doesn't seem to appreciate it at all.

Every social event we attend, I drop and pick them up - they don't drive and live fairly near me. I rarely get a thank you and they don't even ask for a lift anymore, they just assume.

Every birthday I treat them to a meal out and it now feels like an entitlement of theirs. 

Every time they have moved appartments I have helped and filled my car with stuff for the move. They have never once offered to pay for the petrol or toll charges (like congestion charge in Central London). Last time, my car got filthy from all their stuff and they didn't even acknowledge it.

I have paid for drinks and food often when they are low on cash. Of course I don't mind, but they don't seem to be genuinely grateful because 'I have more money than them anyways'.

I have lent nearly £1,000 to them and it's taken months and months for them to pay it back. I have had to ask and remind, which I just don't think is ok.

I often look after their parents dog too. I like doing this, but just to add to the picture here.

Anyway... I rarely get a genuine thank you. I never 'feel' appreciated and it's like they just completely take my effort for granted.

214,"So,  a bit drunk still so forgive my mistakes.   
Well, I've been dating a guy for a few months now and every weekend we go out for drinks at a bar. Usually, we go alone or with my friends. I've always done my best to make him feel wanted and part of the conversation at the table, since I'm used to go out with my friends, that isn't a problem with me so I think it shouldn't be a problem for him too. This dinamic of him and my friends was working really well and he indeed told me that he wanted to be friends with some of mine. So, today (or last night) my friends were all occupied but he wanted to go out in group, not just the two of us, he then invited two of his friends which I've never met. I'm not exaggerating at all but I stayed 30 minutes listening to them talk among themselfs without saying a work because they never tried to include me. The guy I'm with then notice his mistakes and says ""Hey, by the way, this is (my name)"" It felt really shitty to be the outsider specially when I'm always trying to make him feel included. 

Anyway, after one hour, some people I know get a table at the bar, I go over them just to say hi and to ask them how their evening are going. They invited me to join them and I thought ""For a couple of minutes won't hurt"", I stayed there for two hours. Which was really shitty and I know that but I've never felt included in the other table so I wasn't really feeling guilt about it. That leads me to my question and the advice I'm asking.

TLDR at the bottom 

hi, i’m a 17 year old female living in the USA. i turn 18 in a few months. my family situation is a bit complicated and i’m not sure of my options but i’m looking for a way out. in my household, it’s me, my brother (8y/o), my mom, and my dad. my dad is an abusive alcoholic who’s been this way for years. 

i have endured mental, emotional, and physical abuse from my dad for most of my life. my brother gets none. my mom gets the worst of it. she is a victim of direct domestic abuse. he has hit her, constantly insults her and berates her, but also pretty much depends on her for everything. he does not love her. she does not love him. he cannot hold a normal conversation without yelling. he is the one who is always right, no matter what his opinions are. he knows everything and is the smartest in the room. this is the way he has been for the entirety of the past 18 years. it's unbearable.  

my parents are both immigrants from europe, and so english is their second language. in turn, my mom basically does everything for my dad. she pays the bills, talks on the phone, cleans the house, cooks, does laundry, and anything else you can think of. she also has two full time jobs. my dad does nothing at home. he has a job but it’s currently part time. however, he makes his schedule, meaning he could totally leave and go work if he wanted to, he just chooses to go out with friends all day and drink when he gets home.  

during the day when im not at school, i have to be stuck at home with my little brother because he can't be alone and my dad has ""work."" he doesn't have work. he literally goes out to bars to gossip and watch TV and eat. this is his excuse for everything. he has ""work."" i'm essentially a stay at home babysitter, helping my brother with his homework and making sure he's safe and whatnot. if i want to go out somewhere or do something, i usually have to take my brother along. i love my brother, i don't have a problem with it. i do, however, have a problem with what my dad does.  

during the weekends when my dad is still home and there is someone to watch my brother, i go to work. if i could, i would work everyday, but i can only work weekends. yet, my dad has the audacity to complain to me how i could be working more and getting paid more. i consistently always bring up the fact that i'm supposed to be home to watch my brother while he's away. he has no response and just changes the subject. no matter how much i push it, he always has this superior thought. it's ridiculous.  

even with all this, he tries to control my mom and everything she does. he constantly calls her all day to see what she’s doing and where she is, he buys things irresponsibly and gives no thought to saving money, and he uses credit cards when i know for a fact he has racked up so much debt, both in his name and my mom’s. i’m going to be applying for college this year, and i’ve brought it up to my parents. i know they don’t have anything saved for me, yet they’re out spending money like they have it. we are currently set to go back to the home country for about a month to visit family but also go on vacations (aka just go to places that my dad wants to go to), which just means more money will be spent. this is their second or third vacation this year, it’s not like they don’t take any. when asked, my dad’s excuse was, “oh the kids NEED to see the country.” (we go back almost every year.)  

my dad constantly gets into fights or arguments with everyone around him. this often goes on with his own family (my grandparents and my uncle.) there is some family drama between them, but his family knows what type of person he is in the sense of abusive. they haven't done anything about it. my mom's family, (my other grandparents and uncle) also know what kind of person he is, but they aren't ""allowed"" to do anything about it. my dad hates my mom's family, even going as far as to accuse my great grandma and grandma of being witches and cursing him. at this point, my grandma is just straight up scared of my dad and what he will do. whenever he's unhappy, he just takes it out on my mom.  

i've tried talking to my mom about all this. she says she's looked into her options, and she would divorce if she could, but it is expensive. my dad would most certainly not willingly divorce, and she said it costs more money if it's a forceful divorce. i've told her that i would help her, my grandparents would help her, her brother would help her, she has an entire help and support system right here. she simply doesn't want to ask for help. i know she's scared and not ready. because of this, she has developed a drinking problem. it's not terrible, but it's enough to make me worry. i've tried confronting her about it, she won't have any of it. in our family and the culture that we have, drinking isn't seen as such a big deal. she also has this ""belief"" where if she doesn't overcome her obstacles in this life, she'll have to face them in the next life and with this, now thinks that she has to stay with my dad so she doesn't be with him in her next life. while i think it's great that my mom has something to believe in to keep her going, this is going to tear her apart. her life is beyond stressful, she isn't happy and we all know it.  

my family all live in the home country in europe, which is why it isn't easy for one of them to just take us in. i've discussed calling the police with my grandma the next time it gets bad, and my grandma thinks i should do it. he is an awful person, and i don't think i would have any regrets doing so. once i call though, there's no going back. i know things in our family would never be the same. i just want him out of my life. i haven't called any domestic shelters or the hotline, and i know i probably should, but we're leaving for this trip on Monday and i'm dreading it. i know if the situation gets bad in the country, i can just ask my uncle to pick me up, but that's also a big deal in my dad's eyes. he would see it as a betrayal of leaving the family behind. my dad already sees me as ""on my mom's side"" because i defend her when he tries attacking. if i were to leave, i wouldn't want to go back. he is absolutely toxic and i don't know what to do. i don't want to spend the next 4 weeks with him like this.  

i've told my boyfriend who i trust very much, and he has already offered to help me. i appreciate it, but it would most likely get his parents involved, and while i know they would be completely accepting, helpful, and amazing, it is a lot to ask for my specific situation and i don't know.  

i could give so many examples of how awful it is living at home with my dad, but i'm not going to because this is already so long. i'm not sure what to do, or if i even should do anything. i only have a year left before i graduate high school and leave for college. i'm already planning on moving out as soon as possible, but i'm not sure if i should stick it out and use college as my way out or try doing something now. my grandma says i should look out for myself, but i don't know where to go from here.  

TLDR: my father is emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive. my grandma from my mom's side of the family thinks i should call the police or some hotline next time he has one of his episodes, but i'm afraid of what might happen after that to the rest of my family. i'm not sure what to do.",14Jul2019,1

219,"(Throwaway)

Sorry if this is long, I kinda needed to get this out to someone lmao.

Backstory: Basically for the past year and a half I've known my mother has been cheating with her boyfriend of about 8 years. It's an ex from High school. I've seen them talk about things that I wish I hadn't lol, I know they've sent pictures as they've talked about it on a few occasions (I never saw any thank god), but it's always kinda bothered me. They've also met up before, so they could have been doing anything. At one point when my mom and her boyfriend broke up, the plan was that they were gonna date ""for real"",  although she cried and acted devastated about the breakup. But after a day of thinking my siblings and I were going to move back to our hometown, they come out and say they were getting back together. I love my mom, but she's always kinda been like this, that's part of the many reason my father and her ""divorced"". As of now I'm not sure they talk anymore, but the damage has still definitely been done, and they could be talking on other social media, as when I saw those messages they were in plain sight, while I was using her phone. I'm not sure what I should do in this situation. It just kinda sucks that my siblings and I know this information and can't really do too much about it, without causing drama. I talked to the oldest sibling (22) and he said that I should just leave it alone and let whatever happens, happens. I get she can do whatever she wants as she is an adult after all, but it just really bothers me that she can just ruin a really long relationship just like that. She's even joked about having a secret boyfriend while she was cheating, I wanted to say something right then and there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the question is, what do you think I should do? I know I should probably stay quiet, until she get's found out, but I was really wondering what you guys think the best plan of action would be. (Sorry for any spelling mistakes, it's almost 2:00 and I'm tired af.)",14Jul2019,0

But when it’s over the phone (whether that’s texting or snapchat for instance), I get in my own head too much. I know she has a habit of opening snaps and not responding and I know that’s okay, but then part of me says “she’s ignoring you” and it really messes with me.

221,"Just an update from my previous post, today I got her in to urgent care because she got worse and her fever came back. They did a ct scan, chest x Ray, and a lot of blood work. Turns out she has type A pneumonia, or walking pneumonia, thankfully they gave her prednisone (if that’s how you spell it) for the breathing because she was having difficulty. They also prescribed her some other stuff that will help her, and they sent her on her way after 12 hours in the waiting room.

I’m relieved and worried at the same time. I thought it would be worse but pneumonia is no fucking joke. Your air sacs literally fill with fluid as I understand it from an article. I’m glad we got it checked before it got deadly..my moms father passed away from the same bacterial infection she has, so I’m very worried because she could be predisposed to it or something..

225,"So my friend (F) and I (M) went shopping yesterday because she needed a dress, for me it was mostly ""look at that cleavage"" or ""can you see my bra through this shirt?""

But the higlight was when I was trying a shirt and she was in the changing room next to me trying a small dress, and I was done earlier but I waited until I would here the curtain move,  but then she said ""aren't you still done yet?"" ""Uh yes I am"" ""alright, come in my changing room"" so I went in and there she just stood with the dress with a way to linelow-cutkline ""look at this"" while she pointed at her boobs which where like completely showing (minus the bra ofcourse).

After we went home and went to bed we started snapchatting with eachother and then suddenly she was sad that nobody has asked her out in a year, since she took a gap year. So I jokingly said ""alright, reject me, you have done it several times before"" (a few years ago I already asked her and she rejected me) and instead of just saying no she said ""*trying to ignore this*😂"" so i was like  ""just answer!"" ""FWBC?"", alright little backstory, few months ago another friend of her asked if she was open for fwb (friends with benefits) and she was really offended, and we jokingly said afterwards that we would be friends with beneficial conversations, since we talked about sex quite a lot for some reason (im a virgin, she isnt), but back to snapchat: I jokingly said ""what's that?"" And she responded with a different meaning: ""sex with sometimes conversations"", and I didn't know how to respond so it was just like hahaha and then she told me she was going to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just finished a training course for a job, lasting 2 weeks. In our class there was a trio (2 guys 1 girl) who made me quite uncomfortable by the end of it. They made terrible puns with my name and kept doing them all the time like some 12 year olds. The first 2 days I could handle it, but as the days went on I realised they truly thought they were being funny and I became extremely annoyed and uncomfortable. I mean I'm a really shy person, and for them to just take a class room discussion and then turn it into a pun about my name, getting everyone to turn their attention towards me, was uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, the crush teasing started. The guy, let's call him X, I did sort of like him for like the first week, now not so sure. This trio was 17/18 years old and they kept making jokes like ""you have a crush on him :) la la la la la"" like some 12 year olds. And then, the really uncomfortable part. They started seriously asking me if I had a crush on this guy, and of course I told them no. They asked me multiple times. And then, during our last day, they made a joke based on some song and this guy sang the lyrics ""me touching me touching you touching me :)"" and pointed between us. And I decided right there and then that he's on my blacklist of people to avoid.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides this, the girl in the trio (who I had the displeasure of being seated next to during our final day) kept mocking me for being slow in my work and asking the teacher questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout this whole time they just ignored my uncomfortable face, my lack of eye contact, my attempts to ignore them, all the signs that I did not find most of it funny and that sometimes I was deeply uncomfortable, especially the last day. There's a high probability that this trio is going to be working where I work and tbh I don't know how I'm going to handle it.

I was trying to enjoy my summer and thought I could handle all the college deadlines later. I checked some of the deadlines today on a whim and it turns out that I didn't have as much time as I thought. I'm late on the submission of measle documentation- I can't even sign up for classes if I haven't submitted them. I haven't taken any of the math placement exams. They are due in 2 days- a couple practice ones and a proctored exam are required. I haven't signed up for rooming and haven't signed up for classes. I fucked up, but I've been fucking up for a while now. Even when I was still in high school, I did assignments last minute or even late. Test preparation for me meant cramming a couple hours before the sun rose of the day of said test. I don't have any scholarships at all. I've probably portrayed myself in a worse light than reality, but what I've said is true, and I'm pretty disappointed in myself. At age 18, I still haven't had a job, a driver's license, or a girlfriend. My habits are a mess and my health is too. I feel like I'm not ready for college, and I have the sinking suspicion I'm right. So how did I get to the point of applying to college and end up getting accepted? I've had a lot of support from those around me, and that's probably one of the biggest reservations I have right now. So many people supported me to this point, and if I were to not go to college, I feel like I would be letting them down. Let me clarify that I do want to go to college, I just feel I'm not ready. I think that without a goal/ major in mind, and with me being in this irresponsible high schooler state, college will just be a waste. I say all of this, and you might think that the answer is a definite ""don't bother going to college,"" but I'm scared. What if I never get back off the ground? If I don't push myself here, when will I? I honestly don't know what my next move should be. I had an idea of trying to lose weight, be productive, get a job, get a driver's license, fix bad habits, and just get more experience in general in the upcoming year. That way I would be better prepared for college next year. However, I just wasted an entire month of summer like it was nothing. Will the rest of the year flow that way? Will I just tell myself, ""I'll just prepare for the next year"" when 2020 comes around? I really feel like I need more time and that college is just too big of a step up, but I don't know anything.",14Jul2019,1

* Comedian (I have no idea how to make this one work)
* Twitch streamer (I have shit internet, so I can't even begin this one)

I might have missed a few routes, but I think it's gotten ridiculous. Or maybe I'm putting too much pressure on myself again. If I really think about it, it depresses me though... 

The only thing I ever really enjoyed was writing content. And I love writing online. I used to have a kinda popular blog on Tumblr where I had 8k followers. I think my strength is in writing. I feel like I can gain proficiency in web development, but.. but idk. I really don't know. 

I had a surge of energy last night where I wanted to pursue bodybuilding again. The last time I pursued it, I lost 50 pounds and was getting kinda strong, but I took on a super stressful job and started making excuses. That was years ago. 

I think tomorrow I'm gonna try to think of how to get back into affiliate marketing again. I was never a security guard, but I think working security while doing affiliate marketing is something I'm interested in. 

But I don't know and I'm open to what others have to say, even if it's tough love. I'm tired of not having ""something"". When someone asks me what I do, I want a definitive answer and I want to be proud of it. I want to work hard and have a good time doing it. 

I don't want to think anymore. I just want to wake up and do the damn thing. I'm being stupid though.

252,"I am going out of town for two weeks Sunday and he didn’t wanna hangout with me on Friday in order to hangout with the boys and he is too busy tonight to hangout with me cause he’s with the boys.. I think he’s gay. He has a Instagram group of only guys ad half are gay and he’s constantly on there and hides the messages from me. He also has a friend who is a girl who he does and sees scary movies with (without telling me) and gives her his old clothes that shrunk in the wash. 

He says he can see himself with me for a long time but I think he’s just lying. He says he kisses his guy friends on the cheek and it isn’t a big deal. Also, he used to paint his fingernails and he regularly is very vain. His favorite color is pink and the key to his house has butterflies on it. 

Ive never met his group on Instagram guys who he messages all the time and he has never mentioned them to me until I mentioned who kept texting him every ten seconds. He has a group of guy friends we regularly see but this other group of Instagram guys live in Austin but I’ve never met them and I don’t think I ever will. 

In addition, he is going to a housewarming party tonight super late at like 1 am with a bunch of random dudes, none of which I have ever heard of or met. 

I think he’s gay. He said he thinks it’s gross but honestly he seems pretty gay. He even said his parents thought he was gay. His Instagram name is something like “sexqueen69”

He even said his parents thought he was gay. He also follows art instagrams that have pics of people getting fucked in the ass and huge veiny dicks like this (NSFW):

253,"Just going to say before I even write anything that I know this post is stupid and is definitely not nearly as important as most of the questions asked on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I know guilt is normal, but I don't think I am experiencing it normally. Obviously I feel guilty when I do something wrong, but I seem to also feel guilty about a lot of other stuff. I always play out the worst scenarios in my head, and imagine that something I said might have greatly offended someone, or that I was rude in some way, even if it's obvious I didn't do anything wrong. I tend to feel anxious/guilty until I can confirm with someone that I didn't do anything wrong. This also only seems to go one way, as when someone says something offensive to me I rarely ever get offended, and if I do I always forget about it soon after.

&amp;#x200B;

I also sometimes randomly remember moments from years ago, some where I actually did something I should feel guilty about, and some where it's just stupid stuff, and feel really guilty about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I decided to post about this now because of something that happened today. A few friends and I went to a water park, and we usually like to joke around with the lifeguards. They usually enjoy it and get a good laugh out of it. Anyways today I tried out a new line on a slide and when the lifeguard said the whole thing about staying inside the tube and having fun I said ""don't tell me what to do"" in a joking manner. The first lifeguard thought it was hilarious and it got a good laugh out of him. I tried it again and the second life guard seemed to get really offended, and made a rude comment back (which I can't really blame her). I felt a bit guilty about it and decided not to use that line anymore, but I told my parents about it and they both said it wasn't funny, and I have been feeling really guilty ever since. Obviously everyone is different, but I've had extremely rude customers and never took it personally, but I really can't stop thinking about it and replaying the situation in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah does anyone have any advice to get over guilt that isn't really deserved? Also should I feel guilty about the life guard thing? Even if I should I still feel guilty about a lot of stuff when I probably shouldn't, so I could still use some advice.",14Jul2019,1
254,"To start off, sometimes I lack social skills. From the beginning of the year, my college roommate and I would talk a little bit and stuff, but as the 1st semester went on, she NEVER tried to talk to me first. I would sometimes try to be friendly like offering her cookies. She would say, ""No, I'm good."" I just got bad vibes from her. She didn't smile enough, and when she did, it looked fake. Then, mid-semester, she started doing things that bothered me, such as changing menstrual pads in the dorm room, leaving her desk light on way too late/early, not taking out the trash as much as me, and leaving her laundry basket in the way. Eventually, we had bed bugs. She was super grumpy the day we found out and slammed the door. She also glared at me a few times. Honestly, I just decided to tell the RA it wasn't a friendly environment, I was scared my roommate would judge me and I didn't feel safe. The RA talked to my roommate and we eventually had a meeting together. My roommate was super irritated because I didn't talk to her first about the issues I had and she didn't believe I was intimidated by her. She said, ""I don't believe you're scared."" I responded, ""That's because I told my parents about this, and they told me not to act scared so I don't give you power."" When the RA asked about hygiene during the roommate agreement, I said, ""Sanitary napkins should be changed in the bathroom, and I looked this up-body fluids spread disease and pests and that also makes me feel unsafe."" The RA asked my roommate if that was okay with her and she just nodded. By the end of our meeting, she signed the agreement and burst out of the room crying...

2nd semester, she apologized, made changes, and brought me oreos. I agreed that we didn't need anymore tension in the room, and then everything was fine. However, my guy friend started talking to her even after I told him the weird stuff she did. One day he invited her to go to the mall with us when it was just supposed to be us 2. Eventually, my college roommate sent me this long text at the end of the year, confronting me for everything I said to her 2nd semester. She basically said I had a condescending attitude, that I was judgmental, and she didn't understand why I wanted to be a psychologist because I judge people who ""aren't happy"". For example, one time (in person) she said, ""I'm not trying to avoid the room or anything, I'm just not here most of the time because I've been working a lot."" I said, ""Oh, I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs, and I got lots of scholarships because I'm smart, or at least that's what people say."" She also was talking casually about how she hoped her skin didn't look too oily. I was like, ""let me see."" She says, ""uhh no...."" I was like, don't worry I won't judge."" I got up in her face and looked at her skin and said, ""Oh, you just have large pores. I have small ones."" She also showed me her theatre headshots a different day, because she wanted her top 10 chosen for the photographer to edit. I said, ""To edit this, I would take out the red part on your forehead, and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes"". She also mentioned that I was rude for offering her one of my dresses for one of her auditions. I asked what she was wearing and she said, ""one of those dresses."" I looked at her clothes and then offered her one of my dresses, which she rejected. I was trying to be nice...Then, at the beginning of the year during welcome week, she showed me a craft she made at an event and asked me if I made one. I responded, ""No, I'm not really into material things. I'm more into making memories."" She also said she was aware I talked behind her back to my guy friend. Those were just a few things she confronted me about in her text. Did it sound that bad? She's a junior and I'm a freshman, so idk why she'd feel intimidated by me.",14Jul2019,1
255,"TL;DR:  My parents drink too much and it's negatively affecting my mental health.  How do i tell them that what they're doing is affecting my life so deeply?

&amp;#x200B;

For my entire life (possibly longer, how would I know), my parents have had issues with drinking.  I don't want to say they're alcoholics because neither have ever been told that by a professional, and I'm obviously not a professional.  They drink at least one alcoholic beverage every night.  A lot of times they get drunk and go to a friends house on a weekday, even though they have work in the morning.  Every weekend they get wasted at least once.  

Why do I care?  

Ever since I was a child, I felt like my parents had chosen alcohol over me.  Often times they would go out, and my sister would have to watch me.  When I would call them asking when they would be home, my mom would say ""after your dad finishes this drink"" aka ""whenever the fuck we feel like coming home and actually caring for our children.""  If my parents and I went camping (my siblings were all old enough to refuse, I was not), they would take me to bars with them.  This meant driving back to our camper immediately after drinking.  I know drunk driving is bad no matter what, but I feel like forcing a child to be in a car with an intoxicated driver is another level of fucked.  Designated drivers just aren't a thing in my family I guess.  

When I was 10, I really started to realize the scope of what was happening with my parents and my life.  I developed social/general anxiety and refused to go anywhere with them at night.  I became severely, SEVERELY afraid of drunk people, especially them.  This anxiety has still not gone away one bit, 7 years later.  I've had panic attacks due to their drinking, I've attempted to run away while they were in drunken fights, I've cried while listening to them scream at each other just for them to forget it the next morning.  But since I was sober, I'm stuck with the memories.  

Don't get me wrong, I love my parents.  During the daytime, they're perfectly fine people that I enjoy spending time with.  It's just when they start drinking do things go dark for me.  Since they drink everyday, however, every night at my house hurts at least a little bit.  Some nights are better than others, but I definitely spend every night alone in my room with my headphones in trying to drown out whatever they may be doing.  

Since they're drinking affects my mental health so much, I've been wanting to confront them with how I truly feel about their actions.  I've been wanting to for 7 years, but have never had the guts to actually do it.  I have a therapist to talk through my issues with, but I have to convince myself to confront them.  

Is it even worth my time though?  My parents are both in their 50's, and my dad has told me that he won't stop drinking because ""I'm going to die anyways, what's the point.""  If I do go through, how do I even begin to tell them the scope of what this has done to my life?  Do I write a letter?  Or do I sit them down so that they have to respond?  I want to talk to them about this before I move out in a year for college.  Any advice would be appreciated.",14Jul2019,1

258,"Hi reddit. I am usually just a lurker here. But I encounctered a problem with my business partners whom are arguing over the direction of a business we are starting.

3 of us are supposed to start a business but Partner 1 keeps ""suggesting"" different directions to take.

This kinda annoyed Partner 2 because Partner 1 keeps suggesting directions but doesn't do anything about it. He's just suggesting.

Parnter 2 on the other hand wants to focus on an existing property that is under us. Rather than focus on different directions. So partner 2 just wants to focus on what we have first.

This isn't yet final and hence why my Partner 2 decided to announce it via our group chat. This angered Partner 1 because Partner 2 did not tell him about it despite it being messaged in the group.

Did Partner 2 and me really make a mistake here even if we did not do anything yet. And Partner 2 was very professional and polite in telling Partner 1 over the chat group. Or was Partner 1  overacting to what was said to him. He even proceeded to insult us and our religion. (partner 1 is jewish, me and partner 2 are catholics)

For me personally, I don't want to work with partner 1 anymore given how he reacted so unprofessionally to us.

259,"Tonight, I was hanging out with a friend on a street near where I live, just sitting in his car talking. We weren't doing anything wrong, but I guess we made someone mad because the police showed up. They made my friend get out of the car and were talking to him near the back of the car. I felt nervous because he is a person of color and I was concerned about the police potentially being aggressive or violent toward us. I went to look out the window on his side of the car and the officer told me to turn back around. I apologized, saying ""I was just trying to see what was going on"" and he yelled something along the lines of ""it's none of your business"" or ""you don't have that privilege."" I am very shaken because we didn't do anything illegal, yet the police officers made me feel very unsafe and afraid for my friend's safety. They gave some vague explanation about getting a call that we were being ""suspicious,"" but didn't elaborate on that.

I have been crying most of the night. I know it's over, but I still feel afraid because of the way that the officer yelled at me and the fact that this happened near my home.

My friend Rudy is someome I have known for years, however he is a paranoid schizophrenic drug addict who has been deteriorating as a person for the last year or so. They broke up due to him neglecting her and refusing to get help for his many problems. 

During the month and a half they dated, she had woven herself deeply within our friend group. Frequently hanging out with us and texting with us. After the break-up, she messaged me. We talked about what had happened, the break-up, and about Rudy in general. Although Rudy has been my friend for almost 5 years, I have to side with Susan on this one. He was very neglectful and refused to change his bad habits for her. 

Susan and I continued to message as the night went on, and we ended up professing we had a crush on one another. Keep in mind, all of this happened (including the break-up) in the span of maybe a few hours. We ended up talking, and we've decided that once I return from this long vacation, we're gonna go out and see what happens.

My whole life I was praised and valued for being a fast learner and a hard worker. I wasn’t able to get a college degree because of finances and obligations. A handicapped mom, young children and other demanding family members. So when I wasn’t employed I took on physically demanding jobs like deep cleaning my relatives houses, painting, farm and livestock work. Not for pay but because I felt I was needed as there was no one else willing. I am aging and have been feeling the effects of the hard physical labor I’ve done. I take care of my grandchild days at a time when his dad works out of town. I do want to be with him and enjoy his company but 24/7 is demanding. As I head into my golden years I have little to no retirement. I have a few skills but need time and luck to develop my business ideas. I feel kind of insulted when an aunt calls me to come across country to help clean her house so she can move. I digress. I think my problem has been being an obedient, dependable worker has left me feeling somewhat used over my life and even though I helped and worked at the time I felt it was an act of love that no one else would do. Nowadays with perspective I feel used and foolish. I guess I am looking for strategies to change how that makes me feel and how to move forward independently and stronger.

263,"Okay long one incoming but it might help me just to write it all out 

{some background for the girl is that she is also 16 is about 7 inches shorter than me, is super cute, and gives me rides home from work sometimes.}

I’m 16 and gonna be a senior in highschool. I’ve known this girl since freshman year and we’ve been friends, albeit not close friends, for that whole time. We’ve never been that close before junior year when at the end we started to get grouped up in many many projects. I started to express interest in getting my lifeguard certification for the summer for a cool summer job to my friend who was already a lifeguard and already friends with the girl who we will call Kayla. So I start texting her more and more because obviously we should take the city sponsored FREE classes together right? We get thru those 2 weekends and I’m thinking hey kayla is pretty cool and we text more and she asks me where WE are working this summer.

We eventually get put at this one rec center that has a lot of guards in reserve. I start to fall deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. We see each other everyday. Our friend groups overlap. We are best friends on Snapchat. It all starts adding up. My friends start to say to me “So when u fuckin Kayla” I give no response because I really just have to think of the gravity of this decision. She is one of my best friends at this point. We are both well known in the school we go to and not to sound shallow but it would really hurt my reputation if she rejected me. 

Now it’s a few weeks ago I start to hear rumors that this guy I know fucked Kayla. I can’t ask him straight up because that’s weird asf and we don’t even talk that much ya know. So I ask Kayla, (this is on our off days so I didn’t  have a chance to ask her in person) she keeps dodging the question and changing the subject so I give her the silent treatment in hopes that she will recognize what I am trying to do. She tells me she did fuck him. 

at this point I’m taken aback but I remember thinking:  ya know this really doesn’t change my opinion of her that much. She is still this wonderful person who I love to spend time with and would love to date.

I change my whole attitude and say to her : “All I wanted was for u to be honest with me” and she gets it —I think?

Fast forward to two weeks ago. We spend every single day together and often hangout every off day we have. We have entered this flirty nebula where we can’t really tell if we are flirting or not. So anyway This absolute dipshit fuckhead starts working at the rec center we work at. I knew him from our training class and I hate him then and I hate him now too. At first he doesn’t really bother me but then he asks Kayla for a ride home on one of the days that I drove to work instead of Kayla picking me up. I tell her to say fuck that bitch he  can get a Uber since he’s wearing supreme air forces and wearing a Versace shirt. But she takes him much to my chagrin.

It happens about one more time until one night she takes him home but me and Kayla have plans after work. I see that they are texting each other and say “oh I bet that bitch likes u” 
And she goes “😬”
Next snap I see from him is a pic of his dumbass ugly face going “ ummmm so I like u”

And She goes nuts she starts screaming in discomfort while I go “ I KNEW IT” and our friends wonder what the fuck is going on. Me and Kayla have a brief exchange about whether I should act as her boyfriend in an attempt to get him to fuck off but that leads nowhere.

Fast forward to last week she asks me what I’m doing after work and I respond with some bullshit and return the question to her and she starts off with “well after I take _____ home...” I cut her off I tell her “ uh why the fuck are u taking him home he’s a creep” and she goes “It’s just what I do “

[WARNING FOR THE NEXT PART IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE I AM THE BAD GUY BUT JUST HEAR ME OUT]

I tell her “wtf!! I told u not to take him home anymore he’s obviously just trying to get at you”

She goes “Well I already made it clear that it’s his problem cause I’m not interested” 

And I return with “I don’t care kayla he obviously has ways to get home he’s just using you”

I forced her into a super petty ultimatum but none of you guys know him he’s the worst he’s about 8 feet tall and he’s super sexist in a non ironic way he has a SoundCloud account that he actually produces on and he overall gives a very creepy terrible vibe like he has all these expensive clothes and fancy trinkets now it’s the women’s turn to flock to him like he just expects it. Very rapey very awful guy.

And now we are caught up to today I guess the reason I went into that big tirade about bitch at work is because 1) I hate him and 2) I’m afraid that he is what I’m gonna become if I tell Kayla that I like her , and her friends who are also my friends will become me in that situation— pushing me away from her if she says no.

So in conclusion me and “Kayla” talk everyday we see each other everyday she loves my hair she thinks I’m cute but I also hangout with her and her/my friends like a lot so maybe she thinks of me as just a homeboy ? She is not talking to anyone right now romantically as she is brushing off dudes giving her booty calls and our friendship could be ruined by me.

264,"My obsession with this type of anime/manga has been extremely difficult to keep from my parents. For anyone who does not know, Shounen Ai and Yaoi are two different genres of Japanese manga/anime that center around the relationship of two male characters, the latter of the two depicting an explicit, homoerotic connection. After 1 1/2 years, I am at a point where telling my parents is on my mind (They know of my love of anime in general, NOT the fact that my favorite genres are ""Boy's Love""). A pro of telling them is that they may simply shrug it off, and allow me to be open about my hobby. However, a con would be if they take it negatively, and think differently of me. A negative reaction is very probable, and I fear that telling my parents will turn them against ANY type of anime/manga in fear of me being exposed to Yaoi and Shounen Ai further. My parents aren't necessarily open-minded people, but even then, I assume most parents would be quite surprised if they were to learn that their child's hobby is watching the budding (sometimes sexual, mind you)  romance of two animated fictional Japanese male characters. I feel like opening up to my parents and being honest is a good thing, but on the other hand, I also feel that sometimes it's okay to keep things to yourself. So, as my thoughts start to become mushy, confused nonsense, I'm turning to the people of r/Advice to help me.

268,"So I'm an 18 year old American male. I was raised Catholic by my mother. Although religion wasn't a major part of my home life, I was sent to Catholic school, and my mom took my brother and I to mass on sundays (when she felt like it/remembered). My father was raised Protestant and my maternal grandmother (who also lives with us) was raised in Japan with traditional Japanese faith. Neither expressed any interest in religion, but did celebrate xmas and such with my mom, brother and I. 

I never liked Catholic schools or their environments. My upbringing and school life were normal in most respects, though. However, around 4th-5th grade, I began to research other religions. I was always enchanted with the idea of many different gods with niches and likenesses. Particularly, I liked the Graeco-Roman pantheon, as well as the Shinto and Buddhist faiths which reflected my Japanese heritage. As a generally eclectic and person, I always felt more connected to these traditions rather than what I perceived to be the bland, boring, monotheistic Catholic Church. I was tired of religion classes and morning prayers repeating the same tired lines ad nauseam. I felt the need to express my interest in other gods to my classmates. However, the brainwashed little shits bullied me for it, telling teachers and religious figures. I don't want to be biased; I was a little shit also. I'm sure in retrospect I was fairly obnoxious about it too. 

Around 7th-8th grade, this manifested itself differently. As a young teen/preteen, I began to enter my ""true"" rebellion phase. However, I didn't have the balls to defy my parents quite yet. I began to look at my disdain for the Catholic Church on a more rational level; I began to ask the typical questions; Where's the proof that God exists? Why do people believe in all of these stupid stories over science? etc. I did some digging on the internet and discovered atheism.  Around age 13, I fully embraced this new identity. I continued to be bullied by the brainwashed little shits for this. 

It wasn't until I finally got to high school that I revealed my atheistic belief to my mom. I told my dad and grandma first because I knew they wouldn't care. My mom made me go to confirmation classes every sunday after mass, which I simply  could not tolerate. My mom broke down and cried, but she got over it, and I stopped going to church and confirmation.

 I remained in the Catholic high school I was in for the full 4 years. I told many people about my lack of belief, which really didn't affect much and wasn't acknowledged by anyone until almost everyone else became an atheist junior year. Between school work, friends, relationships, and other things, I gradually stopped thinking about religion and atheism. Until my loss of friends senior year, which is when I found a renewed anti-Catholic zeal. 

Though I'm now in a public college free from the hand of the Catholic Church, I still have anger and hatred against it in my heart. Though I know that there have been positive and interesting Christian traditions across the globe that billions of people, including myself, benefit from, I feel as though Christianity and Catholicism have somehow wronged me. I know it's not rational and I don't want to have this bias/grudge looming over me.

My current best friend is an obese, alcoholic, who plays video games and has low self esteem. He's a lot of fun though, funny, loyal, helpful, generous and kind. But yeah he isn't bringing me up in those areas I talked about.

My other friend is also irresponsible, drinks a lot, parties, doesn't care about those areas I talked about either.

I've been avoiding them because I find they drag me down unintentionally, and I want to be with people better than me. But I'm so busy working and I'm not sure where to find these cool people or even if I find them I won't know what value I bring to the table either as I'm not that great at the moment myself. Being alone/lonely is quite painful though. So I don't know what to do as I'm quite stuck. What do you think I should do?",14Jul2019,0
270,"This year I'm entering senior year (F) with no clue with what I want to do or what college I want to go to. I messed up by slacking and even though my GPA (3.0)  isn't horrible, I messed up with my ACT score (18 .-.). With my ACT score, it will probably mess up my chances to get into college. I don't know what to do. My mother wants me to go to Philippines for a year and take a course, and even though it's dual credits, is it a safe idea considering it's a third world country? Previously I wanted to do something in law enforcement so I took all the highschool classes recommended, but I do not think I'm physically fit enough to work in that field. Would it be too late to switch up my courses for veterinary medicine despite me not taking AP Bio and etc?

271,"So, I’ve been in a relationship for the past 5 months. Considering that I’m a senior in high school, 5 months is a fairly serious relationship. Recently I’ve been feeling pretty unhappy in the relationship. We’ve had our ups and downs but I love my boyfriend a lot and we have a strong connection as he was by my side while I was dealing with the loss of my father. However, I feel as if he only focuses on himself, that he treats me poorly and that we have differing levels of maturity. Just tonight, as I was going out of my way to give him a ride home, he vomited in my car. He was incredibly drunk which I didn’t approve of as we had a mutual understanding that we both wouldn’t partake in drug usage. My car is super important to me as it has a lot of sentimental value as well as the fact that I’m making car payments on it. It’s my baby and I love it more than I love myself. I feel as if him vomiting in my car was the icing on top of the cake. I feel like I could just be overreacting but I’m not sure. Am I justified in feeling this way? Would it be wrong to break things off? Also if there’s any advice you can give on how to get my point across and break up effectively that would be great. Thanks.

277,"I'm 17 years old and about 3 months ago my parents split up and my dad moved out because my mum had an affair. They were trying to fix it but my mum never stopped cheating on him. When my dad found out they had a big fight and lots of mean things were said to one another. My mum was at a friends place with me later that day and had a breakdown out the front of their house. My friends parents were worried so they called the police. The police put a temporary restraining order in place until they knew everything was okay.

The next day they went to court to sort it all out and even though Mum had the option to cancel the restraining order, she chose to keep it and on top of that, greatly exaggerate the events of that night saying stuff like he followed her home and threatened to hurt her.

Because of the restraining order, my parent's business is failing, everyone thinks that my dad's an abusive husband and because of that he's leaving our hometown to find a new place to live. My dad really wants me to go with him and my mum wants me to stay with her.

I wanna go with my dad because he could really use someone who believes his side of the story with him right now, but if I go with him then I'm leaving behind all my friends i've made . I've moved around a lot as a kid and I know that it's not for me not to mention I can't stand to look at my mum right now. My dad wants to travel the country meaning that I can't get a job either.

278,"I apologize for how convoluted and unorganized this is it’s late and I just wanted to get these feelings out before I go to bed. 

I fear what my future holds. I have absolutely no clue what I want to study or what school I want to go to. I’m not particularly intelligent or exceptional in any avenue of my life.  And I fear being the common denominator, but it seems it’s where I’ve landed. 

Although psychology is a subject I am very interested in it seems like there’s no way that would ever evolve past lecturing students. 

I feel myself being beckoned by the military. The idea of having respect and being a strong and capable man who’s survived the call of duty is quite appealing. Something in me tells me I will die if I go for it. And I hate that I’ve almost accepted that. I don’t want my mom to be greeted with an American flag one morning. But I don’t want to have regrets. I fear death.  


I might have had a chance to start a friendship with a girl I’m really interested in but fucked myself over. Im trying to become a more confident and capable so that I feel comfortable talking to a girl who to me seems to be ambitious and intelligent but have been progressively been (to reiterate here) fucking myself over. 

I’ve gained weight in an effort to be physically stronger and more capable but every time I see the scale go up I feel nothing but emptiness wondering if what I’m doing is really getting me anywhere. I’ve done nothing in my mind that really matters and my peers have. Some would argue comparing yourself to others isn’t great for you but I’m honestly not sure if that’s true because of the “social comparison theory”. 

I study for tests that I end up failing and it’s just incredibly crushing to get a 40/70 when you really did try and put in the effort. 

I’m using this girl as motivation to continue studying and eating and getting stronger but I feel like it’s just such a foolish and small minded thing to be motived by. My peers want to change the world and help their families. Meanwhile I’m obsessed with my own petty goal. After all what if the girl just dosent reciprocate and I just end up biting the dust. 

It’s my last year of high school and adulthood is just around the corner. I wish I could stay a kid forever but alas that’s impossible.

282,"Hi, I'll keep this pretty brief. 

A couple of months ago I had a party with a few friends and got blackout drunk. My friend ""Max"" posted multiple videos of me barely able to walk, and was proclaiming to people that he was ""sober"". He came back to mine, and i have no recollection of how i got home or how I got into my pj's, but a friend of mine told me she dressed me after they dropped me off. There is a selfie of Max and I in my bed, around 1:20am, I'm fully clothed. At 1:39am I know uber eats arrived, and I remember being on my floor eating it, and then everything is black again. I recall trying to climb into my loft bed and falling off, breaking my cabinet. Then I remember him being on top of me and kissing me and me fading in and out of sleep. When I woke up he was gone, but he called my friend at 5am, I assume he left around that time. 

I snap chatted him to ask if we had sex. He said no, we only ""kissed and got a little touchy feely"". When I asked again on the phone, he said we only kissed and we agreed it would be best to not tell anyone. 

Flash forward to the other night, I find out he's been telling my friends we had sex. Assuming he was lying to them I confronted him about it, and he told me that we did, and that he told me we did. I feel extremely violated and upset, and I know he didn't tell me we had earlier, because i would've been upset back then. He's claiming I was completely conscious and that I moved on him. I don't think I was capable of making decisions if I was a) stumbling around my room, and b) had to ask him the next day what happened. 

I have evidence of him telling people we ""had sex"", a timeline and videos of how intoxicated I was (accompanied by him laughing at me. jerk.), but of course there are so many factors. I don't know if he was lying to me, or to my friends, and I don't know what to do. Any advice?",14Jul2019,1

294,"I'm at a point where I can't take it anymore. I'm tired of my family being ruined and him getting away with it.  

From the time that him, my dad and my aunt were teens he was always an asshole, an alcoholic, who never did anything for anyone else.  Long story short he was driving drunk and got into an accident that messed him up pretty badly.  He's recovered and the only disability it left him with was double vision and slurred speech.  Fast forward to when I was 9 and my grandfather dies, after that point what I though of my uncle is turned completely upside down. I never realized the damage he had done to my dad's side of the family and that grandfather was the only thing keeping his behavior in check. 

The first incident I heard of was him verbally abusing and beating his ex-wife.  This was never taken to court and he never got any punishment for it.  Later on that my dad and I walked into his house to find mairajuana (illegal where I live) there.  Nothing came of that either.  Then there were several occasions where he got into fights with other people.  Still nothing. Whenever my dad or I try to address it my grandmother and aunt (his sister) will say that's just part of his disability.  He's basically manipulated all of them by pulling his ""god bless you"" ""please pity me"" shtick which everyone falls for.  

The most recent thing that's happened and bothered me the most was during my dads wedding.  For hours he would stare at me (15) and my cousin's (20) feminine places. Thats on so many levels of wrong.  As this wasn't the first time it happened I just turned away from him. My dad found out about this from one of his friends.  This was of course brushed of by my grandma.  

Due to all the arguments between my dad V.S. my grandma and aunt, their relationship has deteriorated to the point where my grandma preaches that my perverted, shithead of an uncle is a better person than my father who wasn't able to go to college because of him and just so happens to have voted for Trump (which apparently outweighs domestic abuse).  My dads had to work his ass off while my uncle, at 58 years old, hasn't worked a day in his life.  I've been exposed to his shit firsthand and I've made my own opinion on him despite everyone saying I've been ""brainwashed"" by my dad.  I HATE my uncle and what he's done to my family.

Over all I just want my grandma, aunt, the others he's manipulated to realize how terrible he is. I just don't know how.",14Jul2019,1
295,"When I was 12 I found this online group of people who I became pretty close with. Most of them were older than me by about 3 or 4 years. Due to a lot of IRL situations I didn't have friends at school so these were my only friends I had and they taught me a lot. However about 5 months ago I chose to left the group as they became increasingly toxic and I believed that in order for me to grow and mature I had to leave them, even leaving someone I considered my best friend who had a major influence into making me into who I am today. All was fine until one of the people from the group messaged me today. Last we spoke this person had been incredibly disrespectful to me so when they messaged today I told them I didn't want to speak to them and that was that, the conversation was over. Despite that though, it left me feeling guilty about leaving the people I had considered my friends. 

I never said goodbye to any of them as a lot of people in the group had a bad tendency of making big goodbye speeches then coming back a month or two later, I didnt want that to be me. I'm confident I made the right decision in leaving but by not saying goodbye and simply disappearing I feel as though I betrayed them. I'm happier now than I have been in a long time though and so I'm left in a weird confused state. Do I keep moving forward in life or do I backtrack to these old friends? The ones I grew really close to I respect greatly which is probably why I feel guilty, I feel like I abandoned them even though I think leaving them was the best option for me. It's such a weird situation and I don't really know which direction to take. Any advice on the matter would be really appreciated. I'm not sure how to move on, if moving on is what I should be doing at all.

296,"I just want to preface this post by saying that you can be as brutal and honest in your response as you would like. I can handle it.

Over the past couple of years now, I have steadily begun to notice that I have started to deteriorate as a person.

I am well overweight, I have no personal hygiene, and I am making no progress towards a successful life. I haven't even brushed my fucking teeth regularly in 2 years that's how bad it has become.

I'll break up each of my problems into sections so I stay on topic with each one.

# HYGIENE

I used to be somewhat of a clean freak when I was a child / teen, which is why every time I have wake-up moments like these, I am so fucking ashamed, disgusted, and disappointed in myself for letting it get this far -- this isn't the first time I have had wake up moments like the one I am having now.

As I mentioned earlier, I haven't had a consistent brushing schedule in over 2 years. I haven't visited the dentist in an equal amount of time. My gums look like something out of a horror film, and some of my teeth on the bottom row are covered with visible layers of plaque that I have to hide whenever I speak to someone by not moving my lower lip. My breath smells like absolute dogshit, and the only reason people haven't complained about it is because I refuse to speak within an arm's length to people, and I go through a pack of gum every day.

If I do not have to leave the house, I will do laundry roughly -4 times a month. My showering schedule mimics my laundry schedule. All of my clothes smell like a dumpster fire. The only saving grace about that fact, is that if I know I am leaving my house, I will wash an outfit multiple times and take a very long shower before I leave. I think it is unfair that people have to have their noses violated just because I am a disgusting fuck, so I **ALWAYS** make sure to do this. But if I have no where to go, I sit around marinating in my filth. All day, every day.

My room and car are complete fucking train wrecks. My room is scattered with dirty clothes upon the floor, and various cups, plates, and trash litter any flat surface in my fucking pigsty. My car is no different than this, sans dishes and clothes. I don't bring guests up to my room, nor do I drive anybody in my car. **EVER**. I don't think I need to explain why not.

# OVERWEIGHT

I was the fat kid growing up. At my heaviest, I was around 260 lbs in the 5th grade, and I hovered around this weight until 8th grade when I decided to lose weight. In 2 years I dropped 80 lbs. I was 5'11 and \~180 lbs by the time I ended my sophomore year of high school. I maintained this weight up until about 2 years ago, when I started to let myself go. The last time I weighed myself, I was 253 lbs, only 7 lbs away from the heaviest I have ever been in my life. This was 2 months ago. I know I have passed the 260 lb threshold, but I am too scared to find out by how much.

My diet consists almost entirely of PB&amp;J's, hot links, sugary cereals, junk food, and frozen meals. One thing you will notice about these items is that they require little to no effort by me to cook. I used to cook for myself when I was losing/maintaining weight, and I actually enjoy cooking whenever I do it. I don't know why I've stopped cooking; I used to make some bomb ass food. Maybe it's the grocery shopping, maybe it's the cleanup process, maybe it's because I am turning into a lazy, disgusting fuck. No…It **DEFINITELY** is because I am turning into a lazy, disgusting fuck.

#GOALS

I flunked out of high school my senior year. I made a lot of friends there, so I did alright on the social side, but I can't put that on a resume. I do not have my GED, and consequently, I am not going to college or a trade school. Despite this, I managed to land an IT job 2 years back which I enjoyed. I left after 10 months of employment for personal reasons, and have not had a job since. Thankfully, I was able to continue to live off of the money I had saved for a while, before I was forced to move back in with my parents because I had no income (DUH). However, one of my old co-workers told me that my old boss has been asking for me to come back, and I have since scheduled to meet with him on Monday, so there's that I guess.

My original plan was to go to college and become a high school teacher for either History or English -- my English isn't perfect, but it's alright for someone who has flunked high school. But now, it seems like that plan has gone to shit. It's been 3 years since I flunked out, and I haven't gotten even a centimeter closer to my goal. Procrastination has always been my Achilles' Heel, but procrastination seems to be the affliction of everyone, so there isn't anything special there. But if there is one thing I can say for sure, is that my procrastination has grabbed me by the nuts now more than ever before.

___
# POSSIBLE REASONS

If I had to list some of the reasons why this is happening, I would say it is because of many things. I don't really want to expand on all of them, so I will just list my main hypotheses and call it a day.

* I am turning into a lazy FUCK.
* I have a severe lack of self-discipline.
* I don't think I will amount to anything which is causing me to not take care of myself. I don't consciously think this, but maybe that's what my subconscious thinks. I've heard that bastard can be tricky sometimes.
* I guess possible depression? I don't feel like I am depressed, but I can't deny that I am exhibiting some symptoms of it. Idk man.

# SUMMARY

All in all, I guess I am writing this to get a second opinion from the internet. I know some of what I have to do; it's doing it that is the problem for me I guess. As I said earlier, this isn't the first time I have had these wake-up moments. I always forget about them after a day or two though. Who knows? Hopefully this time will be different. I said that I am meeting with my old boss, and in the morning I should probably schedule a dentist appointment assuming I don't get too embarrassed and chicken out like I usually do.

The advice I ask of you, Reddit, is what are things that I must do in order to stop acting the way that I am. Help me with the things that I can fix, and advise me on the things that I can't -- not that there is much in that category anyways. I don't like saying that something is out of my control because then it sounds like I am making excuses for myself, but judging by the way that I am now compared to the way I used to be, I can't help but think that something outside of my control is fucking with me.

Anything is appreciated. Even if all you do is read this, it's nice to get this off my chest and finally admit this to other people instead of just myself. Maybe that alone will get me off my ass this time.",14Jul2019,2

Sometimes not sleeping fir days. One day while looking over my girlfriends shoulder I saw a text that I thought said ""kill him"" and ""it would be easy"". That night I did something I've never done. I got on her phone to see what it was ( I know imta) and I saw so much scary stuff in those texts. I'm not sure i should get into too many details but this stuff was the craziest stuff I've ever read. She seemed very possessive of my girlfriend so much as saying multiple times over the year worth of text that she wants ""To kill me in my sleep"" and that ""she practices witchcraft"" and ""wants to put a hex on me and some of my family"". Shes violently threatened my family whenever my girlfriend would complain about them to her. Shes also tried to get my girlfriend to join what really really sounds like a cult. I tried to tell my girlfriend how I feel about it but she just keeps saying shes her only friend and that shes harmless. This girl knows where we live as well. Some of the stuff I saw and read was so bad that I literally sleep with my shotgun at night. I get this pit in my stomach whenever I think about it.

301,"To give some context, my wife has made many sacrifices for me (moving to my shitty state, paying for my college, living with my crazy parents while I go to school etc) but I seem unwilling unintentionally to do the same. In the beginning of the relationship I was simply being selfish and focusing solely on my goals but now I really want to put her goals and needs first. However the situation is sort of stuck at this point, we have no money to move out of this state or pay for her schooling (mine is covered by FAFSA that’s the only way we afford it.) So this is not a situation where she is being unreasonable. 

I am trying every day to be a better person for her but she is so closed off and distant from me. I feel like I am drowning and have no one I can tell. Ever since she told me this ultimatum a few weeks ago I have been consumed by it. I can’t focus on work. I’m so worried that I’m going to fuck up this semester of schooling (she’s explicitly said she will leave if I do as I have in the past) because I’m so overwhelmingly scared of losing her. How can I do anything, how can I live my life with this deadline looming over my head? Any advice on how to fix this situation is welcome.",14Jul2019,2
302,"Hi. My dad has always had a gambling problem since I was born. They’ve (my parents) have gone into debt multiple times because of him blowing all of our money at the casino. He isn’t a bad guy, he actually is a very loving dad. He is just always lying and spending our money. I’ve tried to get jobs to help my mom out but it never is enough. I’m young anyways, my dad shouldn’t be blowing the money. Last year in April, he was at the casinos bar with his friend. They got drunk and he punched a cop. (Was his first and only run in with the cops) As you know that’s a BIG case and he was in jail for only about 5 months, but it really screwed us. We went broke so many times and were constantly borrowing from people. When he got out he was obviously banned from the jail but he found a new casino and always goes to it. My mom and him are constantly fighting because he always spends it, and he says he should be able to because “he works for it” and “it’s his hobby” Which obviously it’s FAR from a hobby when it’s putting our family in major debt. I’ve talked to my mom about divorce, but she turns it down everytime. And I understand they love each other. He just has this problem. Today we were going to a bridal shower and my dad tried to sneak off to the casino while we were gone. SO, my sister told on him and my mom and him talked. He had $120 and wouldn’t leave it at home. He said “I’m not going to spend it, i promise.” And my mom says that isn’t even worth it to her ears anymore because he’s always saying that and it means nothing. She always says, if you’re not going to spend it then why take it? Which is so true. Idk. Anyone have any advice? I want to talk with him because I think hearing it from his own daughter may help.",14Jul2019,1

I have asked him to stop watching porn around me twice. I don’t think he really cares how his behavior affects me. I can’t seem to go to the kitchen to grab some food back to my room because my living room is next to my kitchen. When I walk into my kitchen my ears are super sensitive and I can hear things like him hiding his penis under his pants. I walk with my eyes on the floor. I do everything to avoid him from evening time to 4 am in the morning(yes, he usually masturbates till 2-4 in the morning). The problem is it’s making me hate him now. It’s affecting my appetite since I would avoid walking into the kitchen from my evening to 4 in the morning. It’s making my sleeping time change and basically affecting every area of my life. I’m losing weight and I can see my mom won’t tell him anything about his addiction to porn. He has his own room why won’t he go in there and watch porn? How do I stop his porn addiction from affecting my life?",14Jul2019,7
304,"So, this happened Friday when my coworker was taking out the trash at my job at Chipotle. She came back and told us this guy drove by the dumpsters as she was walking out and he flashed his erect penis at her and drove off. After hearing, obviously I was livid someone would even think it’s ok to do this. She managed to get the plate numbers of this car and the description and asked one of the shift managers what to do next.
 I learn the next day that nothing was done or reported, and when the GM found out ( I think the other two managers on shift were like KM or something below my GM) and she was upset that they didn’t immediately call the police instead of asking what to do. 
I’m really bothered by what happened because 1.) it’s made a lot of the female workers afraid to take out the trash, 2.) the fact that there’s this pervert roaming around the city angers me because this place has kids and what if a worker that was under 18 saw that?? 
So I’m wondering if it’s still worth reporting this incident even though it happened a couple of days now (which should have been reported immediately which really irks me). My coworker doesn’t have evidence of him flashing but did manage to get a picture of his plate number. I really want this creep off the streets but I doubt anything would be done with so little information we have.",14Jul2019,1

-My Single mother of 5 (me being the oldest) passed away from cancer. All my siblings look to me for support now and in the future. 
-have great long term friends from middle school age all the way to college days. 
-Mom had life insurance so finances are taken cared of for my brothers.

-Grew up with abusive step father till he got convicted.

314,"So I have a friend in her mid-teens that is a bit crazy to say the least. She doesn’t care about her life or her studies, drinks and experiments with drugs, and she also low-key whores herself out, not as crazy about that as she is her other habits but it’s still worthy of bringing up. This kind of behavior runs in her family (she’s the third generation that I know of that’s like this) and her mother has clearly taken pre-cautions to prevent her daughter from becoming like her because she is having her grandfather and his wife (crazy grandma is his ex) raise her and she’s been going to a nice boarding school. Great right? Well she hangs with druggies and like I said she doesn’t care about her studies. Her grandparents are super chill, too chill. They let her do just about anything she wants without questioning her, so she takes full advantage. Add an eating disorder due to her thinking she’s “fat” (she isn’t by any means, but she’s been on again off again starving herself for the past like 7 or 8 months). Add all that up and it makes up for a pretty crazy person. That being said, I fully believe she can turn her life around before she graduates from high school, she just needs to develop self-discipline. Her mother went to this crazy extent to make sure she turns out ok but she’s clearly not on the right path. I’ve talked to her about my sentiments about her several times but it always goes 1 of 3 ways: she abruptly ends the conversation completely (just stops responding entirely, regardless of topic), she dances around the issue completely, or says she doesn’t care and tries to change the topic. It is very apparent to me that she has given up on any “hope” of maturing into a strong and disciplined woman and that she is very accepting and complacent about being a “fuck up” in society. I want to try to cause change but I wanna know how I can get in her head so she can do so, because she really is an awesome person and one of my good friends. She’s got 3 years, I think that’s more than enough time to change! So what can you guys say about this? What can I do to help this?

319,"25y old woman here. I've been sick as hell for the past week, and today was the first day I felt well enough to go out. Right after parking my car I'm walking along the sidewalk, 2 blocks away from my destination. There's a man up ahead. I slightly move to the side so we both have space when walking by. Right before I walk past this man hacks a loogie and spits in front of me, spraying me with his spit. Luckily the majority of it did not land on me. I was wearing sunglasses and some of the spit landed there, and another bit on my arm. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said 'what the fuck' but not loudly right after we passed each other because I wasn't immediately sure if the man intended to spit on me or not. I did not want to get into a fight on the street because 1 - I am a female and avoid fights with angry men and because 2 - I had a laptop in my backpack and I cannot risk it getting broken/damaged in a confrontation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I rushed to the cafe I was heading to and washed off the spit with antibacterial soap. Originally I was questioning whether the man meant to spit on me but in retrospect there was no way he would have aimed so close to me if he was not intending it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have two questions in terms of advice - 

1 - Was I just spit on because I appeared to look 'well off'? I am by no means rich but today I dressed up in a nice shirt and vest with my $10 knock off Ray Bands since I was going out (I live in a fairly large city) for the first time in a week and wanted to look nice. I wasn't sure if the guy who spit on me was homeless. Possibly. I can't think of any other reason he may have spit on me. Has anyone encountered a situation like this? I'm very upset about this. I know some people are just angry/mentally ill but who does that to someone else?

&amp;#x200B;

2 - I was concerned about my safety and I am generally non confrontational but I am upset that I just let this man walk away. How was I supposed to deal with that? Ask him what the fuck his problem is and get my pepper spray out? I know spitting on someone is technically assault but even if I had called the cops I'm sure the man would already have been far off by the time they got there. Should I start saving to pay for expensive Krav Maga classes so that I can confront shitty people like this without feeling unsafe? Ladies, pls advise.",14Jul2019,1
320,"ok, here's the deal. This is all about me (15m) my best friend (also 15m, we'll call them A) and a few other people who's exact details aren't important.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway,  A and I have known each nearly our entire lives and have been through a lot together. We practically live at each other's houses, I'll spend a week there, A will spend a week here, etc. But there's just one thing they do that bugs me, and I don't know if it should. While A is at my house (mostly when this happens) they have a tendency to spend a \*significant\* amount of time texting other people. I know it shouldn't, but it really bothers me. It's to the point where it actually interrupts things we're trying to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like a few months ago, A was at my house. There was one point where they left saying ""be right back"" then proceeded to spend an hour video calling with someone else. That really bugged me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then recently, we met the neighbors who live behind me. Turns out that they're pretty neat, and two of them are about our age. One is our age and one is a year older. Ever since then, he's been texting the one our age nearly non-stop. A was at my house for a two days after we met them, and for those two days we barely even spoke. A spent nearly every second in the phone messaging said other person. 

&amp;#x200B;

A left for a week, and came back again today. What do you know, exact same thing. A will interrupt or stop things to reply to a text. It's driving me insane.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a point today where we were all sitting together. A, neighbor our age, and I were at the same table, and A and my neighbor were literally texting each other while sitting next to each other. There was a time where A showed Neighbor something on his phone, visibly aimed away from me, and when I tried to look A jerked their phone back towards them and turned it off. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was another point where they were looking at me and whispering. I called them out and they wouldn't say anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely care about and what to be friends with A, but I'm getting stretched thin. It's been a pretty rough six months, I don't need any more conflict or problems. I'm a few weeks clean from sh but if anything happens im almost guaranteed to relapse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanna try to bring this issue up with A and talk about it, but I don't know how.

Can some of y'all please help. I really need and would appreciate it.",14Jul2019,1
321,"So a bit of a back story. Years ago I got my foot in the door of my dream career out of uni, underwater archaeology. A shirt time later I started having seizures and diagnosed with late onset epilepsy. I’m no longer allowed to dive, my casual hours stopped being given despite me being told I’d stay on in a research capacity. I got really depressed and life was hard. I moved back home in September for help with life. I hadn’t worked for a few years when in December my brother got me a job in the kitchens at a the hospital. I’ll be honest, I hated it. But a job is a job. Between me not being able to drive and having seizures, it was tough getting work. 

Now my brother was able to help because he’s the manager of distribution and environmental services at the hospital and he knows the catering manager quite well, the same company run both. 

I worked well and just did my mind numbing job. A new company took over the contract and we all had to reapply for our jobs. This new company came in at the start of May. Halfway through June one of the managers of the company called me in to her office and offered me a promotion. Supervising the pharmacy stores. One hell of a promotion. I said yes. People don’t like that I got it, they assume my brother pulled strings, which he didn’t. I got this on merit. 

I’m now two weeks in to this position and I feel like I’m so in over my head. The stress is destroying me. I’ve always had anxiety but just hid it well, to the point were people think I’m confident. The outgoing supervisor training me had Friday off and I was alone in charge. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, like none whatsoever. I was terrified from 9-5 and people kept coming to me with things to do and I’d put them aside, do the things I knew and kind of just wing it. Monday will see my trainer fixing all my mistakes and the stuff I left. My workers hate me, they want me to fail and they don’t listen to me at all. They all applied for the job whereas I didn’t. It was explained to me that none of them were deemed capable and an attitude and culture change is needed down in pharmacy stores. It’s only a matter of time before my stress causes a major seizure. 

I’m worried that if I say I can’t do it I’ll disappoint my brother. My whole family really. My partner too. The company might put me back in the kitchens where there is no future, or maybe they’ll just sack me. I’m not sure I can stick it out though. It feels like I’ll never grasp the job, this was never my thing and I’m not a leader. And now somehow I’m supervising the pharmacy stores at a major city public hospital. I have no idea what to do. 

Do I step down? Do I stick with it and hope it becomes better? Do I try to explain to the bosses that I’m in need of support? 

I feel like I’m drowning.",14Jul2019,1
322,"I'm (23) in the last of a music undergrad degree, but have become disillusioned with music as a subject and don't really see any way that I can make a career out of music (short of teaching in a high school, which I'd hate to do). I'm starting to think if there's no real job that I can see myself enjoying a lot I may as well focus on trying to earn a really good wage, which I almost certainly can't do with a music degree. So I'm considering doing another undergraduate degree, possibly in something like finance or accounting, but I'm wondering if it's a smart idea since I'd most likely have to do it part time, meaning I wouldn't even get a second under degree until I'm 30, and I'd only be adding to my already somewhat considerable amount of student debt.

They’re strict in the sense that they only sanction a limited time for hanging out with my friends(which applied for my sis when she was my age but since she’s old enough to do what she wants my parents don’t care) and they demand good grades. But here’s the problem: 
They refuse to buy me a laptop bc they think I’ll spend time chatting in group chats or something when I just want to do my assignments. They wouldn’t be so enforcing on this idea if my sister did the same but they don’t get it through their heads that we are different in terms that I value my education more and I want to be much better than her(aside from this about a couple of years ago when she graduated she got the fourth highest finals score in the school and was literally known by everyone about this and also she was super popular but so was I lol) even though she slacked off a lot. Anyway I’m getting off topic. My dad has only one computer that only has a couple of programs I can use for assignments and he’s always using his computer for his business. As a result, I barely get any time to do my assignments and provide half complete assignments that look like trash, which very much ruined my grades. Also, not to mention, I also wanted a laptop so that I could prepare online study notes. This long response sounds like I’m being an entitled brat and whining how I’m not getting a laptop but I’m seriously not. I want to get good grades like the rest of my classmates but I can’t do that if I can’t plan out assignments and actually complete them. I even tried to talk to my parents but they ignored everything I said and essentially said that I’m gonna use the laptop to talk to my boyfriend(in which that is so gross I’d honestly rather be dead rather than have a boyfriend) but the point is I’m trying to at least make an effort in my schoolwork so I don’t fail and my parents think I’m gonna get into relationships.

On top of this, I’m not sure if the person I’m going with is even paying for their ticket (I explained the cost and why I had the ticket when I asked but in the conversations we’ve had leading up to tomorrow nothing has been said about paying me back for the ticket) and I hate asking about things like that. I don’t even know if they’re going to help with gas and I’m freaking out because I don’t have enough money to just pay their way.

I feel like if I tell them I don’t feel safe/happy/comfortable going anymore they’ll talk shit about me at work bc everyone knew we were going and I don’t want to sound like a flake. 

What do I do? 

p.s. i know i’m probably a dumb ass for not thinking it through in the first place, but i was hyped to go atm",14Jul2019,0
330,"I’m the youngest among my siblings. It’s just me(24), older brother (34) , and older sister (32). 

My parents are peaking 60 years old now. 


My older sister never worked in her life. She doesn’t have a license either. She pretty much is dependent on my parents for everything. It’s pretty much like taking care of a teenager. All she does is clean dishes and help set out dinner. That’s it. She enjoys going out a lot. She has no friends. She mostly goes out alone in bike or goes out with my parents mostly. She also loves going on chatting websites and Snapchat. 

Now, why doesn’t she have a job or get a job?She doesn’t specifically give a reason why. She just says Idk and that she doesn’t want to do it. She’s been in multiple therapy sessions and even met the ones who provide pills. Result to all that therapy? Nothing. Nothing has worked in regards to helping her and she is as normal as anyone you meet outside. She has people issues however, she assumes that everyone is talking shit about her whenever they look at her. 

That’s the whole basis of my older sister. As for my brother, he’s a lost cause. He’s in his own world. You can pretty much say he is non-existent. So asking him for help or anything is a no go. 

As for my parents, they are coming to that age. They all expect me to take care of my older sister. 

I don’t want that. I’ve had enough. I want to live alone. I want to travel. I want to live somewhere else. Having my older sister there will just be like me being a single father, where I have to take care of the expenses for myself AND for her for the rest of my life. Not only that, if I want to live with my gf in peace, it will be unsatisfying because we wouldn’t have that proper alone time together. 

My family and therapy have already tried multiple times with her and nothing has worked. She just refuses and always answers “IDK.” 

What can I do about this situation? What do I do?",14Jul2019,1
331,"We’re both 16 and live in London (both male, if that makes any difference) and his mum’s been ill for a long time now, about a year and a half. She passed yesterday morning. I know he isn’t the most emotional person and often struggles to express emotions. I’ve texted him several times and he seems completely fine like he always is, but I’m sure there must be some emotion there that isn’t on display. He isn’t talking much to the rest of his family and tells me that things don’t seem too different (since she’s spent the majority of the last year in hospital anyway). I’m going to go and see him tomorrow but I have no idea how to handle the situation - I doubt he’s going to express too much emotion and will probably want to talk about something else but I feel it’s important for him to talk about it, especially when I’m the only person he’s likely to talk about his feelings with (which for a 16 year old like myself is quite a large weight on my shoulders).

332,"I had this very close friend in 3rd grade. But one day in 5th grade, he just left the school. Neither of us had phones at that time, so we couldn’t keep in touch. And my mom lost his mom’s number. I was absolutely crushed when I figured out that he left the school. 
A few months ago.. his Instagram pops into my suggested. I dmed him. After a while, he answered. I was so happy. But after we talked for a bit, he just blocked me. I didn’t know what to feel, I was just confused..

I have a friend who knows him though, and goes to his middle school. 

Since I’ve been getting mistreated at my current middle school, I might transfer to another one. I have 2 options, the school that my “friend” is at, or another one. My parents are going to try to get me into one of those 2 options. 

1. If I go to his school, I’m just scared that he’ll ignore me or hurt me.
2. Since I might be starting fresh (at a new school), I don’t know what to do. What if I get mistreated at the new school?

333,"I started my internship last week (internship is a requirement in one of our coursework), during the first day I didn't really do a lot of things except maybe photocopy and scan documents (I'm currently an engineer student) it was really disappointing to be honest but I kept my hopes up since I knew it was just the beginning. There are some others who is also taking internship there which I interviewed a bit, they told me that there is nothing really much to do there. Friends have also told me before that the company really have poor internship program, but I still gave it a try.

Second day, nothing happening, we did a brief site visit but the engineer didn't really talk to us and just gave us some measuring wheel which we had no idea what to do or didn't really matter during that time.

Now the third day made me say I had enough, I got invited by an engineer to different sites along with other engineers because their project will get checked by QA (quality assurance). The engineer is kinda foul mouthed and sexist, what happened was he started asking questions about my past relationships, I was really uncomfortable because I didn't have any and was still a virgin. I felt pressured to answer because we were in the same car together along with two other engineers. When they found out about that they started harassing me, saying that I'm probably gay and continually making gay jokes about me during the whole trip. They couldn't comprehend how I still don't have any experience in relationship and anything sexual. They were all laughing and making jokes about it.

That might sound like I made it up since I posted on another sub and they said I'm probably trolling, but it's real. Macho culture is still a problem in our country.

After that, they started telling other engineers that I'm still a virgin and the bullying continues (herd mentality sucks). Overall I realized it was not the environment I want to be in.

I decided to stop coming the next day out of these reasons: [1] The learning experience is really underwhelming [2] Toxic environment, those reasons I felt is enough to stopped coming in my internship. 

I manage to find another one which I believe will give me a good exposure in my field and currently processing it. However, the engineer ask a common friend with my father why am I not attending my internship. My parents didn't know the reason why I stopped attending, except that I told them that I am not learning a lot in that place. They told me to go back and at least give a formal goodbye, I could understand them but it's hard for me to go back and face that engineer again.

I don't really know what to do, I'm planning to go back tomorrow but as I said I don't want to face them anymore due to their bullying. But since my parents didnt know that fact, they think that I'm still in a good relationship with those engineers, but if I said to them, knowing them, they are quite emotional people and I don't want to involve them. I think this is something I have to face myself.",14Jul2019,1

336,"Wow... I never thought I’d be asking what to do in a situation like this but here goes. My fiancé and I are in an extremely rough spot.. he’s been caught in lies and we’ve been sleeping in separate rooms for awhile now. We had his friends over tonight he was less than kind to me and honestly it was pure torture to watch his two friends, who are a couple, love and laugh together knowing we can’t stand each other right now and knowing how bad I long to have his hands on my leg like his friend had his hands of his girlfriends leg. Anyways, after they left I told him how I would’ve really liked for him to do that to me tonight and it sent him over the edge. He had tequila tonight but he absolutely lost it because I said I didn’t want to go to the city with his other friends tomorrow because I was tired of pretending and it was honestly depressing. Next thing I know he’s asking for my keys, because I was parked in our garage, and he told me he was “going to do me a favor”. He has made threats like this before looking back on it but never followed through. I thought he couldn’t find my keys but somehow he found where I hid them and next thing I know he’s in the garage, my car is locked, garage door is closed and somehow locked and he has my phone his phone and our computers in the car. I fucking freak the fuck out and scream at him telling him I’m going to get the neighbors if he doesn’t turn the car off right now. He doesn’t so I fucking run as fast as I can but on the way I see a brick... so I grab the brick run back to our garage.. and yup bust my own window out. Then I grab the keys and he says “you’ve made it worse now”. I honestly don’t know what the fuck to do. He makes me feel responsible for all of this.

339,"So, I left secondary school in 2017, I knew I wanted to go to uni but had no clue what I wanted to study so I took a year off. I can't drive, live in a village with no public transport, no shop. Just fields and houses. I got very VERY depressed and ended up not applying to uni again. Got more depressed, eventually decided what subject to do and got a place at uni, 2 years later than all my friends.

The last 2 years have been me stuck in my parents house, no social interaction, no way of getting a job, so no money to do anything. Literally the highlight of my day is walking my dog on the same route I've been taking for the last 9 years. 

My mind feels dumb, I think I'd be more sane in a prison since at least they have jobs and people to talk to (my parents ignore me). I've gone to the doctor a couple times in the last 2 years asking for treatment (asked for therapy at first, then medication) since I was sucidal for most of my time at home but they just told me to ""go for a run"". I can hardly find the energy to get myself out of bed, when I do find the energy to do something it's normally just cleaning the house.

I feel like crap because of how unproductive I've been. But I just can't do anything anymore, I can't read, I can't concentrate on a movie, I still can't get a job. What do I do? I'm already stressed about the fact that I'll be 2, maybe even 3 years older than the people I'll be in uni with (I have an early birthday) and I'll have nothing to show for those 2 years other than depleted social skills. 

I'm terrified: try to imagine being stuck in a house for 2 years, and then suddenly moving to a city with a bunch of strangers.

There's this server called ""Finesse"", I joined it, talked, and felt like some kind of third-wheeler. I left a lot of servers already.

I was only working 25 to 30hrs at that job making about 10.10 a hr but Thursday the new store manger and the new DM are there to meet everyone. So I talk to them seemed okay and explained what my situation was and my role in the company.  I told them I took care of my father and work a night job and Im just doing this part time and was looking from going to 5days to 3 and they said cool no problem.  Later that night I get a call telling me that I need to drive to another location and work there for the next to weeks for ""training"".. but I told them look my truck is not always dependable to go that far and plus I get off at 7am from my nights and i would have to drive all the way there get off at 3:30pm and be up at 10pm to 7am so i can not. They wouldn't  Budge and kept saying I need to work there I told them look I didn't even want the role I'm in that I just applied for a simple office work but they acted like I was second in command of the store but why am only getting played 10 bucks while other people are getting played 15 17 or 20? Anyways they where going to let me go just like that because I wouldn't show up to the shifts over there but the Asm fought for me and DM finally agreed to let me do training closer and my DM acted like she had to move heaven and earth just for me. Anyways I told Asm look dont worry about it I'm going to have to leave so I thanked them.

I have been occasionally texting this one girl from school for a couple of months now, i believe we both liked eachother even though we didnt talk much in school unless we got the opportunity. I initially added her to my facebook friends and told her she had an amazing smile and the ball kept rolling. 2 days ago we had our gratuation, me and my friends went to the club to drink and dance while other people went to a mini-club right besides the one we where at for the open bar. Around 3-4 in the morning me and my friend deside to check how the open bar was going so we go in. It wasnt long until the girl recognised me and immediately i offered to go get some drinks and finally get to know eachother.(in retrospect i shouldnt have left my friend all alone.) While waiting at the bar i continued talking about how much i love her smile and she looked really happy.She was hugging me from behind and touching me flirtily(?) We were constantly dancing and having a good time, could be my type.Anyways we get 2 glasses of whiskey since that was what she was drinking and began talking. We were both quite drunk but very functiional, we could keep up a conversation. One thing led to another, kept dancing and flirting and we kept getting closer and closer. Eventually, when i was not expecting it she leaned in for a kiss and i refused gently by telling her we should better take a seat first. We grab 2 chairs and start talking, she was very comfortable with me and laughed at my jokes. I finally lean in and we make out for a bit. After a bit she tells me to wait for a minute and goes back to chatting with her friends i guess. She comes back and we continue talking. Towards the end of the night (6-7 in the morning) she leaves again and tells me to wait for her since she was getting ready to leave. I wait for atleast half an hour and have no news from her. I give up and continute talking to some other girl friends i come across before getting kicked off the club since it was closing.

Texted her the next morning and she said she had to leave since she was going on vacation.I cant stop thinking about her and if she thinks the same about me.(A girl friend of mine told me however that she is kind of a slut and many guys have been with her, however i dont know if i should believe her since she has a crush on me.Besides it doesnt look like that at all, she is a shy happy girl that most of her guy friends are geeks.)

351,"Bit of a long post, so stick with me.
My brother's girlfriend, let's call her Tina has completely taken advantage of me and my family. In 2015 she moved into our home without even asking. She went from staying over a few nights (which is fair enough) to a few weeks, to a few months. Right now it's been around four years. Despite the fact that my parents have let her live here for free (though they have recently started charging a pittance) she hasn't done her best to be a good houseguest. Dirty plates and laundry, instruments and paint supplies lying around, you name it. Not only has she not offered to contribute to the grocery shop, but she uses our groceries. If she was only using her own it wouldn't be a massive issue.
Anyway, the situation is further complicated by her and my brother's child. She's three years old and a sweet girl! But Tina takes advantage of my family for childcare all the time. 
As many of you may know, a child that young really needs to be looked after at all times. What Tina sometimes does is comes into the room with the child, and leaves. This effectively renders the person left in the room as her carer for the period of time Tina has left the room. The fact that she does this is annoying but the fact she doesn't even ask makes it worse. My mother already looks after the child at least once a week for free and to expect more is a complete violation of trust. Recently, Tina has having problems with her own family and complaining to us. No offense to her family issues, but if I'm sitting down trying to watch TV I don't need to hear her ramble on about issues she's having with them. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem she's leaving anytime soon. The relationship with my brother and child are one thing, but she's recently taken a couple of jobs in the local area. Of course, this also affects the previously mentioned advantage taking of childcare from our family. 
All of these events in addition to a couple of other things recently have made myself, my parents and my other brother feel that it's time for her to leave. Four years of free rent is more than enough, let alone groceries and childcare.
How do we approach this situation?",14Jul2019,1
352,"Why do I only get ""Mad/Frustrated"" in front of people?

Just wondering how and if I can control this. Whenever I am alone in my room, alone at work or alone anywhere basically, I don't really get angry when something bad or frustrating happens. When I am in front of others I tend to get more angry/frustrated with what I'm doing. Is this more of a sociological thing? Do I think I'm smarter/more intellectual (which I dont, but in a time like that I can't control what I'm thinking) than them so therefore I have to get angry? 

Situation~ I am playing a Video Game (it's not correlated to the Game at all cause I dont get mad when I play alone). My friend does something questionable, whether it was or not, I get frustrated for a couple minutes then I am cooled down and fine. 

My friends think I'm Toxic to be around but I don't see it that way cause I only get mad for a few seconds and I dont argue anymore. Working on a team doesnt suit me well because if something doesnt go the right way, I more or less state the problem and am blunt about it. I admit when I am wrong if I am wrong.

Is there a trick? Do I have anger issues? 

P.S.
It's not as bad as it seems to be I don't degrade anybody or call them inappropriate names or anything I just raise my voice [yell] and tell them what I think they did wrong.

I'm a pretty average guy. Ive come from a good family. I'm not rich but I'm certainly not poor. I'm social. I'm not terribly unfit. I'm not awful to look at. 
Recently I quit my Job in a trade. It wasn't for me and I decided that I belonged in university. I started a part time biomedical science bachelor with hopes of gaining entry into medicine. I was always a straight A student but on the very first quiz (not a significant piece of assessment) I failed. And I definitely was smart enough to pass. When reviewing what I got wrong it struck me as obvious that my arrogance was why I failed. Some questions I didnt read properly. Others, I made simple mistakes on that wouldnt have happened if I practiced more beforehand. 
And that leads me to here. I'm starting to think my arrogance is going to hold me back if I dont amend it immediately. 
And I guess I'm asking how do I do that? How do I accept that sometimes I'm not good enough yet without running my self esteem through the mud? 
I'm starting to think its more significant than just my studies. Perhaps its why all my relationships have failed and why ive never been more than a rebound guy. Maybe my arrogance makes me impossible to be with.
Ive been reading books like notes from underground and I can relate to such characters as well as the likes of people like ted Bundy (I dont mean that I think of killing people more of just perhaps how such people thought day to day). 
I feel stupid as I write this. In my head it was far better detailed and just wasn't as pathetic.

356,"    About a week ago I experienced something that hasn’t let me sleep for days. I don’t want to get into the details but basically one of my parents nearly died (no severe wounds) and i was there and i have that image of them lying on the ground stuck in my head whenever i try to fall asleep. There was a lot of blood that they puked after not being responsive. (Long story short, they are totally okay now)!
    I haven’t been able to fall asleep for literally days because whenever I try, I only see that image and those few minutes of absolute panic while calling 911 are ingrained into my head. I could go all day without seeing it, but when I try to sleep, I only see that and want to cry, feel useless, and very scared. It’s almost 4AM rn and i have the biggest headache because I haven’t slept. I go on my phone to not see that image, but going on your phone before bed makes it harder to sleep, so it’s a vicious cycle.

I [19, F] am INCREDIBLY shy and the fact that I stepped out of comfort zone to even initiate a convo with this guy is beyond impressive. So I freaked out a little, also kind of felt a rejection coming so I responded ""I think you're cute but we barely know each other so, you know...""

Fast foward a week, we're all talking about rubbing butts in the group chat (don't even ask...) and I see I get a DM. It's him saying ""*rubs butt*"" and when I tell you I screamed, I SCREAMED. I messaged my friend from the group asking ""Did he send you this too?!"" She says no, says that he's sliding into my DMs!!! So I get super excited. 

Me and him talk and I can tell he's interested in this conversation &amp; is being super engaging... Now. Here's where the problem starts: He tells me that he's been talking to another girl in the server (who turns out to be the same girl he brought up in our initial convo) and she's super awkward, that it's really hard to get to know her, that there's no chemistry BUT the only time they have something in common is when they're both horny... 

(Now, I had hope. I really did. I thought he was gonna say ""But I realize I like talking to you more!"" or something dumb like that... He didn't.)

Me, being a good friend, is giving him advice about it. blah blah blah. But in real life, I was so confused and a little hurt. It honestly felt like a slap in the face. This dude knows I like him; he pops up randomly in my DMs being flirty; and is now talking about a girl he wants to fuck?! 

So I let him know -- which is also super bold &amp; unlike me. I say ""It's kind of awkward that you know I liked you and now you're bringing up a girl you wanna eat out."" 

And I kid you not, he says "" Wait what?! You didn't say yes!"" I reply ""What are you talking about? I said you were cute."" 

He then goes on to explain that he interpreted my response as ""I think you're cute but no."" And now he's having a big fucking realization and is freaking out like ""We're you legit flirting with me all those times?!"" and ""Oh my god did I accidently flirt by RP rubbing your butt?!"" 

At this point, I'm so humiliated and honestly a little ticked off because what the fuck. I ask him if we can drop it and he says yes and then we stop talking. 

Now. I need advice - Am I overreacting? Is he right to read my responses the way he did? Should I message him to try to clear it all up or should I leave it be? 

I'm just super confused right now because I really, really do like him but I'm so lost. There's probably so many other things I want/need advice on but I can't think of them right now. 

So truly, ANY help is appreciated. Thank you!",14Jul2019,3

365,"I borrowed some money from my friend when I was going through a rough time. I said I would be able to pay it back within a month or so, but it has been almost five months and I haven't been able to do it. I wasn't able to at all for a while, and I still don't have a job, but I still get a bit of cash from family, so I can pay a bit time to time. I was experiencing one of the worst times in my life in so many ways, and only now is my situation peaceful and settled. 

My friend has been furious with me, understandably so. They feel lied to, I totally get it. I told them I would pay it back double, which is what I aim to do. I wanted to keep the communications line open with my friend, but all they do is insult me and belittle me when we talk, so I have just blocked them and pay them online when I can.

It has been very difficult for me to find work to pay it off. Even though I haven't been able to pay it back off on time, given the fact that I am going to pay them back double the amount they lent me, and also within a year of asking for the loan (gulp, I know how awful this sounds), is this the best that I could do at the moment? I feel awful, especially because I think I might be especially tight these upcoming two weeks.

In the midst of the relationship I found out he had cheated on me, which he denied for days in front of all my friends until I found evidence. My dumb ass decided to stay with him because love does stupid things to the mind (or I’m just incredibly dumb). He continued to talk down to me and ridicule me for the remainder of the relationship from sending nude photos of me to his friends to telling me I have no friends and am autistic. He got a new girlfriend in February 2019, and we were still sort of talking. He told me that it’s nice to be with someone who has full trust in him (acting like he never cheated and gave me no reason to not trust him). I have so much anger towards him to the point I feel like I’m going to explode. I’m well aware that I put up with this for so long, so I definitely have myself to blame.

I've had this best friend for 2 years now, when we met we weren't close and would only talk a bit, but about a year ago is when we would actually become good friends.

We use to talk about games, specifically fortnite (Horrible, I know) and maybe about a movie we've seen but that was mostly what our conversations are.

Fast forward a year later: I hate the game and cannot stand when people talk about it because that's all anyone does now and that is the *only* game he plays, he refuses to try anything else.

We have barely anything in common: Im unhealthy, he's sporty, meaning I can't really talk about sports because I don't know much about it. With movies I basically only see movies he doesn't care about.

Normally when we walk home it's me, him and one other person and it's fine. But when the other person leaves halfway through we just walk the rest in silence: I'll try and start a conversation but I can tell he doesnt really care about what I'm saying, with responses like ""Alright"" ""Ok"" ""Cool"" and not making a good effort. Unless there's someone else we don't talk.

He's one of the nicest guys I've met, and I don't really want this friendship to end but it's been like this for the past 3-4 months and I don't know what to do now.",14Jul2019,1

370,"Context: throwaway for personal reasons as I don't want this to be linked to my main account.  


So, I'm a 20 year old college dropout working at the moment. I lived in a foreign country for the last year before I moved back for the summer to work at home(Ireland). Whilst I was aboard I started to study computing as I have a passion for computers but soon to my realization I didn't like it (dropped out). So I worked for the next 5 - 6 months in a call center, now whilst I was working here I was living with one of my best mates &amp; I was going out with people from work, we were a really close group. Now I left I was devastated but I was to be happy. I missed my mates at home but they're gone now for summer on summer placement.  


So, I came back from a two week vacation with my friends from the foreign country &amp; it was on unbelievable, I'll never forget it.  


To why I'm writing this post, my closest mates from home are gone for three months (one month left till them coming home), and it's just me and a mate or two here left. We meet up as regularly as we can but we're working constantly and we can't. So when I come home from work I look at social media &amp; see all my mates aboard having fun &amp; gives me a sense of worthless (I suffer from depression, I go phrases but this time they stick). How do I fix this? I know I can just give up social media but it's harder than what it seems.  


The next point of this post, is the life decisions, how do I decided what to do? I have a big decision to make before the first week in August. I can either go aboard to study again (this time it's closer to home) or to move back to where I was originally, I have mates there and I can get my old job back but where I'm going to study I know no one &amp; I'm going in blind (is that a good thing?). I will always have my mates at home but I don't know I'm scared.  


So, my questions are:  
1) How do I stop getting down looking at snap chat or Instagram &amp; seeing all these people having amazing fun, whilst I'm lying in bed, getting upset?

2) How do I make the next big step in my life? (decision wise)",14Jul2019,2

N purports to have a range of impressive credentials, the most important being that they are a medical student, a physician assistant (not a certified profession in my country), and a former nursing student. I know this to be false, because (1) I am an MD/PhD-student myself and have noticed a multitude of errors in N's story, and (2) the university that N claims to study at has no record of them ever studying there.

I am 6’5 and pretty good looking (I used to hate the way I look so sorry if I sound arrogant). I have a big family and love to be around them. My nieces and nephews love me and are always playing with me when I am around ( I guess I’m good with children)

I'm about to start graduate school and go into a completely new career field. I'm looking to change my last name because my previous career was in social media and I'd just like a fresh start with no one online being able to find me (unless they really tried hard, I guess.) Another one of the reasons is that an ex-boyfriend has talked about ending my career/etc before and it just gets me nervous thinking about it. I don't have documentation of this.

I'd like the name change to happen before the fall semester so I can re-introduce myself to my professors with my new last name and it goes as smoothly as possible. I'm thinking about changing it to a last name that one of my grandparents had, but I've been told this would make it obvious it's me through google? I wanted the name to be at least something still tied to my family, because the thought of abandoning my last name from birth is quite sad to me, but I worry about this kind of thing so often when I'm trying to sleep that I don't think I'll get over it. I'm always going to be looking over my shoulder and feel unsafe with my current name. I don't want my new career to be potentially easily sabotaged because of this.

For the advice - Would a name change from one unique name to another unique name just make my information more public through a quick google search? Should I just change it to something like ""Smith"" or ""John""? I'm worried that the fact I change my name at all is going to pop up as the first search result on google.

So after I got help from my abuse then I needed to face the issue I built which was my coping mechanisms for porn / video games / maladaptive day dreaming . Now that’s my goal before I go to college is to stay in the present and focus on my life but the thing is some of my friends msged me to come back to this game and they were gonna help me with a lot of stuff and remind you every time I get into a game it’s hard for me to pull back as my disciple is low. But they said to play mandatory but I’m afraid I might fuck up and end up back in the cycle of porn and all that .
And the other thing is I don’t have many friends I can talk too irl because when I woke up and realized that most of my friends are negative and won’t make me grow I had to move on but most of my friends I speak too are in this game .
 I took a break from video games and I was extremely lonely but I wasn’t working out so that might be the reason but I spoke to myself a lot and just idk I wasn’t as happy but I felt I could work through this.
Then yesterday they said to come back and it felt good to be validated and accepted but what is scarying me is I don’t want to go back into being a addict .

403,"Tl;Dr My friend has a lot of mental health issues including schizophrenia and severe social anxiety.   Hanging out with her is exhausting and I'm tired of jumping through hoops for her only to be guilt tripped into oblivion when I don't meet her expectations. 

 Oh boy this is going to be a long one.

So I have this friend, we'll call her Lucy. Lucy has paranoid schizophrenia among some other issues and for the most part, I'm not going to lie, being friends with her is a real struggle. We used to be really close, and before things started going down hill I considered her my best friend. Despite knowing that most of this is down to mental health issues beyond her control, I just want out. 

Just for some insight into what this friendship has been like, here's some things that have happened. 

She would regularly send her bf to my house as late as 2am to pick me up so I could be with her during a meltdown.  I almost always complied but on the odd occasion that I couldn't, she would guilt trip me for 'not always being there for her' . She once got so angry at me because I wouldn't phone in sick to my job to be with her and she guilt tripped me to no end when my friend went on holiday and left her elderly dog in my care, preventing me from going to her house overnight (I started work early the next day and wouldn't have had time to walk or feed him before my shift had I gone). 

 I eventually put a stop to that when she called me up 5 days after I had a baby and asked me to drop everything to be with her in her time of crisis. I told her no and after a bit of her usual guilt tripping I said that I couldn't do that now that I had a kid. She seemed to understand and she hasn't done that since. 

The absolute last straw for me was when she sent me a picture of the back of her head with the caption 'I put my hair in a bun, what do you think?' Innocent enough right? Nope. She had a massive bruise on the back of her neck and I freaked. My first thought was that her bf was hitting her and she had sent the photo as a cry for help, but after a bit of questioning and some not so funny jokes from her, she admitted that she had asked her bf to choke her during sex and leave a bruise. She then said that she had meant to crop the bruise out but forgot. She was giggling whilst telling me this. Bullshit. She knew exactly what she was doing. She was trying to gauge my reaction to see what I would do.

Fast forward to now.  I don't go round to her house as often as I used to and she has never been to mine despite me having lived in this house for 2 years. When I do visit it inevitably end up with us in her room whilst she chain smokes cigarettes and she talks about nothing except her mental health and how much everything sucks for her. Any attempt I make at having a normal conversation is quickly smothered and rerouted back to how horrible her life is.  

Last week I mentioned I was going on a play date with an old friend from school and she mentioned that nobody ever invites her anywhere. I bit my tongue because I have invited her on plenty of play dates (She has a young son) and she has cancelled every time. She didn't even come to my daughter's birthday party despite telling me multable times that she could make it. She always says the same thing, it's hard for her to be in public because she gets panic attacks. I totally understand that but I feel like she can't cancel every single outing she agrees to go on and still expect to keep getting invited. I'm sick of reserving my days off for her only for it to come to nothing. I invited her round to my house anyway. She was supposed to bring her son today and we would let them play in the garden. She phoned about an hour ago, she's not coming.

The thing is she doesn't have many friends, most of them have bailed on her.  I think if I bailed too it would absolutely wreck her since she doesn't have the best support system for her issues and up till now I've always been the one she turned to for help. But I'm tired, I don't want to deal with her anymore. I don't want to tell her the truth because honestly I don't want to deal with her reaction.

So that's it. There's actually so much more to say but this post is already so long and I think I've portrayed at least the main stuff.",14Jul2019,1

I feel like he is afraid of his family history repeating itself. While I grew up in a great family and have no reservations about family life.

Has anyone had a SO that had reservations about having kids? Any that changed their mind? Do I give him time to figure it out? Is there something I can do to help him?

413,"So, for reference I’m a younger man who happened to want ED medication just for fun. Rather than face the awkwardness of a doctor visit asking for the prescription, I figured that an online source for ED meds a place like “hims” would be an easier option. Well, they don’t tell you on the website that they have an age before which ED meds are not prescribed, but they don’t tell you what it is. As a result my first attempt was foiled. My second attempt, I put my birthday to make me 40 so I could move past that screen— well then I found out they require a picture of a verifying ID. No problem, I assumed they just wanted it to make sure the age was correct, and I fired up photoshop and (stupidly) doctored my actual ID to match the age I gave online (because I had used my real name etc, and only changed age on the application). I submitted and waited until I got an email asking for additional medical questions and the message suggested they’d be looking up pharmacological records if I proceed, so my question is, should I move forward? My main concern is that if I answer the questions and move forward, then they’ll run the ID picture and find my real medical record, identify the fake age, and then the FBI will bust through my window and throw me in jail for pharmacological fraud or something. Is this a valid concern? Should I just abandon it and go to the doctor?",14Jul2019,0
414,"I'm 26 and a recent college graduate with a bachelor's in finance. I've realized, however, that at this point in time I would not be able to stand working in an office. Many of the opportunities because of my grades would be in accounting, which i interned in and is a personal hell. My talent in school was in creating forecasting models and doing analysis but those jobs are far and few between. I've realized as well that I dont want a legacy resting completely on wealth management. It's the opposite of why I got into economics in the first place.

I've always had an interest in the military and two of my good friends who I looked up to in school had been veterans. I have an admiration for it and always regretted not postponing school before my grades dropped and enlisting. There are great opportunities there but I feel at this point at my age in either an officer or enlisted position I would be sucked into an accounting position rather than something more involved and hands on, which is ultimately what I crave. Whenever I hear my friends who are in different branches or completing new training I'm extremely jealous. However for the more stimulating and active jobs I am nearly past the age requirement and I fear this would be a huge disadvantage.

The other option is to try and get a lower level desk job in another country. This would nearly certainly be closer to accounting and I would try to suffer through it. This however would gain me international business experience and give me more opportunities internationally if I chose to. Many of the programs have an age gap of 30 so this wouldnt be something I could pursue if I did end up going into the military.

I do have the intention of going to grad school in tech eventually. Much of the math used in finance is highly transferable to fields such as AI and weather modeling and I would really like to use my knowledge and talents for a more useful purpose, however I'm not ready to go back to school at all. I'm still young for a few more short years and I want to utilize the fact I'm able bodied while I still can. 

I'm currently pursuing getting a local job so I can see if I can handle an office job but my experience from temping and interning was less than stellar, so I'll likely move after it. I dont have much going for me here right now and I know I'm missing out on life while the clock is ticking. I'm deeply unsatisfied with where I am.

Last night myself and two girls were working when the pub was closing and the deputy manager on duty supervising us was dreadful.

The duty manager was doing nothing about it, despite overhearing it. At the end of the shift he called us all cunts and said he hates us.

So I was planning on inviting my classmates but there are a few problems.

First of all they all live far away from where I’m from and I’m not close with any of them.
I also know that they are all the types to prefer going to the disco than to a birthday party while I’m the opposite.

Since I’m not planning on doing anything related to disco I’m pretty sure they will boycott the birthday.

I work 10-12 hours overnight, cook clean, laundry, bathe and dress the child, take the kid to school and pick her up and make sure she gets time outside of school with friends or at least to the park plus more I’m not thinking of now. The wife spends around 10+ hours a day playing Xbox. We had split up recently due to an issue over infidelity from her but I gave her another chance for the sake of the kid. The root of the current problem is that my wife refuses to work or do housework (she accuses me of being sexist for asking her to do it). I tried talking to her and she said that I don’t do enough around the house as it is and until I change she won’t help. After that I lost all respect for her and I do want a divorce. The only problem is the kid, I love her and I know if we split up she’s going to move in with her parents a couple states away and I most likely won’t see her again.

He was in a long term relationship and deeply in love with his gf a good 14 years I would say and planned to marry as well but then cause of family issue the plan fell through.

428,"I don’t know where to even start from my own problems or my relationship problems.

As for myself I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I’ve been suicidal for about 6 years I’ve thought about doing it so much but I can’t afford any help. That and I’m not good at opening up to anyone. I have barely one friend if that I don’t even speak to anyone in a social context. I don’t know how to pick myself up and go forward with my life. I’ve just finished my university degree but I have no direction I don’t know what to do with myself. I am average not that amazing. I hate everything about my self the way I look, speak all of it. Lately it been harder and harder to do anything basic things. Showering, getting my hair cut, cleaning or getting out of bed.  I don’t know how to get out of it.

The second half is relationship wise. I’ve been dating my partner for about four years. As a bit of context he met his new friend while we had a big fight, his friend is female. The person he barely knew he started talking about our problems with, which made me extremely uncomfortable. I told him to stop this but I don’t know that he did. 

That was a while ago, but this week he had a major freak out over our relationship and how we had changed overtime and the things I was into. I tried to ask what was wrong but I never got an answer just nothing. It’s weird like he pretends it hasn’t happened just like everything had gone back to normal. It makes me worry a lot more than I should the unknown makes me uncomfortable. 

But the point of my max freak out is when I’ve been basically ignored all day (he said last night he would call me the next day but didn’t) to just find out he went out late at night with this friend to apparently go to karaoke. It very unlike him to just go out out this time. In the past I feel that he’s lied about how much he has told this person overtime including sexual wise which makes me uncomfortable as well. Which has included a poor tasting joke of a sexual nature to this person which humiliated me. This relationship for the start has rubbed me up the wrong way (between him and his friend). 

I guess to add to context he got really creepy into anime. To the point of having a waifu while we were together. It was never talked about or specifically mentioned. But I brought it up on his computer one day and facing all that it killed me. Like emotional cheating (and wow actually reading that back has given me more context to this situation. Like he was emotionally being busy with this thing I got ignored to the point where I had moved on without him, leaving him behind as he want paying attention to me anymore.) but he decided after this hurt me a lot to delete it one day. But this brought out more weirdness in the fact that he kept bringing it up like some amazing achievement. Which I pretended it didn’t exist because I didn’t want it to. 

 His job causes him a lot of stress but when I ask he never tells me. For the most part our relationship is fine this whole mess came out of know where. I only found out about his freak out just before I was meant to see him that day. It was like being slammed by a truck.

My brother (H) used to hit me. Since he’s turned 18 though he hasn’t yet. But the thing is he bullies me. I have mental health problems (body dysmorphia, depression and anxiety) and a few times in the past my brother has told me to kill myself or that I’m a waste of space. I attempted 3 times before (my dad hasn’t taken me to hospital cause it would danger his reputation as a good father to the court) and he holds this against me and had said before that he wishes that I didn’t fail. He’s so two faced aswell , he says that he wants to get along with me and he acts like he cares to my dad but when it comes to being downstairs alone with him he treats me like a bully would in a schoolyard. 

Another problem is that I can’t eat in the house without getting shouted at. My brothers have things for their packed lunches for work but if I grab a biscuit that was meant to be theirs it’s as if I’ve stolen the Crown Jewels. I’m a curvy girl by genetics and my brothers both fat shame me for it

I’m sick and tired of arguments aswell as my Dad’s controlling behaviour. I can’t go anywhere without my dad tracking where I go. When I’ve confronted him on this, he’s said that he was only checking up on me (I’ve been to school or out with friends and turned find friends off just so I could see if he was constantly checking and he was). 

I’m tired of living in this house which is full of arguments and so much stress. I’ve tried to see if I could stay with my grandma but I would only be interfering with her life and I don’t want that. I want to see if I can get emergency placement from the council (at 16 I think you can be in the UK) or put into the care system. I only have two more years left at home until I’m moving away and not coming back because of all the stress that has happened.

So I’ve been cleaning every day. Washing up, hoovering, doing the washing, putting clothes away, mopping floor, cleaning the bathroom etc. etc. And they thank me and then mess it up straight away. I have OCD and things being a mess or dirty just really stresses me out, I know that sounds pathetic but tidy place, tidy mind really works for me. 

They leave me with the kids whenever they can and they’re not the best behaved children.  I pay my fair share to live here a month and I’ve been buying my own food which everyone has been eating. 

I know I probably sound so ungrateful. I feel ungrateful. My friend saved me from an abusive relationship by letting me move in and all I’m doing is complaining. It’s just hard to adjust to being tidy and house proud to living somewhere that’s really dirty and untidy. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to try to relax more  and not get so stressed about stupid stuff? Thank you xx",14Jul2019,1
435,"I work in a bookshop and for the last while I have noticed that my manager (29M) treats me pretty badly. 

Firstly, he always assumes that I am the person responsible for mistakes made in the shop, without even looking into the issue. I am rarely responsible, as I am a fairly vigilant person. 

Secondly, he makes me carry heavy boxes, even though I am a small female and was specifically told at the beginning that I would not be expecting to carry out heavy lifting. There are plenty of stronger people in the shop who could do those tasks easily. 

Thirdly, he is condescending and patronizing. The other day I fell while carrying a heavy box and he did not ask me if I was okay. He laughed at me instead. He also laughs when I struggle to reach a book that is high up on the shelf. He never steps in to help me

My coworker noticed his behavior and asked me if I was okay. He was suggesting that the behavior was a sexist thing, as he noticed the manager does not treat male employees the same way. Also I think it is important to note that I have been working in the shop longer than this particular manager, who was only recently employed. His uncle is the owner of the shop.

I’m just looking for some advice as to how to deal with the situation. I really don’t want to quit or lose my job. I was really enjoying the work up until recently.",14Jul2019,1
436,"A lot of people above the age 18 want to move to apartment for freedom from parents, colleges that have lots of rules, and to live with their friends. A few words of advice I have include:

- Make sure you completely understand what the complex provides and what equities might not be apart of rent.

- Have some months worth of rent before decide (at least 3 months, but 6 months if you want to play it safe). 

- Don't go too crazy with your new freedom. I know a lot of people that were evicted because they liked to party a lot and cause noise complaints.",14Jul2019,1

438,"Hey all, I started this job about a month and a half ago. The management is super toxic, constantly bitching to employees privately about others, swearing to change policies, but overall just ranting while never trying to change anything.  


I've been saving to move with my friend into an apartment, as my dorms at college have no AC and thus it gets 105+ sometimes making it difficult to do anything at all.     


Anyway, I quit after toxic boss promised me on X date he'd change policies as I, the new employee was doing most of the shift work, he really talked shit about the others on my shift which made me feel uncomfortable. He didn't; change policies on promised date so I quit, and was asked to come back.  The store, a small gas station downtown, needs 3 employees for evenings and nights, and 1 full time morning staff, along with 2 managers.   Since I'd started the morning shift quit, two mid shifts quit, and one of the night shifts quit.  Overall we are right now at 5/9 employees. I'm supposed to be transferred off the night shift tomorrow, and I had to call out as it was 95 degrees outside and thus 110 in my acless dorm. ((it's cooler at night, so trying to sleep for night shift didn't work out, I was in bed 23 hours to get 6 hours of sleep, and am awake 14 hours before my shift.)  I called into work to let them know the situation so they could cover my shift or not. (They've changed policy, nights only needs one person, this would've been the last day ever where there'd be two night shifts.)  When I quit my manager and I talked for half an hour and I explained I wanted to get an apartment to get away from the constant heat(which we had discussed when I was hired) And would be ok coming back after an apology, which they provided.  


Well, after I called in I asked for my upcoming schedule (as the schedule was redone 3x due to people quitting again and again) I was told they'd call me back later to ""see"" if they still need me, since I'm ""going to call out every time it's hot."" I'm 100% sure they're not going to fire me and go down to 4/9 employees, but should I even bother at this point? I'd probably be quitting when college starts just to get into this apartment, just never had such a shitty job where managers are constantly toxic to employees then shocked we're at half staff.",14Jul2019,1

440,"Hello. I'm concerned for my sister.
My sister is 30 years old, still living with me, my other sister (I just turned 19 and the other is 26), and my parents.
She doesn't care for her attire or appearance, but at the same time, gets mad when you comment on her. It doesn't even have to be a mean comment. It could be something like, ""Why are you wearing a hoodie out in this 109° weather?"" or ""Why are you wearing such thick pants in mid, hot summer?"". Once you say that, she will say something along the lines of, ""You need to mind your own business!"" or ""Stop picking on me! I'm not a child anymore.""

Now that you know what she does, let's explain her appearance.
She had long and matted, thick hair. Hasn't brushed it since April and it's almost on the verge of dreadlocks. My mom often asks if she wants her hair done and she always says no, ""Stop treating me like a child,"" or threatens my mom with her disgustingness like: (warning)
Athlete's Foot
Unbrushed Teeth // Dead Rat Breath
Farts
Armpit smell
Or basic body odor

It's /disgusting/.

My grandma used to say that she missed the girl who was always bright and happy all the time, always organized and dressed up pretty. Never to my sister, but always saying that to me. I wish I could do something to help her.
It sounds like she has depression or extreme stress, but that's no reason to let this behavior go, especially if it is now costing her job (cus she goes to work in hoodies with her hood up so people dont see her hair) and probably approachability. She often says that nobody looks at her, so why should she care? But she cant seem to understand that everyone had an impression of you-- through voice or achievements online, and they will see you or /smell you/ when you walk by.

I love my sister to death, but this has got to stop. I want her to feel pretty, not say that ""nobody will care what I look like because nobody notices me"". I want her to feel good about herself and take pride in her features, not let them go astray. 

What kinds of things should I say to her or my family do to change this behavior?

Note: She is very sensitive about everything, calling things racist if you remark about a service that isn't from America or comment on someone appearance (if it's directed in a nice way or concerned way, ie. Lump on neck could be cancer (btw thisbactually happened, someone called in on a show saying the dude had a lump and it was stage 3 cancer) and she'd blow up).",14Jul2019,1

442,"We've been for 8 years together, since University. Two of those year we lived together. Through all those years I helped him with his anxiety, depression, alcoholism and drug adictions. He recovered and has been sober for over three years now. It was a hard road for me and him as well, but he made it!

When we ""broke up"", and due to his depression, we haven't had sex for more than 2 years, and I completely understood that, of course. I gained weight, and our relationship was becoming a routine; I wasn't loving my self at all. Before telling you what happened, it's worth mentioning that his family has a strong sense of fidelity, since their father left them (wife and three male children) for another woman; so I always thought of them as the ""we would never cheat on our girls"" kind of people. Until his brother did it and it was caos on the family, everyone was so sad; especially me, who had an excellent relationship with him as my brother-in-law, I felt so disappointed. All of these was added to my mind...

The day he left the apartment, he had told me the day before he had gone out to a museum with one of his female students... I got mad, why? Because I don't think it's correct for a teacher to go out with a student alone; it would have been OK if it was a group visit to the museum, but it wasn't the case. Adding to all I mentioned above, yes, I felt insecure and jealous. I blame myself for letting anger talk through me, and I told him quite awful things. During the argument he said: ""well, then I'm leaving..."" and, of course, out of anger and frustration I understood he was leaving the apartment, so I said: ""ok, then, leave, but take all your stuff"". He was overly offended saying: ""you're throwing me out?"". He ended up taking a few things and going to his mom's.

A week after that he came back talk and take all his things with him (I was almost sure he was coming back), he told he will go to therapy, that he needs to make up his mind about being with me, and be sure it's not about repaying all the support I gave him through the years. Which I understood... He haven't had s formal job since forever and talking money I've helped hin a lot. So he felt guilty about that. So I asked him ""are we braking up?"" And he says, ""not sure..."". While his packing he says, ""I never thought I'd broke up you"". Me, speechless... When he was definitely leaving, he said: ""but we're just taking a break, so talk to you later"". And I'm like: ""ok, but you know I can't wait forever""... Of couse, during this conversation I properly apologised for the words said and told himnto come back... He left me so confused. 

It's been a month now and he stills tells me he doesn't now what to do, he doesn't want to get back together and realise it was a mistake and make me suffer again. He doesn't want to definitely brake up, because he's scared he'll regret it! But I feel it's been enough time to know what to do. I felt awful when he left, I had to go to the doctor, I stopped eating, and well, I'm finally feeling a bit better, so NOW it's me who doesn't now if I should keep waiting for him to decide or just tell him to brake up. I miss him, yes, I'm feeling better now, yes. I love him? I'm sure I'll get to love him again as I did before. I hate this feeling of uncertainty... But I also think I shouldn't let everything on his hands.

445,"I originally met this guy via a dating app around two years ago, we got on very well and ended-up as friends - but it felt like that's all he wanted, it essentially took me inviting myself to his for sex. It just feels he's on dating apps as he's lonely.

I ended up blocking him, actually multiple times, because there would be times he'd talk jibberish and not explain what he meant. He'd make comments that implied he had done something or about to do something wrong to me, so his not clarifying caused a lot of anxiety. I'm fairly certain there was a problem between English not being his first language and he may have been drunk.

A few months ago he reconnected, he'd stopped drinking, gotten himself a job, and started to lose weight. He was doing well and so I decided to give him another chance, but it started again and I stopped talking...I didn't block him this time around, but he stopped talking for months and I think he believed that I had blocked him. 

Two weeks ago he started talking again, insisting he was going to try to figure out what it is he does that makes me unhappy with him. 

Last weekend he messaged me asking me how I was doing, but I didn't reply as I was on a date. He followed this with a sound recording of some music he had playing and then a message of 'thank you' 'for everything' (which is typical of what I mean about saying something but not clarifying, that sounds like he's deciding not to talk to me again). So the next day I asked him what was up with those messages...nothing. 

A week later I see he's sent a message but deleted it so I can't see what he's said. I've asked him what it was but he's still not talking. 

To be clear I've no romantic interest in him, he's just an interesting guy to talk to (when he's not being weird) and I prefer to be on good terms with people than block. It's just frustrating not knowing what the hell is going on with him.",14Jul2019,3
446,"Ever since the infancy of the world wide web, I've been using different services to talk with people one-on-one, everything from AOL chat rooms, to text messages, to Instagram. It seems that every time I have a conversation with someone new it's always very brief. This is partly because I instantly feel nervous when speaking to someone directly like this, so I think it permeates the conversation. There's always something else that feels like it's missing though. 

I've always had a lot of envy for other people who talk online/text a lot. People are able to make lifelong friends and internet boy/girlfriends/partners, and it's elusive to me because I don't know how to hold someone's intentions enough to go beyond a few blocks of text. I overthink weird details like the amount of time it takes me to mark something as 'read', and the time between each response. Obviously these are different for each conversation, but I feel like there is a cadence that keeps conversations alive. Instagram DMs have been helpful because I can respond to stories saying something relevant to what their story is about, but it never lasts long and always seems to fizzle out. 

There's been a lot of frustration that's stemmed from it, and especially lately because I'm back on the dating scene. Even after meeting someone new in person, it's like you have to get to know them a little better through text/the internet. You know, I could always say ""Hey, I'm bad at talking online, let's meet up somewhere and talk in person"", but a. that doesn't necessarily work on everyone I want to get to know better and b. I legitimately *want* to learn how to feel more comfortable having conversations online, I feel like it would improve my quality of life.

Over the years I've come to understand that the times that I'm trying to chat aren't always good times for everyone else, so I try to be mindful of that. I've also learned not to inundate people with walls of text. Voyeuristic as it is, I've even tried to seek out chat logs of people who have willingly uploaded them online just to see how the energy flows. 

I used to have in-person social anxiety fairly bad, like cringing after conversations and criticizing myself for 'what I said wrong', eye contact issues, etc. That's actually not really a problem for me anymore. Even in new social situations, I can relax and get along pretty well. It's like talking to someone digitally is a whole other domain, though. I'd just really like to learn how to do it comfortably and effectively. Any advice is appreciated, thanks in advance!",14Jul2019,1

448,"I spent almost all of my childhood in this house (I was born here, but we had a two-year period where we lived elsewhere for my dad’s job, kept the house during that time and moved back). I moved away for college about 8 years ago and ended up staying there for a job. I live about 900 miles away, a two-hour plane ride. I come back to visit four to five times a year.

When I left for college, I really thought I was ready to move away and leave everything about where I grew up behind. The town I’m from is small and there isn’t much to do, and I ended up moving to a city, which was much more interesting to me as an 18 year old. But since then, I’ve started to appreciate the simplicity of where I’m from, and I sometimes fantasize about moving back here. I wouldn’t though, because I have an established life where I currently live - friends, a good job, and a serious boyfriend whose family leaves near us. It would not make sense for me to move back here and start all over.

What’s been keeping me hanging on is the idea that I can come back whenever I’d like and sink into this warm feeling of nostalgia whenever I enter my house. I had a very good childhood, my parents and brother are amazing, and being here brings me a sense of calm and security. This house holds so many memories for me, and those all come flooding back to me every time I come home.

My dad has worked really hard to ensure that his future is full of travel and excitement. He retired last year and he and my mom are gearing up to sell the house and settle down in a country with a cheaper standard of living, like Mexico or Ecuador. Whenever I mention to my parents that I am sad about them selling the house, they are understanding, but say that they didn’t retire to just here in our hometown and perform maintenance on a century-old Victorian. I understand that too. But I can’t shake how sad I feel.

When my parents move, and I visit them at their new home, will I still feel safe and calm? Is it really my family being close to me that gives me these feelings, and at the moment, those things happen to be within the walls of my childhood home? Has anyone else experienced these really strong feelings and has come out on the other side?

TLDR: My parents are looking to sell the house I grew up in that I feel a very strong connection to. Will I ever get over it?",14Jul2019,2

During the course of those years, here's a rundown of shit that went down that has bothered me, and their ""reasons"" as to why theyve done these things:

&gt;Were against most of my ambitions (getting a career mostly related to the humanities).  (Get a more realistic dream, they said. It wont get me any money.)

&gt;Forced me to join their religion, and leave my former religion and beliefs behind (because apparently, if i dont join, i wont be saved.)

&gt;Nearly arguments everyday.

&gt;Uncle forces me to buy his cigarettes (I'm not allowed to, but he does it anyway.)

&gt;Called me ""weak"" and ""petty"" bcus I was suffocating @ cigarette smoke. (they cant withstand it, so why cant i? take note that i have a history of asthma.)

&gt;I study hard, but they find my grades low despite getting grades equivalent to A to A+

&gt;Invading my privacy, snooping through friends' letters to me on special occasions, my wallet, etc. (I got questioned for a friend's letter to me once.)

&gt;Telling me to be grateful bcus if they didnt pick me up and take care of me then I wouldve been rotting right now.

&gt;Using my dead mom to guilt trip me whenever I do something that doesn't seem right to them.

.... and more.

Idk. Should these actions be tolerated or not? I have no idea what to feel or do anymore. It just keeps happening over and over again and I dont know if I should permit this to keep happening or not. Sigh. Send in your thoughts, would def appreciate thanks.

Im sorry in advance if this sounds absolutely petty. The whole thing just leaves me so confused and drained and I literally dont know what to do. Are they actually concerned for me? Or something of the like.

452,"This is a touchy subject, please be understanding, I suck at trying to find the right words but I really need help!!! 

Ive had an a female German Shepard mix as an emotional support animal for almost 3 years, and I live in an apartment in North Dakota. I have only lived in apartments with her, and never had an issue before this apartment. A few days ago I received a complaint letter from the manager filed by a neighbor, basically stating “if I can’t get her under control the leasing company will be coming in and removing the dog from the unit.” She isnt aggressive, she would NEVER hurt someone, she is not destructive, generally well mannered and she love people. I always clean up after her outside. I have provided them with proper documentation from my doctor that she is a part of my treatment plan. She is starting training as an actual service animal the end of this summer. The only thing is she can be protective over me, because she feels like her sole purpose is to be there for me, especially because I left an abusive relationship and she would get wound up if he ever attacked me and jump in front of me. If someone is making a bunch of noise outside the balcony, screaming in the hallways, she gets upset. The walls are paper thin so you can hear EVERYTHING. It’s an older building so I feel like it wasn’t built great. She will bark occasionally when this happens, but I can typically calm her down quickly, and it only lasts a few seconds before I’m able to quiet her. 
This is really difficult to talk about because it’s a touchy subject and I don’t really know how to word it without sounding horrible, but I don’t know where to look for advice. 

A lot of the other tenants in this building are from another country, which I don’t mind. But because of cultural differences, they are deathly afraid of dogs. It wasn’t a problem to begin with, I more or less just felt bad because I understand they don’t like dogs and was trying to be a little more cautious when I walked her out the door. But now it’s become a full blown problem. A man in the adjacent building from me was swearing at me, yelling, threatening to call the police on me when I literally was just standing there with my dog. This happened multiple times with the same man. Probably 5-7 times in a matter of a few weeks. Other neighbors have been cussing at me, scoffing, giving dirty looks, yelling at me, I’ve had garbage thrown up onto my balcony. I’ve had someone pound on my door and start screaming at me “get your f***ing dog out of here.” I’ve had people swatting their arms in my direction to keep the dog away from them and screaming when we’re all the way across the yard area. Yesterday I was coming back inside the building, with my key about half way in the lock, and a man inside the building stands there, stares at me, and then slams open the door from the inside. Because my hand was on the lock, my wrist bent backwards, and I fell off the platform to get into the building. He scoffed and walked back inside. 

I’m starting to get scared to even live here anymore, I don’t even want to walk outside with her because I’m afraid of upsetting someone.
I entirely feel bad for subjecting people to living in a building where they’re uncomfortable, but it’s escalated to a point where I feel like they’re just complaining to the leasing company because they don’t like dogs or because they are afraid, not because shes doing anything wrong. Some other people in the building love her. People come up and beg to pet her, she plays with some of the neighbor kids all the time, an older man stops me outside the apartment every time he sees me and compliments me on how good she is. 

As you can see it’s a really tough subject, so I just never brought it up to the leasing company because I felt like they’d accuse me of something. But now that the company is threatening to take her, I want to find somehow to get out of my lease. But I don’t know how to explain it. And I feel like if I tell them what’s been going on now, they’ll take it as I’m trying to counter the letter I received with fake complaints. 

My lease was up June 30th and now I’m on a month to month basis. Typically on month to month they require only a 30 day move out notice, but they need it in by the first of the month, prior to the month you’d be leaving. So if I wanted to have been out of here by the first of August, I would have had to given the notice on the 1st of July. 

PLEASE HELP 
I feel horrible making people scared of the dog, I’m scared to live here. I don’t want anyone upset, I want this to go over as smoothly as possible. I need to find a pet friendly building. Since she’s a registered emotional support animal, I can live anywhere, but i feel like living in a pet friendly building would be much easier because unlike here where people are expecting there to be no animals, people will know that everyone has dogs or cats.",14Jul2019,1
453,"Hi y'all this is my first post on here it's probably gonna get pretty long so bear with me, also I'm on mobile so ignore any format issues. English is not my first language so please excuse my grammar.

We have been friends for over six years now and we get along great. We both have our problems we deal with and we try to help each other out with that as good as we can, furthermore she is seeing a therapist for her depression and social anxiety. 
She is 19 and has never been in a relationship, which doesn't help her emotional neglect issues at all. She looks good, has a great sense of style , she's very shy in personal interactions but pretty forward over text, which has impacted the few dates she has had in the past. One boy has told her that her online presentation had discrepancies from her real life and because of bullying from her childhood she thinks people won't love her because she's fat (she's a bit chubby but I wouldn't consider her fat). This boy in particular is really hard for her to get over, she can't stop thinking about him and cries when she sees his Instagram stories. I have told her to unfollow him but she won't because ""it's the only thing from him that she still has"" and ""it has to hurt"" even though they don't talk and it's only hurting her to see him.

Recently she has been getting involved with this other boy, they have been texting and saw each other once. He has clearly stated that he is looking for a fuckbuddy and mostly only talks about sex. She told me that she wasn't comfortable with that and that she wants to have real conversations.
They haven't talked for the last few days because he was on a trip but now he's back and has texted her again. Now she wants to talk and meet him because ""he's the only one that wants to spend time with her"" and because she thinks he's her only chance for affection. She stated that if sex is the only way she'll get love and attention then so be it. She gave up on finding anyone that will love her because if love was real she would have found it by now. This really concerns me because she is a deeply romantic person and always imagines their whole life with her romantic interest. Emotional neglect was normal in her family as a child and she says that she's always gonna feel neglected no matter what. 

I tried telling her that this would not be a good idea because it's only gonna make her issues worse and that she can choose to break the cycle by not getting willingly involved with someone that she knows doesn't have the same goals as her. She wants someone she can be emotionally comfortable with and not just use her for her body, she has had an experience like this before and it broke her, she stated she never wanted something like this again.

After I told her that she send me a text that said: ""I appreciate the concern but you're not my therapist and you're talking like you know everything about how I'm feeling and it's just not working out for me lol like. I know u wanna look out for me but I'm not naive anymore"".

I know she's making the wrong decision by engaging with this boy in any way, what should I do? Thanks for reading all of this you are the real MVP's.",14Jul2019,3
454,"I know this has probably been asked a bunch, but no advice seems to really fix anything. I have to clean my bedroom up, and there's a lot of clutter, and one half of my bedroom hasn't been touched in over a year, (my bedroom's almost a storage room at this point) and when looking behind my door, saw a black shadow quickly shift behind my bed, so now I'm not feeling too good.

I get [giant house spiders](https://i2-prod.getreading.co.uk/incoming/article11867468.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/JS99127996.jpg) in my house, occasionally, and I've seen at least 2 the past few weeks.

I'm pretty badly scared of them. Not too long ago, I saw one on the far side of my bedroom, and it went behind my bookshelf. I couldn't get to it, and mustered up the courage to stay in my bedroom, since I thought it would stay behind the bookshelf. The next day, I was laying in bed, turned around and saw it a few inches away from my face, almost falling off the wall onto my bed. That's the second or third time something like that's happened.

455,"Hello everyone. I’ve very recently ended a meaningful relationship with someone for reasons I don’t share nor understand and would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice on how to move on from it.

Last August I met a girl who came to my city from abroad and we instantly hit it off. So much so that she helped me pursue my lifelong dream to move overseas, and told me to live together and that she saw herself spending many years and experiences with me. We were madly in love when she left my country in February, and I went to see her on March, before I definitely move to her city in August.

The thing is, she changed her mind a month ago and told me via Skype that she no longer wanted to be in a relationship with me. I told her it was fine, that since she was coming in July we could just spend time together and see where things went once she was here, stressing on the fact that I intended to keep it “romantic”, and she agreed. But last Friday, when she finally arrived, she told me that since she hadn’t felt a sudden rush of love when she saw me again at the airport, it was a sign for her that things were over. There was no use in telling her that I thought that happening was quite unlikely since we hadn’t seen each other in months and having broken up in the middle. As she says, “it’s just the way I work”, and I respect that.

So now she’s here until the end of the month, apparently very much positive about not being together, and I haven’t yet been able to move on. As the title of the post says, I’m in dire need of your advice.

TL;DR: I’m just out of what was a very meaningful relationship to me and need help to move on.",14Jul2019,1

In just a few weeks I will be moving into a 2 bedroom apartment with my fiancee and I was wondering what sort of advice you have when moving in with a signficant other? We are both really excited. I believe our relationship is healthy, we get along well and when we fight we don't sit on it for days (the don't let the sun go down on your anger approach is pretty great) so that's a good place to start. We have talked about finances, chores, work, personal cleanliness, and have a rough plan (and some contingencies) for the next few years. 
I do know however that with life, things are generally quite different in practice than in theory so I'd love to get any and all advice on the subject so that we can be as prepared as possible!

462,"I’m a 24 year old female talking to a 27 year old male. We met in college, we talked briefly at one point and I’ll be honest I blew him off...FOR YEARS. I wasn’t interested in him and I was always skeptical of his intentions. I’m not kidding I probably told him no about 15 times. 

I’ll give him an A for effort because he would always just keep trying. Earlier this week, he texted me and it actually turned into a 48 hour conversation about how he just wants a fair shot and wants to give me what I deserve. I finally just gave in, and consistently talked to him. I have to admit, he’s such a sweetheart and I can totally see myself with him. Tonight, we’re getting dinner together. 

He’s so sweet.. he keeps telling me how excited he is to see me again and how he’s just so happy I finally decided to give him a shot. Oh my heart! 

The one and only problem: he lives two hours away. Tomorrow we’re meeting at a halfway point to basically talk about everything and ease my mind. He’s convinced we can make this work out and it’ll be fine, I on the other hand aren’t too sure. I’d like it to but, I don’t know. There’s just a lot to consider and discuss. 

I talked to my mom about her thoughts and she essentially called me crazy and told me I should tell him no to dinner. Last night, my parents were asking my plans for tomorrow and I told them I’m getting dinner with Hayden... my dad also gave me total shit for it and called me crazy and pretended like he didn’t know anything - however my sister had told me she heard them talking about the situation without me there the previous day. 

They belittle the idea of me even grabbing dinner with him and then begin talking about how next I’m going to be taking two hour trips to see him. I simply told them I’m just getting dinner, I’m not marrying the guy and it just caused more of an uproar. 

I’m actually kind of just down in the dumps about this right now. I made a post about this once before and everyone was encouraging. My friends are also encouraging and don’t think this is really crazy at all or even the slightest bit unreasonable. 

Im really just bummed out about how my parents are viewing and treating this. I want them to understand I’m an adult and can and will make my own decisions. I’ve attempted to have this conversation with them previously and it turns into an argument every single time. For whatever reason they swear they’ll need to come to my rescue or whatever meanwhile they’ve never had to “rescue” me in my life. They’re both really immature about the situation and have a completely different outlook on dating that’s no longer even current. 

I really want to please my parents BUT I also need to do what makes me happy. I can’t let them control me forever. How can I handle this situation better? Any input is so so appreciated.",14Jul2019,3

We are currently on summer break and I usually pick up more hours during this time. However, due to the progression of my scoliosis, combined with spondylolisthesis, This has caused a vertebra in my spine to crack. 
I have been to Vanderbilt about it and I’m now in physical therapy for it. 

I told my manager that due to spinal issues I can’t work long shifts anymore and can only realistically work about 4 days a week. She then proceeded to schedule me longer hours, and put me on the schedule for 5 days a week. I can’t stand for more than 2 hours at a time. To combat this sometimes I would go in the back room to sit and fold boxes until the pain became a little more tolerable. I don’t take smoke breaks so I figured this could be a substitute for that. I have left work in tears from the pain in my back and after the fiasco last Wednesday I have resorted to some drastic measures. 

It has gotten to the point that I have had to buy pain pills from sketchy people just to be able to make it through my shifts at work.

467,"Let me give you a little bit of a back story.

I graduated from high school in 2017, I then took a year off college because I had eye surgery and did not want to start college in the winter. 

I decided to go to college in the fall of 2018, I had decided that I really wanted to become an Engineer. I still do. 

The Fall and Winter semester went by great, I have to retake English but that is ok because it is not my strong suit. However during the winter, I had some troubles finding the focus to do Math a subject I love. It got worse and worse, I knew it was my brain telling me that I had other more ""important"" things to do. 

This summer when I started my summer class, I started going to a therapist. He thinks I might have ADHD. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I started to connect all the ""dots"" together it made sense. On my good days, I could hyperfocus and math was extremely easy as it was before. But on my bad days (which I am having nearly 6 days out of the week, they have been getting worse, because I am continuously falling behind in my summer class) math is so hard to a point where it makes me feel like I am not smart enough to become an Engineer.

Should I drop my summer class so that I can refocus my life and work on myself?

Last night i had two friends over for some beers and a fire, friends both rode their bikes over but the one lived about 15 minute ride away. So as our night wraps up (2a.m) we call it and they head out. My friend (a solid 7/10 on the drunk scale) starts his 15 minute ride home, I know he's not going to crash so I let him go having faith. He explains to me this morning after I see his post on local town buzz facebook group that his bike got stolen, he got stopped by the cops and had just spent the night in the drunk tank, being forced to leave the bike there, half way home, on a street with no houses. He tells me he walked right to where they arrested him after he was released this a.m and the bike wasnt there, then walks home (about 2hrs of walking, on minimal sleep and a slight hangover). He got himself a 70$ drunk in public ticket aswell. Worst part is hes had two previous BMX's stolen, and he had just built up this dirt jumper yesterday.

So i feel bad because he couldve stayed at my house, but im more angry at the cops, why didnt they just let him go home? Escorted even? Why did they just leave his bike on the side of the road? They knew it would be stolen, is there anything we can do? Fight the ticket, go after the cop for him being the reason for friends bike being stolen. I dont think theres any winning in this sitution for him, unless he gets his bike back.

I have been sexually assaulted multiple times by different people, and raped when I was in my 20's. Over the last few years, I have developed a phobia of sex and intimacy and honestly, anything to do with sex freaks me out and disgusts me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It improved for a while, as I was single (and celibate) for about 2 and a half years. Just after Christmas, I met my girlfriend. We get on really well and I love her. But eventually the fear crept back in. The issue started again due to a couple of issues. 

1) I am on a lot of medications for my depression and anxiety, and these have a massive impact on my sex drive. It's very low at the best of times.

2) I have Chronic fatigue syndrome and it's been particularly bad at the moment, and I have been far too exhausted to want sex. It makes me feel like I have a mild flu most of the time and its exhausting. The problem is that I associate being too tired etc for sex with past partners then getting frustrated and pressuring me for sex. In my first ever relationship this happened, and eventually, I used to wake up to my boyfriend fingering me in my sleep and masturbating. So in my mind I associate lulls in sex with pressure and sexual assault.

I just freeze and just let things happen to me even if I'm incredibly uncomfortable with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

476,"This may be a long story but if you want the short(ish) version here it is: I have been without a place to live for the past 3 weeks. I am staying with some friends but they are a newly married couple in their new home and I just feel uncomfortable over staying my welcome. I don't make much money and I have no savings if any kind. How can I possibly find a place to live??

-----
Now for the detailed version of how I got into this mess.

1.5 years ago, I broke up with my boyfriend whom I was living with. The lease was to expire just as he was finishing his degree and moving away. I didn't have a plan but I had a job so I knew that I would be staying indefinitely in the area. As such, I found a place to live.

I found a woman with a beautiful house in a part of town that I had always liked: she was looking for someone to move into the furnished guest bedroom and live there on a month to month basis + my two dogs were welcome. It seemed perfect as I had no furniture anymore and didn't want to commit to a year long lease. I am not sure why it did not occur to me that there was something wrong with the fact that she was ""cool with not dealing with the formality of a lease"" or that paying her rent in cash was best. She had a hippie vibe, seemed nice enough, and had a really nice home so I figured all was well.

6-7 months later, I had started seeing a guy and we were pretty serious, my dogs and I spend nearly every night at his apartment. We decided to move in together, I gave her my 30 day notice which she was totally fine with and said she would just apply my security deposit to that final month's rent. Well, when I showed up (after several days absence) to pack up my belongings, I found the house locked up and totally empty. 

My room mate had moved and taken everything I owned with her. I tried to contact her and unsurprisingly it took her a while to respond. She tried to say that she hadn't had access to a phone or anything for weeks and was out of state. Supposedly, the house's owner (apparently NOT her) had said that she needed to move out because of some safety concern. She said because she was out of town with no access to a phone, her friend (who didn't know who I was or how to contact me) had taken on the task of moving all of both of our belongings into storage.
She said she would send me a key to the unit. 
After several months of trying to contact her and hearing nothing, a key finally arrived. When I went to retrieve my belongings, I found that she had not paid for the storage unit the entire time and it would take several hundreds of dollars that I didn't have to open it to get my belongings back. She blocked my phone number and any other route of contact.

I had been staying with my boyfriend and we intended to move to a new place together when his lease expired. However, several medical issues and car breakdowns later neither of us had anything in savings. We couldn't afford to get a new place. He went to renew his lease at the current apartment but was told that his unit was for 1 person only and maximum 2 dogs (he had 2 before I begun staying with him and I had 2 as well). Without any other options or time, he went ahead and signed a lease for him and his 2 dogs. I continued staying with him while I tried to find a new place to live. We were very friendly with the staff and they were aware that my dogs and I were there but they let it slide.

Then things get even worse: 4 weeks ago today, my dog and I are at the apartment dog park with a friend and his pups. A man came by and started teasing the dogs through the fence. My friend (who is not known to be the most polite) told him to go away and leave the dogs alone. This made the guy even more aggressive and he began kicking and punching at the fence anytime the dogs were near it. I tried to get my dog back to my boyfriend's apartment but the guy was attacking him still. He then claimed my dog bit him and that I slapped him. My dog may have bitten him (if so, I don't blame the dog AND it didn't appear to cause any sort of abrasion or injury) but I definitely didn't slap him.
 He spent the next several hours yelling threatening things at my boyfriends apartment door, refusing to leave, saying he was going to get my dog euthanized or break his neck himself. He at one point threw a punch at his girlfriend who had apparently not acted as he wanted her to. In short, he obviously is not entirely stable and clearly not exactly an upstanding individual.

He called the cops, I called the cops. The cops issued me a citation for assault because they said that there was a witness to me slapping him. As I did not slap him, there obviously was not a witness but he was able to ""persuade"" someone to lie for him (presumably the girlfriend that he punched). 
In response to my complaint that I felt unsafe and that he was harassing us, the officers tried to tell me that he would have had to stand outside my boyfriend's apartment and been reported for it maybe 10-15 times over several weeks before they would consider that harassment. They say that he was perfectly within his rights to be right outside as, in an apartment complex, only the step directly outside your door is considered private. The sidewalk right in front of that can be inhabited by anyone at anytime.

The security guard that works at the complex took down a detailed statement from everyone involved about what happened.

A week later, I received a letter from the apartment's lawyers that said ""your dog attacked a resident. Because you are not on a lease here, you are being issued a no trespass warning. If you or your dog are on the property you will be arrested immediately and your dog taken by animal control"".

I spent the next couple of nights and the last of my money staying in a hotel room at a super 8 in a scary part of town. A friend of mine found out and convinced our mutual friends (the married couple I referred to in the beginning) to allow me and my dog to stay for awhile.

My boyfriend is stuck on his lease for the next several months so I am on my own.
I have a full-time job and make a fairly reasonable amount of money for what I do (I work at a veterinary office. I have an economics degree but I really wanted to gain experience in the veterinary field so that I would hopefully one day work for a rescue group or shelter).
However, I have hundreds of dollars worth of bills every month:
- student loans (not much as I am on income based repayment)
- My dog's medical bills (she was hospitalized resulting in some 1500 worth of bills that I am still paying on).
- Insurances
- my dog's medications and supplements
- my own medications etc
And now a steep fee for a lawyer to fight the ""slap"" charge.

To sum this all up:
I have no money in savings anymore, I am in a difficult financial situation, and now I need a place to live that I can have my 2 dogs in and eventually also my boyfriend's 2 dogs AND I need to be able to afford it on my own for the next several months.

Also my credit is not the best. Being that I had no credit history whatsoever but a bill in collections (I had the cable bill in my name at the apartment with my ex. I left it open for him but asked that he pay it. He didn't) I wanted to try to build up my credit. My sister had probably 50-60k worth of available credit on her cards and offered to add me as an authorized user to help boost my credit. It worked and my credit was finally pretty good (800ish) but THEN she and her husband opened a restaurant and used their personal credit cards to pay for everything rather than applying for a business loan. They maxed out all the cards and my credit plummeted. All of sudden my debt to income ratio was unreal- suddenly it looked as if I had debts totalling 3 times my annual income NOT including my student loans. My credit is now about 540 and many landlords won't accept renters with such low credit 😔.

So I am in need of advice! Please help me 🙏",14Jul2019,1

I moved to a new state a little more than five years ago. The reason I did so was to marry someone that I had met online. Before moving I was doing freelance musician work like performing and teaching and I have tried to do the same thing in the current state that I am living in. I do not make as much money doing this as my partner would like. She would really like to own a house and we are doing our best to save up but for her it can’t happen soon enough. We have been considering career changes for me over the past year. So that I can make more money Here is a list of all the things that I have considered doing: Priest at a church, music therapist, something with animals, librarian, software developer, get my phd and become a professor of religion. I have had a hard time imagining what I would like to do as my career for the future. My greatest areas of interest are music, animals, religion/spirituality, and cannabis. One problem I have is not having enough money to get more education and already having a bunch of loan debt because of my undergraduate. People seem to think you can teach yourself software development for free or cheap and then make a crap ton of money doing that. I have started teaching myself a little about coding but don’t know if I’ll be able to be interested enough in it to get good enough. I basically want to spend all of my time doing music. Right now I am leaning towards music therapy. I think I would love to do music therapy for animals. Unfortunately, the possibility of getting paid a whole lot more with a masters in music therapy is not that great. I know what makes me happy in this life but I can’t seem to find a way to make it more profitable. So how do I continue to do what I love doing and make more money? What would you say if a dear friend or family member came to you with this or a similar problem?",14Jul2019,1
486,"So a little back story, tlme and two of my friends we all work in the field of IT, we're good at what we do, and decided that it was time to register a business. We went on and registered, entered a contest to get support from our local municipality. So far it is going great, it seems that we're getting the financial support we need for tools.

Now we have only one problem, we have no idea how to search for work.. 

So the question is, what is the best way to publish ourselves so other businesses/companies hire us?

Are billboards still a viable choice? How about those large screens? Flyers? Any advice is welcome.

487,"My sister and law and brother gave me a gift yesterday while we were out to dinner, and I opened it . It was a piece of simple but not super expensive jewelry which was pretty. It didn’t need to be expensive, it is fine. I said wow, and thank you, and put it on to wear the rest of the evening. Mind you I did say thank you and I was pleased with it and said so. The only thing is she acted mad the rest of the night. She had a mad look on her face, and then today I saw a post on her Facebook about how some people in families just do things differently and are a little weird. 
I don’t know if that was about me, but like I said I said thank you for the gift and was pleased with it. I don’t know how else she wanted me to act, a song and dance maybe? I was planning on writing them a thank you note and still will but what in the world did she want me to do? Did I do something wrong?",14Jul2019,2
488,"I’m currently in a relationship of 5 months with someone I’ve known for 2 years. 

My boyfriend has a best friend who is his ex girlfriend, they had an on and off again relationship, she cheated on him, but never dated more than a couple weeks at a time, 

Thing is, my boyfriend has all these things from when they were together, letters, pictures, even fucking underwear she sent him. 

He doesn’t know I’ve seen the letters or pictures, he’s currently moving out of his apartment and I came across them under his bed. 

We just had a fight about him having a picture of her in his wallet with writing on the back saying how much she loved him and wanted to experience life with him so he gave her his favorite picture of her to carry out and look out when he’s sad and lonely. 

This hurt a lot. 

I already had previous problems with the ex gf, stalking my twitter, instagram and tik tok, yelling at my boyfriend for hanging out with me so much, demanding him to fly half way across the country to see her, she sends him pictures of her crying, her topless and drunk telling him he’ll never find someone like her again, and so much more, telling him we’ll never last, and so much more. 

He knows how I feel about her, and how everything she’s done effects me. 

I know he might have forgot about it and probably hasn’t come across the picture or looked at it since we got together but, it’s the way he threw the picture at me, yelling at me for caring so much about another girl, and saying we’ll never last like this.

I don’t know what to do or how to feel. 

He keeps telling me to move on or get over it, but I can’t when I stare at a picture of them together in his apartment hanging on the wall just there. It’s a constant reminder of her, and how much she hates that she is not the only dating my boyfriend. 

He makes me feel like I’m the bad guy here but I just feel hurt and upset.",14Jul2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and sister (43) were doing a Euro trip and visited me on a layover for a few days on their way to Europe. Me (35) and my sister got into a fight (it was something stupid and we're both to blame 50/50) but in my view, she took it to another level by being extremely insulting, saying cruel things unrelated to the issue. She insulted my personal life, told me the family was better without me, that I shouldn't visit when she visits (we sometimes vacation in warm places as a family), said I should marry someone like this woman she hates, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So she left to Europe on this note. She was messaging me later via Whatsapp, sending photos, telling me about her trip like nothing happened and I told her directly that what she said was cruel and it bothered me. She ignored it, then complained to my mom that I'm still simmering over the issue and I haven't let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

Now they're on their way back from the trip and are coming back to stay with me for three days. I have the opportunity to stay with my girlfriend and avoid this situation. This will cause a fight between me and my mom as she'll view this as me extending this fight. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other option is to stay at home and maybe she'll finally apologize a month later, which I don't really value, or maybe the situation will be tense as we just avoid each other/try to be cordial. The latter concerns me as I'll be uncomfortable in my own home.

492," 

I know how much people absolutely hate phones during movies, to a point where it's kinda scary, which is why I'm worried about what others might think of what happened to me today. So basically I was watching a movie with my cousin and my aunt (his mom) called me, and my phone rang for around 5 seconds before I managed to turn it off, and I then proceeded to spend the next 15 seconds texting her, creating an annoying light.

It wasn't during an intense moment or major turning point but it was during a part where the movie's volume isn't very high and the characters are speaking. Do you think someone could be plotting to hurt me or do something like track me down and follow me/find out where I live? I know MOST people will shrug it off, but there is a possibility that someone with mental problems happened to be there and overreacts to things like this. It's rare, it's over the top but absolutely POSSIBLE.

Do you think my worry is justified? I mean, there were a ton of people so I wouldn't dismiss that possibility. There's a lot of crazy people out there and you can't just say they don't exist because THEY DO. Maybe they have been to many movies where there was always that one guy who's phone rings and I just happened to be the last straw. When small annoyances stack up it can really make someone snap.

BTW, this takes place in China and the movie was Spiderman: Far Away From Home (probably huge fans watching with me who would NOT tolerate a ringing phone), so I'm not sure if people there are more/less inclined to react than in America. Just want to get some opinions/thoughts from you guys.",14Jul2019,0

499,"Hi all,

So my boyfriend (20) and I (F, 19) have been together for 6 months and told me a while ago he's bicurious, which made me worry I wouldn't be able to give him everything he wants (mainly sexually) but he reassured me that he is in love with me and this wouldn't get in the way, he'd rather be with me than explore. He's come out as enjoying cross-dressing, liking anal stimulation (which is fine that's where the male g is), and has kissed guys before but never done anything more with anyone.

He also told me he'd had a crush on and asked one of his friends if they'd be open to exploring with him but his friend rejected this, but he also said how it pissed him off that this friend has also now come out to some people as bicurious which makes me think that he isn't over it/him.

Very recently he opened up about how he's been thinking more and more about sex with men and how when he thinks of the typical picture of a woman lying on a man's chest in bed he doesn't know who he relates to more. I've told him that the typical relationship doesn't really exist like that and that I don't mind he's maybe more feminine than the typical male society perceives but he's still caught up on it and wondering what it'd be like to be a woman.

The main part is his desire to have sex with men. I don't want him to not find out who he is or what he wants because he's stuck with me. I also don't want him to force this down and end up regretting our relationship and resenting me down the line. The idea of him having sex with anyone else, man or woman, while we're together upsets me but I love him and he loves me, I know that might sound naïve but it's true. I also know if we continue on together without him having explored who he is it's almost certainly set up to fail with this idea and these thoughts constantly in the back of both of our minds. He's said he doesn't want to do something that'll break us up and he does want to be with me but I have a very clear gut feeling if he doesn't do this then we'll end up forced apart regardless.

I just don't know what to do or where to go from here. Any help, advice, opinions, experience with this sort of thing would be greatly appreciated and I sincerely hope this doesn't offend anyone :)",14Jul2019,1

502,"We've had this miniature schnauzer for about 5-6 years. His original owner was a dunce that would show him off for a day or two, and then leave him at our house and actually moved to a whole other state at some point. This gave him such terrible separation anxiety that took me a long time to work him through. She died September 17' but she was never solidly in his life so it didn't matter really matter.

Anyways, this dog is the softest natured animal I've ever met, and has become my dad's closest bud. This dog means absolutely everything to my dad, and has been by his side through some pretty major losses over the past 5 years; my mom, my brother, my grandma, his original owner/my dad's GF at the time, etc. 

Yesterday, out of nowhere, his back legs just stopped working. Literally he was running around rubbing his face everywhere cause my dad had just given him a bath, and then he just stopped. My dad rushed him to the vet last night, and at this point it's spreading to his front legs and nothing easily fixable has appeared in a lot of their tests. 

It's looking more and more like euthanasia will be the most humane option, as opposed to my dad driving him two hours away at the end of this week to see if it's neurological. Even if it is, there's not much that can be done. And none of us in the house have the kind of schedule to give him the kind of care he would need. Not to mention his overrall quality of life would be significantly reduced. 

I guess I kind of have two questions for advice. Should I encourage my dad to pursue the neurologist, or just to euthanize him (the vet has encouraged the latter)? Also, if we do have to euthanize him, how long should me and my siblings wait to get him a new dog?

I know the second question seems presumptuous that he'd even want another dog, but my dad is a very depressed man with no social life. He said to me this morning ""sfdbsd, these animals ARE my social life"". He needs another dog to get excited and flip out when he gets home. That reaction he gets means so much to him and makes him feel so loved, wanted, and that he has something unconditionally loyal in his life.

513,"I am a 20 year old male. My parents divorced when I was young (8 I think) and I barely remember living with my father. What I do remember of him were a few moments of rage and my own terror. He hit me and my sister and also my mother. When he left he never payed child support, and indeed continued to interfere with our lives from afar, like getting my mother fired from her job at a private school, forcing me and my sister out of that school for financial reasons and not being educated that year (mother said she was homeschooling us, she wasn’t). I’ve tried contacting my father since to get closure and not feel like discarded trash (he has since had new kids that he is now raising), but we are simply too different. I don’t love him, but I never had a father figure and in this vein I feel incomplete.

My mother grew depressed when this happened. I remember neglect and wrath. She would hit us occasionally but reliably, was emotionally and verbally abusive (threatening to send us to our fathers and abandon us—for simply not cleaning the house well enough which she would force us to do everyday). She would lay in bed all day forcing us to fetch her food, walk to the store, even forcing me (not my sister) to pluck hairs from her face with tweezers, rub lotion on her feet, and step on her back. I hated it. Further more, she lived in her own filth (that she would make us clean) and would walk around naked (which I found profoundly upsetting). She is very obese, and seeing her like this made me disgusted of myself: I came from a literal pig. (No offense intended, this is just how I interpreted it at the time)

My sister was fed up with my mother and left our family when she was to go to college. She dropped out, made amends with my father, and joined the coast guard. I’m doing this she left me. Indeed, she tried to get a restraining order against my mother, forcing me to lie to the judge so that my mother wouldn’t subsequently lose her job and not be able to support me. I didn’t want to defend her, but I had very little choice. My sister berated me, said we were done talking. She has since reached out, and I don’t try to avoid her, but I simply have no desire to speak to her.

My mother’s wrath is much diminished since my sister left. But I simply don’t love her. I can’t even stand it when our elbows touch on the center console of the car—I shudder and compulsively need to “wipe off” my elbow. She has said she will help pay for my college, but is taking out loans in my name, not paying them, assuring me they will be paid, and not changing or amending her truly horrific spending behaviors. I truly am disgusted and ashamed by and of her.

Beyond family, I have other concerns that are eating away at my soul and my happiness. These are tough to share...

I was cheated on by my first real girlfriend (1 year relationship), who shares pornography of herself with strangers online and met up with at least one “sugar daddy”—a 36 year old man (we were both 18). She lied to me and manipulated me for months and weeks, and my sexuality has since been very confused.

I grew attached to drugs through high school. Big surprise, since I never saw my mother all day. She would go to work and not come back until I was asleep-left money on the counter for me to walk to the store and get food. My relationship with drugs hasn’t been healthy, but I’ve finally quit weed this summer (I hope I don’t relapse come the fall semester). 

Drugs have precipitated many problems in my life. There was an incident where I was accused of sexual assault. I must say that this is a very complicated situation and I wasn’t actually accused by the alleged victim, whom I have spoken to and sorted things out with—so far as I knew we were good and had even alluded to continuing a casual, episodic relationship, but I was rather accused by her friends. Unfortunately I was on drugs at the time, and upon hearing this Iapsed into such strong self-hatred and suicidality that I was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for a week. There I was put on medication for depression and also for OCD-a condition I had been struggling with in a rather quirky manifestation for years. My OCD was related to my hope for a life in academic mathematics and physics, but this forced hospital admission caused me to fail classes I was in and my future is now very much in question. I wanted to leave college. 

I want to stress that me and the girl mentioned above had spoken and were fine. Nonetheless rumors about me spread, and my life took a dark spiral. I haven’t spoken to her since, however, because of threats from her friends.

Because of a lack that of hope, I turned to drugs: now, naively, psychedelics for healing. Unfortunately I was very reckless with drugs and got myself into trouble again. I lost control of myself and did some bad stuff. I realized now that I had a serious problem in my life.

I have started meditating and practicing Stoicism. These have helped me somewhat, but I am still consumed with hatred, self-hatred, feeling unwanted and desperate for love, and deeply sad. I recently broke both of my wrists, which were hugely important to my fitness regiment of calisthenics for doing handstands, which was my only true method of stress relief. Now I am stuck with my mother, broken, hating myself and the world. I’ve made some tangible progress, but I need advice.


Is my family worth any further attempts at reconciliation? How can I forgive myself? I’ve always felt like I was a good person, but now I feel wretched.

515,"my boyfriend seems to be lying to me about little things and when I catch him out he tells me the truth. This has been happening for a while and the past 4 weeks we have argued about it as he keeps lying. It's only small things like why he deleted a chat and although small and silly, he has lost nearly all of my trust. Now I don't believe anything he says and am questioning if he's telling me the truth. For example, who he's texting, what he's doing etc. He says it's down to my reactions but sometimes the lies are so stupid I can't understand why he thinks I would be mad? Is there any chance a pathological liar can change?",14Jul2019,8
516,"I'm in my late 20s and I've been struggling to make ends meet for a long time. Minimum wage jobs that never gave me any kind of fulfillment other than a paycheck, my parents convinced me to buy a brand new car (always a bad idea) and with where I'm living I'm very stuck. It's too expensive for me to move out of my parents house and I feel like it's really time to move on and get out of here. There's a lot of negativity and toxicity within the household, I just want to add that to kind of paint a picture of why I'm so torn.  


I received a ring from my step grandfather. It's my late step grandmothers and it's worth.. a lot. We're talking around \~$20,000. I never wear the ring as it's too expensive for my taste and not really my style. I just don't feel safe wearing it. I'd like advice on what to do. Should I sell the ring? It has sentimental value but not as much as you'd think. I was never very close with them, just the only female on the side of the family to receive jewelry (other than my mother) It would pay off my debt (8k left on my car) and it would leave me with a nice chunk of cash to move out and get my life going. I've been planning to move to the states for a while now.  


I'm torn because I know morally I should keep the ring - it's a family heirloom and has meaning to some of my family. But I also know that I really need money and it would help jump start my life after being stuck here for so long.   


I'd love your opinions and thoughts.",14Jul2019,2
517,"I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know how to treat someone who has treated me like shit over and over again. 
Okay so last semester I had a giant crush on this guy that hates me. He would ignore me and told me to never talk to him again after I asked why he was mad. Its fine. But the part that is messed up is we had every class together and he'd purposely walk way behind me and sit directly 2 or 3 rows behind me at all times. I got the feeling he was watching me constantly. He also purposely matches with me on bumble but still won't talk to me. Its frustrating I'm a very sensitive person so I've taken everything personally also I'm weak so I keep falling for this shit and every time he does something like act creepy or like a jerk it brings up a ton of unwanted emotions. Part of me is tempted to treat him the way he treated me last semester in a less creepy way, I have no idea how to do that. I need to move on I need to be happy I'm sick of letting this person effect my emotions.

519,"(J=my ex, M-my ex's oldest brother, B-ex's older brother) 

Long story short, I met a girl ( J )on Facebook and we got into a relationship, moved hella fast and one thing led to another which led to me moving to her state. So during the 2 years we've been together, we've had our ups and downs and that's what led us to a recent break up. Not that the other cheated, it just became toxic and we just drifted apart eventually as some couples do. It happens. Me and her brother ( M ) have a good friendship, and I mean a great friendship especially since I know nobody here. We kinda got close after he started smoking. After being out here for a few months, i finally found a regular plug and kinda joked at smoking with M one day and asked if he wanted to smoke and he shocked me when he said yea. (I'm black and they're white Republicans) So the next time we chilling at their parents house, we blaze up outside in the garage. I actually smoked her other brother ( B ) out a time before that 😂. So he gets really high, and he's feeling good and he's comfortable enough to try it again. This time he gets mad, mad high and me and B decided to leave his ass out there while he tripped. This dude was at the side of the house hiding from his dad because he didn't want him to know he was high. Hell his dad didn't even know lol. 

So around September/October time, M's wife takes the kids and herself out to the beach for about a week and M had to work overtime and be on standby as usual. Me and J were in school so we couldn't go with the kids, but you bet your ass we stopped by M to smoke and drink a little lol. M's wife didn't like him smoking and didn't pause to let him know either. So they come back and the wife and J are drinking and the wife doesn't mind me smoking as long as I'm careful with it. And as long as Miller doesn't smoke. So I roll up and I'm smoking, I'm smoking and I hand it to M. He takes it with zero hesitation and puffs that shit and I cracked the hell up like ""oh you getting it boy"". So you know how women are, can't let us men have too much fun without them so they start looking for us(just kidding) . You know alcohol and cigarettes go together so they come outside to smoke with us. So I'm smoking my blunt and she opens the door to their garage and I'm putting it out. Then we light a cigarette and we're all sitting out there talking. Everyone knew we both smoked but he still tried to act normal and M's wife's eyes were drilled into him. Then his dumbass just bust out laughing 😂. She let us know he smoked and he better not do it again he just kept on laughing. He laughed so much that she couldn't even do anything other than to laugh with him. As much as she didn't like weed, she sure did like the effects that night.

So fast forward to November when he's diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer on his mom's 62nd birthday. The entire family is kinda silent and emotional about it for a few weeks really. I mean I met the cousins, auntie's, great aunts and uncles. Im like really, really apart of the family even though I was always the ONLY black guy at the reunion or the Sunday dinner lol. But when we first found out, for 2 weeks, me and J spent the night at M's house. He was our priority and pretty much still is. So from his first treatment of chemo in mid-December til now, me and M have smoked a lot, we've hung out probably almost as many times as we haven't, we talked a lot of shit together, and ive seen him experience a lot of pain. He'll try to hide it but he can't hide it now. The dilemma here is that im not gonna be here much longer since me and his sister arent together anymore. I plan on leaving at the end of July since it's the end of the semester. He was 330 in Nov and he's 210 now, so it's not looking too good at all. J kinda thinks I should stay for a few more months until it finishes him but I don't want to be here any longer. I'm torn between seeing a really good friend before the inevitable and  actually living my life. I don't wanna be here any longer but I don't want leave him behind.",14Jul2019,1

Repost for background text

So I always, like a kid, admired kid messages and one I like is “Be yourself.”

I don’t get why being blunt and honest I need to change. I don’t get how I am aggressive, defensive and unpleasant. Someone said I attacked others and I never realized until they said what they meant by that. I call out mistakes, get angry over people using pronouns and not being specific, etc.  I try to get along and it always ends with the person calling out my mistakes emotionally (my emotional ones, not them being emotional although they probably are).

I hate the outdoors and am probably allergic to the seasons except winter. I hate standing still for three minutes or more because of pain. I hate anything active and then people claim I am just inflexible. I am but I want fun too without pain, not my fucking problem. My parents say to stop complaining and just move on because it is incurable, but I can’t help it. My hypersensitivity issues with my hearing, food texture, smell and fabrics also makes me bitch and moan constantly because even toilet flushing hurts my ears and makes me tremble.

People I swear to god suck ass at following my rules. I don’t mention my rules at first because they seem uninviting apparently, but as soon as someone breaks it I will call them out. My rules are broad but general ones are not being specific or being indirect and pissing me off so fucking much. Like what the fuck, how would I know what you’re talking about if you aren’t saying what you mean. Like Jesus Christ use logic and shit.

I use a point system to determine if I like someone. If they smile, help me, thank me, obey the rules, etc I will add a point. If they argue, frown, glare, break any rules like talking while the teacher is, I will subtract a point. I notice most are on the negative spectrum.

My cat passed away recently and I cried over it and can’t imagine what would happen if my dog died. I had 17 surgeries (you may recognize my main account, just organizing my account for normal and sad self) and have two conditions. My dog makes my life not hell and I get homesick whenever he is away from me such as school or going to an event. He comforts me both emotionally and physically (sensory meltdowns). I would never commit suicide but feel like if he died I would question why I am alive miserable.

Not sure if my background matters but I was abandoned as a newborn and had several deformities (someone nice I met said to use a new word, so help me out with that maybe). Partial hearing loss due to hole in eardrum, moderate scoliosis, Klippel Feil (fused neck bones), MRKH (missing uterus and vagina), ectopic kidney, extreme underbite (fixed but was bullied for it), cleft palate (fixed), extra finger (gone), and honestly, not to sound pitying, I probably forgot something on the list. But that should be it.

I was a socially oblivious kid (still am sometimes) and have been bullied several times without realizing it. I just do when I would casually tell my mom someone told me to commit suicide and she would storm into the school (exaggerating, just calls them). She made two girls apologize in a letter but they crossed out “sorry” and I found it odd then showed my mom and she got angry again. After my jaw surgery I never got asked why I was weird looking, an ogre, etc

I am usually happy and such but just realizing how many flaws I have and realizing no one likes me IRL makes me feel upset or something negative. I know people like me but it just feels like they don’t because of how many arguments I get into compared to good conversations which leads to negative points on my system.

Socializing is not exhausting but it is if I try my best to not be myself (more agreeable, friendly outwardly, etc). Imagine a math formula. You cannot solve an equation that is scrambled and needs to be reformatted to match the formula to substitute and solve it. Like maybe you need to factor the equation before you use the formula but you never even knew that was the formula you used then. Say I have a solid idea you like chocolate ice cream and then way way later into the conversation you say you dislike it. That immediately destroys my memory (I rely on memorization and premade responses) and then I will call you out. Obviously ice cream flavor is a bit more petty to be angry over. But one scenario that happened was a guy said how I was and then “I guess I’ll have to find someone else to pass time.” It was less than ten minutes and I started the message with “You’re a bit clingy.” I called out his bullshit but my online friend said starting with attacking (I see attacking as insulting him, I was not insulting) would not help me. I asked if he was really 18+ and he said he was married and had two kids and I said I highly doubted that because, well, I don’t think he acts like a married man in his 30s. He called me unpleasant and blocked me. That shit pisses me off and I now know it’s my fault but I can’t help calling someone’s bullshit out. If someone says something completely out of reasoning or predictability I have no clue what to do and will have a mini tantrum over the shit they are doing.",14Jul2019,0

I can’t focus on anything and I don’t even know what I want for myself so I don’t have anything to work towards. There are some terrible things I have done when I didn’t even know I was doing them, I am very heavily suspected to having bipolar disorder as well as BPD along with a few other things. Sometimes I’ll have an episode and completely black out and in this time I become very very aggressive, I’m drowning with guilt after badly assaulting my girlfriend who I hold so close to my heart.

The worst part is I don’t even remember it or didn’t realise it was happening until I snapped out of it, realising I’m sat on top of her with my hands on her throat. Her red tear filled face looking at me with the most terrified eyes haunts me like nothing else, I will never forget the most awful noise of her choking by my hands. I still can’t believe it, it’s been over a week and it’s all I can think about, she knows it wasn’t “me” doing it. I would never ever want to harm her after all she’s been through, I was supposed to be the one to protect her but she’s gone now, I just didn’t mean to do it and I cannot make it better.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have upset me in a lot of ways, and I'm pretty sure what they've been doing in general to me is abuse, and I've even given up on change before going back into a loop of ""maybe it's my fault"". I'm not even sure if right now I'm doing the same. For a long time-- since last year-- I've had back pain that almost made me throw up, has me scream in pain, and then over time it goes away. However, every time something worse happens during the affliction-- I got weak in the knees, Advil wouldn't work, etc. and each time my parents wouldn't treat it as a big deal. I went to PT and felt a bit better, but things got worse from there even with the exercises. Last night I got really upset-- my back 'cracked' again while I was out, and suddenly it was hard to think or talk for the first time. After going home, it was painful, but this time my right hand became painful halfway and the other half was completely numb. I asked them, then forcefully tried to get them to call a doctor, and they treated it like I was overreacting and said they'll call the physical therapist. I suddenly felt more nauseous than usual and went upstairs to get water. Then my fingers and toes started tingling. Then I started to sense I was losing control of my body, so I went back downstairs at the risk of my own to tell them the best that I could that I felt paralyzed. I couldn't communicate, so I grabbed my dad's hand to let him feel it shaking, sweating, feeling hot and cold-- trying to list the symptoms and telling them to call 911. Instead, my parents didn't listen. I lay flat on my side, officially paralyzed, and couldn't lift my body or even move. My parents criticized me during these interactions, saying I was being 'emotional'. With what I thought was the worst bedside manner, my dad left when I begged him to stay. Then my mom left, and I was able to calm myself down for 4 minutes before my dad returned saying he talked to Urgent Care and that I should wait it out. At that point is where I start to doubt myself-- he said he told Urgent Care the symptoms, and they're professionals. Right now I've partially recovered, and my parents are saying that they're right because it's true. I am 'recovering'. But it's still kind of hard to talk and I feel numb in some places. They're also saying that they're going to tell the doctor of my current symptoms, not my previous ones, and I feel like that's overlooking what happened last night and the one year span of horrible, increasing issues.

&amp;#x200B;

However, once again, they're right. I did have to wait it out. But everything from criticizing my posture when it's hard to speak to my dad prioritizing ordering Mcdonalds for my brother and leaving to get it over looking for doctors (my brother has a car by the way) felt horrible.

531,"Hello all, I’m on mobile so my apologies for formatting.

It’s a long story that I’ve been trying to put into words for a long time now, so I guess I’ll start at the beginning. 

My biological father, Scott, had me when he was 17, and being so young, he and my mother put me up for adoption. This spawned feelings of abandonment for me in preteen-teen years. I felt so distrusting of even my adoptive parents because I though maybe they’d put me up for adoption too if I became too unruly, unappreciative, etc. 

When I was 12, Scott reached out to my adoptive parents and we met at Polly’s Pies in Southern California. It was fantastic, I finally knew where I had come from, why I look they way I do, where I learned the small mannerisms that I preformed that weren’t taught/viewed from my adoptive parents. I was ecstatic and that feeling of happiness and joy lasted a good 5 years. Then he got married, started having more kids, and was just generally too busy from me. What were once a week visits, turned into 1 per month, then to into once every 2-3 months. 

Around when I turned 17 I was becoming more politically involved and I was very passionate, being a bisexual, person of color. My views were more left leaning than the rest of my family, because of those reasons. Scott knows I have been sexually assaulted and for some reason thought I would love to debate with him about the controversies surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, a man who was accused of sexual assault before he took a place as a judge for one of the American court systems. I wasn’t enjoying the conversation and he knew full well it was making my uncomfortable but I, of course being 17, couldn’t stop myself from becoming visibly upset and angry. He chided me for not being able to just have a conversation without getting upset, reduced me to crybaby, and essentially made me cry @ the happiest place on earth ( In n’ Out). 

Repeat this story 10x’s, just with different snide remarks. I’ve told him multiple times in the past we don’t agree on things politically or religiously so he needs to stop pushing his views onto me. I’ve had to, and still have to remind him not to send me political cartoons, news, etc via text. I’ve set clear boundaries but for some reason he just will not respect them. 

A while back there was a new abortion law passed in NY and he texted me and asked how I felt about it. I should’ve known not respond, but instead I gave my two cents since he asked. His response? “Well you know your brother was a premie, you’re okay with the doctors killing babies like him? You’re a baby killer and I’m disgusted with you.” 
Dear God how I wish I was lying or exaggerating but he has a knack for taking my words and twisting them straight back into my face (or even worse he’ll take my words out of context and tell them to my grandparents so he can control the narrative of their mentally unstable grand daughter. 

I’m tired of him being mean to me, I’m tired of him calling me mean names. I’m tired of him not treating me like I’m his child when he’s the one who wanted a daughter-father relationship. I’m so angry with myself that I wasted parts of my childhood crying over him wondering why he didn’t want me.

I don’t know how to tell him I don’t want a relationship anymore, but I’m also scared he may just say “Okay” and move on. That would probably hurt the worst, because it would finally confirm to me that he wanted to meet me just to know who I was, not to know and love me like his own. Whatever the outcome, I know it needs to happen. I can’t live my life waiting for Scott to become a better father figure, so does any one have some advice about how I should go about this?",14Jul2019,4
532,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and he has always been honest with me. After a few months of dating he revealed to me that he has been to jail. The charges are complicated and I believe him when he says that he made a mistake, but is not 100% guilty. He went to jail for a year, and was evaluated as at a extreme low risk of offending again. That was ten years ago. 

About three weeks ago, I was sent two messages from two different friends of mine, telling me there was a post on a local ‘safe n sound’ group on Facebook. The post says that at 16, he was in a relationship with this 14 years old, he made her feel that she was an object and should have sex with him whenever he pleased. She said she felt manipulated by him, and by the end of her relationship with him, she was so manipulated, that she was convinced -not by him- to join a rape ring. At the end of her post, to I guess solidify her argument that he is a bad person, casually mentions that he has been to jail. She then posts a picture of him, and the area that he lives in. 

I talked to one of the friends that messaged me with the information, I explained the situation. I said that I believed that he was sexually manipulative at 16, honestly, what boy isn’t? I’m not saying it’s right, but I’m saying he is not responsible for what happened to this girl after he broke off their one month relationship. I explained to her that I know about the charges, and that he is no longer a threat to anyone, and that should be understood. I asked her to invite me to the group so I could see any comments that were made, and see what an impact it might have made in the local community. After three weeks, she finally decided to send me an invite. 

This is what I found when I looked at the full post. At lest five friends of mine had seen and commented on the post, saying things like, ‘I know him, it makes me sick to think she probably knows and doesn’t care’. Seeing friends of mine talking about me thinking I will never see what they said made me sick. And the even worse things they said about my boyfriend. I never let him see, I couldn’t, I know he’s not that person anymore. 

I should say, at this point he is going though this situation with me, he was not contacted about the post, he made a new Facebook account a few years ago, and doesn’t have many friends on it, he also has really good privacy settings, so no one can find him, for this reason. I told him about someone sending me this post, and let him take a look at the screen shots I received. He told his boss at work, to be honest with him, and his boss told him that someone reached out to him when he posted a picture including my boyfriend. It turns out, when I saw the full post, that someone commented his workplace. His boss understands that these are things that happened in the past, and the person he knows and trusts is still there. We are working on a way to talk to the rest of the staff about the situation, we don’t want anyone to see the post and assume that he is dangerous before we are able to talk to them. 

This is where we are now, I have made the stupid decision to comment on the post and say that I am aware of the situation and that I am disappointed that his current information, and my information has been shared publicly. I wasn’t angry in my comment, I wasn’t looking for an argument. I just wanted them to know that assuming a person can’t change and grow over the course of a year long prison sentence and ten years is close minded. And witch hunting like that is very Black Mirror. As soon as I started conversing with other angry commenters, I was kicked out of the group, and blocked. 

I have tried messaging admins with no response, I decided to message some of my friends who I saw commented on the post. I just wanted them to know that he is not dangerous, I am not brainwashed, and that because this post is reaching his at work, this is impacting mine and his future. I wanted them to know that his success is my success, and sharing information that make it seem that he is still a treat is hurting us in so many ways. I value their friendships and I don’t want them to think I’m supporting someone who I know is a bad person, because I’m not. 

I’m sorry for the wall of text, I’m just feeling so alone. I know I have my boyfriend, but I feel like everyone else is just turning their backs on us. I have been dealing with the stress of overworking as well, it’s hard not to feel so isolated when you constantly have to pretend to be happy. I really just don’t know what to do, I thought maybe sharing our story, someone could maybe tell me they have gone though something similar. Thank you so much if you have gotten this far, I will post updates if there is interest.",14Jul2019,4
533,"Hi!!! I’m 20 and my bf is 22. We were out with his best friend and everything was going well. Soon however, we got on the topic of sex. My bf then told his best friend (in front of me) that me giving him oral does nothing for him. His best friend kinda looked at me and gave an awkward pained face. Personally, I’m upset because I feel as though that’s something private that should be discussed. Prior to this, I’ve never heard any complaints or tips about anything I could do to make the experience better. He acted like he enjoyed it and would always want it so it caught me off guard and hurt my feelings a bit. I’m open to criticism and finding out what I can do to make it more enjoyable but I won’t know something is wrong unless I’m told. I understand guys talk about these things, but did it really have to be in front of me??? And couldn’t he have talked to me about it in private first?? Or am I just overreacting like he said? 


Thanks in advance!",14Jul2019,2
534,"My roommate and I are going our separate ways and things have been incredibly rocky. She's moved out over a month prior to us knowing we needed to leave the premises, which is fine her life is her own. But within this time she has completely neglected her cat the past few months and left him completely in my care. I don't find this an issue as I love this cat completely as my own. She's leaving the country for a month, which during this month is when we need to be officially out of the house. My question for advice comes to, if she leaves the country and leaves the cat, should I just take him? She's proven that she doesn't care much, despite what she's said, and that she can't take care of this animal. Rightfully I know I should ask her, but my fear is she will say she wants to keep him, which makes me fear for this cats life as there were times I found them without water, she didn't clean her cat box for over a month and everything had mold on it, etc.",14Jul2019,2
535,"She’s a very nice person and I remember last year when I was going through a tough time I shared everything with her (only her) and she was there for me because I trusted her and up until recently I shared a few more things (all of it was about my past/current relationships) not my family or personal stuff. Anyway, for the past few months she’s been going through some tough stuff. What blows my mind is that she shares it with everyone at work, and I’ve noticed since then everyone treats her like a child or tries to give her some “perks” (people are very nice of course). My boss has never bought any of us gifts for our bdays since we’ve known him for the past 2 years but he got her a gift this year. He treats her so nice but he’s always joking around with me. All my coworkers always seem to kiss up to her. She also has been acting like a “child” “oh I have to go pee pee guys I’ll be back” (she’s 30) or laughs so obnoxiously loud so we can all hear her. The worst of it all is that she shares literally with everyone at work but when someone shares her business with me (we’re not that close anymore) she gets mad as to why everyone talks about her “behind her back”. Idk I feel bad she’s a great girl but I wonder why she’s changed so much over the past year. Maybe I’m jealous? Maybe I’m mad we’re not that close? Rant over.",14Jul2019,1

537,"I work for an auditing company and I believe my boss wants me to quit my job. 

I apologize now if this post seems all over the place. i’m using this platform to gather all my thoughts to see what I should do to proceed from here. 

I have worked here for going on 2 years and the entire time said boss has always been my main boss. We have however gotten an almost entire staff since then even down to the manager who works under her. Early on (first 6 months) I was recognized for being a “good worker” accurate, efficient, compliant... and i was asked to become a team leader. I took the class with a few other people and I was excited. some things happen and I had to get ahold of HR and someone lost their job. I won’t get into the ins and outs of this. My manager has treated me some type of way ever since. 

Any further TL training was at standstill. I was confused. So XYZ lost their job due to some very sloppy and poor decisions and knocked up a coworker and was sending pictures about it to other workers... messy situation. Also at the time our Manager just quit and now we are running on a wire .... i’m going to skip the next year but we went almost three months without a manager only the main problem manager. 

an entire year in a few bullet examples: 

-I was aloud to supervise small stores mostly stores where I work alone or manage very small crews for smalls jobs. 
-I was verbally attacked about 5 months ago and a worker quit someone who has been here for 10 years or so and made my manager hate me even more. btw. 
-I overslept and my manager was going off on me!!!! mind you I am a parent of four children all under 5. 
-I was feeling very ill one day all of a sudden. Not ill enough to go to the dr because of the expense but i’ll enough to take the day off work and she REQUIRED a dr note or I was termed 
-Someone who was in training with me is supervising several events and IMO I do it far better and much more productive and when aloud to prove that I do. 
-I am having issues with drama at work because I just want to come to work and be the best I can be at work and no matter where i turn something is just so bad i’ll get attitude from everyone. I really love my job and I don’t want to leave. but I’m nervous to say anything to hr at this point because of her reaction and all my coworkers. 

Also i have about 27 hours of voice clips all interactions that i have had negative interactions with coworkers and my managers all giving attitude and attacking either myself or other workers because everyone is bad. angry people. 

My manager just wants to skate by and care for the store. drags her only manager threw the mud and treats all her workers like crap and i can’t believe no one has reported them before this. 
- my boss throws tantrums and talks about inappropriate topics and is just all about bad energy

I know that most of this is probably incomplete thoughts and I apologize. will edit once i have some more time. also I know i’m missing a ton of stuff and details but this is the gist. what should i do. i would start a new job but i want the work history for a mortgage that i’m working towards 

I worried that if I contact hr again that it may work out like this - boss is fired i then become the most hated coworker and will receive never ending back lash. 
hr may eventually get tired of me and make me pay i. some type of way. 
or my boss is not fired and she then makes my life worse. 

again, this post is all over the place please give feedback while i can reflect and will be sure to update the post with more information.",14Jul2019,0
538,"This was originally posted in r/AITA, but I feel like it could fit in here as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 15-year-old British female, neighbour to a lovely couple who often have their six-year-old granddaughter to stay with them. She is a sweet kid I guess, but I don't do babies or kids.

Now, I am an avid My Little Pony and Littlest Pet Shop collector. I style their hair properly, arrange them neatly on a shelf, even make videos with them for my YouTube. I have put a LOT of time and money into my collection. (some go for £60-£120 each.($80-$140)) And unfortunately my little neighbour just LOVES them.

She always invites herself over to my house. Her grandparents never ask if she can come over, they just send her over. I am NOT a babysitter. I have never babysat in my life and plan on keeping it that way. One time she appeared at nine p.m, way past when a six-year-old should be asleep by.

She always charges up to my room and makes a beeline for my ponies, picking them up by their hair (ruining it), throwing them and even decapitating them. (fixable, don't worry)

And, yes, I know they are toys. But they are MY toys, and don't treat them like that, however selfish that may sound. Imagine someone storming up to your house and dismantling your LEGO Death Star and using the pieces to create something new. Irritating at the least.

I've also noticed that she is quite rude, asking when 'she can have the ponies', asking to use my laptop and picking up my £180 video camera! (about $200) I am just about DONE with her. I have to BRIBE her to go home, usually with a pony that I have multiples of and is in bad-ish condition. I cab't refuse to see her as i don't want to create tension with the neighbours, but I just CAN'T anymore. Dealing with her has set my anxiety on the blink. I DON'T DO kids. Full stop. (Period)

However, am I in the wrong? Am I so bad for not letting a little girl play with my toys? I think the thing that annoys me the most though, is that I, nor my family ever agreed to this. She just *appeared* one day and continued to frequently. She appeared yesterday the minute we returned form our holiday in England and was resistant to be sent away despite the fact that I needed to unpack my belongings. It's got to the point that I can't walk past her house without her popping out and asking when 'she can next play with the ponies?' whilst trying to mess with my phone.

Am I so evil to prevent a little girl form playing with my things? Please post your opinion in the comments below. I am expecting another 'surprise playtime' this week so I am currently hiding in the shed.",14Jul2019,1
539,"So I've got this friend, she's my late bandmate's little sister. Her life has been on a downhill spiral for the past couple of years. She lost custody of her daughter after she fled the state with her abusive felon ex-husband and it led to them being homeless on the streets of a big city. She came back to our state because she was homesick and had a new boyfriend (who was less abusive but still pretty abusive, and also a minor although legally of-age to consent). After I told her that she and her daughter could stay with me, but not the boyfriend, she left and that's when she lost custody of her daughter. Around this time I was starting to have some health problems and couldn't handle the stress of having an unhappy man-child living on my couch.

&amp;#x200B;

So shortly after that, her brother (and my bandmate) died, which was devastating for all of us especially her. She found a new boyfriend who was, again, not \*as\* abusive as her ex-husband but still objectively abusive and seemingly incapable/not interested in receiving help. About two months ago, she discovered her boyfriend's body where she had been living; he shot himself in the head.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex-husband and current boyfriend and I have tried in numerous ways to help her. We've given her shelter and facilitated weekend and overnight visits with her daughter. We've financially supported her. We've been her friend even in the face of her inevitably going no-contact with us as soon as she gets an abusive boyfriend to take care of. (It's weird, she's \*totally\* capable of getting a job and her shit together as long as she's got a man, but it's seemingly too much when she's just living normally as a housemate with friends.)

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past month or so the camel's back has been broken for me. I've had some medical procedures for these chronic health issues I've had. I have been unable to work. Yet she has \*still\* been asking me for things. I have politely explained to her on more than one occasion that I don't want to be bothered to help others right now because I'm in a position where I need help myself. Usually she just responds by like half-heartedly apologizing for being a piece of shit, or blithely promising to help me out when she gets her own shit together (which never happens, because she only ever gets her shit together in order to appease men).

&amp;#x200B;

I found out recently that she's been talking with a friend of ours about having him take her on a vacation with her daughter. A lot of folks feel obligated to help her in order to make things okay for her daughter, who has been in the middle of all this and suffered tremendously thanks to both her parents. I explained everything to him that I've explained to y'all, and he decided that, if they were to take this vacation, he was going to use the opportunity to help her unpack the deep-rooted psychological issues she has that cause her to make the choices she does. When he explained this to her, she flat-out said she wasn't interested in working on herself right now and that she wished he hadn't gotten her hopes up.

&amp;#x200B;

He also mentioned to her that a lot of us were really mad at her. She responded that she wished we could talk with her about it and that she didn't understand why we were mad at her. It's to the point where I just don't really want to fuck with this person anymore. I've tried to explain to her when I've felt used. A lot of the times, when she's called on her mooching, she just whines about how much of a piece of shit she is and then does nothing to change her circumstances. Do I owe her this explanation, even something brief like ""I don't want to be friends with someone who hits up their \*physically disabled\* friends for financial support""?",14Jul2019,1

542,"Some context is needed, but I promise not to make it very long. 

I’m 19 and I don’t live at my family home full time, during term I live about 2 hours away in a different city. I come back home to work in the summer because I’m lucky to have snagged a well-paying summer job that I’ve had for a couple of years. So moving out isn’t a viable solution to this. Essentially, I’m at a loss of what to do or why she’s blown things this far out of proportion. I’ve apologized because I know I was in the wrong, I’ve done what she had asked me to do in the first place and more at this stage, I’ve begged, I’ve pleaded and I’ve burst into tears, mainly at the frustration of trying to speak and apologize to someone who won’t even acknowledge I’m in the room at all. On top of this, she’s taken my television, and other items from my room and  turned off the WiFi router. I’m positive the only reason she hasn’t taken my phone as well is because she thinks I haven’t paid my bill to have 3G on it. I could live with her taking most of the stuff she took, but I need the WiFi to study for an upcoming resit exam that’s scheduled early next month. I missed the first because I was too ill to attend that day. All the materials for this specific exam are on the online Uni library and she’s fully aware of this. 

I get severe exam anxiety so following a study plan is important for me, but because of this “punishment” I’m already three days behind. I’ve offered to let her keep my other items and watch me study if she has to, if she wants assurance that I am revising and not doing anything else so she can continue to punish me. Silence.  You’d assume I snuck out or did something I really wasn’t supposed to, but this is all over me not putting my washing away for a week because I was coming home late from work every day. I may not be a parent, and maybe I’m wrong, but this feels like complete overkill for what actually happened. I’ve no local library near, not enough data to study with my phone or risk being caught and I have no idea when she’ll let me use internet, never mind actually speak to me again and I’m starting to get very stressed over it. I’m well used to her silent treatment, but because of the exam it feels worse this time. 

I know it’s a pretty minor problem, but any advice on what to do about this?",14Jul2019,2

I was kicked at 18 because after being forced to come out, since my parents didnt agree with my life style. For the past 2 years I've been living with my sister and some of her roommates, which is okay. Ive been working at a call center for minumum wage, and here is where I'm stuck. All through out highschool I would always say ""I am never going to work a dumb desk job"", yet here I am 40 hours a week dumb desk job. It pays well whatever, but I hate my life. All I do is go to work come home smoke weed and watch youtube videos, thats about it, and I dont really know what else to do. I want to go to school, but I dont know what for, and if i did decide to go to school at some point, I have no idea how to appily for scholarships or schools, I dont have that much money saved up, and 2 years out of highschool I still dont know what I would even go to school for, thats why I havent gone yet, I dont want to go and spend money on something I decide I hate. 

I never expected to make it to where I am right now. If im honest I didnt even think I was going to graduate highschool I believed I would have killed myself by then. Ive outlived my expiration date and now I have my whole life ahead of me with no idea what to do and no idea how to get started. 

I always intended to go to school but I was going to try and figure out what for first. Its always been hard because my parents didnt encourage genuine interest, I would be given something and told, you like this now, me being a kid went along with liking whatever people told me to like, so now, I have no idea what I like. Im interested in art, digital art, game design etc. Which would be awesome to go to school for, but I always hear about how these jobs are really had to get, that its not worth going to school for, or no one will hire a graduate. But art and games are really the only things that interest me, and other than that I don't really know what else to do? I don't want to live a boring life I want to do stuff! My dream is to get a VW bus and make it liveable and just drive around the world, maybe make money doing odd jobs. I know im not going to be able to do this for a while, all of that would cost alot of start up money. 

I dont know, I'm just stuck. I have been in the same place for 2 years, I really want to do something with my life, but I have no idea how to begin.

She expects me to get into medical college after high school but also wants me to do ACCA and completely rules out what I actually want to do (photography). I don't have any solution except moving out after I get my ID card at 18, but she's completely opposed to the idea and says stuff like, 'that's because you never thought of me as your real mom' and 'parents hold their head high because of their children, I'll never face anyone and keep my head down because of shame'. 

It's not like I don't love her, it's just that I'm not in the mental state to bear all of her demands and do as she likes.

546,"Throwaway because the friend in question knows my Reddit.   So, I have a friend, let’s call him Matt. Matt and I tend to speak on the phone (Discord Video Chat) frequently , just because he’s a good person to talk to and etc.   There weren’t really any issues until January or so. That’s when Matt began dating a girl I’ll call Sarah. (I actually pushed him to ask her out bc they really liked each other).  So Matt and Sarah speak on the phone (Discord Video call as well) all day.  (Like from the second Matt wakes up around 9/10am until 11pm-1am depending)(for context, they’re long distance)

I’m still in high school, so I shouldn’t be staying up that late if I finally get a chance to say hi at midnight.I like to call my friend to update him on my day, and to just have someone to talk to lol.

Recently, they’ve been staying on the phone until 1 am or even closer to 2am. Which is fine, it’s summer, I can stay up later now.

But, whenever I text Matt, or Snapchat or whatever during the day, he’ll completely ignore it, and when/if I eventually get to call he’ll respond to everything. This is fine, but if I ever needed him for something during the day (advice or whatever) I’m
not sure if he’d respond until hours later. Occasionally he responds, but I can tell that it’s a quick response (it almost doesn’t even feel like him if that makes sense)

To note, Sarah is fine with Matt and I’d friendship, and I’m not asking him to only talk to me( they can talk as much as they want) I just feel like our friendship is suffering. I also think that he needs to spend less time on the phone so he can do other things. He frequently mentions that he can never sit down and watch things he wants (that Sarah wouldn’t be interested in) or talk to others, etc bc he’s always on the phone. 

School is starting up again, so obviously i need to focus on that, but weekends are the only time i can stay up late to talk. But I’m going to get a job, so I might be unavailable. Plus, I wanna have a life outside of school and work lol.

Sorry if this makes no sense, and sorry for formatting as I’m on mobile.

Also, I’m worried what his response would be if I brought it up. I’ve mentioned him cutting back his time on the phone, but he said “but I want to talk to her”

I'm not ugly, I'm not clingy or financially unstable so I'm guessing that is the reason these dates havent really went anywhere. I think I'm quite funny and although I can be shy I always make sure theres no awkward silences.

552,"

I have a cousin who i hang out with from time to time.. but my intuition tells me she’s a hater. We really started hanging out together more often last year and at one point I would hang out with her every single weekend. I started to notice she was one of those people who always has something to say to counteract what I have to say. For instance, I could tell her that the sky was blue and she would argue me down about how the sky is actually purple LOL. A total contrarian. She’s also one of those girls who’s ALWAYS talking to a different guy and I’m kind of the opposite, so she would always make slick comments about how I need to start talking to guys. She even told my best friend when she was hanging out with us that I need to go out and start dating so i can “actually live my best life.” Mind you, I’m fine with not dating multiple men at a time, I don’t feel like I’m missing out on much. And the guys she talks to are absolute trash. She really think she be putting me on game but I literally have no interest in taking any advice from her whatsoever. I came over her house one day when I was dressed up and I had my makeup done, and she looked at me and said “....I like you better without that foundation on your face”, even though I know my make up looked 100% fine. One of her best guy friends had a crush on me and she was well aware of this and every time he would come over, he would always flirt with me. One day while we were talking, she asked where my other best friend was and mentioned to the guy “yeah you should see her friend, you would really like her”... Knowing that he liked me. I think that was so shady of her to say, but I brushed it off. After that, I noticed she would always make little sneaky underhanded comments about me and what she thought I needed to be doing with my life. It annoyed me so bad because in no way shape or form is she doing much better than me in life. The only thing she has going for herself is that she talks to multiple men and some of them pay her bills. At the beginning of this year, I got so fed up with hanging around her that I ghosted her for several months. We recently just started hanging out again but not much has changed.. she still thinks she’s better than me in a way. She just got a new apartment last week and I expressed how happy I was for her. I visited her the day after she moved in and  I kept telling her how lovely her new place is. She made a comment about how I can call up my friends and told them how her new spot is actually nice.......as if I came over there just to spy lmfao. I really want to kick her to the curb again because I really don’t get much from hanging out with her but I want to know if y’all think I’m overreacting? Does it seem like she’s somewhat of a hater or am I really overthinking it?",14Jul2019,3
553,"thank you guys for all the advice on my last post, all of it has helped me grow and i am focusing more on me rather than the world. anyways i wanted to ask, i am in a dilemma as you know i am preparing for an engineering entrance exam (JEE). But the choice that i am presented with now is that i can either continue preparing for my jee and hope to get a good seat in a decent college or i can go to germany for higher studies and i dont know what to do. i am currently preparing for JEE but i can also focus on improving my german and focus a lot more on strengthening my concepts which will hellp me immensly in my school exams (my school exam marks will decide if i am eligible to apply to germany). please understand that i can only focus on one thing the syllabus for JEE is brutal although its essentially the same as my school syllabus but the paper formats are diffrent so (one is objective and other one is subjective). so if anyone is familiar with the german education please please inform me so i can make an  educated decision.

555,"TL;DR at the bottom. Excuse me if I use any inappropriate language.

A little bit of context. My friend, let's call her A, and I met through an MMO when we were kids. We've been friends since then, but we live far away from each other so we can't meet up to see each other very much. A has autism and she struggles in making friends and maintaining friendships (as such she hardly has any friends - afaik all of her friendships are long-distance internet friendships, like with myself). She has social anxiety and ptsd from past trauma and she has major trust issues.

A dropped out of school because she found learning very difficult and she quit working as well because it was too much for her to deal with. She's been staying at home with her parents for a few years now. She's in a program that helps unemployed people keep busy with creative activities, which she likes. However, she doesn't really have a real connection with any of the others there. She often talks about wanting more friends but she doesn't know how to go about that.

A year or so ago A's partner of several years broke up with her because she felt like she was just taking care of A and that was too much for her. Her partner was A's main form of support and she has been very lonely since. She's constantly talking to me about how she really wants a girlfriend again and misses intimacy, but she finds dating very scary (especially online dating tools like Tinder, which is almost a requirement to meet romantic partners here if you're gay and live in a small town). A was very reliant on her ex-partner and I'm guessing she would be very reliant on any new partners as well, which I can imagine would make potential partners hesitant about wanting to date her. She herself recently mentioned that she can't imagine anyone wanting to date her because she has so many issues. I personally don't think it would be right for her to start dating anyone right now before tackling her biggest issues, but I feel like mentioning that might come off to her as if I'm saying, \*'Hey yeah you\* do \*have too many issues to date!'\* Besides, it's not my place to tell her whether or not to make such life decisions.

Aside from struggling with dating and friendships A also has a lot of mental health issues to deal with. I mentioned that she's currently suffering from ptsd, which she recently got out of therapy for. But there are many other issues that I feel she needs to deal with if she wants to move forward in life. She talks to me a lot about not being able to do anything in life and not having anything to work towards. She feels pretty much 'stuck' and I notice it does make her depressed sometimes. She's just living from day to day, unsure of what to do and how. A few days ago A mentioned that her parents are talking about her moving out, but she doesn't have the money or the means to even start thinking about that. Like I mentioned, she doesn't have a job, and her welfare isn't enough to start saving up for her own place. She's also very reliant on her parents and I'm not sure how well she'd do if she were suddenly on her own.

I've talked to A before about going into therapy, but she always says she's already tried all the available clinics in her area and that none really helped her. I really believe therapy would be good for her so she can start to deal with her social anxiety and trust issues, but she just comes up with excuses (at least that's how it comes off to me). However, if she doesn't deal with her mental health issues I don't think she'll be able to move forward in her life.

Watching A just sit at home and do nothing while her life passes her by sucks. I want to help her but I don't really know what I can do. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my friend has a lot of trouble making friends and she wants to start dating again, but she finds it too hard and scary to do anything about it. She also can't get a job and move out of her parents' house because of mental health problems, but she doesn't want to go into therapy. I want to help her but don't know what I can do.

556,"I just witnessed a shit storm of epic proportions. First, a little context, my sister who’s in college, loves her little schnauzer who she got on her 16th birthday. This dog loves my sister, and whenever he thinks that someone poses a threat to her, he’ll lost his shit. For example, when my sister use to take him for a walk on a trail by our house, he didn’t like it when men got near her. I mean full grown men, he didn’t care about women, teen boys, or old men. He loves my sister, he cuddles with her, kisses her when she comes home, and sleeps in her bed. So when I say that my sister loves my dog, I mean it. 

I need to add one more piece of context, my sister is home for the summer, and is notorious for sleeping in late on Sundays. Today, my mom decided to play a practical joke on her. 

My mom barges into my sleeping sister’s room and says in a panicked voice, “Jay is hurt. Some golden retriever attacked him. We need to take him to the emergency room.” I have never seen my sister wake and get dressed so fast. Throughout this entire process, my sister is asking if it’s the golden retriever down the street because he use to act aggressive whenever she and her dog walked past his house. At this point, my mom just agrees with her. 

When they go downstairs, my mom finally reveals it’s a joke and that my sister’s dog is fine. My sister just looks at our mom and bursts into tears. She’s sobbing because she thought her dog was dying. And my mom’s not helping, she laughs and tells my sister to calm down. This is when shit hits the fan. My sister sister says, “why would you do that? You know, I love that dog more than I love you. Why are you such a bad person?” She leaves.

Now, my mom’s mad that my sister said that. She wants my sister to apologize to her. My sister is angry at her and doesn’t want to talk to her. I’m just here playing  mediator and they’re both trying to get me on their side. 

What should I do? My mom did a messed up thing. My sister said a messed up thing.",14Jul2019,59

Alright guys, your local idiot sandwich here with a quick story:

IM A STRAIGHT NINCOMPOOP FOR STARTERS! coming in to work this morning I went to park, realized my boss wasn’t here and decided to park closer to my entrance for the day, casual cool whatever right? Nope, because when I was flipping around to move I love tapped my coworkers bumper and cracked it (I didn’t realize how far out she was and how tight my turn was i was only going like 7mph) she just bought this car too so I’m literally the  worst, she looked and said she’s gonna have to get an estimate in 2 weeks when she gets home from training, 

my problem is though I’m uninsured and I’m not sure how much this is gonna cost me, I’m stressing bc I’m supposed to be taking a 500$ class to get certified in home care to leave my shitty job, and I’m sure this is gonna cost me a pretty penny too


Has anyone experienced something like this? I’m trying to figure out around how much this is gonna cost out of pocket and what tf do. Should I go get insurance in this 2 weeks and like claim it when she gets home? Should offer to pay her deductible and toss some more cash her way? How do I make up some extra cash to make this right? 

I’m thinking of selling plasma to close the gap but I’m not sure if that’s healthy? 
I can’t Ubereats or door dash bc I’m an uninsured dumbo so that’s out of the question

I am an introvert who needs space and I feel my shot temper is being tested (although I'm not speaking up about it because i feel like i will explode).

563,"So about a month back I bought a used car from a dealership, knowing I can afford it I wasn’t stressing. But in Missouri with buying a car you have to pay for sales tax and state tax on it within 30 days, now that’s putting me in a rough spot. The car was 8988.00 but with the 1000 down I put on it I’m not sure if that affects the sales tax or not. 

Now the real issue comes into play here, I expect I need at least 750 dollars to pay the sales tax and right now I’m at 389 with a pay day coming up on Wednesday. Thursday is the last day I have to pay the sales tax + state tax and now I don’t know what to do.

577,"Hello everyone.

I'm having issues determining whether I should stick with my current job. I've been here for 6~ months but every day is a chore to get through.  


Here's a breakdown of my weekday:

* 1 hour to commute to work.
* 1-2 hours at most are spent developing features.
* 1-2 hours are spent in meetings that don't involve me but I must attend.
* 1 hour is spent at lunch.
* 2-4 hours are spent without anything assigned.
* 1 hour to commute back home.
* 1.5~ hours at the gym.
* 1~ hour to myself at home.

I enjoy the development portion of the day, but it's towards a project that I don't feel excited for. 


During the time where I don't have work assigned, I've dived into various topics related to my field. Learning new things while at work is great, but its hard to keep focus for 2-4~ hours straight. 

Originally, I had decided that I would only stay for a year, but I'm having second thoughts now. The catalyst for this is a recent vacation I had to East Asia. I had such a great time that I've even decided to spend a few years working over there after this job. But, I've returned to my extremely repetitive weekday cycle for now, which is making me feel like shit. It doesn't help that I'm in a rural area and I just cut out a bunch of people from my life either.

I just think that my mental state is declining and the only real thing keeping it from snowballing out of control is the gym, personal projects, and learning a new language. I've had friends heavily recommend that I just go for it while I'm still young (and this does have me shook since I'm worried that if I wait I won't be able to enjoy the things I loved while traveling) but it seems fucked up to just leave my company on a whim after how welcoming they've been to me. People would kill for the level of comfort at my job, so should I even be complaining?

We’ve just recently bought a house together, with the help of my parents. I’ve got a good career at a mental facility that I worked my butt off for for ~2 years. I have everything I’ve ever wanted. 

However, a couple months ago, I started t realize that I wasn’t enjoying my job, which I know most people don’t, so I tried to just look past it. I told my mom, who helped me get in the program and helped me get the job, that I didn’t really want to work there anymore, but she said to just wait it out. 

Over the past couple months, my feelings have just gotten worse. I’m constantly stressed out. When I’m off work, I’m constantly thinking about work. I’m awake for hours dreading about going to work. I’m having stress and anxiety and panic attacks while at work because I’m afraid they’re going to mandate me in the morning (I work night shift). 

Last night, while trying to sleep with my boyfriend, I just finally had a mental breakdown and told my boyfriend everything I was feeling. He knew I didn’t want to work there anymore, and we’ve always talked about him making enough money in a year or two to support the both of us. But I told him last night that I don’t think I could handle being there another year, or even another week. After I explained myself, he didn’t realize just how bad it was and how horrible I’ve been feeling. I cried for hours and he tried to console me the entire time. 

To put it short, I’ve just been having a really tough time with my depression, anxiety, and stress that it’s seriously affecting my physical well-being. He keeps trying to tell me that we just have to wait it out, and hold on a little longer. All my mental stuff hasn’t been this hard since before I met my boyfriend, so it’s been hard trying to deal with it all, especially with someone who’s never had to deal with all this personally. He wants to help me so bad, but I know he doesn’t truly understand no matter how well I explain it and he doesn’t know what to do. 

And as I’ve said, I can’t really quit either because we just bought a house and this job helps with money a lot. But I really want to quit anyways and go back to my old job, who would take me happily, and even get another job if I had to. 

However, I’m afraid to tell my parents as they’ve helped me through all of this. I’m afraid of making the wrong decision. I’m afraid for my life if I keep working here.

587,"I’m 23 and so is she, we haven’t spoken in around 2 months. I made the effort on a couple of occasions I’ve just returned from my holiday and I was wondering if it’s worth reaching out or not

Previously we had a disagreement last summer we  had a period of time we didn’t speak as she assumed I was basically being an ass she then sent me a long message regarding how I am as a person and that I’m not very attentive to the friendship etc and then I told her the situation I was in. But the friendship never really got back to how it was , my dad was involved in an accident and I went into depression at that time. And I had this discussion with her. She seemed okay but I have this feeling that since then things weren’t the same. 

Anyone have any advice on whether it’s worth reaching out here? She hasn’t really made any effort to text me at all, not even once in 2 months to say hi how are you or anything, and a part of me feels like it takes 2 to try",14Jul2019,1

I (18F) have a crish on my step brother (23M). He has always been kind and gentle to me. I know he loves me as a sister. But I've come to realize thaet no other guys even match up to him and I have a deep crush for him.

The worst of all is his girlfriend. She's such a bitch to me always criticizing me and making me feel inferior. I really, really want them to break up and I'm prepared to try to actually do that. Do any of you have any suggestions on how i could do this?",14Jul2019,0

I was using my moms prius for a while but realized I wasn't making enough because I couldn't get hours because she has to use it.  


I really wanted to save up for a used car in the $1000-$2000 range but I settled on a street legal scooter (motorcycle class in IL,   would need license) so that I could get a credit card,  treat it as a loan,  and then pay it back within a month with Doordash money.    Reason being that a new scooter is probably not likely to break down on me as much as a used car for $1500 is,  and I wont get screwed with the credit card thing.  Only problem is,  I don't have proof of income.

590,"me (17) and him (16) have been friends for about 5 years, we fell out briefly and in that time he decided to do online school instead of going back to normal school. hes gay and struggles with that, an alcoholic and extremely emotionally draining.

everytime he drinks he becomes aggressive and very emotional/ dramatic. drinking at my house he pulled a knife out of my drawer and threatened to slit his wrists, woke my working dad up and argued with pretty much everyone there. he has come onto me and made me uncomfortable, last time i left his house at 2am because he had a loud argument with his dad cause he was so drunk he forgot the password to his own phone. he asked me to meet up this summer and i feel bad but i dont want to see him, i agreed and said i would but dont want to drink because every time we do it goes wrong, and now hes being off with me.

i love him and care about him but he is extremely dramatic and has fallen out with pretty much every one of my friends. recently he fell out with another depressed girl because she isolates herself, took 4 days to reply to his message. he proceeded to get drunk and attack her over the internet for it.

the only reason i havent dropped him is because i worry about what would happen if i did, he has literally 0 friends but me and often talks about being suicidal.  he is funny and i care but he is also dramatic, aggressive, insecure and selfish.

i worry that im just being critical of him and should just be there to support him. he said hes getting a therapist soon.",14Jul2019,1

I know I’m looking too much way into this but I’ve heard the dating app culture is really shallow.

Gran’s ring was from during the war and, while the jeweller I talked to said it was a surprisingly nice ring for England at that time, it definitely isn’t flashy or big. The jeweller suggested putting the diamonds in a different ring with a newer, flashier diamond to modernize it if I felt that way.

I'm a young girl and I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about 6 month now

I like him a lot and he's completely in love with me, we're both each other's first serious relationship and it's wonderful 

There's a shadow on the picture tho : I don't feel as in love and thrilled as I used to feel when I'd have one sided loves, and this creates problems because he is very clingy and wants my complete attention all the time

I think he'd need to please me less so the power balance is inversed, so I want and respect him more

How do I explain to him that he's too nice without seeming weird/ hurting him?

Basically , everyone in the group has a 'partner' or belongs to a 'subgroup', and I'm a part of none so I feel left out, and well, basically, I don't feel like I've any friends really. 




The problem is that I'm actually sad about this, and idk how to get rid of this loneliness. I'm not the kind of person who's always been surrounded by friends, since I used to play video games(League of legends rip me) before (and they kind of take away from your social life) , but online games are banned in my university, so I don't have an escape from this loneliness.

598,"Hey,

To tell you something about myself: I was brought up to be efficient and hard-working, I am studying at the top of my course, I dream of getting my PhD and working in academic research. I‘m also drinking 2-3l of vodka a week (about 100 ounces).
I study hard and don’t know how to relax. I can’t enjoy a day at the beach because I get terribly bored. Soo in other words I am only living to study, work, get money, buy expensive things and have a secure future. The thing is I noticed I don’t want this. If I get old and sick, I don’t want doctors to artificially delay my death. If this means to drink every night just to find some purpose, I don’t want it either. I want to wake up near the beach or a lake, in a small house with only the things I need. I don’t want a phone and care about politics and the news. I want to have a garden where I grow what I need. I want to live with some animals. I want to have time to properly enjoy the sunrise and sunset. I want to enjoy the time I spend with others rather than only meeting others to study. 

Is it possible to live like this? What if I move to another country? Do you have any recommendations?

605,"This isn’t easy and I’d be glad of advice. 
I’m Scottish and have finally reached a point where I can conceive of taking my family on a holiday abroad. I’ve got three bairns who’ll be 15, 10 and 4 next summer when we’d like to go. I’ve dreamed of taking them to WaltDisneyWorld and the gap in ages makes me think this could be the last chance where all of them are old enough to appreciate it and young enough to enjoy it. I’m unlikely to be able to afford another trip again. 
However, I’m horrified at modern America. 
They have actual concentration camps for infant children. Scotland in the UK reacted to its only school shooting by massive restrictions on gun ownership. America thinks the solution is arming teachers. The President is a racist, misogynist, narcissist balloon.  I’m not sure that’s a country I want to visit. However, I also see how good America can be. I’ve always wanted to go there but now when I can afford it things seem to have changed. The few Americans I’ve met were all nice but I suspect Americans in America might be different. 
It’d be easy to say we will just go somewhere else but I really think that Florida would be ideal. We’ve had family challenges and the eldest has had to live with grandparents for much of the last couple of years. Disneyland offers all the things they like. We considered Disneyland Paris and it is an option but it’s not the same, doesn’t hit all the favourites and the language barrier is an extra challenge I’d rather avoid.  If I’m lucky and another chance comes again then a french trip might be easier when the youngest is through the school. 
So do I spend a lot of money and take them to Florida and pretend I don’t know there’s wee kids being forced to live in cages not far away?  Or do I miss the only chance I might get to do the big theme park trip and miss a much wanted special moment for our family?

I don't know how to give a start so I will just tell you the whole thing

I had a friend basically a brother, had known each other for 17 years spent almost spent my entire childhood with him till we split schools but we were still in contact as we were neighbors and as we reached 11th grade( collage in some other countries) he came it my school.

There we had formed this really close group of friends to the point that one of us had a fight with some collage students we were all beaten the crap out off.

When we cleared our competitive exams (NEET for me /IIT JEE for my friend) after 12, one day me and my friends were laughing as usual, everything was normal but the very next day my friend commits suicide because his test scores were not good enough ( Huge deal in India).

I was devastated due to that but my so called friends were busy using  this event as tool to get booze (we were minors) and sympathy from other girls and shit.

This is where my problem begins I going to being my third year of collage, this past year I tried making friend by being all friendly and tried to put all things behind me but the group does not consider me a "" friend friend"" just a ""collage friend"" they are not bad people but I can't open up.

I have to spend 3 more years with these people I want real friends.

My problems are -

1. I thought I knew all about my friend but I didn't know what he was going through, That's one of my fears That I might not know about a person as I think I know.
2. The people I consider my friend may not consider me the same way.",14Jul2019,2

When it ended, she said that I was apparently too much for her (due to my issues) and it was honestly a more than fair decision. 

However it affected me way more than it should have. For two years, I just confined myself to a bubble thinking that no one will love me for who I am, not even as a friend.

Anyway we've been talking again and it's been 3 months since it's been happening. We both have considerably changed. Today she messaged me that she wants to give our relationship another go and I'm all for that but I don't know. I can't seem to make a decision on it.",14Jul2019,2

The situation is that they grew up a tough childhood, living as the youngest in a divorced household. I have memories of this person crying all the time in the schoolyard and feeling bad for them. They grew up having positive influences, their eldest brother, older sister, and father, but the direct negative influences included the mother (who got custody 6/7 days of the week), step-father, and older brother. Although the rest of my friend group is well through college, my friend dropped out of engineering and pursued trade school, eventually landing a union job. However, the current state of the situation is that the mother delivered an ultimatum: to either stay and do the work given with the pawn of a step-father at their large-acre house in the woods, or get kicked out of their house and live with the aging father who is having age-related health troubles. The idea I had was that my friend could continue to stay with the father and have a house under their head until they have enough funds to get one nearby, I suppose.

A few years ago we lived in an apartment and there was a tornado that forced us to move into an awful rent house. whenever we moved in there were holes in the floor and walls and the people before us left it so dirty and we clean it everyday but no matter what it still feels absolutely gross. the water damage that the air conditioners bring once caused my wall in my bedroom to collapse. luckily we had drywall laying around and we tried to fix the leak as we couldn’t afford someone who knows how to fix it for us. we live next to a field a and theres a new animal in here everyday. im constantly finding roaches, water bugs, field mice, and spiders the size of my hand. the breaking point to me was this morning. i woke up to a cottonmouth snake slithering on the headboard of my bed. i absolutely freaked out. after animal control left i was texting my best friend about the issue, just telling her how crazy it was that there was a snake on my bed. but she hits me back with “i spoke to my mom and you can live with is until your family finally moves” now this, is an amazing opportunity. she lives in a place where i wouldnt have to worry abt a poison snake nibblin on my toe and i would absolutely love to live there. the only problem is, i have strict parents. i feel like they would never go for this. my mom first had problems letting me stay the night there. our parents arent close at all but im close to her mom. i feel like my mom would also be worried about the financial aspect and things like that but their family has everything figured out we would just need my mom to agree. they are serious about this and so am i. im not even sure how to bring this up to my mom. what do i do ? should i just stick it out with my family?

618,"So roughly 3 years ago I met this girl at a bar and her sister. They were fun we had a good time and exchanged numbers. We texted a little that night and the next week but it kinda fizzled out, didn’t think much of it.

Recently around the 4th of July I ran into her younger sister and was like “hey I think I’ve met you before, don’t you have a sister?” Or something like that (we were at a house party where it was all friends, everyone knew it other, very casual). So I didn’t think it was weird to say ‘you look familiar’ basically.

She was like “whoa dude how do you know that” and made me feel a little weird. I explained and they day went on normal but I think she was put back. That’s fair. I’ll give her her space.

Unfortunately for me, I ran into them the next night out at a concert; this time both of them. They were making me feel super weird/stalker-ish because they’re like “hOw Do YoU rEmEmBeR tHaT?!” “It was so long ago”...

In hindsight I wish I said nothing.

The next day I looked up her first name in my phone: boom there was a convo we had a few years ago. Now, I’m gunna say this was probably stupid of me, and I should have just let it be, but I was feeling like they actually thought I was some rando. So I screenshotted our old convo and sent it to her saying something like “see! not making it up”

Pretty much backfired. She didn’t respond.

Then just yesterday I was out at a bar with a bunch of friends. Lo and behold guess who I run into?.. yep, these two sisters again. I said hi very friendly and then the older one was like “that was so weird sending the screenshot of our convo from 3 years ago” which made me again feel like absolute shit. That literally wasn’t my intention.. whatever I just walked away.

We are all mid 20’s and looking back now I probably should have even ever texted her. But I haven’t done anything wrong and I feel like they’re making me out to something I’m not..

Should I send her a text just saying “sorry for sending a screen shot of our original convo from a few years ago. didn’t mean to creep you out” ?? Or should I just let this thing ride. See odds are I’ll see them out eventually again since they’re not in my immediate friend group, but like friends of friends.

Or maybe I’m caring too much. I just feel they’re like talking a bunch of shit on me (maybe not?) and I want to do damage control.

This probably is really silly and dumb. But idk I think I’m a sensitive dude so I care about people thinking badly on me. Maybe I should just learn and move on? All suggestions welcome",14Jul2019,2
620,"Hi everyone,

I am writing because I really need someone else's perpective and advice on this.

I have graduated from a Bachelor degree in Business Analytics (actually, I have studied both economics, computer science and statistics) from a very good university in Europe but with a low grade. The fact that my grade is low is given both by the fact that I haven't really put all my efforts in studying (or I am just stupid, it might also be that) and that other universities consider this grade very low because of the graduation scale of other universities in my country and so I cannot really do anything about that.

During these three years I have been taking very low grades in maths, computer science and all other subjects, but I got the highest grade in advanced statistics (Casella Berger topics) and a similar grade in machine learning. 

So when I was doing my last exams, I had an offer for a summer internship from a well known tech company (but something I really didn't like, more management-related) and I had been admitted to a MSc in Computational Science, a MSc in Machine Learning and Statistics, a MSc in Computer Science and a MSc in Finance and Economics, all at quite good universities. However, as I was unhappy about my previous studies, I felt lost and I didn't manage to dedice what program to choose. So when I got another offer for a 6 months internship at a bank I decided to go for that just to get more time to decide.

But now the problem is even bigger because now, having the time to prepare for the GMAT, I could get a chance to get in some good business school. Fortunately, I don't have money so I really have to think about that.

Now my problem is, what should I do? What should I study? Is it a problem that I am starting one year later?

I really like finance, if I had to study finance I would do it to become portfolio manager or to work in risk management, but I somehow feel guilty to be working in that environment. I'm not saying my family is disappointed, but they are quite left-wing and I feel they are not very proud of me going to a business school. I'd probably want to do something more scientific. I like physics and astronomy, but it's too late now. Should I start again another Bachelor degree? I feel I am too old and I am not even sure I would succeed in that, so why should I risk? Should I hope I get an offer from the bank I'm doing the internship at? I would be prisoner of this job forever. 

I probably want to do research, I have done an internship in research (still in finance) and I liked that. 

But I am not sure what I want to study and I'm not sure if I can make it. 

I hate myself so damn much for being so responsible. I'd like, for once in my life, not being the only one in my family to do things right, to finish what I do, and always be coherent. I don't know what I want to do, or what I want my life to be like. 

Should I follow money? Or should I try to do something at which I will most probably fail?

I know it's easy to say to risk it all to someone else, but what would you do in my place? 

How did you decide what you wanted your life to be about?

What can I do to get a clear idea of all of this?",14Jul2019,1
621,"like, every day there’s someone yelling at someone, be it my mum and stepdad arguing, my little siblings getting yelled at because they refuse to go to bed, my brother arguing with my mum or stepdad (or both)
there’s ALWAYS something, every. single. DAY.

It makes me worried for my siblings because them seeing their parents arguing all the time, insulting each other constantly and never actually agreeing on anything is hardly setting a healthy view of what relationships are supposed to be like - or what’s normal for a family in general.

my oldest brother has pretty clear anger problems that go sweeped under the rug all the time - and I’m also worried both for his future if he doesn’t get help for those problems and worried for my younger siblings if his irritable and angry and frankly mean personality rubs off on them - they’re already picking up on the habits of just yelling at each other if they disagree which I guess is normal for little kids but it’s not like anybody in this house will be able to teach them that it’s not the right solution. 

When my brother and stepdad fight it’s not uncommon for my brother to 1) throw things and or 2) make violent verbal threats (that kind of scare me because I don’t trust his self control and I’m getting more and more worried that one day he’ll actually carry them out)   

my mum always asks why I never leave my room and it’s because whenever we try and have “family time” together it’s either really tense on the verge of an argument or they’re already arguing. 

Idk what you could give advice for, actually. I came here wanting advice, but it turned more into a vent. I guess, how to stop being so affected by these fights? And maybe how can I protect my siblings,, or help my brother even though it’s out of my ability to get therapy for him

628,"Okay so I’m staying at my aunts house and I saw a mouse on the windowsill last night. I didn’t think much of it, but it happened again today, except this time, there were two of them. This was on the windowsill that’s inside the house. My first thought was to pet one of them and take pics, so I did just that. My aunt freaked out tho and told me to get rid of them. I managed to catch one of them and escort it outside. I set it free in a bushy area with trees. The other mouse, however, managed to hide. It went back into the space between the windowsill and the window frame(construction flaw), where they came from in the first place. There’s a metal grate outside the house that’s situated around that spot, which might serve as another exit for the remaining mouse, but I’m not entirely sure if the grate is connected to the space where they used to live.
Now, I have some concerns, as I’m no expert when it comes to wild rodents: 
Will the first mouse be able to survive? It was very small so I’m guessing it was still young.
 Will the second one be able to escape since my aunt duct taped their entrance near the windowsill? 
I can provide photos and stuff if needed, I just don’t want these cute fuzz balls to die.

632,"So when I was 16 i wasn’t at a very happy spot in my life and I was pretty lonely and I met a guy online a lot older than myself (27) and we really hit it off and I sneakily met him in person a few times (he was my first kiss) and the last time we saw each other things got kinda steamy, we never had sex though. I was really liking him and I think he was into me as well. After a few months of getting to know him and falling for him... my mom finds out about it. And I couldn’t even find a way to lie about about it cause she had all the evidence she needed. She also found out about abuse that happened when I was a child by a family member. So she went to the police about it. I got a quick second to warn him something was probably going to happen but I’ve never spoken to him since. I told my parents and the police everything that happened except for the fact of how hard I was falling for him. It was so hard telling everything cause I knew he would be in trouble but I didn’t see any other option. He ended up getting arrested and charged, put on a sex offenders registry and spending time in jail, and every night he spent in jail I cried myself to sleep. I felt and still feel so guilty because even though he was older I feel that everything that happened between us was consensual and I took part just as much as he did. I felt like I ruined his life. And I’ve been carrying that with me at all times. The other day (I’m now 23, he would be 34) I came across an old legal letter that had his name and my name and what happened and stuff and I just broke. I burst into tears and just felt so broken. I’ve always wondered what happened to him and how this has all effected him, so I looked him up and found a picture of him and he looks amazing. He looks so happy. He’s living across the country working a good job and looks like he got some help. And when I look at this photo of him, part of me is angry that I never have gotten any help and another part of me just melts and says “he’s mine. I need him. “ it’s been so long and I don’t think he would ever want anything to do with me and it’s probably not a good idea to contact him again if I’ve gone this long. But I’ve been with other guys since him, and I’ve never gotten the feeling I’ve had with him. When he put his arm around me, I just felt so safe and nothing else mattered. He was my first kiss, so he will always be with me in a way. I’ll never forget him and I never regret him. I think what I need is closure. I never got the chance to say goodbye. I feel like if I could hear him say that he’s not angry with me maybe I could move on. I love him but I don’t think we will ever get to be together. Should I let him be or write him a letter to give myself the closure I think I need to move on? It’s not fair because I feel so stuck but he looks so fine.",14Jul2019,6
633,"So I (20F) have been doing a study abroad program that has had me on the other side of the world from where I live since last September. I officially end my program and move back in December, but next month I go back to my city for 3 weeks for a wedding. 

In the beginning of last year I met a guy (21) who lived about four hours away from my city. He came and took me on a few dates over the next few months and he made an effort to come see me before I left overseas but besides that we didn't talk or text much. Basically, we tried to see each other when we were both in the same city but we didn't really talk besides that. Before I left, he suggested a few ideas for dates for when I get back. 

Now here I am, 10 months later. He has since then moved to my city but we haven't talked very much at all since I've been overseas. He doesn't even know I'm coming back to town.

I really like this guy but I'm struggling to get myself to text him. I was under no disillusion that he would wait for me or anything like that, but I currently have no idea of his relationship status or if he would even want to hear from me. I honestly feel like I'm being a wuss or, in the very least, trying to spare my pride. Can anyone offer some perspective?

I live with three other siblings and I am constantly cleaning after two of them. I went on ""vacation"" for 3 weeks and everything in the house fell apart. Of course, I was being labeled with the other children of the household. It's demoralizing and I can clearly prove that I'm a much better human being and adult than she'll ever be. 

My mother and I don't see eye to eye. We have always had a troublesome past and the problems that existed in the past are still relevant today because of the person she is. She is stupid, simple minded, extremely emotional,  and fails to learn her lessons and accept the consequences of her actions.

I was driving to my first day of orientation and was in a freak car accident which folded my foot and ankle in half and landed me in the hospital facing a complicated surgery on tiny bones in the area. 

The injury has been non-weightbearing for almost 2 months now, during which I've been out of work and exhausted from getting around on crutches and only using one leg. I had been working lucratively as a nanny in California and my next step was grad school (which I have deferred for a year due to my injury.)

648,"
My family gave me a trust fund. I used to have it only for emergencies and never dipped into it, until the last 2.5 months. 


For background, immediately right after graduating college leading up to this point, I moved out of my parents house, got an apartment with roommates, was working retail, then landed an internship and finally landed a professional job less than a year after I graduated. I was feeling good and like my life was going somewhere. I enjoyed the job for the most part. I was working at this job for almost a year, but there were substantial issues beginning to crop up at my workplace due to poor management and I ended up quitting in the winter time due to certain reasons that were affecting my mental health. I am a giant idiot for doing this, I am very aware, but I cared so little by the time I quit that I did not have another job lined up in my industry. All I could feel was I felt like I was constantly on the go and stressed at this job and I needed to breathe. After I quit I took about a month off of no work. After this “break,” I applied for and got a retail job for a couple months in 2019 that paid me much less money, requiring me to live off the savings made from my prior job. But, despite the shitty pay and boring work, I felt better mentally again. I didn’t feel overworked and exhausted constantly like at my prior job. I felt I had a better work life balance. However, as my savings from my previous job dwindled, I decided to move cities to position myself in a better location for finding job’s pertaining to my industry, because I knew I couldn’t work retail forever. I hated my retail job even if my commute and responsibilities were minuscule. Customers can be so nasty and I was so under-stimulated working retail. I’m no stranger to retail as throughout college I worked retail or odd jobs for my college to make extra money to save. 

Anyways, I quit that retail job this spring and moved cities. That was 2.5 months ago.
But ever since I moved 2.5 months ago, my savings were depleted so I dipped into my trust fund. 


I have lost almost all my motivation and energy after the move. I don’t know if I’m depressed or what. 
My life has been fairly chaotic emotionally the last few months. I’m not suicidal, no, but I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

The last 2.5 months, I have been a bum when it comes to my life. My daily routine for the last 2 and a half months have been: wake up between 7-9AM, take care of my pets needs (I have two cats and some snakes), make sure that my home is very tidy, hang out with my very loving and caring boyfriend a few times a week, maybe eat a few meals, play with my cats as much as they want, halfheartedly fill out and send a shameful number of job apps a day IF I can force myself to, watch Netflix, use the pool at my apartment, and sleep. I at least can pride myself in that I am not a slob, I keep my home immaculate, i grow healthy plants on my patio and my animal are spoiled and given so much love and attention since I’m home so much.


But I’m not fucking productive. It’s a struggle to do job applications, it’s a struggle to go to the gym, I haven’t worked out properly in months and hell its a struggle for me to eat properly. I’ve been underweight for the last four years when I used to be a huge gym rat in college. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I am just lazy and unmotivated or if there is a bigger problem here. Like seriously, I used to love exercise, I had muscles and strength and a routine and now I’m just very skinny. Honest to god, even the Netflix stuff, sometimes I can’t even bring myself to watch something, I just lay around sometimes once my animals are taken care of, doing NOTHING. I hate it and I don’t hate myself yet but I don’t know if this is a sign I need therapy or SSRIs or what. I used to love video games too. They remain untouched because they aren’t fun anymore. I like cooking for my boyfriend when we hang out and he is very caring of me, but we don’t live together and have not been dating very long so he is unaware that when we are not together that my diet is shit. I’m a good cook but I struggle to feed myself when it’s just me in my home. I don’t really get hunger pangs. 


I try to spend my money on my basic necessities like food, rent, pet expenses and utility bills. I feel like I could use my fund to invest in something to make myself more income but I don’t know where to start.  

I really want to change and to achieve something out of my life, but honestly I'm living too comfortably and finding it hard to change. Every day I get a bit more bothered and anxious about my lifestyle and I wish so much that I could just get off my ass and find work. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",14Jul2019,2

I‘ve Never used an online Platform to ask for an advice but im going through a though time at the moment, and maybe someone was in a similar situation and can give me some hope! :-)

I have a very close female friend with whom i Fell in Love.
We know each other for 6 years. The first year we both were in a relationship with different Partners that’s propably why we ended up as friends.
I‘ve always knew that she‘s an awesome Woman and we Share so many interests but I always thought that she‘s just a good friend. But about a year ago we moved into a shared flat with another girlfriend of her.

Since about two months we both have quite a bit of free time and spent every minute together. That was the moment I realized that I want more from her than friendship. I‘ve never felt more attracted to a person ever in my life!

Sometimes when we watch tv our legs or whatever touches and my heart starts acting like crazy. I tried to show her my affection but i absolutely don’t want to be creepy!
The only thing that keeps me from telling her is that i don’t want to endanger our friendship but if I don’t I’ll ruin myself..

I also tried dating other woman, but the only thing I can think of is her when I’m with others.

I could really need some advice of someone who‘s been in my situation.

657,"I'm 19 and my girlfriend is 18. We have been together for a year and have a really good relationship. However I like to smoke weed with a friend of mine from time to time, more so now as its summer vacation and have just graduated high school. She gets upset every time I do it. She tells me its wrong and is only something you should do a handful of times in your life, that its a gateway drug, it will make me lazy and that I should ""drink like normal people"". It is illegal where I live.

I like smoking weed, I like how it makes me feel, I like the ritual of meeting up with my friend, rolling a joint and just hanging out. I do not like drinking, I act horrible when I do and it always makes me feel sad. 

The first time I smoked this summer was about 2 weeks ago, I hadn't touched the stuff since Christmas as I was committed to doing well for the end of school exams and getting into college. Since then I've smoked about 4 or 5 times, and usually stayed up all night. She freaked out at me the last time telling me that I was overdoing it and would become a junkie like a former friend of mine who got addicted to cocaine and ruined his chance of getting into college. We don't talk much anymore as a result. 

Sometimes I feel like she is right, maybe I am overdoing it. I've been in a bit of a funk lately, I never really made a lot of friends in the last two years of high school as I transferred and was the new kid for ages and have just been depressed/bores since exams finished. Me and my best friend fell out a year ago after I came out as bisexual and never really recovered which makes me upset. I guess I smoke with this buddy of mine as a way to not be bored and talk to someone. I don't really talk to a lot of people other than my gf, and she's going away on holiday for a month soon, so ill be quite lonely. Am I overdoing it? I don't want to become a junkie, nor do I want to upset my gf. However at the same time I like doing it. Am I just being immature?",14Jul2019,5

659,"About 3 or 4 months ago, we just had some new neighbors move in next door. Many times they have yelled at my siblings, critiqued us and our house for being disorganized, and have been doing nonstop CAT construction since about a week after moving in. 

None of this bothered me, as I am leaving for school in the fall and our family is generally good about not reacting negatively to this sort of stuff. That said and true, this morning was the final straw--

One of our family friends came over last night and parked on the street, unfortunately, in front of the their driveway. That was a big mistake, but the driveway is not functional, as it is covered in concrete from construction. Nobody is parked there, to be clear. They called the cops, the cops showed up, and our buddy's truck was towed ($400). I'm sure if they came and asked for him to move it out of the nonfunctional driveway, he would have. It was 100% unintentional on his part but obviously it wasn't illegal for them to call for it to be towed.

Everyone in the neighborhood is frustrated with them already. Again, this is on top of a litany of other aggressive things they have done to both my family and the surrounding neighbors. What can I do to work cooperatively with them so the tensions all end? (Talking to them has not worked very well)

Sending resume and talking about my experiences where I was fired for not being fast enough is like a kick in my guts

it's been a **hard** year

1. Psychiatrist that have no experience with aspergers got me meds that made me more sick , I had a fucking month getting off them , being depressed , throwing up . Now I am with a new one but too expensive and I have anxiety with paperwork so I did not filed for insurance , yes I am a dumb.
2. I am in a long distance relationship with a sweet geeky dude , he gave me hope in life The family of my BF is adorable so we can see a future .
3. Living with my family is complicated , I always lie , I don't feel at home , they think I am a slob wheras it was the medication making me ill
4. My parents are religious close minded , they don't accept that I am agnostic "" you are just crazy "" NO being asperger doesn't make my values less valid , and it makes the relationship with my BF frustrating because they believe no relationship out of marriage . So when I told my mom about him she reacted : I was a slut for having sex out of marriage and my BF will only come to our house when he will ask to mary ( come on it's 2019 ) me my dad doesnt know and he will be judgemental because my BF is an atheist with a jewish family and my family is muslim .
5. To get out I have to get a job , I have a master degree from Rennes School of Business , I got fired from my internships for "" not listening "" and i could not keep up with non verbal communication , even jobs like waitress got me so confusd with the tables number and messed up .
6. If I go to the city where my BF lives (FRANCE / Angers to Toulouse 6 hours train ) and get a job here I don't have the support of a social worker that can explain better Asperger to potential employer about how to manage me
7. I managed to get a little financial help but if I get out of the city I have to take month to do papers for health /taxes/ insurance / appointment at a therapist doing paperwork makes me awfully nervous so I procratinate like the failure I am .
8. The housing market sucks and I need a bail from my parents I tried to look for a flat and the paperwork was huge

i have diagnosed adhd and depressiv tendencys,

One is temporary and often for a reason while the other is lasting and way more severe.
Broadly speaking at least)

Because of the former 2 reasons it is way easier for me to get both.
As of recently i started to mutilate my body again, i am cutting or pricking my legs with scissors, it ia not a severe case of yet.
And nothing of the things i did in the past helps me to get better, sport selfcare and motivational videos,
I can't really bring myself to talk to a friend as they are all at quite Importend point in their lives and i dont wana put more pressure on them.

It seems that this parent has been alcholoic forever and there's no way of stopping it. Yesterday I confronted this alcholic parent and they told me (like they usually do), that they won't stop drinking until I stop being gay. They say I can't stop them drinking just because I don't like it, in the same way that they haven't been able to make me straight because they don't like it.

672,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I've looked at LOTS of porn throughout my life and used to masturbate multiple times a day. The vastness of the internet allowed me to fap to extremely specific porn, which catered to my exact tastes and fetishes. However, now that I'm older, I worry it has warped my expectations to unreasonable levels for what turns me on. I say this because I've had a few sexual experiences in the last month and for NONE of them did I get an erection until they started directly interacting with my dick (blowjob, etc) and even then, I was only about half-mast. When I look at porn I like online, I can get hard no-problem, but in real life where people (obviously) don't have looks that exactly match my turn-ons, my body doesn't react. I can't even remember the last time I got fully hard without needing direct contact on my dick and it's demoralizing. The anxiety of it probably makes the situation worse, as I'm constantly focusing on trying to get erect in these situations before they reach my crotch and notice that I'm soft. I've quit porn cold-turkey, but I worry that the damage is done. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?",14Jul2019,3

i try my best to ignore it and try to do better but in the end, it always get to me even after i mute them/block them.

I forgot to ask my parents if i could go and forgot to ask my boss from work if i could get a day off.

The guy who's idea this was, (Let's call him Tom)  sent us a pay request, i didn't paid that cause did not knew if i could go to the park.
Tom bought the tickets for 5 people including himself and i.
I did not knew that and did not get a message or call that Tom was going to buy or already bought the tickets.
Today is said i forgot to asked because is was busy with work and just forget a lot of things.
I offered to pay the tickets which is €27,65.

I also offered to go give him the money in cash, cause he lives close to me and i could get my game back which i lent to his little brother.

He said it is easier to just deposit it on his bank account,  but my parents won't agree if i basically pay for something i'm not going to do or use.
So i offered to bring it cash because i feel like a bad person if i don't pay the tickets.

I explained that my parents most likely won't agree with this, but they all called me out for being stupid.

I don't really know what to do, i think that the best option for me is to just bring him the cash.

I feel like it's my fault, and yeah that's it.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months now and we're entering our third year of high school together. We're an affectionate couple (not in public, of course) and we spend a large amount of time texting each other, which typically results in us just complimenting each other. I really love her and I have feelings for her, but I feel like a shitty human. I get really hurt by seemingly small comments she makes. She knows a number of people with the same name as me, and she'll say things like, ""why aren't you as dreamy as other ..."" I know it's a joke but it hurts. She'll also send out a heart in a group chat but joke that it is intended for someone else. These are specific incidents and it doesn't happen too often, but still hurts my feelings.

Beyond that, at times, I feel like I pay her a lot more attention and affection than she pays me, but I worry that if I tone the affection I give her down, she'll suddenly lose interest in me. That seems so silly and I acknowledge it, but it's hard for me to not be insecure in this way. Ever since entering this relationship, I'm been anxious and sad and I know it isn't her fault. It feels like an issue with me.

Anyway, to the question- how can I become less insecure and happier in my relationship? I spend a solid amount of time on hobbies and work but I feel the need to text her or else she'll slowly drift away. Thanks guys.

697,"So 7 years ago my half sisters left my home to live with their biological mother (she had manipulated them into thinking my dad was a horrible person and did drugs and such). This left our Father in shambles with what he should do and my mom very mad at them for screwing up our family. One had attempted suicide under her mother’s roof, then noticed how bad she was. We welcomed her back under our roof at this point (5 years ago). The other was already over 18 so she didn’t need to come back per-say. My mother was hesitant with this move but grew close with my half-sister to the point I was actually jealous she wouldn’t spend time with me. Another issue was they then had to spend more money than they had before since taking care of 2 kids now. Well she stayed with us for about 2 years and it went back downhill. My parents obviously hated her mom for manipulating her. Well rather than just ask if she could visit her mom, where my parents would obviously say yes, even if hesitantly, she decided to sneak out to see her and her mother convinced her she needed antidepressants, rather than get it diagnosed. My parents found the pills and were obviously pissed off, as she had gone to see her mom without asking, and got her mom to buy her pills. They grounded her for obvious reasons and we thought that was the end of that. Well a week later during school, unbeknownst to us, she made trips back and forth from her moms house moving her things. When end of school day came around she picked me up and dropped me off NEAR our house not at it. That was the last time i’d see her on good terms. She said she needed gas and had a club meeting so i was like whatever. 2 hours later i hear my parents fighting and go downstairs to see them crying (only time i’ve seen my dad cry). They had gone in her room and were heartbroken. (this was 3 years ago). So now my dad was back to being easily stressed and mad 24/7 because she just left and wouldn’t talk to us. Recently our household is getting back to being perfect, i’m going into senior year and everything is back to normal. She sent me a message on twitter giving me her number and saying she wanted to see me and catch up. Now i’m private on twitter and didn’t accept or decline the message. so she doesn’t know if i’ve seen it. I’d like to see my sister, as i haven’t seen her in years, but my mom is against it. My dad doesn’t even know as we don’t want to make him sad. My mom hates her vividly now as she got close to her and she left a second time. My mom doesn’t want our now near perfect life to be ruined by my sisters trying to come back in, and even went as far as to say if they came back in she’d leave my father.

This may seem crazy but I live in Texas so you don’t meet many people who are open in that way and as vulnerable. 
Here’s the real issue... he lives in NY. I used to live there and that’s how we have mutual friends. 
So it’s not like I can just ask him for some coffee or whatever. I just don’t know what I should do or if there’s anything to do.

702,I went out drinking a few days ago and I met this guy. We instantly hit it off and spent most of the night together. I know this sounds cliche but I never felt a connection like that. When I gave him my # I might’ve put in the wrong one... I was intoxicated by this time. He did the whole thing where he called my # after I entered it but I didn’t check if it rang on my end. The next day I went to my call log and I never received a missed call. Plus I forgot his name! Any suggestions on what I should do?? I know it’s like finding a needle in a haystack but it’s killing me to know if I did give the wrong # or he just wasn’t interested.,14Jul2019,1

I have worked as telephone interviewer for around a month now (its a job where we call random people like sellers and ask them to complete surveys for datacollection and just research purposes. We also get the same hate as sellers though) and i really want to quit since its making my mental health worse. Last week i had to deal with someone who insulted me personally through a 20 minute interview and ended up hanging up riiight before finishing, just to waste my time. I know its to be expected with a job like this but i really needed the money. 

So Reddit! How do i quit a job? 
I feel quilty for quitting already and i want to make this not awkward and as professional as i can. Do i hand in a letter? Do i call my boss? (I dont even know who my boss is) Do i do it before a shift or after?

As for families, we see each others' regularly (almost on a weekly basis), which is important to both of us. 

There is a little bit of an age difference between us. He's 28 and has a nine year old son who lives with my boyfriend's parents. As for the backstory there, he was young when his son was born, the mother of the child dipped, and he didn't have the means to care for his son on his own. 

I've of course met his son many times. We'll call him Derek. Derek spends a lot of his time playing video games in his room; sometimes my boyfriend is able to coax him out for a jump on the trampoline or a game of catch, however. 

My boyfriend wants Derek to (eventually) move in with us when we get our house. I'm 21 years old with no children and without much experience with them. I always feel somewhat awkward interacting with Derek as I've never been in a ""maternal"" position.

718,"Hello everyone, this is my first post on this subreddit I really need some guidance. looking forward to reading your replies.

PS : I'm not gonna disclose some specific information like location for example for my own security. 

I'm a 21 year old male, a few years ago I came to Europe to study (I came legally via student visa then a staying permit), I am from a third-world country but I had the chance to have a high enough education to be able to speak 3 languages and assimilate into the European society. I had some difficulties but at the end I passed the contests and was accepted into several business schools. Problem is I need to pay for the first year out of a 3 year course (2nd and 3rd my future boss pays the school), all of my fellow students contract a student loan to pay for the fees of the first year, they get the loan easily and it's just around 15 000 euros tops. But apparently since I'm a foreign national, with no family in here no bank will lend me the money, and also I don't want to play the victim card but to be honest after 4 years in here my name really doesn't help because people automatically assume I'm some kind of a ""bad desert guy"", It's to the point where I would change my name in a heartbeat if I had the chance. 

The loan is the only way I would have been able to continue studying, and after that get a job and succeed in life, for the reason I stated before it is also hard to get small summer jobs. But since I won't be able to get into a school, my staying permit will probably not be renewed, and in that case I would have to go back home. Problem is I don't have family there anymore, my grandpa died, and my father kinda abandoned me and started a new family and has a little daughter at the moment so ... not to mention I have been pretty vocal about my government during my stay in Europe and I attracted the attention of he wrong people. 

I'm lost, I am also scared to be really honest, what can I do ? I just wanted my life to have a meaning.",14Jul2019,1

722,"As the title states, my mom is obsessed with my acne - which I actually have very little of. Of course, a little is natural for a teenager. I take good care of my skin, washing it twice a day with face wipes and a formula in the shower, but I still do get some acne. It's gotten more under control since I stopped wearing makeup. My mom, however, is obsessed with any little blemish I get. 

She constantly tries to get me new products (which I don't need), get me in for a teen facial (which I don't want because I don't like strangers touching me or my face), and snaps at me not to touch my face any time I try to do anything to the acne. When I was about to get my wisdom teeth out, she was there taking a quiz on my skin about what I need to ""fix"" in order to get me more products. I almost started crying because I was already terrified of the operation and she was just making it worse. She makes me feel awful about my face, and it was hard for me to feel comfortable going out without makeup. I quit wearing makeup on my own terms, though. She was the one who got me into wearing makeup at 13, which helped cause more acne.

Just a few minutes, she sent me a text about getting a teen facial, which would cost $55(USD) for 30-40 minutes. She said that she ""would really like to get my skin perfect before \[I\] go off to school"" (her words directly from the text) after I told her that I wasn't breaking out much. When I told her that I'd think about it, she just sent an annoyed bitmoji.

8 months ago I started dating my new boyfriend B. Before me he dated a girl named K for 4 years and she is C R A Z Y. When they gor their apartment together they both signed the lease. We lived in this apartment after she had move dout and played the rent but since she still had a key she came in at all times of the day whenever she wanted whether we were there or not. She came in a total of 24 times the 6 months we lived there that we know of. She stole things, assaulted my boyfriend, locked herself in our room and started screaming on multiple occasions. She messaged and called him almost everyday even she we blocked he run everything she used other people's accounts or created new ones or went through email to contact us. We had enough one day, packed up everything and left because she wouldnt leave us alone. We left the apartment a mess so they wouldnt get their security deposit back (her and her family were the designers and threatened us multiple times about barging in and stealing our things) we told them to keep the apartment and pat for it all. We left them with debt and a huge mess but after all the harassment and stalking we really didnt care. She kept in contact and kept screaming so We got a restraining order signed to cease all contact and basically checked off every box in existance. The judge approved it and we went to serve it. She ran everytime but she did acknowledge its existance 12 days before we gave it to her. There is a 14 day limit to when you can file for an appeal. She had her mom serve us paper work today requesting to appeal the order but it was signed on the 15th day. Does this still count?

He’s given everyone else no reason to not believe him. He lies about growing up where “there were drive bys all the time” near his house, he lied about not being a virgin all throughout high school and claimed he had 12 bodies, he lied about going to the Travis Scott concert recently, he lies about having done acid and he told one of our mutual friends that he was trying to date that he’s a cocaine addict who can’t go a day without a line, he was fucking with this girl behind my back after calling her fat and ugly, then when I called it out to her after she kept asking me for advice on him being two faced to her, she told me he said “i told him i thought you were cute but he told me not to fuck with you so i’ve been hiding it” when he ONLY EVER called her ugly and gross to me. He tried to fuck with my ex girlfriend soon after we broke up, completely denying it to me even tho I had screenshots and top of lying he tried to take music i had shown him and pass it off as him finding it and introducing it to me.

When I turned 15 in January of 2018, the manager realised I was a valuable worker, especially for my age, and promoted me to be a supervisor. I made many friends in this job who I am still extremely close to. I loved my job. 

Late last year however, the company itself was having trouble with their managers as a few left. So, I decided to help out with anything I could. This included doing the rosters, creating displays, covering as many shifts as possible and doing the grocery orders so everything would come on time. Obviously being 15 however, I became stressed doing everything on a small wage with school. My parents and previous managers who used to work there, suggested I moved on and quit so I did. I’d still visit my old job frequently and to this day i’m on friendly terms with the owners and coworkers.

I got a new casual job but I’ve regretted quitting every since. So, I sat down and wrote the pros and cons of going back to my old job. The pros definitely outweighed the cons (money, shift time etc). I discussed this with my parents and close friends who now all agree it’d be a good idea to go back.

This has obviously increased his anxiety to the highest degree. Over the last 48 hours he has increasingly gotten worse, plummeting into a low mood. He is returning to work tomorrow morning (Monday) and I'm hoping this will give him some confidence once he finishes his day.

He has apologised for his mood explaining that he has worked hard in his career that last 10 years and the constant toying by his company that he may no longer have it is playing with his emotions. Which I can understand.  He has explained that he isn't trying to ignore me rather he is used to dealing with things alone rather than with someone else, i.e. in a relationship. 

He has been spending an increasing amount of time with his parents, as he lives alone, explaining he is lonely due to myself having to be at home and he feels like he needs something to do outside of work whilst I cannot be there. 

Effectively I'm looking for advice upon how I can be there when I cannot physically. Any suggestions upon how we can create something for him to do outside of work together, when we cannot be together.",14Jul2019,1
744,"Specific info for my exact situation:
NC
Over 18
Passed drivers ed
Had my permit but it expired

I'm going to the dmv tomorrow after years of things that I don't want to get into the details. I'm prepared to take the written test and I can do the driving, at least enough to pass the test. Any googling I've done for this has resulted in a ton of contradictory answers and I know it varies from state to state. Do I actually have to reapply for a permit since it expired or am I able to just go for my license?

I'm going to preempt the answer I'm expecting, which is ""you should probably just go for your permit."" That doesn't answer this question at all. 

If I get my license I intend to treat it like a permit until I'm ready, but I want to know if I HAVE to go and take the test for the permit again first, then go back and take another written test and a driving test later. Obviously it would be better to get the license and use it as a permit (drive with a  parent or guardian) until I'm ready instead of dealing with everything again later.",14Jul2019,1
745,"My partner and I met online and we just recently made our relationship public. We have never met but he is about to visit me in 5 months time. Earlier, he told me that when people ask me how we met I should tell them that I used to be an exchange student.
He said it hurts him to lie but he has to. He said it’s to avoid the stigma and me being called a mail-order bride. He is kind of well known and I understand that this might be because he has to protect his image. Just wondering though what I should do because I felt a bit sad that he has to lie (although a part of me tries to rationalize the situation and he just doesn’t want people to think of me that way).

Six months later her appointment arrived to see the specialist and still turned up with no answers only more tablets, her gp told her she could go see a neurologist but answers might not show.

752,"My partners (29M) parents are really nice, down to earth people. They're nice to me (26F). But they love their son so much, they pretty much worship the ground he walks on. I feel invisible when hanging out with them. Which is FINE, I really don't need to be any focus of attention. But I do feel it's odd for your S/O family to not make exerted efforts to include you.

Maybe I'm sensitive right now, because his parents came into town unannounced and stayed in our living room (of a 350 sq ft apartment) for 7 days. So it felt really concentrated and compounded. My S/O is really close with his family, and they grew up really poor, I don't think they can afford to stay in a hotel so long. It was just a really cramped space, and given no notice ahead of time, it felt so sprung on me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few small examples:

Excessive complimenting on my S/O. ""Good job driving So-and-So!!"" (1.5 mile drive, that I did one of the ways...) ""Good job making dinner So-and-So!!"" (both my S/O and I made that dinner...) ""Let's go back to So-and-So's place"", ""I really love what you've done with your place, So-and-So"" (I pay rent and live in this place too...)

When I made comments joining in conversation they were brushed aside and disregarded quickly.

After 7 days of this, I got pretty fed up. Does your 29-y/o son really need to be congratulated for breathing and existing at all hours of the day??

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It made me think back to last month when we were visiting my family. My parents asked my S/O umpteenth questions about his life, childhood, job, hobbies, etc. Really strikes me how he's the topic of conversation with MY parents and HIS parents when we're together. I'm not just a supporting character here... I am pursuing an ambitious career, and I have some pretty badass hobbies too.

I don't know where I'm going with this. And I know it sounds pretty minuscule in the grand scheme of problems you could have with a partners family.

&amp;#x200B;

I already spoke with my mom about it, just requesting to her that when we're visiting them to stop gushing on my partner so much. Gush on ME, I'm my parents daughter, I'm the permanent one here. I can't be invisible both to my family + my partners' now that we can be seen as a unit or couple. My parents were being great in being welcoming to my S/O, but I do believe a lot of it can be cultural. My family is pretty sexist in a lot of other way, so I can see how their daughters' partner is so much more interesting to them than their own daughter.

\---- Point being, my mom heard what I said and agreed with me. She's going to take the focus off my S/O so much now when we visit and direct more conversation toward including me.

754,"Hi Reddit,

Recently, I saw this video about the hashtag #proana. Long story short, people who use it want to lose weight and a lot of them even have an eating disorder. 
This video made me think: What would simple words of an internet stranger do? Could I help people Just by talking to them?

I started with someone who posted pictures of too skinny girls on her insta, saying she wanted to be like them. I commented, and she DM'ed me. We had a long conversation and she opened up to me about bullying, her friends and family, etc. 
I gave her advice that I thought would be helpful. 

Now, my question is: Should I be doing this? Am I really helping? How do I know if I don't make things worse? I've tried looking for some advice on how to help someone with anorexia, but it wasn't very succesful. I want to help people, but I do have to know what's going on inside their heads and how I can help. Or do I just need to mind my own business?",14Jul2019,1

I’ve been with another guy but there’s somethint about the first one that keeps me coming back to him.

756,"So my friend and I go to school together, and she has a boyfriend from her hometown. She told me about how she essentially cut all of her guy friends out of her life (and her boyfriend did the same with all his female friends). She also told me about how she stopped hanging out with her other friends when she goes back home to visit, because she would prefer to spend any of her limited free time at home with him instead. I now notice her doing this with my friends and I; if there is any opportunity to hang out with him instead of us, she will take it. This even includes canceling plans or at the very least leaving early so she can meet him. She even skipped my friend's talent show to go see him (and my friend had prepared for months for this and invited us to come way before she made plans with her boyfriend). She defends herself by saying that since she and her boyfriend go to different schools, she doesn't get to see hi as much as he sees us. Which is true, but also a bit of a flawed argument because being near somebody is not equivalent to being friends/hanging out with somebody. 

Most of us are kind of tired of her treating us back-ups for when her boyfriend isn't free. At the same time, I care about her and can see things going really badly for her if a break-up ever occurs (because she won't have any of the people she cut out or the people she consistently ignored to be there for her). I don't know if I should just let her be and keep doing what she's doing, or if I should say something to her. I want her to be aware of how she's making us feel and about how ignoring 90% (if not 100%) of her friendships because of her relationship probably isn't a good thing in the long run. But at the same time, I don't want to come off as pushy or needy or force/guilt her into spending more time with her friends. For now, I'm thinking of just letting her do what she wants, and if she simply doesn't want to hang out with us, that's her decision. But it does make me and the rest of us feel pretty annoyed or even crappy when she's always leaving everything early and consistently treating us as a low priority, and idk if she's aware of that (and if she should be). Has this ever happened to anyone else, and how did you handle it?

TLDR: Friend is treating me and my other friends as low priorities (canceling plans, ditching) because she prefers to hang out with her bf, unsure if we should say something or just let her be",14Jul2019,1
757,"I'm 17, turning 18 in November, and since i was little i was told that the military was my only option after highschool. 6 of my 7 older siblings went in, 3 to the air force, 3 to the navy, and i believed that I was going to enlist like them, since that was what my parents always told me. Up until a few months ago I believed them. 
After a field trip to a university through AFJROTC, taking the SAT, Looking at other colleges, and started taking depression medication, i realized that I don't want to go into the military. My parents were supportive for maybe 2 weeks before shooting my idea down. I gave up for a while and resigned to the idea of enlisting.
 Just before the fourth of July, my oldest sister, who is around 25, came to visit with her husband, both are in the navy, my sister is reserved and getting out soon and her husband has another year. When i joked about joining a certain career in the navy, she told me that she'd rather not have me join the military in general. I was rather excited and agreed. We texed about it later and discussed it a lot. 
She said that if i had to get private loans, she would cosign with me, as she has better credit scores. Ever since my parents decided that they couldn't pay for my college, even though i told them many times that they didn't and wouldn't have to and that I wasn't asking, they've fully decided to push me into the military. My sister, who is also going to college for oceanography, tried to text my mom and that I was upset that i couldn't go to college. This prompted my mom to barge into my room and yell at me about how they couldn't pay for it and that i couldn't go. I stayed quiet and just said okay. Once she left, i texted my sister what happened and cried. My dad then texted my sister to not bring it up with my mom again. We were stuck. For the next week my parents acted like it didn't happen and that i was still going in, but that i should follow the path of my sister, the same one that disagrees with me enlisting, and using her as a ""good"" example.
My sister came to visit again this weekend. Her and her husband took me with them to dinner and we talked about it a lot more. After she received a text from my dad to, ""not bring up college with them again"" We came to the conclusion that my parents think my sister is trying to basically brainwashing me to not join or enlist, and that I'm on their side of this debate. Now that my sister has left, I need to tell them. But how do i tell my parents, mainly my mother, that I'm not joining the military? I know i just need to rip the bandage off and get it done now, but I'm worried on how to deal with my mom freaking out about it. So, any advice?",14Jul2019,6

759,"I have a friend group who voice chat while playing a kind of arena battle game together. Friend A has a very monotone voice and kind of wooden way of speaking which I assume - but don't know - is because English is not his first language. 

Because of this sometimes it is hard to tell when he is serious or joking, or when he is questioning something in spirit of enquiry or being judgemental. Personally I feel confident that he is a nice guy and never intends to be rude because that is my assessment of his character. But others in the group have had misunderstandings and felt offended or exasperated with him. 

They usually deal with this by removing themselves from the voice chat for that particular game without really trying to clear the air with A or help him understand what he did wrong.

 This is very frustrating to witness but I'm not sure what I can do about it, if anything. I don't think I can tell A that he's 'too monotone' without putting it all on him and I think he would absent himself from voicechat to avoid offending anyone ever again ... because he is nice like that. It also feels unfair to go to the others and say 'you shouldnt be offended by this'.

761,"I originally posted this on AITA wondering if it would be wrong to flat out cut her from my life, but there were a few replies on other ways to go about our friendship so I figured I would ask you guys for your opinions.

I was at my tennis club waiting for my  mate to get there one day so we could practice a bit, when he texted me  and said he couldn't make it. No big deal, there is normally someone  there I can have a hit with or at least sit and watch for a bit. No such  luck, the only person there was a 12 year old girl all by herself. This is weird because we don't have any junior teams but I figured why no  ask her for a hit. We got a talking a bit and I found out that she's  newish to our city and her parents just dropped her off there and left,  and she was just going to walk home whenever she wanted. This struck me  as unusual, but I did similar things at that age so it didn't ring too many alarm bells tbh.

Eventually some other guys showed up and I introduced her as the lost child she  was and they joined us for a bit. After a few sets they wanted to go and  practice for real, and I don't have that much stamina so I was looking  to head off. I asked her if she had any friends she could play with  normally and she told she doesn't at school, she was just planning on  coming to the club and seeing who she could find. This is where I  suppose I made a risky judgment call and gave her my phone number and  said to text me if she ever wanted a hit.

Fast forward a few months and I would consider us friends. We go out once a  week for a hit of tennis, she tells me about her life and me about mine.  I made some calls to my junior club and managed to get her signed up as  a fill-in for some teams, and even once got her dinner once because her  parents were off god knows where.

This is the main point of contention. Her parents don't know I exist and  tbh, I don't know that they exist with 100% certainty, I've never seen them nor spoken to them. They are very much absent a lot of the time  (not abusive though, I've done all the phone calls and whatnot) and I  can tell it weighs heavily on her. This makes me extremely uncomfortable  as I am well aware of the implications of hanging out with a 12 year  old girl as a 19-20 dude. At the same time though, I'm her only friend  at the moment. I've done my best to help her make new friends her own  age and with similar interests, and at some point I feel like for both  of us it's best we part ways.

I just want the best for her, she's extremely intelligent and capable and  I do legitimately care for her, and only being friends with a grown ass-dude is not the best thing for her. I just wonder if cutting her off  now would make me an asshole and do more harm than good. I have asked friends and they give me a  mixture of ""what are you waiting for"" and ""how could you even think  about it"". Maybe I should wait until she makes at least one other friend?",14Jul2019,1385
762,"Hi guys!

I'd like to start off that I don't think I am lonely or depressed, I've just found myself not enjoying my solitude as much as I used to. 

While I do have a group of friends I would trust with my life, lately I've been feeling the need to be on my own. Its natural for me, my friends know all too well that I disappear for days or even weeks when I need my time and they understand that. These times for me are usually really fulfilling for me and in my experience, are integral to my individual growth. In the past, I've found myself becoming a kinder and more zen like version of myself.

This time however, it feels different. While I feel less exhausted on my own, being an introvert and all, I find doing what I normally do when I do my solitude time empty and joyless. Things like reading, learning new things, gaming, cooking, going for walks, etc., have all lost the joy I would normally attribute to them. During these times, routine tasks like laundry became a source of joy for me.

Sometimes, I find myself craving human contact, but more than my family and friends. More like a relationship. However, I know I still have some issues to iron out before I leap back into that pool. I still have a lot of trust issues from my last relationship that I haven't quite gotten over yet, but I am making progress.

770,"My mother has been quite upset the past couple of months about the cleanliness of our house. While I would say our house is very clean she likes to maintain a high standard all the time. This means that the house is cleaned more often than a normal house and we have certain rules we have to follow. (Such as shoes are not allowed in doors at all and drinks/plates must have a mat) My brother and his girlfriend don't seem to be able to follow these rules and I don't know whether it's due to them forgetting or just not caring. I find it hard to believe they could forget as the rules are very reasonable and straightforward that a 10 yearold could easily understand. My mother finds it easier to confide in me as we are very close and I can see how annoyed and upset this makes her. I suggested ways to give them an incentive to follow the rules such as if they don't the weekly rent goes up. She is tempted to do that but she says if it doesn't get any better she will tell them to find their own place to live.

My dad is an abusive pos and married a more abusive pos and tormented my two younger brothers until 4B (the fourth son of 5 brothers) moved out and 5B was removed from the home by my mom. Between the time that 4B moved out and 5B moved in with my mom, 4B was living with her while he went to school under the condition that he could live with her rent free so long as he was in school. As events unfolded, he flunked and chose to move out with his then gf. Their relationship broke down and his living condition is untenable. 

Now, he wants out. 

He has a job that pays 9 bucks an hour and works 50 hours a week. But his financial position is worsening. While he had no debt when he moved out, he had a wreck that totalled his car plus two more because he continued to drive said car and it was definitely not a road worthy vehicle. With three wrecks under his belt in 1.5 years, his insurance on his new car is about 350 a month. He expects state farm to cancel him at the end of his time. That sucks because most insurance companies are quoting him at 700 a month! Looks like being a crap driver at 18-19 isnt working out well for him. 

So that means he is looking at paying a thousand bucks a month just for his car while he only makes about 1600 a month. That's a tough cookie to swallow. In the meantime, he is living with his ex gf, her mom, her bf, and one other dude in a tiny house in the worst part of town. 

What he is asking is to come live with me for 3-6 months (I own my own house and live with my fiancee) for free save paying a portion of his food and utilities so he can save money to move out. 

Now, mind you, this isn't something he thought of himself. He was telling me his situation and I mentioned I had a spare room and bathroom. So it's not like hes acting entitled. 

The thing is I'm worried about his safety, I'm worried his other options will lead him down a path of drugs and debt, and I'm afraid he wont be able to pull out of it. I think he sees it too. 

The problem is I cant really see him working out his financial problems in 3-6 months. That insurance is killer. Even if he saves up for a deposit at a good apartment he can afford, his job situation will be unstable even when he is working 2 jobs. So hes asking in good faith, but I'm worried there's no set time line. 

So what do you guys think? I'm in a position to help my brother, my fiancee will likely agree, and it would be pulling him out of the gutter. But at the same time, theres no end date. It could be for a year or more. Idk.

778,"I hit a wall hard the other day. A week after a nice weekend away my girlfriend got scared about committing and kind of ended it. It was abrupt and I'm devastated and in a shocked, confused and painful frame of mind. Don't know what's gona happen. Heart broken is an understatement.

I just wanted to get that off my chest but I wanted to ask you guys, what do you do to cope with things? Doesn't have to involve with relationships, just any little thing you do to be happy when you struggle to think about anything else. I'm down to try anything right now. Thankyou",14Jul2019,5
