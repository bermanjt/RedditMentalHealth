0,"Hiya, I need some help please. I'll just breifly explain. I met someone online last year and we became friends. We spoke/speak nearly everyday and both develop a story together. Gradually over the last 6 or 7 months, he would disappear randomly for lots of time then come back with some poor excuse. Each time I excused it. Then he started behind different. He would tell me to say certain things when he did, to stop calling him, that I had so many chances and to tell him a surprise I had planned or he wouldn't be pleasant during it etc. For most of this, I would get very stressed. Not knowing if he's gonna be there or not, what he'd say. He'd frequently dangle goodbye over my head too. Now granted, I'm not perfect, my insecurities pop up here and there but we worked through them. However I knew this time would come. He told me just recently that he was too busy in his life with work to talk or anything for several months and that maybe we ought to say goodbye or to choose if I want to talk to him or continue the story. He said if I won't choose, he'll follow through on his goodbye. Now here's the thing - I have huge fear of abandonment (from my childhood) so I really find it immensely hard to say goodbye to anyone. I keep getting myself in knots trying to make something work out, thinking back to when we got on so well to now. It feels like such a waste of time and maybe I'm responsible for him pushing me away (he said things that annoyed him about me). I feel so broken. So honestly I don't know what to do, there doesn't seem like a resolution. He said he would talk to me later a day ago so I haven't been able to. It's stupid how much this is getting to me when he doesn't seem to give a damn. It's just hard when I've conditioned myself to talk to him so much about everything. Sorry for the long winded post, thank you all for your time.",02Jun2019,1
1,"So recently my younger brother (13) has been making lots of “jokes” about how great drugs are and how much he loves them. This made me a bit suspicious, and one time, when I was alone in the house, I looked in his room to reassure myself that he couldn’t be doing drugs. (I know that’s wrong to do, but it happened). I found a small plastic bag with white powder inside one of his little wooden puzzle boxes. I don’t know what it is. I do know he likes to make it look like he’s doing some thing that he isn’t to mess with people (once he got red food coloring and pretended to be badly bleeding on the streets, he’s also pretended to be homeless and he begged in the streets for money) so maybe this is one of those times. How do I approach this situation, should I leave it alone? I don’t want to get in trouble for snooping in his room, and I also don’t want to make any false accusations.",02Jun2019,1
2,"So I’m actually asking this for my friend, really, because it’s such a weird issue.  

So my friend, her BF and I all work at the same company.  

Currently we’re all having performance reviews and having conversations with our managers about future development, past struggles/success blah, blah and all that.  

During the BF’s review his manager asked “so who’s the morning person and who’s the one making y’all late?” 

So this struck me as incredibly unprofessional for a few reasons. 

1.) if one of your reports is tardy so much then the performance review shouldn’t be the first time this is coming up. There should already be a paper trail (neither of them have been written up for tardiness)

2.) assuming the reason for said tardiness is because of someone’s romantic relationship 

3) assuming that these employees live together 

The whole thing feels icky and I’m worried for my friend.  Should there be any action taken/can she take action?

3,"As part of the final step in interview process I was sent a skills assessment for a volunteer recruitment position. Despite having a lot of recruitment experience, I have never done sourcing. I've researched a bit and I believe I can answer the other questions (since they aren't about sourcing more making recruitment plan), but I'm not sure how to pick keywords for sourcing. Does anyone have any examples or should I email back and say that I don't have that experience?

So, last night was the worst night I've ever had there, and along with other reasons to push me into this decision, I quit this morning via a phone call.

This is the only place that i can talk about this since i dont know any of you. Sorry in advance for my grammar

 I have this guy in my class whose name we'll call martin. Now martin and I are very close and always have been. He does alot for me, i do alot for him.

So about 3 weeks ago martin started liking a girl in my class and has been hitting pretty hard on her. I've always liked this girl but not thought much of it. Though lately this girl has been more close to me and I've started liking her more. To the point where i have almost fell in love with her.

This is where the problem occurs. I've fallen in love with her and martin doesn't know about this while martin just said that he is deeply in love with her

8,"This sounds really dumb to you guys and maybe its a manifestation of something deeper, but I feel like I can never be happy until I can join the Army. I have a family history of military service and I am very patriotic and want to serve my country and continue the tradition. I am medically barred from joining because I have a history of depression and self-harm and am also on the autism spectrum. Because of my autism, I can't find a job and it's difficult for me to have a social life. I feel like the Army would give me a purpose, make me feel like I am doing something important and a sense of accomplishment, and camaraderie, and adventure. Maybe I'm off somewhere, but I read stories of Medal of Honor recipients and pictures of American soldiers posing with captured enemy flags and think ""I want to do that stuff"" and ""I don't want to read about history. I want to make it."" This probably sounds like a dumb thing to be depressed about, but I actually want to be someone worth a fuck and serve my country instead of being a barely-functioning freak with a cocktail of emotional issues.",02Jun2019,1

12,"I am an adult now but when I was a freshman at 14, I was 6' tall and had a deep voice. I looked like I was 18 at least. I met one older girl because she eavesdropped into my conversations and then laughed loudly at a joke she clearly heard me make then asked me to repeat it to her, then after I talked to her, her and her friend wait after class for me so she can pop out and say boo and smile at me and she got in my face to do so. Then she began laughing at dumb stuff I say to other people, butting into my conversations, responding to me or asking me to repeat stuff to her. She couldn't look me in the eyes and say hi first. At first, her friend girl 2 didn't talk to me and she just pushed me to the first one. While talking to me 1 would get red and make no eye contact, hide her face and didn't stand still. She blushed and smiled when I say hi first. Then her friend asked me to be around them and she was embarrassed and had an attitude but 1 wanted me as close as possible to her and talked to me as much as possible. She scared me after I talked to her and she got my attention. Then she had her friend come and get me for a selfie when she dressed up and wore something showing cleavage. 1 asked for a picture with me when I talked to her and for me to get close to her. She found any way she could to compliment me and approached me with her friend next to her. They both laughed at everything found any excuse to be around me and talk. 2 offered me a ride when it wasn't necessary. Theyd both give me no space smile and make eye contact. Laugh at dumb stuff I said. Theyd get in my face trying to talk to me then follow me around. Find any excuse to be around me and as close as possible. Compliment me a lot. Theyd talk in a tone with me or talk in a higher pitched voice. Theyd giggle and say my name or say ""youve been really innappropriate recently"" when I did something bad. defend me and stick up for me.

13,"This morning, I went down to my job at McDonald’s to get my schedule for next week, only to find out that they have taken me off, and that I no longer work there. 

I have some health issues, a lot of it stemming from my mom being a drug addict when she was pregnant with me. I also become hypoglycemic easily, and some days I become so dizzy and feeling sick that I can’t walk down to work. I can’t afford to go to the doctors either.
 
I will admit however, I’m also a little lazy. Some days I called off of work because I didn’t want to go in or it’s too hot outside to walk there (Arizona). I know that was really stupid to do, as I’ve been warned about it before, both by my Bf and work. Now it’s come to bite me in the Ass and I really regret it. 

This was my third job. My first one I had to leave after 11 months because I got kicked out of my parents house, and moved in with my Bf and his family the next town over. My second one I quit after 4 months because the work atmosphere was stressful, they didn’t follow the hours I was able to work and I didn’t agree with the company forcing us to bother customers about signing up for the stores credit card.

I’ve already applied for several places a few weeks ago, when I checked with them they haven’t looked at any applications yet. I applied for a few other places today within walking/ biking distance.

I want to find something to do in the meantime to make some money to pay for internet, my part of rent, food and electricity, all together being $400 a month. Luckily my Bfs dad is super understanding about the situation, and he’s willing to help on rent. 

I have some artistic ability, and I try to advertise my art and get commissions, but I don’t get them very often. I’m willing to do pretty much anything that doesn’t involve going the next town over. I’ll happily dog sit, clean houses, ect...

20,"I’m on mobile so sorry about possible weird formatting and poor grammar/spelling. Also, I posted this to r/rant already but I would appreciate some advice from here so here we go

So we talked for about a month, he said he liked me, I liked him, so we went on a date (under the understanding that we weren’t going to use labels, and that we were just friends who like each other). Date was awkward but overall nice, and I thought everything was cool. Next day at school he kind of blew me off. He avoided me until after math class when he pulled me aside and told me that he’s not ready for a relationship and that he would really just like to be friends. I said ok. Being friends was enough for me, all I knew is that I liked him and I just wanted to be around him. He ghosted me. I tried to talk to him in class, invited him to sit with me and my friends, texted him, and he ignored my texts, ignored my attempts at conversation, and declined to sit with us. I thought ‘well, ok then. I thought he wanted to be friends but I guess he just wanted to let me down easy. I would have appreciated clarification but hey, if he doesn’t want to talk I’ll respect that.’ So I just went along with him and stopped trying to talk to him. A few months go by, and things settle into a routine.  We ignore each other, and just try to keep our distance from each other. I start to get over him and everything seems to be in the past. Then, about two weeks ago something changed. I don’t know what, but something did. (To give context, I’m a very analytical person. I recognize patterns in behavior and I’m pretty good at telling what people are thinking. Though I tend to overanalyze sometimes.) he started hanging back after class for seemingly no reason while I was packing up and absolutely refused to walk in front of me. I thought I was imagining it, what’s the big deal anyway? So he’s sticking around class more often, that has nothing to do with me. But it kept happening. More context: our math room is in the basement of our school in the robotics lab. It has two exits, one of them leads to a hallway under the garage and up a large flight of stairs into the rest of the science building, the other is the door that leads to  the arts building where my next class is and his next class is in that direction. Sometimes, if I took a while packing up after math, he would act as though he was leaving through the door that led to the hallway under the garage and would double back after I was ready to leave with my friends. When I noticed that, that’s probably what made me think something was off. Our school campus is spread out in about three different buildings, I know what building his last class is in, and it’s a different building then my last class. (Context: sometimes I take a bus home, he takes the train, my bus stop and the train station are in the same direction and he used to leave right when school ended, with me usually a few minutes behind him.) One day I was going to be getting a ride home from my dad, and I was waiting outside the building my last class was in, and talking to my sibling. I see him, inside the building in the lobby just standing there. I know for a fact that his last class is a block away because I used to pass him in between classes (before I switched routes to avoid him) when me and my sibling get in the car I look out the window and sure enough, as soon as I was leaving, so was he. Ok, weird, I’m noticing a pattern, but he could have been there for literally any other reason then me, that doesn’t mean anything. correlation is not causation. Then, this morning I realized I wasn’t imagining it. That it 100% had to do with me. I was walking to school context: I sometimes walk to school, same bus (in a different direction), same train station so we are both coming from, and going in the same general direction towards school, though in the months that I’ve been walking to school I have never seen him once. Today, I was on a late bus (around 7:40 am, I’m usually really early to school) and as I’m walking down the street I see him at an intersection about a block in front of me. I see him, he sees me, and he immediately looks down at his phone. Not out of the ordinary, avoiding eye contact is what we’ve been doing for months. So he crosses the intersection agonizingly slow, and when he gets to the same side of the street at me he just stood off to the side for over 30 seconds until I walked past. What the fuck. It wasn’t even subtle anymore. He just fucking stood there until I walked past, for an uncomfortable amount of time. It was so obvious that he was waiting for me to walk past that I was genuinely weirded out. He waited for me to walk a full block until I was past him. I don’t get it. Honestly, if it was anyone else I wouldn’t care. But he makes me nervous, not because he’s creepy, but because he’s the loud kid in class, the funny one, and he’s smart. If he wanted to socially destroy me, he could without even trying. I would never get in a debate with him because I’d loose. He hasn’t hesitated from being hostile towards other students but he’s never done it to me. He has never said a single unkind word to me (kind of hard when you don’t talk to somebody) but I’ve appreciated not being on his bad side. Being around him is awkward and I get self-conscious and nervous and I don’t know why he keeps doing this. It’s explicate, and now that I’m positive I’m not imaging it, and reflecting on everything I’m so confused. My main question is why? Why is he waiting to walk behind me every single class I have with him? As somebody who prides myself at being able to read people and figuring out what people are thinking I’m at a loss. I wouldn’t care normally but it’s weird, awkward, a bit uncomfortable and now that I’m sure it’s because of me it’s impossible to ignore it. What changed? Why is he not even being subtle? Did I do something? What the fuck is going on? Any advice would be appreciated I’m not sure what to do",02Jun2019,3

24,"Hi! This is my first (and probably only) post on reddit, I plan on using this only as a throwaway account.

I recently just finished 9th grade, and despite my whole year there, I haven’t made a single friend to last to the summer. There’s some stuff that makes it kind of questionable, but I’m worried I was annoying or just cringy.

I’m part of a program at my high school that makes it so my first four classes are with the same people, and the majority of them are boys. I myself am a girl, but I don’t tend to act like the other girls I see them interacting with. I don’t want to make a “I’m not like the other girls” statement, but I feel like I’m louder and a lot more tomboyish then pretty much everyone else. The year started out pretty well, and I managed to get along with two of the guys who definitely don’t seem to have any social issues and get along fine with everyone else in the class, but after our assigned seats changed, they seemed completely uninterested in talking to me. Afterwards, I felt like I had to initiate conversations with everyone to get them to talk to me, but as soon as class was over, they’d leave to hang out with their friends on the other side of the classroom. I’ve kind of given up, but at this point the only time someone actively talks to me is when one kid calls me “bitch” and “dog eater” (I’m half asian) for no real reason as far as I’m concerned. If it’s anything, he’s also a bit out there and really obnoxious, but I still see him talking to other people outside of class.

I have been able to make and keep friends in the past, however, and I still have a very dear one from sixth grade (which I am sure I was annoying back then). The only issue is, she lives across the state after my family moved, the others didn’t seem to want to talk to me anymore. Here, I did manage to make a few friends, but they didn’t seem to be very active in continuing conversations outside of school, and the one who did just started pestering me when I needed to study, so I ended up ending that friendship for the sake of my needs. I didn’t join any clubs (but I plan to next year), so now I’m stuck with one person to talk to (she isn’t bad at all, but I just wish I had more people that I can talk with and actually hang out with on a regular basis).

But now onto personality. Like I said before, I consider myself a loud person. I’m not quite sure if I’m an introvert or an extrovert, as I can have long conversations with a topic that I’m interested in, but I hate (and suck at) small talk and starting conversations in the first place. I try to make jokes, but they tend to fall flat or go unnoticed, so I guess that should stop. I’m also a bit worried that I might be too competitive and arrogant, but also terrible at graciously losing, as I think I might be good at something and then disappoint myself when I’ve overestimated my talents. But that’s general stuff.

I think the one thing I’m really concerned about is my pessimism. I keep it minimal around acquaintances, but with my one remaining friend, the loneliness of living here just kinda spills out. It’s self depreciative for bonus points, and I feel like it’s annoying and just downright cringy. I don’t consider myself depressed, and it’s mainly just about not really having friends or relationships (I’ve never dated or been asked out, whee!), but I feel like I keep repeating myself to where it’s getting annoying, or at least dragging her down too. I feel like (or at least hope) that if I made more friends, it would help build my confidence so I could stop feeling sorry for myself. 

So... am I annoying/cringy? Or just doing something wrong?",02Jun2019,1

Am I obsessed with them for still loving them, wanting to care for them, etc. and not being able to move on from them? Or is this normal?

28,"I am deeply conflicted about this. 

Here's the background. 24 F, have lived with parents my entire life. I am finally graduating college in December. I have gotten the opportunity to move in with a friend in October until May. I'm taking 18 credit hours next semester and am only going to be able to work 1 day a week. This summer I can make about $900 a month so I could make about $2,700 which would cover the months I'm in school. However, by not doing this I would make about $10,000.00 in the same amount of time to save living at home to add to my savings. If I live at home, I'll only make about $3,000 to save. 

Pros: I think it'll help me be more social. I live about 25 min from school and this has really limited my social life and making friends during school. The apartment would be closer. The girl also has a strong circle of friends that I'm acquaintances with but would love to hang out with more, get closer to. We're also both in the same major ad school so I feel we could help each other out more with things. Basically forces me to be more social. I also have a new boyfriend who lives with his parents as well still and while we've made it work, it's a little frustrating being in our mid twenties and having to sneak around to be intimate because his parents won't allow a girl to sleep over while he's living with them. But it's a new relationship so I don't want to base everything on that. Also it would be nice to have a space in general to have people over to. 

Cons: Won't be able to save much money. Money will be pretty tight. 8 month lease. Will not be able to work except for one day 3 months of the lease because of school, so money will have to come from savings.

I can see both sides. Moving would give me life experience and more independence which I barely have at 24. Would allow me to have my own space to bring people over, would be better for my relationship to not have to sneak around to sleep together. Would probably force me to be social, be closer to school, be around more people because she's got way more friends than I do. I get along really well with her and think we could also help each other out with school because we're in the same major. Money would be tight though and I wouldn't have much to save and definitely wouldn't have much extra to spend on non essential things. 

But if I stay with my parents, I'll be able to save nearly $10,000 for after school, have disposable income. But I will have to put much more effort into being social. Will have to keep dealing with not being able to have a space to bring people to. Parents are not strict but even at my age they dislike when I come home late, wouldn't dare allow me to bring a guy home, house is too small to really have people over in general. I suffered from depression for a couple of years and only this year have I felt like I've improved and made steps to be more social, make friends and get into a relationship but I don't know if I should just take the next step and be on my own. I plan on moving out of my city some time next year so I don't know if I need experience first or if savings would be more important.

32,"I’ve been in this friend group since 7th grade. I’m currently going into year two of uni. In sophomore year of high school me and one of the guys in the group had a secret relationship, and to put it short it was abuse in almost every way. He convinced me that my friends would hate me if they found out we were seeing each other so that’s why i never told them during it. He eventually cheated on me and I still never said a word because I still loved him for a good bit after we broke up and didn’t want to start drama. 
About 6 months after the break up, everything that happened during that relationship kicked in. Soon I was having anxiety near him and didn’t want to be associated with him. I started to avoid hang outs and trips with that group if he was going. I almost switched school, got a therapist, wouldn’t walk by his house (fun fact: he lives 4 houses away from me) and decided I wanted to move far away from my town. Still didn’t say anything but honestly they definitely suspected something was wrong. Obviously I slowly stopped going to most hangouts and distanced myself from the whole group because of it. Eventually a few people did find out why this all happened and I’m guessing most of the group knows. 
Here’s the thing. They all still hang out with him and don’t talk to me as much. They literally just ignored it. To make things worse, the first friend I poured my heart to actually dated him after I told her. And then a different friend after that. 
So here is what I’ve been thinking about doing for the last year or two:
1. Just cut them all off and leave them be. No drama and I won’t talk to them again 
2. Tell them my secret and maybe rekindle because I do enjoy spending time with a few and honestly believe a few don’t know what happened 
3. Tell them and still cut them off

Some days I’m ok with them all being a group and all cuz I’ve moved for uni far away and I don’t see them often. But also some days I get so upset because I feel like my friends chose him over me. Which hurts more than anything. So plz help a girl out",02Jun2019,1

Anyways, he told me a long time ago that he deleted them, but he got drunk the other day and actually texted me one of them making a joke about part of it. I got really mad and asked him to delete them and questioned why he still had them. He said he didn’t want to delete them because he would “never see me like that again” now that I’m in a serious relationship and moving in with my boyfriend. I became furious and told him to delete them ASAP and that I didn’t want to be friends with him anymore. He apologized to me but I haven’t responded.

42,"My parents are emotionally distant and I feel as though this has caused a lot of problems for my brothers and me. I am unsure of what caused them to be emotionally distant to us. It may just be the way that they are. I remember the first time I realized my parents treated me differently than other parents. I was around 10 when I started to realize that all my friends were super close to their moms. Whenever they had a problem, their mom would help them through it. Whenever I had a problem, I never learned to ask my parents about it. I wouldn't know what to do so I would just do nothing. For example, in elementary school, I was never taught the importance of learning or why I was in school. My parents never told me anything they just sent me to school. Then I would see my friends' parents asking them ""how was the test today?"" and ""did you do your homework?"" which are things my parents never asked me. They just didn't seem to care.

Because of this, I feel like I have social problems. I avoid creating connections with people. I have learned throughout the years to create some connection, but I have to try very hard because it doesn't come naturally with me. I've always had a very small group of friends because I am not good at making new friends.

I don't talk to my parents much. After taking psychology classes, I think I have an avoidant attachment style. I avoid my parents and while my parents don't necessarily avoid me, they are emotionally absent in my life. It feels as though I have lived my life without my parents even in it because of how little we talk. I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. How can I fix this problem? Has anyone else had this problem with their parents?",02Jun2019,5

52,"I am almost 23 years old and I have never been in a relationship. I have never been on a date, never been kissed, nothing at all. 

I never really got much attention from guys, so I really can't tell if one is just being friendly or is genuinely interested in me. There have been a couple of men in my life that gave me the impression that there was something sparking, only for me to be left wondering if I was right to think they liked me or if I just got too excited over the attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first guy was from school (I was 19) and when we interacted, he was very kind to me. He held doors open for me, pulled out chairs and seemed nervous around me. I would speak to him and he'd turn red and he would offer to help me study. I took these as signs he may be interested.  This all happened sometime before our semester break. A few days into the break, he seemed as though he wasn't interested at all, though he was still very friendly toward me.

&amp;#x200B;

The second guy is from work. My department was doing a contract event and one day, we were the only two in a room at the moment. He initiated small talk and asked if we had met before (we had). He apologized for not remembering me and was really nice to me the entire day. He sat next to me while we worked and tried to lend a helping hand whenever he could. He seemed to really have my back that day and was really nice to me for the rest of the days we worked the event. After we worked the event and went back to our normal jobs, he doesn't really speak to me as much. I get he's a busy man, but I barely get a ""hello."" Not sure what happened here.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I get too happy, I don't know. I'm sick of getting a little bit of hope only to be let down. I'm really beginning to think these incidents were nothing to begin with. I'm trying to adjust to the idea of spending so much time alone, but it hurts and it's hard. So how would I be able to tell if someone is actually interested in me or just being nice?

So any advice on how to start a conversation and to get rid of not speaking until spoken too.",02Jun2019,1
55,"Ok so it all started two years ago. For a long time my family has been friends with another family. They have a set of triplets my age. I have a twin sister. For years, my sister had been friends with crush, they were in a girl scout troup together, and one of the other triplets and I were friends (We have since sort of drifted) and we were in a boy scout troup I have since quit. I was never really friends with crush, but she at least knew I existed and talked to me every now and then.

My sister then develops suicidal thoughts and ends up having to be put in the psych ward for a few months. Not the best time for me. My stupid brain suddenly starts liking crush. I could not begin to fathom why that happened, I don't even think I could name many reasons why I liked her. It was a product of emotional trauma. I get up the courage to ask her to a school dance. Now crush has struggled with anxiety for years, and does not have it within herself to refuse something like that. Deep down I knew it and I knew she did not want to go, but she went. For the preceding two weeks, we like don't talk at all, cause we weren't really friends but my stupid brain is all on top of the world like ""uwu shes my girlfriend"". I was young and stupid. She tells me two weeks later after my sister brings it up again that she never wanted to go to said dance. I did not take it well, I had too much on my plate and I was not, mentally okay. But she was completly justified because I was weird, creepy, and obsessive, and I honestly just laugh at my stupidity back then.

It takes me several months to fully get over her, and I tried REALLY fucking hard, but eventually it worked. I eventually rebuilt a friendship and sort of joined her friend group, and I was so glad that things were back to normal. We're good friends now. Then she comes out as bisexual and starts dating the girl who has been best friends with her for as long as I've known both of them. All in all, it was not a wise descision especially with crush's severe anxiety. They dated for only a little over a month (They refused to tell a lot of people, I didn't even know until like two weeks in, neither of them told their parents or siblings) and barely went on a date. They grew distant, and it was all around a toxic relationship, so crush's girlfriend broke up with her, and she did not take it well at all. She freaked out, could not sleep, had severe panic attacks, barely ate, had the first time she had ever had serious suicidal thoughts, and she skipped school twice (Granted the breakup happened on a friday, she skipped both monday and tuesday)

So I cared about her. An awful lot, and the group of friends we shared did too. Crush and her gf are no longer friends. The rest of the group got her to talk and go to school the other day in a group chat, and I sort of got her to talk and convinced her to work something out at school the next day, because I had to do something right for her once because I had been terrible to her previously and I wanted to look out for her. She never worked anything out, but at least she went to school. Over the next few weeks I checked in with her and as a whole I tried to help her get over her. We were finally friends individually instead of two factors in a larger group. I'm currently helping her get a therapist and she's a lot better right now.

At about this time I found out someone liked me, a girl who I previously thought was a lesbian (and she was very lesbian), I took the bait, I never really liked her, and we didn't really date but I confessed feeling which I thought I had to her, but turns out I was confused, had crippling loneliness, and I only liked her because she liked me. It was really fucking terrible, I said some genuinly fucked up things to her. Turns out I was rebound from her previous girlfriend, she's back to a lesbian and does not like guys at all.

Crush sort of helped me out with the situation and we were really relating because both of us had been through breakups (or sort of breakups in my case) that tour apart a friend group. For the first time I finally felt close and someone I could relate to especially with my anxiety which I have suffered through for a while. We talk all the time, at least texting, at school she might say a thing or two to me but she doesn't really pay attention. I usually start all the conversations, and they last a few hours and they get really in depth and for once I can actually talk to a person.

So my stupid brain says I like her again.

We're both really into theatre, we're in like musicals and plays, and she is one of the only people in my friend group that is doing like a community youth musical over the summer with me (I'm a veteran of the program, it's her first time). I'm planning on making some big moves there, even if it doesn't really work out.

(Side note its High School Musical we're hoping we get Sharpay and Ryan)

I just don't know if there's really a chance, if she rejected me the first time. I always feel like she's been sort of banned, I worked so hard to build a friendship wither her again and I don't want to ruin that. But I really fucking like her. And this time I can actually name countless reasons. I don't think she's rebound from the other girl, I already had someone be that. I know she's bi, and she's actually more girl leaning, but she still likes guys. She has a lot of common interests with me actually. A bunch of our mutual friends have said we'd be cute, I just don't know if it would really work out or how I make my movies, and how I get her to start talking to me first, when I'm kinda the one to initiate all social conversations. The whole reason I'm waiting for the summer thing is because neither of us are emotionally ready for a relationship, but I just want to know how to keep her close for when we both are or if there's even a chance after what happened in the past. Advice?

TLDR: I liked a girl, got rejected, two years later I like her again, what do I do

Edit: So everyone in my friend group are huge marvel fans, we all saw both Infinity War and Endgame as a group. One of my mutual friends convinced me to ask if she wants to go see Far From Home with her, me and the crush, she'll most likely say yes she goes to a lot of things with us as a group, then I can tell her that the mutual friend had something come up a few days before we see it so it just ends up being the two of us. I won't confess anything, it's just to build our friendship before I confess. Is this a good idea?",02Jun2019,1

59,"Hi everyone, Won’t give names in this story but it’s just one I feel I need advice on. And bare with me,only my second post.

My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years. I live with his parents and older brother, in the senior care home we’re starting up. 

We have a “helper” who comes in our home to help with the seniors. She’s 17 and had a very flirtatious relationship with my brother in law. The CEO of the family business. It’s gets a bit much at times and it really makes me uncomfortable. Also to mention I’ve known this girl since she was roughly 13,through HS. 

Lately she’s been casually arguing,nothing crazy,or say things to me and then changing what she says to others.  The other day the family dog,was running around the fenced backyard,and bites when he gets excited. I simply told her “Oh be careful he bites when he gets excited!” She loves the dog,but I was just simply warming her. And she said “Oh okay no problem!” And things carried on. This was last week.

Today when I come home from my retail job,my mother in law tells me about the incident. “Oh our helper said you told her the dog bites. She wasn’t sure if she should be around him” 

I looked at her confused because this incident happened last week. She continues “ I don’t want her spreading that around that he bites. He does not bite. He mouths people and scratches. I don’t want people thinking we have a dog in a care home that bites. But I’m not having a go at you” There was more said but that’s the main part I remember. 

I told my mother in law my part of the story and we talked a bit about it. But I really feel with other things that have happened with this “helper” that I’m being questioned or doubted. 

I just don’t know what to do,or how to be with this helper cause every time I talk to her,I feel like I can’t trust her.",02Jun2019,1

They still talk and hang out and even though I've had several discussions and trust my GF completely, I still feel really insecure and uncomfortable with them hanging out. I've asked her to stop hanging out with him on their own bc it makes me really anxious and uncomfortable and now Frank's gone home for the summer.

61,"I never met someone so amazing until I met her, when we first met eachother we instantly connected and eventually became best friends. She's the most trustworthy person I've ever known. Although i didn't think she would feel the same, I had feelings for her, I always did. We always helped eachother through every thing, including breakups and that. After almost a year now of our amazing friendship, I told her I had feelings for her. I was pretty scared to do so, because I didn't want to ruin anything. But she responded really nicely, told me im silly for thinking that id ruin anything then said I should of told her earlier (because she's talking to someone at the moment), and said something about you never know how the future will turn out and 'I heard best friends can have very good relationships' or something like that. So now, I really don't know what to do. Because she seems pretty happy with the guy she's talking to right now. So at the time being I really don't know what to do, I really feel like she's the one.

This question is not just about how to feel love or connection, instead it is revolving around the issue of how I am able to remove myself from seeking an answer that I cannot ever satisfy myself with.

68,"**Background**: I live with my brother, my sister, and my single Chinese mother (CM). I have a boyfriend (BF) and both of us are 16; We've been best friends for a year and have been dating for 6 months by June 2nd.  I know my BF's parent's (BM, BD) like they're a second family. Both of us play trombone in our high school band. My mom hasn't taken me to my psychiatrist and my therapy appointments in months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Situation:** At 7:20 AM on Thursday, May 29, I had missed my psychiatrist appointment, once again, because my CM didn't want to go.  I told my BF this because I no longer have a therapist to go to, and he freaked it. BF texted my CM saying he didn't like the way she was treating her children. I was very upset at him and when he texted me this I was still in bed. I had to somehow rush out of my house within 5 minutes because if I don't leave, CM is going to burst into my room and emotionally / mentally destroy me.  

&amp;#x200B;

The texts that were sent go along the lines of 

BF: ""You really suck as a mother you know, your daughter is suffering and drowning in tears""

CM: ""You fucking bitch! I'm going to slap the shit out of you and call the cops after if I ever see you again!""

Obviously, there's more to that, but that's just the TLDR.

Some extra background for the curious: My ex told CM worse things when I almost died during a marching band performance and my mom wouldn't come by and help me. However my ex also took her to the hospital when she wanted to get a boob job done, so she saw him as an asset for her personal gains. She doesn't see BF as an asset for herself so she's probably taking extreme measures to make sure he doesn't get near her.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day, I'm at BF's place with his parents getting ready to perform at our concert. At around 5:30 while I'm talking to BM, a knock is heard at the front of the house. Fearful that it's my mom, I stay out of sight of the door.

 It turns out to be the fucking cops.

BM and BD tell me that my mom has put a trespassing warning on BF saying that if he steps in my house, or around my house, he can get in legal trouble for it. Now I found this absolutely insane. My mom almost put a restraining order on a 16-year-old boy who told her something (that he shouldn't have) that my mom didn't like. I'm not saying the way my mom is feeling is unjustified, hell I would be furious if a child told me that, hell I AM furious that my boyfriend did that. I do not agree with the way CM is reacting to this entire situation, however. It's over the top and out-of-line. Think about it: A boy gave you an opinion on how to parent. How do you react? Obviously angry, flustered, and shocked. But would you go as far as to forbid them to ever see his friend? Girlfriend? Or even step foot on your property? Just because a 16-year-old decided it was a good idea to tell an adult his opinion?

&amp;#x200B;

During the concert, while I was performing, my mom is blowing up my phone about how I'm basically the worst daughter in the existence of daughters, and how everything wrong with her life is my fault; This is usual, don't worry about it. The only troubling part of it was, my BF had my phone and had full capability of texting her back, however, I told him if he ever spoke to my mom again I'd have to break up with him. So like someone who respects their girlfriend, he did exactly that. BF kept going on and on about trying to file lawsuits and put CM in jail for slander and emotional abuse, but I don't think what she's doing is slander, and I don't know if you can sue for emotional abuse. If my mom is put into jail, or I am taken away from her, I have to move back to Savannah, Georgia, with my physically abusive and emotionally abusive father who spoils his children so they forget the pain. I can't go back there. I have like, Nam flashbacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking at different types of laws for 3 years, and I know that in my state, when I am 17, I am legally allowed to move out or be out as late as I want with my mother calling the police. The issue with this is that my 17th birthday is 7 months away. I don't want to spend the next 7 months of my relationship being technically illegal. I also don't want to break up with my boyfriend because we are insanely happy with each other, well, until my mom decided to become the fucking government.

72,"She’s unnaturally skinny, pale, and her cheeks are hollow. She’s too thin and looks emaciated. She acts healthy, however. She can give full 90 minute lectures, she’s really smart and has sharp focus too. My uni gives her so much work to do and she gets it done and delivers it in the best quality possible. So idk if she actually has an eating disorder but she’s too thin to be healthy and she’s been getting thinner and thinner every year (I’m a senior now). 

I love her, she’s an amazing person with a big heart, and I’m worried for her health. Should I talk to her about it? I used to starve myself so I can relate to eating disorders a bit but idk.

My previous job was at a call centre, I was the supervisor. It was pretty easy going  however I was getting sick of it and something told me I needed to quit. 

I got a job somewhere new, with less pay but can benefit me for my career choice in the future.

Up until last week I thought I made the right choice and was certain of it.  However, now I can’t sleep, I feel like I regret my decision and I can assure you they will not accept me back as my position was immediately filled.

Thanks...",02Jun2019,1
75,"Part of me feels bad just typing that, wow. 

So, there's a story behind this for context. I've only been friends with my best friend (BF) for the school year, so about 7-8 months, but I've become closer to her than almost any other friend, both past and present. I also lost a lot of friends this year (by choice, but that's another story), so I value our friendship even more. 

So, BF has been dating this guy (BFBF) for over a year, and they're doing great. They're a very open, functional couple, and I love them both. I've also become pretty good friends with BFBF over the year, even though I don't see him much because he goes to college about an hour away, and he's just a really great guy. 

We have the running joke between the three of us that they're my 'parents'. They're both a bit older than me, at least by our current standards (BF will be a college freshman next year and BFBF a college sophomore, while I'll be a highschool sophomore), so it works. We all actively participate in it, and it's just something fun we do, nothing weird or serious. 

Anyways, getting to the point, BFBF has a younger brother (who I'm tempted to call BFBFB, but I'll just call B). He's only a year older than me, and, over the year while we've been talking, I've realized my feelings for him. It took me a while to realize, because I spent most of this year figuring out I was in a bad relationship. He's been in a similar situation, actually, but it took him longer to figure it out. 

He's a really funny, supportive, caring guy, and I really like him, but I'm worried if I pursue this anything between B and me it will negatively affecting my relationship with BF and BFBF. I know that it would definitely change our relationship, but I don't know how. BF knows at least that I think I have feelings for B (I told her I liked someone, and she figured it out by asking questions, but this was a few weeks ago, when I still wasn't sure), and she seems supportive. She told me the fact that I was similar to her and he was similar to BFBF meant it would probably work. 

But here's the other thing. No matter what I decide, I can't act on anything until next school year. I mentioned earlier how B figured out he was in a bad relationship: well, their relationship only ended about a month ago. He doesn't seem to be upset about it at all, in fact, he seems much better. I've literally heard him say ""not my problem anymore"" when his ex has gotten upset. But still, it wouldn't feel right being so soon. And I know there are people that move on sooner then that, but I'm not one of them, and I don't want to force him to be if he's not. 

But yeah, I'm all kinds of confused right now. Sorry for what feels like a long l post. I guess I'm just looking for any kind of advise right now. I don't exactly have anyone to talk to about this in real life: I feel a bit weird asking BF and the other people I could ask I'd be worried about them spreading it around. 

Basically: I'm in love with my best friend's boyfriend's brother, and I really want to start a relationship, but I don't want to to negatively affect my relationship with them, it's to soon after his last relationship, and I'm just overall confused.",02Jun2019,1

I really don’t want to leave her but I want to be able to play with my friends or just someone consistently like I used to be able to do.
I’ve been playing video games with her for months because I told her about how I felt with having no friends but she just doesn’t understand that it isn’t the same as playing with a friend that can actually get places with you in games.
I just really don’t know what to do anymore and I really don’t want to leave her because she has definitely helped me through depression and she does keep me happy but this is starting to really be a problem to me and I just want my friends back but I’m afraid it’s too late.",02Jun2019,1
79,"Will exclude any identifying details for anonymity.

A fellow employee is living in the break room at my job. He is between living situations and will not be able to move into his new place for a few weeks. He is strapped for cash, and so just decided to live in the break room under the noses of our bosses. Honestly I am not going to bat an eye at spending a night or two when you need it; but weeks?  
The situation is extremely uncomfortable. This employee doesn't take care of himself; he is an alcoholic, and that coupled with his poor hygiene creates a very disgusting odor that has already filled the break room. He has been on a downward slope for quite a long time now and despite help offered, doesn't appear to wish to change in the slightest and just spends his time complaining that he's lonely, tired, or poor (keep in mind he spends all his money on alcohol). His habits have leaked out of his life and are starting to affect everyone around him. Clearly they are now affecting every single employee except the managers, who don't use the break room. 

He has the option of actually paying for a room at a very low rate, but claims that it is still too much money.

No one is sure what to do and we are all very uncomfortable with this. No one is willing to approach him about it, nor is anyone comfortable ""tattling,"" for lack of a better word.

While doing that they smoke quite a few cigarettes and instead of putting them in the little stone bowls where they are supposed to go they like to chuck them over the side of the railing and just flick them away.

Normally I wouldn't be shy noting my objection of this but my boyfriend has become repeatedly frustrated with me asking him to not throw them out the car window and I've become a bit self conscious about asking (I still try to get him to dispose of them properly).

If you wanna smoke, go for it, but I think it's a disgusting habit to just throw it out into nature and litter like that. And it happens every goddamn night. I don't want to be an asshole and I don't want people to dismiss me so I'm not sure how to bring this up in a polite way.

85,"Every time a close friend or family member breaks down, I try to comforting them but I always feel like I'm doing a shitty job. It's like I am emotionally out of sync with what they want to hear, whether that be wise words of counsel or sympathetic agreeing or what have you. 

For example, my roommate has been struggling with her grades and given it's finals week, she has to pass all her classes to avoid being put on academic probation. Last night I found her bawling in our room with the stress of upcoming deadlines so I tried comforting her. I listened to her and everything but when it came time for me to say something uplifting I said something like, ""Listen, everyone struggles with something you know? It's not just you."" She then got upset that I was diminishing the severity of her problem. Granted, academic probation is a serious thing and I didn't mean to downgrade her issue. I was just trying to point out the fact that there are other people in the same boat with other severe issues. I find it comforting to know 'it's not just me' whenever I am going through a hard time, but obviously this wasn't something she wanted to hear. 

To those who say it's not my place to speak, I get it. I always listen to everything my friends/family members have to say when they come to me with their problems and never interrupt them. It's just in that natural moment when they've stopped panicking or crying as hard, when there is a brief window of silence, where it would be useful to say something to calm them or reassure them, that I have trouble putting into words what I hope would be help them.

87,"To preface my situation, my mom has cancer so I am not thrilled about leaving home as my dad and brother are very unhelpful and rude to her especially when it comes to her various ailments and negative feelings about her illness. They do not help her do any housework and in fact are quite disgusting and cannot even manage to throw their own garbage away. I am not happy that I have to leave her with them and I will not have a car that I can use to visit on weekends. In addition I often feel lonely, depressed and that I have a hard time making friends, or otherwise fear that I will not make any. All this coupled with the fact that I had an extremely stressful night listening to the three of them fighting and getting less than three hours of sleep made the start of my day very rough. I woke up at 5 AM and drove 2.5 hours to get to campus as well.

I ended up breaking down crying at lunch which actually made me feel better. After this I was introduced to some people in my orientation group and learning community who seemed to be friendly and take an interest in me. I made sure to be friendly and nice to them although I don't think I overdid it and I definitely made an effort to converse with them rather than waiting for them to make an effort. It went well enough and I thought maybe I had made some friends, I made an effort to stay with the group and continue with friendly conversation for the rest of the academic activity segment of orientation. 

However, when it came to social activities (a dance party with DJ booth and various food stands, pool tables and etc) the group totally abandoned me. When I could find a familiar face they walked away from me as quickly as possible. I milled around for around 45 mins and as it seemed nobody wanted me there, I ended up going back to my dorm room and I am now alone writing this post. I really thought that I had been successful at making friends but apparently this was not so. What am I doing wrong? Am I inadequate?",02Jun2019,1

He’s tried to fist fight me in the past and they are both very toxic. My mom even tried to kill my sister at one point. I’ve asked my mom if she ever regret beating us as terribly as she did when we were kids and she said no. 

    My therapist said there is no way I can have a relationship with my parents after I went into detail about them. And no they aren’t rational people so sitting down and talking to them isn’t an option as I’ve tried that before and it ends with “if I yell louder than you I’m right”

     But I feel an obligation to stay in the family. My therapist and everyone of my friends said I shouldn’t talk to them anymore after I move out but I would feel guilty if I didn’t. I feel like I have to take care of them and if they texted me something like “ I can’t believe you’ve left us” it would destroy me. No matter how many times my parents beat me and berated me and bullied me, I feel like I have to love them. That I can’t leave. That I will feel an insane amount of guilt if I do. I’m stuck in denial that one day we can have a family but everyone again has said it’s not possible.

So I started a job at this new restaurant. I’m a 20 year old male, so I’m still learning to grow and develop my skills as everyone should; socially and professionally. I’ve always been a little socially awkward, but I despise this aspect of my personality so I’m trying hard as fuck to change it. I want to be sociable, confident and not be seen as “that awkward young dude.” I’m also not a complete beta, I’m good looking and attract girls, but I feel as if my beta ass personality completely turns off any girls that I could potentially date. 

That being said, there’s a bartender at my job who’s the definition of alpha. Powerful, confident aura. Attractive face. Muscular and shredded as phuk. Smooth with girls, always knows what to say, and earlier today had a large group of cheerleaders take pictures with him while he flexes and they rub on his body. I mean this dude is literally the epitome of alpha. I should also probably mention that he’s only 25. 

Don’t get me wrong, he’s the type of guy that someone would look at and consider a douchebag, but he’s also cool as hell. Nice to others, always calm no matter the situation and overall he seems like he just knows his place in life. Everyone fucking loves this guy and can’t get enough, coworkers and customers alike. 

I know that you shouldn’t compare yourself to anybody, and that it’s a recipe for disaster, but it’s so hard not to look at this guy and wonder what he has that I don’t. He’s only 5 years older than me, so she probably isn’t much of a factor. He’s mentioned to me that he takes steroids so that could be a small factor, given how big he is. How am I supposed to look at how fucking charming and physically attractive he is, how girls are all over him and not be a little bit jealous? 

I know that saying all of this makes me sound beta as shit, and that’s exactly how I feel right now. I was actually starting to feel pretty good about myself for the first time in a long time, and then this dude comes along and crushes my self confidence. I guess the only thing for me to do is to continue improving myself in every area of my life, continue nofap and abstain from alcohol and drugs since those things significantly lower your testosterone. I realize that I’m still young and I have a lot of time to improve, but I just can’t continue being this skinny, awkward piece of shit that people love to step on. I feel like it’s a vicious cycle at this point.

Him: Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation.

Her: So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

Him: I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth

97,"So I’m 25, and long story short my mom and stepdad have been together since I was about 7. They have almost never had a healthy relationship so really this is not a surprise as it’s been a long time coming, and something they should have done sooner to be honest. They are both to blame for it, but my stepdad has frequently verbally, emotionally, and sometimes physically abused my mom throughout the years and has lied numerous times. The last straw was a couple days ago when my mom caught him and his parents talking horribly about her on the porch, which the Ring doorbell recorder caught on video. 

Me and my stepdad used to be very close up until a few years ago our relationship started to go downhill due to how he treats my mom, and sometimes me. Despite all of that, I do love him and he has always been my father figure since I basically have no relationship with my real dad. I am very close to my stepbrother, and just thinking about not spending holidays together or hanging out with him hurts. I have a 5 year old daughter and my stepdad is honestly a really good papa to her and they really love each other a lot. It breaks my heart that she will not see him almost everyday like she’s used to. This is going to be very hard on my 11 year old brother (from my mom and stepdad) as well. 

Of course I am open to my stepdad seeing my daughter and me still, and I won’t cut him off of course, but it just won’t be the same and my heart is really hurting right now for everyone and I just really need advice.",02Jun2019,1
98,"So me and this guy used to have a bit of a FWB thing going on. Eventually we both admitted we had crushes, but that we weren't compatible to date, so we took a bit of space and went back to being just friends.

Now however he has gotten super annoying. He will comment about the female friends he sees on my social media, asking if they're single, and asking for their profiles so he has ""fap"" material. He will point out girls he finds hot on the side of the street.

It's gross, I tell him I don't want to hear it, but he doesn't seem to care. 

Is this just what being friends with a guy is really like? Lol.",02Jun2019,1
99,"I just finished my first year of college. I’m 18 and I don’t have any prior work experience so I was looking for an easy summer job to pass time and make some money. I applied to be a cashier at a grocery store, but when they called to schedule an interview they told me the only position available would be in the deli. I said that was fine and agreed to go on the interview which is in a few days. People say that if you get the interview there, you basically got hired. But I’m kind of nervous because I imagine the deli could be pretty dangerous with all the slicing meats and cheeses, cooking, etc. Also, all of the employees at the deli are elderly women and it would be weird not having any coworkers my age. On the phone I was also told that I’d have a lot of hours (like 30 a week) and I don’t want to work that much at something I probably won’t like. However, I’m pretty desperate for a summer job. I’m basically broke and don’t want to be broke during the school year. I applied at a ton of other places but haven’t heard anything back. Should I still take the job or not?",02Jun2019,1

If I do anything like my father or sound like my father she gets pissed with me and will ruin my night. If I don't do something she says immediately I get yelled at for it.

108,"This is my first time posting on Reddit so please be gentle. I have very low self esteem that only comes out when I’m in a serious relationship. I’m perfectly fine and content with myself when I’m single. However, every time I get into a serious relationship, all these negative feelings and thoughts burst out and make me miserable/extremely depressed. I’m currently in a long-term relationship with a very kind, sweet, amazing man (35M). He makes it so easy for me to trust him but I just can’t bring myself to fully trust him. Sometimes it gets so bad that I become extremely upset whenever we are hanging out with another woman (even if it’s a mutual friend who I love and trust). In the end, I am always left feeling miserable and worthless. My usual thoughts are that he’d much rather be with them than me or that I’m the last option. I avoid watching movies and tv shows together because I always feel like I’m not as good as all of the beautiful people on screen. However I would never pick a fight because of these feelings. I know he has never done anything to make me feel this way.  It’s not his fault. I have no idea why I am this way and only when I’m in a relationship. I just know that I really need to find a way to resolve these issues. I know that what I’m feeling is very childish and immature and I honestly wish I could make it all go away.

I don't have a job and my parents are obsessed with education. They want me to go to university and they have pride and prejudice. My parents don't have a good relationship.

111,"So my friends want to take a trip to the beach, however the only problem is, I do not feel safe with the people who would be driving, driving me. 

One of the friends always complains about his eyesight and back issues, is quick to anger and I do not think those are good traits for a safe driver, especially for trips in Los Angeles traffic. He tries to make it better because he will be using his moms van which has seat warmers, comfy seats and full insurance coverage, but the way I see it is that although the car might be nice, and insurance is good, it wont matter if I die. I am just not comfortable with his driving skills.

The other person has only had their license for 3 months and only been driving for 6, so there is no way I would go with them anyways.

114,"I'm an older sister of two and a younger sister to an adult half sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

My little brother who is only in sixth grade (soon to be in seventh) is overly aggressive. I know that this is common for a boy his age, trust me. But he just seems over the top. He's not aware of manners and is wanting to drag any dispute into a fist fight. He's still a lot bigger than me, standing about 5'6 at the age of 12. He likes punching me and throwing things at me such as shoes or even baseballs. He's out of control and I don't know what to do. I want to be there for him since Danny (our father) was never a figure too look up too and our mother doesn't want to deal with my brothers outburst. Our 21 year old sister comes over every once in a while but not everyday due to college. The other two and I greatly look up to her! My older sister seems to be the only one who can somewhat put my brother in place, but not all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that's been scaring me is the fact my brother is harming himself. He's taken a stapler and stapled lightly punched staples into his arm. He kept playing with our mom's lighters while in the car, scaring our little sister half to death. I told him to stop but he just yelled at me. I reached for the lighter and all he did was twist my arm and used to lighter to burn my skin a bit. He's also taken an eraser and rubbed it on the back of his hand (I'm sure he only did this because it was a trend at some point in his school). I don't think he's depressed or upset. I think it's the fact he doesn't really *care* all that much anymore? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my brother have set an awful example to our little sister. Along with our parents. My little sister is awfully spoiled and she doesn't understand when we tell her no. We've told her to behave but all she says is, ""I get it from you guys!"" We've told her time and time again that now she knows it's not the right thing to do, but she continues. She whines about everything and cries. But I'm guessing that's a normal thing for a nine year old?

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know how to handle such things. My mother ask me for money all the time to help pay for ""bills"", but she just ends up using that money for hair appointments. I don't get allowance but if I do it'll be about 5 dollars every two or three months. I'm just running low on money all the time. I'm trying to gain enough money for items to help my siblings personal hygiene and some extra drinks for all of our sport games. I'm not old enough to get a job yet. I can't wait to get one, I believe in being paid for doing hard honest work.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are cool, don't get me wrong. They help us get from point A to point B. They also care about our well being. Our parents just got married in 2017 even if they're our biological parents (except Danny isn't my oldest sister's father). They've just had a very.. *rocky* relationship to say the least. That's a story for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

After it all, all I'm wanting to know is how to stabilize everything. How can I help my siblings become a better version of themselves and how can I let them live a balanced life? I just want the best for them and I want to be there when they need it. Anything is welcomed, thank you ((:",02Jun2019,1

121,"Hello, I'm not really sure what I'm doing. I'm not really sure what went wrong. 

My girlfriend of the last 3 years said she didn't love me anymore yesterday. It was by far the most painful thing that has ever happened to me. 
Not just because she's leaving me but her son who I've been the step father of for 3 years will be gone from my life aswell. 

My now Ex-fiacee had an abusive previous relationship which resulted in her having a child. But I treated him like my own son and I loved him very much. In the last 6 months I've been worried about my girlfriend's mental state, she believed she was the victim of something called ""gang stalking"" where she believed she had a team of people following her and spraying gasses at her, For some government experiment. In our first house together she believed the neighbours were spying on her and ""pumping gasses"" trough the wall. 

I never saw any evidence of any of this. We moved house anyway. In the new house she immediately started to think the same thing was happening again. 

About 2 months ago she attempted to meet a stranger of off a ""gang stalking"" conspiracy chat room. Upon learning this I talked her out of it as it seemed very dangerous to just go meet some conspiracy theorists of off the internet.

After consulting with a professional I decided to take her to a doctor as I believe she was mentally ill. She agreed to see a professional after alot of convincing. The doctor diagnosed her with anxiety/depression and prescribed anti-depressants, but also recommend we speak to a therapist. 

She asked me to attend the therapy session with her, which I did. I'm not sure how the therapist helped her as she seemed closed off from me in the few days that followed. 

4 days later out of seemingly nowhere yesterday she told me it was all over and that she didn't love me anymore. 

Naturally this hurt me alot. Not just because she's leaving me but our son will be leaving me aswell. I know he's not mine biologically but I loved him more than anything. 

About a month ago she asked me to have another child with her, I said no. But only because it wasn't financially viable and our new house was too small. I think this hurt her, but she claims not to remember asking me now.

I'm worried about what will happen to her and her son. I don't know if I'm being selfish or what? Because I know I'm not a perfect human being but I only did what I thought was best.

I regret not socializing more in high school. I wasn't a quite/shy kid by any means. I did a sport in the fall, winter, and spring time. I was part of a dance studio and music studio. I work a job on the weekends as well. 

I mean I got along with everyone in my high school but never really had a group of close friends I guess. The friends I hung the most with during school were the smart kids (I spent my Junior and Senior year in a computer lab taking online college classes). However after school got over I went to sports practice where I spent time with my teammates. I always felt accepted anywhere I went but never like sticking to one group. The same went with my dance lessons. I'd always have people I would stretched with, practice, and cool down with. Yet I'd never hangout with anyone after. 

I was social but not as social as I probably could have been. I think my problem was that I was too nice (I also have a dry sense of humor and most people don't get my jokes). I was also always really busy working to pay for everything thing I was in.

I guess I am wonder if there is anyone else who understands this. Always being around people but never really feel like your super close to anyone. I never really felt like I've had a best friend.",02Jun2019,1
124,"I am an adult (22 years old) woman and I don't know who else to ask or how to ask.

Is my mother toxic or am I a brat?

There have been good times and there have been bad times and I don't know how to sort any of it.

Growing up, my mother was rough on me and my siblings. She's dragged me down the stairs by my hair, she's slapped me, pushed me, pulled my hair and publically humiliated me. Then she would follow it up with hugs and jokes and pretend that everything is fine moments later. Then when I don't lighten up she'll ask why I'm so upset. ""You have nothing to be upset about, everything is fine.""

When I got in middle school, it went from physical to verbal.  She called me, ""princess dragon breath,"" and would tell me about how ""knights would rather spear themselves than kiss you."" She made fun of my acne- mainly because the sight of acne disgusted her. She would follow me around and try to pop whiteheads on my face despite me saying, ""no,"" and ""please don't touch me."" 

Her response was always the same: ""Don't you say no to me, *I am your mother!""* 

But when she talked about me with my teachers or my older relatives she would give me high praises.""

""Blank is such a good girl! She's so kind-hearted! You know, she goes to church EVERY Sunday!""

""Blank and I are very close, we're very good friends and support each other. I'm so lucky to have such a good daughter!""

""Blank is so talented and very smart! I swear, the girl goes through 3 books a week!""

When we were home she would never say these things, unless we had company over. Other than that, Mom made fun of how I dressed. How I would wear my hair. My weight. How I would never get my nose out of a book. It was always about what I was doing wrong. That I had no common sense and that I woke up in a new world every day. But she would never say these things to my face. She wouldn't even say my name. My mother would just say ""She"" or ""her"" instead and give me a pointed glare/look.

But when I was bullied, she would be the first one in the principle's office to make a complaint. She would even go to the superintendent's office.

Then came high school. She and my dad would fight and she would take it out on me. Same name calling. Same jokes. Then brush it off and say it never happened. But now she was complaining about me to other people, then those people were approaching me about my behavior.

One time, she got mad at my dad and trashed the entire upstairs of our house. She threw everything down the stairs, and I mean EVERYTHING. It was so bad that I couldn't even see the steps. All of it was mounded over, you couldn't climb up the stairs even if you wanted to. 

I woke up to it. I had no idea what had happened, why it had happened or what was going on. Being as I didn't want to make anyone upset, I left it alone and waited for my parents to wake up and tell me what to do. Apparently, this was the wrong thing to do. I didn't know she wanted me to clean it up. My mom followed me around the house, screaming and yelling about how lazy I was and that I didn't do anything ever. Even as I was cleaning up *her mess* she was still yelling at me. Eventually, she got on her computer, played computer games and left me alone.

When I finished cleaning I got on facebook and had a VERY LONG message from my friend's mom about how I needed to stop being so self-centered and actually help my mom around the house.

But she would help me when I needed it and always get me supplies for projects.

Now I'm in college and everything is weird. She'll do nice things and then demand something in return- she told me I was stupid if I thought that she should do things for me for free. 

My phone was stolen so she bought me a new one and even offered to pay for it herself. Then she told me that I am now required to call her and tell her where I am. Who I am hanging out with and what time I plan on going home that night. I'm 22. 

She's also taken to telling people that she's paying for my college when she isn't, she doesn't even help me with my FAFSA. She also tells everyone that I go out and party all night. Her neighbors have approached me about, “concerning behavior” and that “I’m not being safe.” I was not going out all night and partying. Hell, I wasn’t even out all night. I was doing street ministry with a group of twenty people who walked me home. I was safe.

She's given me money to help me out with a financial situation being as I'm in between jobs right now and she's helping me get my license (she refused to do it when I was in high school) (my dad has tunnel vision so he can't teach me) but followed up with telling me old me that I am no longer allowed to correct her, no matter what (unless it's on spelling). And if she tells me to come home or that she wants to spend time with me, that I have to do it and it has to be a week-long visit, even if it is during the school year and despite me being a full-time student.

But what she's doing is kind and more than what a lot of my friend's parents do for them. 

Am I being bratty or unappreciative?",02Jun2019,1
125,"Alright, I know this just sounds kind of dumb straight off the bat.

But there's this game that I've been playing for a long time now, it's like one of those Farmville, collect and wait kind of games, it's called *Monster Legends* specifically. And it's changed since I started, basically becoming more like all those games become, tedious and pay-to-play oriented.

The thing is, I'm pretty decent leveled in that game, so people I talk to on there (albeit fairly rarely), appreciate having me around.

During that time, we discovered she had cancer. For the last two and a half years since I moved out, she has had more surgeries, more chemo and just kept getting worse. 

Sarah has some family in our city, but the rest of them live a few hours away. 

I want to be there for her but I can't understand or begin to imagine how hard this will be for her. 

Today I brought her some food, her favorite drink from Sbucks and dropped them off. 

Several family members that are in town now staying with her are leaving in a few days. 

I have offered her to stay with me if she doesn't want to be alone, or I could stay at her house. She also needs to move from her apartment she shared with her mom and that will include packing all of her stuff up. 

If you have a parent that has passed, what would have helped you or comforted you? 

I know she will need love and time but I don't know anyone at my age whose parents have passed yet and I would love to hear from anyone who may have had a similar experience. 

Thank you!!!",02Jun2019,1

She also goes to bed very early around 9:30.  She soon asked that my cat be kenneled at night, I have never done this before. In reality he isn’t very disruptive, just a loud walker, plays with his toys. Now, every night, she asks he be put away when she turns in, also dictating when he is allowed out.  So say she turns in at 9:30, she’ll get up at 10:00 or 9:00 the next morning.

At first I thought this might be for only a week or two but I’m starting to see she thinks this is a permanent situation. I don’t think it’s very fair to kennel him for 8- 12 hours. I’m scared that confined him continually for 6 months may effect his health. How should I approach this situation?

I drifted away from my hometown friends due to schooling, drifted away from my college friends due to graduate school, and made no friends there because of the work load. 

I’m currently alone at my apartment as my high school best friend got married today with my other friends as groomsmen, with no invite. My college friends are at a bachelor party in Nashville drinking as I type this with no invite or knowledge of him being married soon. And my relationship is going south due to opposite interests that were hidden during the talking stages. 

I’m no means social awkward, rude, or a poor friend. I always reach out when one is in need and I make sure I’m there when they need someone. But for some reason I am always the last person to be invited to things and typically left out of events. I have attempted on many occasions to be apart of my “friend” groups through self created events but have no luck.

With that I also started going to the gym and its been doing me great until I fall into slippery slopes and stop going for 5 months at a time (this time because of injurying my wrist which has now fully recovered). Then I started doing Tae Kwon Do to put my muscle to use and learn to move it around but that started getting far to expensive and i regretably needed to quit.

Getting to comfortable and being stuck at level 1 because I have no educational background and 30k a year wont be enough once I finally move out from my parents home and then i'll be stuck making ends meet again hating my job again and bary scraping by yet again.

148,"So I’m a 19 year old girl, and my ex is 18, just graduated high school. We dated a little under a year ago and were very happy, but I had to break up with her because my parents are very religious and I felt like I had to choose between her and my family, and family ALWAYS comes first for me. However... today was her graduation party, and I spent basically the entire day at her house because she lives right across the street from me. And damn if I didn’t feel so at home whenever she hugged me, looked at me, paid any attention to me. At one point when I’d gone home to grab something and then came right back, I came up behind her and wrapped my arms around her, and she just leaned into it and held my arms. There were several other instances like this, like when she pulled up a chair right behind me so I was sitting with my back to her between her legs, or at one point when we were sitting on the couch and I had my head on her shoulder. It was just so comfortable, and she did tell me recently that she still has feelings for me, so I think my feelings for her are coming back because of that. I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to see if she’d be interested in a friends with benefits situation so I can still be close to her without having a romantic attachment, but I’m not sure my heart could HANDLE being close to her and not having a romantic attachment.

I'm currently living at my parents saving money after a failed attempt of making a go of it by myself. I had always thought as long as I have time to do me when I got home id be cool with doing anything, after working truss plant and warehouse jobs while I was on my own i realized that wasn't the case. Right now I'm working the fast food job I had when I was in highschool getting some money saved up for when my gf and I move back out, and I need to have some kind of career plan before then, will I go back to school? If so for what? Nothing really seems appealing to me and I dread the idea of being some nine to fiver my whole life. I didn't really have any hobbies growing up, wasn't into cars, fixing things, sports, I just kinda hung out with friends and played video games so I really had nothing to go off of when it came down to ""what do I wanna do.""

Lately I've been having artistic desires. I've wanted to learn how to play an instrument and produce music for a while now, a let's play channel seems fun as fuck, I've had this idea for a graphic novel kicking around my head for a few weeks now, stand up comedy and improv seem awesome, but I had none of these desires as a kid. I haven't touched an instrument since grade 8 music class, I can't draw or write, it just seems like to make anything out of any of this I should've been learning since I was 7. And besides for every 10000 kids with a guitar one will make it. These aren't things you bet all your chips on happening regardless of how long you've been going at it for.  

The obvious question to ask is ""why not do these things as hobbies and also build towards a realistic career"" Yeah that would be ideal. But what's that career gonna be. I don't think I can spend my life spending 40+ hours in some place I hate without going crazy. I honestly think I'd hate most ""normal jobs.""

&amp;#x200B;

I have struggled with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and OCD for a long time. It all escalated by the time I turned 19. I moved into my own place a couple years ago and have been unemployed since then. I've been living off savings and gotten help from family. The problem is that I have become so reclusive over the past two years that I feel like I don't even know how to function in the outside world anymore. I have let agoraphobia, apathy and escapism get the best of me. So what have I tried to do about this? I was excited to find from my psychiatrist that I qualified for ketamine therapy. And I've been exercising/working out in the meantime. However my psych is so booked that they can't get me into a constellation for a while. I was then reminded that I'm off my parent's insurance soon anyways.. Which also means the meds I take currently won't be affordable anymore. And there goes my chance of trying therapy again.. or anything else any time soon. On top of all that I'm having an OCD ritual relapse and some paranoid symptoms again (as a result of stress). I keep worrying about getting hacked/spied on, or having things stolen from me. Just afraid of being harmed in some way. I feel like I'm drowning in anxiety. The only person around me generally is my moron of a roommate. I forced myself to apply to a few jobs but I still feel awful. I've been through this before but it's even worse this time around because I'm getting older and am struggling exactly like I did as a teen. I had ambitions then- with music along with other goals. Now my life is lacking direction and I feel nothing but existential dread these days. I am a slave to my daily habits/vices. I am lost in this modern world/digital age. It feels like things will never make sense. I can't imagine doing a 9-5 just to qualify for insurance. I have a general associate's degree and I'm definitely NOT going back to school. What the fuck do I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: No woman, no job, no money. Dealing with addictions and mental health issues. Insurance is running out when I need it most. Watching my life slip away and yet I continue to procrastinate because it all feels pointless. In isolation (by choice) and have been in an existential crisis for almost 7 years.",02Jun2019,1

158,"Over the past few years, I have lived through quite a lot. I had a failed suicide attempt that left me in a weird place about 3 years ago while attending college. Shortly after that, the person of my dreams came into my life and we have built an amazing relationship together, although being long distance. I have overcome anxiety and depression thanks to the love of my life, and even managed to pull my GPA out of the gutter with his guidance and support. I also recently got my degree after an amazing work study opportunity. About a week before graduation, I was presented with 2 amazing options and I can't have both. 

My mentor at my work study announced her big retirement. And her job is my dream job, although in an area that I don't like living. I made great connections at this placement and even earned brownie points with her supervisor after proving my worth. I have been highly encouraged to apply by both her and her supervisor, and I feel that although it's not guaranteed, I will probably get the job. This means my relationship will be strained on distance and I will be unhappy living in the area, but I will have my dream job. 

My boyfriend asked me to move in. He lives in a town where I also made great connections in my field, but the job I have just been hired for is terrible. My friends in the same business are miserable and often come home crying or clutching a bottle of jack. I will be happy living with him and starting our lives together, but I will be too far away to work the job I love. And honestly, I probably won't find another job like it for quite some time. But I will be with him. It also costs significantly less to live there and I have stayed at his place for about a month, so I'm not afraid of our relationship falling apart if I make the official move.

161,"Okay, so I’ve been homeschooled since fifth grade and haven’t had much experience socializing. I have a 3.8 GPA but I definitely don’t feel like I live up to it, I plagiarized a ton of stuff to get through high school and I never truly learned how to do the basic stuff because my parent lacked supervision and efforts towards me and my education. I didn’t take many normal classes (the ones usually required in public schools) besides ones I was interested in. 

I also graduated a year early and have been super busy with moving, financial issues and family issues so I haven’t had any practice or experience with any sort of educational matters in a while, and I feel I’ve fell back in what I did know tremendously. I’m planning on going to community college and taking my required classes then transferring to a university to finish everything else. I can’t file for financial aid either because my parents haven’t done their taxes in a while and they’re needed to apply, so I’m going to need to get a job as well as maintain class attendance I’m afraid.

I don’t know where to start honestly, I’m very overwhelmed and need some guidance. I don’t know how I’m going to pay without using a student loan and being in debt or working tirelessly and using a student loan, still having debt. I also only have a slight idea of what classes I want to take in the future after my required classes, being sociology and psychology. I’m not very familiar with how classes work either, given I’ve never had to go to one.

I sincerely appreciate any advice and/or reply given! I hope I’m in line with the rules as well",02Jun2019,1

165,"Ok, let me set the scene. I live and own my home, to my right is a vacant rental property (rp1) and to the right of that is another (rp2).

I’ve known the owner of (rp1) for 10+ years, we’ve helped with each other’s places , normal good neighbor stuff. The place has been vacant for about 2 years. The owner asked me to park in the driveway ( it’s joined with mine) to make it look occupied, and I’ll occasionally mow or pick up trash when I see it. 

The problem is with the tenants of (rp2).  They are the standard trashy neighbor. Always outside, constant flow of traffic out of the house, strong weed smell , parties that turn into people yelling in the front yard at midnight or later, ect.  I do my best to ignore it as long as it doesn’t spill into my yard and the late night stuff is brief.    

The issues has been with the driveway i share with (rp1) . It’s a 2 car driveway next to my 1 car (rp2 has 2 of its own driveway on each of its sides and then parking in back) . People from (rp2) have taken to using the second spot of the driveway , not a big deal, but they’ve started to abuse the property.  

The first thing was they cleaned all the trash out of their car and just tossed it on the ground...

The next time I came home to them doing what I assume was a drug deal and telling the customers they could Pee on the side of (rp1). I had to chase them off..

Tonight I was heading to the movies with my kid and they had dumped all their beer and liquor bottles in the yard of (rp1). I tossed them back into their own yard.


At this point I feel the need to escalate the situation.  I plan to speak with the owner of (rp1) so he is aware and the only actual victim at this point.

I plan to get the landlords info for (rp2) and make her aware ( we’ve met but I don’t really know her) .

Beyond that, not really sure what else I can do.  I have a family and don’t want drama but this behavior has got to stop... so I just become the neighbor who calls the cops constantly till they stop or what do I do here?",02Jun2019,1

I started getting suspicious about my 6 year old not being mine when he was two. During that time I talked about it with my sister and I said I wouldn’t get a paternity test. I’m his father and that’s how it will always be.

Fast forward to a few months ago and a friend of mine discovered his parents had been lying to him his entire life about his father being his biological father. He’s still a mess if you talk about it. He’s cut them out of his life. He said he was always suspicious growing up. 

I remind myself that both of my sons look exactly like their mother, and that he likely won’t ever think of that. My friends situation was different in that he didn’t resemble any of his parents. I just don’t know what the right thing to do here is anymore. I want these thoughts to go away.  Part of me thinks that if I were to get the results and he wasn’t mine then it’d only be right to tell his mother to find out who the real father is.

169,"I don't know how to deal with this.

My mom has always had a strong dependency on myself and my sister. She expects a visit about once a week and and considers us her only friends. She is married (not to my dad), but she still believes family should be first. When we were growing up she didn't have many friends and instead spent time doing things with us. Nothing wrong there.

I met my fiancee about 3 years ago. He lives in Germany. I live in the USA. Met him over a video game. Friends for one, dated for two. We didn't think it would ever work, but here we are. I greatly love him, his family loves me, and mine love him.

We had agreed Germany would be a better life for us long term, but ultimately decided on moving to the US. I didn't have to learn another language right away and we could both enter the workforce pretty quickly. We even started the petition process and got it approved. It's on it's way to the Visa center as we speak.

Issue is, since we filed the petition things have come up. His dad had to have an emergency surgery due to a leg infection and now my fiancee has to have a heart surgery for an issue he's had since he was born. (He had a surgery at birth, but they just recently found out his heart is leaking from his wall) This is causing us to reconsider living in the US, as healthcare in the US is ridiculous, his parents are much older than mine, and ultimately we do think the culture there is more our speed.

After that LONG explanation, the whole point, my mother is not handling it well. Everytime I bring it up she starts crying, saying I will be abandoning her, she'll have no child anymore, and that Germany is a socialist country (Her opinion, not mine). She just cries and cries and says that I would be killing her, my family means more, etc.

I know she has attachment issues but I am close with her. I wanted to be able to talk about this with her, have an honest discussion, figure out logistics and pros vs cons, and her support either way it goes. I don't know how to stop feeling like a terrible daughter over this. I don't think my mother should be making me feel this way, but I don't know what to do. Any advice would be helpful on how to deal with this. Thank you.

173,"This is my first post from a throwaway account. 

Some backstory: I'm (22f) in college right now in my final year dealing with some pretty agitating family stuff. I have a terrible relationship with my mom due to a pretty emotionally abusive household and our family life was pretty miserable since I had to rely on friends for basic hygiene stuff. It was bad, but I just accepted that my family sucked and I was poor. I was pretty suicidal throughout my entire life mostly because of my father (but thats another story).  Even though he and my mom divorced, I still spent summers with him until my 12th birthday when he was sent off to jail and he was out of the picture (great). I tried killing myself more than a handful of times and I got close once when I downed a whole bottle of Advil once. My mom came home to me throwing up in agonizing pain, she then told me to just lay down and drink water. Later, she came back yelling at me for using all her ""headache relief"" and left me alone in my room. In the next few hours I experienced the worst pain imaginable and wished I would die faster... but nothing fucking happened. I pretty much got it all out of my system... Pretty unfortunate at the time, but I moved on to just wishing a drunk driver would swerve into me on my way home after school (sad). So I anxiously waited month after month counting down the days until my 18th birthday to leave my moms home indefinitely. My older siblings had ran away on their 16th birthdays and never looked backed so our relationship was pretty rocky since i felt abandoned. My youngest sisters (currently 10 and 16) were practically raised by me and I tried to not end up like my older siblings by making them feel abandoned. Unfortunately, by HS I was so in my head about escaping my home life, that I preoccupied my time with clubs and spent all my after school hours till midnight doing community events. I also spent all my weekends with friends. So by the time I graduated, my relationship with my younger siblings was rocky.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now. Mentally I've taken care of myself as best as I could, got a good job, been in counseling for a couple years now and I try to have my sisters visit me often. I know they want to live with me, but I'm still in college and I can barely afford to have them for more than 2 weeks, so it kills me saying goodbye to them each time they visit. Recently, I found out that my youngest sister (10) wrote on her state test that she wanted to kill herself but there is no rope in the house.... She has mentioned to me about her feelings towards our family and her home life before, but I never knew how to help her out. I do tell her things I wish someone would have told me when I was in my darkest places, but it doesn't seem to help. The principal at the school and the school counselor called my mom and told her to get my sister help but my mom doesn't believe in therapy since she doesn't like other people knowing our family shit. So, they called over a sheriff and an ambulance to escort my sister to the hospital to be tested so that she could qualify for mandatory counseling. A long 2 weeks passed since then, and I found out today that CPS came to my mothers house and checked out my sisters room. They said it looked fine and my mom should just keep an eye on her and take away her iPad (okay?). My mom said she googled something and ""learned"" that children looking at iPads at night become suicidal from the light....I told her then that its bullshit but my mom refuses to acknowledge the absurdity. I then learned that the principal called to check to see if my sister is now  in counseling but... my mom got turned away from the counseling center because my sister ""doesn't need it"". Apparently the hospital performed some tests and told my mom that she isn't depressed. Okay... well thats gotta be a joke. So my mom asked the doctor about her options and they basically told her, ""hide any rope around your house, lock up the meds, and have her reach out to other family members for help""..... HA Im dead. What a fucking joke. My mother has decided to spend more quality time with my sister but idk how thats gonna go. 

Anyways sorry for the rant and any mistakes I made... I guess what I want to ask is... what the fuck can I do here?

He claimed I was being biased by not believing him, but I have never seen proof of this or heard of this occurring in history. I understand that extremes go in both directions, but as someone who has studied psychology, I have a hard time wrapping my head around a doctor that deliberately pushes a woman into having an abortion because THE DOCTOR believes it should be done (other than for life-saving reasons).

195,"I buy things on Govdeals from various government facilities and import them to my country to make a profit. A good portion of my earnings comes form this.

Recently, I bought some phones at a very good price from Tennessee Tech. I contacted Dillon James (From Ten. tech) about getting the items picked up. Usually I pay for the items, I'm send a buyer's certificate, and then I e-mail the certificate to the person who picks it up and ships it for me, usually a UPS store. James Dillon however told me that I needed to pick up the items in person, which was a first.

So I contacted Govdeals and asked if there was something I could do to cancel the auctions without having my account locked for non payment. A lady explained that I could e-mail James and ask him if he could cancel my auctions without locking my account, since he had the ability to do this.

So I e-mailed James and asked if I didn't pay for my auctions, if he would just cancel my items , or if he would cancel my items and lock my account. I did not ask to cancel my items. My Govdeals account means a lot to me since I rely on it to make money, and if the only option was to buy it in person without having my account locked, then I would have driven the 10 hours from Iowa to pick up the phones. Anyways, James just went ahead and locked my account directly, even though I never said I would not pay for it, I never broke any rules (You have 5 business days to pay for the items).

So I received an email from Govdeals saying my account was locked, and I decided to give them a call. They said there was nothing that I could do. I talked to a lady (Kara or Karen I think) who was the supervisor. I told her so a sell could randomly lock my account randomly at their will and she told me yes. Then things got heated in our conversation and I used some profanity, which I shouldn't have, and she mocked me and starting laughing and and said ""Now we'll never unlock your account"" and hung up.

I called back to try to apologize to her, and some other lady told me that they don't want to deal with me since I had used profanity, and I couldn't talk to Karen because she was on her lunch break (It was 5 PM). When I asked the lady's name, she paused, and said ""Stevie"", which was obviously a lie.

I called a few more times after this and they just keep hanging up on me.

I don't see how a professional organization as this can act this unprofessionally.

What are my options? James was definitely in the wrong for locking my auctions for no reason. I was wrong for using profanity.

I really would like to buy the phones I bid on, and be able to buy future items.

How can I find if there is someone higher up at Govdeals.com that I can contact?

I just find it absurd that any seller on their can block your account for no reason, and that 1 person can say ""we will never unlock your acount now haha"" Considering I have been buying items for close to 2 years there and never had an issue.

Can I sue James? Can I sue Govdeals?

I don't want to sue anyone, I just want me govdeals.com account back. https://www.govdeals.com/index.cfm?fa=Main.Item&amp;itemid=5819&amp;acctid=127 This is one of the items they are selling that I had purchased (A similiar one)

197,"Was in a relationship for a year and a half. Year later dated again and got out of the relationship of 3 years in December.

 Tired of dealing with relationships. The longer I remain single, the less I care for a relationship. But in return I'm also starting to not care to go out with friends or be social.

Now I'm starting to become a hermit. Work, gym, sleep, repeat. Weekends I'd rather relax at home then go party with my friends like I used to. I used to be gone every weekend. Now MAYBE 1 weekend out of the month I'll go out.

Anybody a previous hermit? Last thing I want to do is be the crazy cat lady, male form (yes I have 2 cats Lol).

198,"I'm lost. My high school ended, and now I have nothing to do. The last year of high school I spent in depression and anxiety, and that completely ruined my school life. Nowadays, my friends are going out and having fun, whereas I can't leave my room in fear of getting a panic attack for not studying. This feeling arose in my freshman year, where everybody told me that they don't study, but in reality, all of them studied their asses off. Only I was left thinking nobody studies, and it was ""cool"" not to study, and so I didn't. Once I realized that everybody lied about it, in junior year after everybody got their final transcript and I did relatively worse, I was terrified. Everybody admitted to having studied their asses off, and I felt miserable. I regretted listening to them then, and still, do. Since that day, I stopped believing anybody if they said that they didn't study. This turned to shit in the senior year, where I started getting anxiety attacks for not being productive or working.  
I always have a feeling that when I'm not productive, there is someone out there who is and so should I because I don't want history to repeat itself. Anytime someone I knew was studying, and I wasn't, my chest began to ache, and my heart started pounding on my chest. I couldn't breathe. Now, even when I'm out of high school and will start college in August, I can't stop getting anxiety and feeling sad all the time. There are times when I start crying while sitting on my bed without any reason whatsoever. I need to do something at all points, and now that I have nothing to do, with no real direction in my life, I feel so scared that I will fall back and that history will repeat itself if I don't do anything. Maybe not with my friends, but in life. My girlfriend is a year younger than me and incredibly smart. She is by far the most intelligent and most beautiful girl I have ever met in my entire life. The problem is that my anxiety had become so horrific that even when I think about her, I get flashbacks of the time I had when I was in her place. They never fail to give me panic attacks, and it always leads to me being sad for the rest of the day. And it's not like it only happens when I think of her. It occurs at random times throughout the day. At least 7-8 times.  
I have nothing to do now, and I need to be productive and stay ahead of everybody because if I don't, then I feel like I'll be left behind. My condition is only deteriorating, and it feels inescapable. Slowly I feel like I won't be able to do anything because of these anxiety attacks, and I can't have that in college. I have way too many regrets in life, and it just makes my condition worse. I can't handle other people studying and me not, but I'm just not able to because of my anxiety. It's a snake biting its tail, and I don't know how to get out of this loop. There are a lot of things I want to do, but I'm just not able to because I'm so anxious about me falling behind and history repeating itself. I question everything I do, and I feel like I've stopped living my life for myself. I'm just surviving.",02Jun2019,6

200,"Throwaway 

I feel like I’m at a cross roads right now and rather than writing a long winded post I’ll summarize:

- I’m currently attending school (30/s) for a bachelors degree. I’m almost done, only a year or so left.

- I’ve been living in the same city for the past 20+ years and it’s a huge metro city. I think about moving a lot just because I’ve never experienced anywhere else but everyone moves *here* for the opportunities.

- my family is here and deeply rooted. This is both a blessing and a curse. I feel like sometimes I have an obligation to stay here because of my mom—but I feel like I’ve never been on my own (even now I live in the basement and pay rent but if I move out she will say I’m squandering my money when I can be saving for a house but houses here are 1mm and above easily.)

- it’s hard for me to meet someone I really click with... it’s why I am still single but I made the mistake (a couple of months ago) of letting loose with someone who turns out to be the friends/housemate of someone whom i later met (damn you dating app algorithms) and clicked really well with—and well, that’s done. The one I really click with couldn’t get over me having been with (including sleeping with) his friend.

- I have a job that pays well, is something I’m good at...but I’m bored at times but it’s so flexible with my school. I literally have the full support of the person I work with so if I need to arrive late three days a week and leave early a couple of days and telecommute for another day, I can.

- there is someone who is absolutely solid material that likes me, and I like him, but not in that way.

I really really, am thinking of just moving to somewhere like Chicago or nyc right now. 

Am I crazy? I feel like I’m suffocating here at times even though I have more than what one would expect... I feel like I’m ungrateful for thinking this way...but I also feel like I never got the chance to go out and explore. For those wondering, I had cancer when I was a teenager and that made me go straight to work (after a bit of a scare, I initially did go to college but dropped out to work full time plus two part time jobs to cover the bills).

And I also feel like that unfortunate event with the random guy and housemate/friend who turned out to be a one in a million... it just kind of pushed it over the edge for me.

I want a change and part of me feels like I should ride it out for at least the end of my school—but I’m not spring chicken. Coupled with having cancer, that changes my perspective. I don’t want to make a wrong mistake again (like the rash decision to get together casually with that random guy which I never do!!) but I also feel like I wasted a huge portion of the last ten years. I just worked worked worked. I don’t feel like I actually lived if that makes sense?  Lately I’ve been doing more ‘living’ but it’s hard when you’re also working and going to school full time (context it’s 5 classes and 40+hrs).

Can someone whose kind enough to read all my ramble help me with perspective? What would you do if you were me, or maybe knock sense into me? advice on how I should proceed?",02Jun2019,1

212,"Hi all.  Just got done with my first year of college (and did pretty OK!) and moved out of my dorm a couple weeks ago. It's been pretty difficult adjusting to living with my family again.

I've spent a while trying to get all of my feelings about this out without it turning into an incoherent manic rant. So, I will try to sum it up quickly.

My house is filthy. I'm talking near squalor if not already there. Most of it is beyond my control. 

I'm dissatisfied with my friends. Had a really hard time branching out from my HS friends, who just happened to go to the same university. They have a tendency to be quite catty and unkind though I don't think they even know. Also, I'm a lesbian, have known for a long time, and college was not the grand coming out I thought it would be, to say the least.

Being around my mom all day is dredging up some old bitterness about a shitty period in my 'tweens that therapy apparently did not really fix. This has been exacerbated by a recent acid trip. This bit alone could honestly fill an entire post.

I also can't really go anywhere and don't have much motivation to work on my hobbies so I'm just alone stewing in my room all day. I'm definitely getting a job soon, and I know at the end of summer I'm moving in with some people whose company I actually enjoy. So I'm trying to be hopeful.

216," 

Ever since I was young my sister has always wanted to control and use me. If she was nice, she had a motive. After this semester ended I decided I NEED to cut her off. I'm not confrontational or really competitive. I'm very positive, forgiving, and bottle up my emotions. She's the complete opposite.Possibly a narcissist honestly. A scorpio.

Freshman year of college back in 2016 I gave her **$1,000** from my refund so she could intern in New York which was never paid back, this semester I let her **stay in** the open room in my dorm **apartment** due to commuting from her job to campus (could have gotten kicked out). This was AFTER she went on a trip to Asia with my **ex-best friend** who also hurt me which she's aware, and now she's back to her old ways of treating me, my oldest sister, and mom poorly. I know I have to stop forgiving. She only shows up as the good sister when others flock to me after I dance or model in shows at our uni. She treats her friends way better and it's sad. So many hurtful things she's done, but these top the cake. I'm 21 now and she's 23 this year. 

She's always gotten a rush from confrontation and controlling situations with others. She's very good at convincing that she has changed just to strike again later. So I want no communication what so ever. I haven't talked to her in a week and half lol. I've talked to her once about her ways, but nothing changed and was awkward.

My question I guess is **how do I deal with the aftermath**? We have a few mutual friends and may see each other at family event if she makes an appearance. She also will show to anything I'm doing as ""support"". Should I completely ignore her or just be cordial in these situations? She may paint me as the bad person to others or be cordial for her image.She's unpredictable. I just want to be ready for whatever she brings in public or one on one. Also any tips on not being tricked by her and returning back.

Sorry it's long! I would really love to hear what you all think.",02Jun2019,2

218,"I feel the need for a little bit of a backstory, so here goes..

A few years ago, my brother came clean about his heavy meth use. His (now wife) had broken up with him for her own reasons and told him he needed to get clean. He has had two relapses on meth, one which happened recently before his son was born. He refuses to go to therapy to help himself actually get/stay clean.

He isn't using meth now. He's basically swapping one addiction for another - alcohol and prescription pills mostly. I don't think he realizes that is what he is doing, but I see it. 

In February, I had a gallbladder attack and ended up in the hospital with awful pain. Naturally, the hospital sent me home with pain killers. In March, one of my dogs was attacked by a dog that jumped my fence (she lived) and my husband and I spent two nights out of state - she needed an emergency surgery. My brother stole the bottle of pain killers I had from the hospital while we were away. I didn't mention it because I knew he would say something like ""you probably took them with you and left them in your hotel."" I kept a lone pain killer in my purse, just in case I was away from home and needed it. I also kept the prescription information with it so that if police searched my purse, they would know it was my prescription. 

My brother's basement flooded and destroyed their bed and the carpets. He, his wife and child are staying with my husband and I until they can get the clear from insurance to start cleaning up. We really agreed because the baby is only three months old and he doesn't have the immune system we have. The first night they were here, my brother stole my emergency pain killer. I know it was him because my husband didn't take it - he would have asked me for it, and my sister in law doesn't take pills unless she absolutely needs to. The thing is, he made it incredibly obvious that he went through my purse. He left it open and in a fashion that I never leave my purse. I should have taken it to bed with me, but I didn't think I needed to since this is my house and I thought I could put a tiny bit of trust in him... 

I want to confront him about it, and I've been stewing about it for a few days. If my years in therapy has taught me anything, it's that I need to listen to Wise Mind. If it goes unsaid, then he skates by without repercussion. I'm at the point now that I don't want to help him at all for anything. Why should I if he is going to steal from me? 

**its 12:30 AM and he asked me if I was okay. I told him that I am a little perturbed because I'm in a little more pain tonight that I'd like to be and my last pain killer is missing and that I am pissed because I knew it was in my purse. He met me with ""oh, that sucks.. you could ask my wife for one of hers. Or you could just drink a beer."" I didn't expect him to own up to it, but I had hoped that he might. He left to get something from their house, but the way he drove off makes me feel like he wants to come up with a good excuse to retort with.**

I feel like I'm at a loss of what to do. My mom's advice was to wait until they can go back home because she feels that they would end up feeling uncomfortable staying here. I don't know what is the best thing to say/do or when the ""right time"" is. I don't want to cause conflict between any of us or between him and his wife, but conflict is going to happen I think.

TLDR; my brother stole my pain killers and I don't know how to confront him about it.",02Jun2019,2

220,"So, just some context:

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is very controversial and a lot of highschool kids saw him as ""sus"" or ""dangerous"". He was just misunderstood and was emotional, there was nothing especially bad about him. However recently he's been feeling depressed because our group, which he never really talked to anyways, wasn't talking to him. He sits with his girlfriend for most of lunch and doesn't really talk to us and when he does he just stands there without saying anything, expecting us to say stuff, which is hard since he hasn't actively talked with us for a while. There was one lunch where it was very emotional and he told us about how we were excluding him and I tried my best to fix the situation. I thought it was fixed and things were fine until about last week.

&amp;#x200B;

About a few days ago, he comes up to me and asks to talk after class. He explains once more how we weren't talking to him at all and he specifically went off on me. He said ""F\*\*\* You"" and walked away, essentially cutting me from his life. He also said he hated everyone else, but from what I've seen, im the only one he said this to. He hasn't talked to me since and its hard for me to even talk to him because I dont know where to start and I know once I say something, emotions will explode, dragging everyone else into it (Terrible since not everyone understands the situation). Everyone else is unaware of the situation except for 2 of my close friends. He seems happy talking to everyone else, except when he sees me specifically. What should I do? Should I just leave him be since it seems like he makes it clear that he doesn't want anything to do with me.

TLDR: Friend felt left out, specifically targeted me, a close friend, to put the blame on. No one else knows, and no idea what to do.",02Jun2019,1

When we hang out, she’s excited to do something one second and then wants to leave and go home the next. I don’t understand some of the things she does and I’m starting to feel incompatible with her.

So far ive done these tests:

-state testing

-finals for all of my classes online

- performance tests

-and many many practice tests

It seems like a little but in every single class. Its not a lot compared to other grades but at the end of the day im exhausted. I need to do finals on my last week of school but i continue to do tests during that time. They arent  10 question quizzes they are like 50 questions each.

My laptop wouldnt work for state testing so every day for the past 3 weeks ive had to walk to make up testing in another building but my laptop doesnt work yet they still send me. Ive tried fixing it but IT did nothing. It was annoying. So yah how do i stay motivated for finals?

232,"My cousin always tells me my nose is too big. She says I would be pretty if I had a nose job. The thing is... my nose isn't big (I think). It's not perfect but it's not big. I put my nose into the golden-ratio and it seems to be a pretty normal size. I did this after months of being unsure how big my nose is. I grew up with almost no problems with my nose at all. However, after she began saying this to me, I began to think my nose was big. I thought something was wrong with me because I couldn't see that it was big. I became extremely self-conscious and cried every night believing I was ugly. Ever since she said it is too big, I will always have that in the back of my mind. Even on my most confident day, I will look at my nose and think ""hmm... maybe it is too big."" One day I had enough and cried about it to my boyfriend. He promised me that my nose wasn't big. I made him promise that he wasn't lying to spare my feelings. He swore that he was being honest and it made me feel a little bit better.

Any advice on how to deal with this? Is it worth it to cut contact with my cousin? Should I confront her? (her opinion on my nose isn't going to change even if I do). Could she be telling me my nose is big to hurt me? Is there a chance she is lying in order to make me feel insecure?

I have suspicious she may be jealous of me, but I am not sure if it is my way of denying the fact that she truly believes my nose is big. In my head, maybe she is only saying it because she is jealous? It is a lot less painful than believing my nose truly is as big as she says.

Here are examples of her acting jealous:

First, she rarely compliments me. She does sometimes but it is rare. If there were a ratio of insults to compliments, it would be about 30:1.

Second, she acts super competitive and jealous of her one friend. She does it all behind her back, and I have a feeling that she does not make her competitiveness and jealousy obvious to her friend. But based on what she says to me, she is very jealous of her. This makes me believe it is not too far off of an assumption, maybe.

Also, when I began dating my boyfriend, she did not act happy for me at all. She told me I made a stupid decision to date him so early on because we hadn't had sex yet. While all my friends and family were happy for me, she told me I should have waited until we had sex to know if I truly liked him. That was all she said. She did not seem happy for me at all. Then when she got a boyfriend about 2 months later, she posted it all over Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. She also wouldn't stop talking about him to me and everyone. It was as if she was downplaying my new relationship while boasting hers to the entire world. The thing is, they hadn't had sex before they started dating either but that was no problem for her?

I  started taking a lot of care of my hair so that it would become healthy again. It was damaged because of the constant straight ironing.  I began to take really good care of it so that it would grow. It took 3 years to get my hair to a long, healthy state. I wore my hair naturally every day and cut out straightening it. Everyone was complimenting me on my long and natural hair, but all my cousin had to say was that it was ugly. She said my natural hair is ugly and that I care too much about my hair and it's abnormal how much I take care of it. She said I should cut it because it's starting to look ""too long"" when it isn't even to my butt. Then, she buys extensions that are super long.

I also spent a lot of time learning 2 different languages this past year. I became pretty good at them. I devoted a lot of time to learning and practicing them. But then, one day, my cousin yelled at me saying I'm not even good at the languages that I am learning (yet I know I am good because teachers tell me I am very good and I rarely make mistakes) and that I should just find another hobby. Then she goes and starts to learn Russian.

Okay, maybe she isn't jealous and it's a stretch. But it is my way of rationalizing why she would say my nose is big... when it really isn't (unless I have a bad judgment). The pain this has caused me is unbearable. I spent months believing I was truly ugly because of my nose. It makes me want to cry. She also constantly criticizes me with other things, but for some reason, her thoughts on my nose have caused me the most pain. I think it is because I am extremely self-conscious and have low self-esteem. Why is my cousin so critical of me? Is she just very honest? Is it rational for me to believe she is jealous? How can I deal with this?",02Jun2019,1
233,"So basically my elder brother who is 26 now is a virgin,and has had no experiance with women whatsoever. I am 22 yro female and i am very close to him,so he tells me everything,everything has been fine until yesterday when he told me that he is goinh to have sex with a hooker/prostitute cause he cant find a girl and he cant wait so he has to have sex with a prostitute. I tried making him understand that he will get girls once he decides to do so and its not that hard,but as he told me that the kind of friends he was hanging out were same ,they were having sex with hookers and so it will not be a big deal for him as well. 
I am really sad for him. I dont know what can i do to stop him from going down that path. He is not worried about stds as he told me that he will take care of that. But i dont know why do i feel so bad about it. Should i not think about it? After all its his life he can do whatever he wants to but i dont know its been irking me so bad lately.

235,"I was at a friends house for their birthday, I came on bike. They were having a sleepover but my parents would not let me stay for the night but then I realized I stayed too late so I asked my Mom and Dad if they could come pick me up because of how dark it was, my mistake that was on me. They said to go through the dark, okay, no problem, you’re the parents, you’re the smart ones. I started my ride home, should take 30 minutes. After 10 minutes, I realized a car had been following me for a while. I stopped and it drove by so I shrugged it off. 2 minutes later I see the car parked next to the sidewalk I was on so I switch sides. Little shit follows me onto the fucking road, (What’s wrong with this? 1. Following me, 2. He’s on the wrong fucking lane!) I cross again and he follows! This happens for 10 fucking minutes and then I speed extra fast and lose him. FFW 3 more minutes, pitch black outside btw, he’s right there, waiting, parked. All around me is blackness, nowhere to escape except the light I’m at. I call my parents in hysteria and tell them the situation hoping they would help me. Instead they call me a “fucking asshole” repeatedly and say something along the lines of “Look what we raised, a fucking pussy!” In the end they cope and send my sister to come pick me up and (thank god) my sister CARED! I loaded the bike in and zoomed past him not looking back. He did not follow. I got home safe and sound, yipeeeeee! My parents arrive home and are mad asf. They start talking to me about what I should have done but I rexplain everything and my mom literally goes pale. She realizes that if I went past the car I could have been killed, raped, or just plain abducted. My Dad tries to find ways to shift the blame but it lands on them. My Mom just springs out and says “You’re selling your VR headset.” I immediately go into shock, I almost got abducted and you want to land that on me? That’s not even related! Do you want to give me a heart attack? She explains to me she does not want me to live in a “Virtual World” and that “I’ve become a different person with electronics” because of some retarded article she read from facebook. I have changed, I will not lie. I changed because I grew older and natural change landed on me. I am not excited if I go to the Tillamook Cheese Factory or museums. I have changed for the better in my opinion, I grew up and they can’t cope. I want to be normal so bad, I want a normal life so bad.

236,"So we had a joint account that was a private one. We only used it to upload our pics and to see them whenever we wanted. After our break up, I felt like that account was stopping me from moving on because I always logged into it and stared at those old pics of ours, so I deactivated it.

We'd broken up like 5 months ago, my ex wanted to remain friends and for the first 3 months he would ask me how things were then we kinda stopped talking, but today I received a long long message from him saying he wanted me to activate the account again and added that if I changed the login email to his, I wouldn't have to have it on my phone. 

I was about to tell him honestly saying I missed him too much so that was why I deactivated the account as he thinks I just hate to have the account on my phone whatever the reasons are, but the problem is.. I'm worried that what if he steps back knowing that I still miss him. Maybe he just wants the account back and doesn’t really wanna hear what I felt or my thoughts.

I don't know what to do, Somehow I miss him so much and want him to know that but the other side of me is thinking that he won't come back even if he knows I wanna get back together, so there is no point of rambling about how I truly feel. What should I do?",02Jun2019,1

239,"I'm 17 years old and about to go into my senior year of high school. I was at a party with a bunch of people, most of them were from other schools and I didn't know them. Since I was spending the night at my friend's house and didn't have to worry about driving home I had way too much to drink and I don't remember much past 1 AM. The next morning I woke up and a few of my friends started talking about how I finally lost my virginity. I was super confused at first but as I talked to more people I learned that while I was super wasted I had sex with this girl from a different school. There was even a video of me going into the bathroom with her.

I honestly have no idea how I feel about this. I am pretty bothered that I don't remember my first time or that she seemed pretty sober from the vid. There is also the entire issue of whether I was raped. I don't remember it and she seemed pretty sober. While it doesn't bother me a ton, I don't really know how to approach this. Every friend I've tried to talk to it about has just kinda laughed it off and joked about how I wasn't a virgin anymore. I honestly just don't think there is anyone I can reach out to about this without getting laughed at. I'm also scared about whether or not I used protection since I don't remember it at all.

243,"Im 23 years old and I'm already burnt out. Ever since I was a kid, i self sabotaged a lot of the things that I had in order to get pity. As an adult, that doesn't work anymore, but it's changed my personality. I put value in delaying gratification, sometimes indefinitely. The stress becomes so pent up that my only release are nightly panic attacks. I've managed to avoid them by only going to sleep when i am exhausted. I now suffer from insomnia. 

I have a very, very long story about my sad life in reddit drafts, but I don't think I'll ever finish it. I'll take out some thoughts from there though and share them, because i think they are important to share.

To make a very long story short, due to thinks like moving away, my own stupidity, or my weirdness,  the very few friends that I had left me. I can remember each one, I should treasure those memories, but all I feel is pain in my heart when I think about them. I should be surrounded by people who love me, but instead I'm more alone than I've ever been.

My parents have told me that im lazy throughout my life. I never wanted to do things that I didn't like, like every child. I was not afraid of labor, in fact, projects of my own that required serious work were never a problem. I had a passion and I would spend many hours working on my projects, you certainly could not call me lazy then. 

Fast forward to today, I have run out of passion. There are only two things in my life that I value. I value my few remaining friends whom I've gone through enormous lengths to stay in contact with, even though we have been thousands of miles away for over 11 years. I also value my family. Specifically, my baby brother. He is my world. There is nothing i would not do for him. I feel weird thinking about him this way, he's not my child after all, but with my father being a truck driver, I had a fair part in raising him. I understand he's not my son, but i think that i love him as if he were. This could be due to the fact that I've settled on not having any children of my own.

I have some vague passions. I'd love to be a writer, or own a small shop in Washington State, or work for a space agency and be a part of some great project to get us closer to the stars, if it were a possibility, I would like to set foot on another planet in my lifetime. 

I used to be a big anime and video game nerd. I legitimately cared about these interests, but that's dried up. If i play games or watch something, it's only with someone who I can talk to. My friends have been distant lately, so it's difficult to do that now. I value the time spent together much more than the media we do it through. 

Old people make me sad. Thinking about abandoning grandparents in old folks homes with nothing to do but sit in their cells, waiting for that heart attack that ends it all brings tears to my eyes, how many helpless, hopeless people have been thrown away because they were unwanted or undesirable? How can we be so cruel? I believe people can endure anything together, but suffeeing alone is torture. Nobody should be alone, and that's exactly how I feel about myself in this moment.

But enough about my personality. Here's the issue. I'm only 23 years old and I'm already ready to die. I've run out of things to do. My upbringing has irreparably changed my perceptions about people and I now live with a permanent prejudice against most people in the world. My secret desires fight against this, and lead to an internal conflict through which i learn to hate myself even more. It's not simply a matter of being more accepting, it's not a choice I can make. Deep down, I'm sexist, racist, and homophobic. Thanks dad. What's interesting is that i'm also bisexual, would prefer to have been born female, and was born into an immigrant family, who has suffered due to racism.

I'm a bit of a paradox, and that might be connected to my bipolar disorder. Rarely, I will be manic, just raring to go at projects like writing. I love to write when I'm manic. Unfortunately, it also leads to some stupid decisions like cutting the hair ive been trying to grow out for over a year. The rest of the time though, I'm depressed. Just stuck in a state where I have to force myself to be occupied by entertainment that im not all that interested in or suffer the dark thoughts that lead to tears and panic attacks.

These are not all my issues, not by a long shot, but i'd like to finish this post for once. Ive tried before but chickened out. I need advice. What can I do in my life to start caring about living again? How do I fix my mental illnesses? If the apex of my life was 12 years, then why am I still hanging on? Its decline from here. A lot was left unsaid, but if anyone comments, I can shed more light on my situation or back story.",02Jun2019,1

245,"im currently in my second year of med school and it was all going okay but not the best marks until this semester i failed three subjects... this means i will have repeat the year for me to move on , i study very hard and the least leassst i expect is to at least pass with the amount of effort and time i put into studying, i would have expected this since my marks have been decreasing in 2nd year and the subjects are getting harder by the semester, this has put me in a very bad mental stage and tbh the main reason i even went to med school is because i wanted to see my parents happy and they have repeatedly expressed their interest in me studying it, they didn’t force me into it but i was 17 and stupid and incapable of making my own decisions, i was sent to another country to study and only see them three times a year which has affected me very much and i think plays a factor in why im not doing well , aside from the fact that i was suddenly very responsible of myself when before leaving to college i had never lived alone or did anything by myself, they basically drove me everywhere and i had a very early curfew etc... so i admit that a huge part of my failing goes to me being very afraid alone and confused, but i cannot deny the fact that the subjects are very hard and i do study but never get the outcomes that i expect,, so i’ve been thinking about switching majors for a couple of months now , i just feel like maybe it is just not right for me , mind you in school i was very good at maths and physics and while i got an overall high grade in biology it was the lowest one , subjects that require memorizing were not my strong points and that could be a cause , so maybe i just made a bad decision and no one trued to guide me on making it ( which costed me two years of my life ) 
i talked to my parents about studying something else but was met with youre just confused or you study wrong or you dont sleep before your exams (which i do ) or you shouldn’t quit from failing once that’s not right or if i could go back in time i would have studied medicine and passed it anyways they are very biased and whenever i tell them no i just dont want it they just say im discouraged cus im failing which makes me confused and scared 

i feel out of place in med school and i don’t see myself being any special in it , i also see how enthusiastic my friends are about it compared to me , i also have a couple of other friends that are failing but im the only one thinking about switching majors which makes me think that maybe i just don’t love it like they do

246,"I'm really upset &amp; can't seem to see a way out. I met someone online last year and we became friends. We spoke/speak nearly everyday and both develop a story together. Gradually over the last 6 or 7 months, he would disappear randomly for lots of time then come back with some poor excuse. Each time I excused it. Then he started being different. He would tell me to say certain things when he did, to stop calling him, that I had so many chances and to tell him a surprise I had planned or he wouldn't be pleasant during it etc. For most of this, I would get very stressed. Not knowing if he's gonna be there or not, what he'd say. He'd frequently dangle goodbye over my head too. Now granted, I'm not perfect, my insecurities pop up here and there but we worked through them. However I knew this time would come. He told me just recently that he was too busy in his life with work to talk or anything for several months and that maybe we ought to say goodbye or to choose if I want to talk to him or continue the story. He said if I won't choose, he'll follow through on his goodbye. Now here's the thing - I have huge fear of abandonment (from my childhood) so I really find it immensely hard to say goodbye to anyone. I keep getting myself in knots trying to make something work out, thinking back to when we got on so well to now. It feels like such a waste of time and maybe I'm responsible for him pushing me away (he said things that annoyed him about me). I feel so broken. So honestly I don't know what to do, there doesn't seem like a resolution. He said he would talk to me later a day ago so I haven't been able to.

I work at this store, we are a chain, we have an RX program for employees and you don't need insurance too use it, ive spoken about it with other outlets and they give it too me just fine.... but this one pharmacist at my location will pull my script, tell me he will fill it, go out of his way too remove me from the RX plan, and refuses to let me use it.... I -know- I have every right too, and this inflates the price astronomically.... I think he dislikes me as a person :( and I don't know why, I never did anything too him, I translate for them when they need it and im always polite at work, but he just eyes me like im less than human.... one time, he took my sleep meds script ""lorazapan"" and said he could have it filled that day, than said it would be in tomorrow, and than had me come in on 3 other days, and than told me that he wouldn't be able too fill it and i would need too go too another pharmacy too get it filled, where they filled it that day and with the RX program..... I need too drop off my script, I got my sleep aid taken care off, now my script is a few days old and im afraid he is going to give me a hard time and it just really feels awful, I never abuse my meds, I get bad anxiety and I am a student, I can't hold conversations like a normal person without it and I can't sleep at all without my sleeping meds, I don't know if I should be calling corporate about it, or if thats something that I just have no say in at all.... any advice would be appreciated, those are my only medications, they aren't for high doses, and I get a new script every month, I only go to my works pharmacy or another outlet of my same company....",02Jun2019,1
249,"Long story short, I opened up a pizza franchise a few months ago and sales aren’t up and tbh the only marketing I have really done is mailing coupons and a good portion of the delivery zone area hasn’t been mailed the coupons yet. Problem is that marketing is expensive and not marketing will also be expensive if I have to pay costs out of pocket. Right now, we’re doing sales of about $6500 a week and we need to be at $8000-$8500 at least to break even and cover the necessary costs (payroll, lease, etc). Goal is to get sales at $10-11,000 a week in order to save a decent amount or more if possible. I fear that I won’t be able to keep everything running if this continues. But the marketing/mailing that I have done isn’t helping too much. Right now, I’m going to local businesses and giving pizza, plan on going to kids sports games with pizza, and doing deals with apartment complexes and schools (but now summer is starting so that’s a problem, but I’m trying for summer camps). Honestly there’s not an insane amount of competition, I just don’t know how to drive damn sales !!!! Please someone help. I know it takes time to build a customer base, but for crying out loud... the pizza business is one of the largest growing markets. It’s like I’m begging for people to buy a damn pizzas. If this pattern continues, I don’t think I can stay open or worse... alive.",02Jun2019,6
250,"I live in Japan, and a year or two ago, I made friends with a guy who was here studying abroad. He went back to America, and we kept in touch, but about six months ago, he went radio silent. I have been trying to contact him for months through facebook and email without any luck.  He was in a dark place before, and I am worried something happened to him. I don't know how to find him. I don't know his home address, or anything other than his facebook or email. I know the university he used to go to, but I don't think he still does, so it doesn't help me, really. I could probably track him down if I went to America, but I only get to go home once a year, and his state is too far from mine to make a detour.

You see, I like guys and find them appealing/attractive so I've always thought I was straight. But since last year I've been questioning if I am or not. 

The person I really (My SO) is Gender-fluid but I’ve never really cared weather or not they identified as male, female, or neither as I still love and am attracted to them. 

I’ve come to realize that I don’t really care about looks/gender or genitalia when it comes to love &amp; relationships. I only care about personality and how you treat others as well as me.

252,"Hello Strangers, 

I need your advice on something so please take a minute or so out of your precious time and read what my situation is below. 

I started talking to this guy on Instagram, he is a friend of my best friend but I have never met him in real life. He lives in Canada and I live in USA. We started talking last year in March and talked for a while but then didn't talk for a month or so again, no reason behind the gap we were both just busy in our own lives. After a month or so we start talking again and this time things got a little ""explicit"" (as in think of the highest level of flirting, idk if I am allowed to say the word that I am referring to here sorry if I am confusing you) so that went on for a couple of months and since then we have been texting. Point is I have got to know this guy pretty well. (Side note we have never video called or anything but we have each other on Instagram so I kno what he looks like and his background info and all, i made sure he ain't some 40 year old dude posing as a 20 year old). Moving on, we have been wanting to meet each other but he can't come to USA because he doesnt have a Visa, his passport is expired so for him to apply for Visa he would need to atleast wait for a good 3 or 4 months. Before I moved to USA I used to live in Canada and so I am a Canadian citizen so I dont need Visa to go to Canada from here in the US. I should mention that I live in Cali. 

Now school is starting back in August and my uni here in Cali has a national exchange program to Binghampton Uni in New York which is very close to the Canadian border. I am majoring in supply chain management rn and turns out Binghampton is one of the best supply chain schools in the USA. So basically if I go do an exchange there for a sem then I would be able to meet him and go to a reptuated supply chain school. The problem is that my parents don't know about him at all, I can't even dare to tell them, let's just say they are really strict. I already told them about this program and they gave me the permission to go study there in New York.

My concern is should I go with this plan or no? Essentially I chose binghampton because it was near the Canadaian border (there are other options available too) but it just so turns out going to school is going to benefit my major as well. Also I should mention that I am 20 years old. I am not planning to tell my parents about this guy anytime soon though so even if I go decide to meet him I would be kinda sneaking away but like I am 20 so idk man. Also this guy is not my boyfriend yet fyi. 

Someone please give me their opinion on this situation and maybe suggest on what I should go forward with. Thank you so much for reading all this.",02Jun2019,1
253,"

So I have been in this toxic long dist relationship with a guy (lets call him Bob) for about 7 months. Things were pretty good at the beginning, he was behaving nicely and all that. I must say I can be a very impulsive person, and soonly after (about month 4 in the relationship) we started to fight, but not like most of the couples. We would fight about silly stuff sometimes, or very serious stuff othertimes, and he would always offend and hurt me, I would cry during the whole night and he would simply go to sleep and text me the next morning, expecting everything to be ok ( he only apologised when he sensed I might break up with him). This happened a lot, almost 3 times a week, all of my friends hate him and told me several times to break up with him but I couldn't imagine living without the person I love ( because I really DID love him so so much). Moving a bit forward at the start of May, we were about to have sex and the foreplay wasn't good enough ( sorry but those details are important so you can understand the story) and I didn't get wet no matter what. I told him what he was doing started to hurt and he got mad and refused to have sex with me, saying I am disgusting ( and that the idea of having sex with me makes him sick). I started to cry, partly because we didn't have the oportunity to do it very often and it was important and intimate for me, and partly because he insulted me, but this time he really hurt my feelings. When I told him I wanted to break up after this incident he started to cry and told me he is really sorry and he only said those words because of his anger, and the stupid me forgave him again. But I couldn't get over it, no matter how hard I tried. All I thought about was that I am not good enough for anyone anymore, I felt like a thrown away doll. Things got pretty fucked up after this, I couldn't totally forgive him and he didn't have the patience to wait until I got better and recovered my dignity (of course we never had sex again), and we got into a point in which we fought every single day, no exception. And he kept victimizing , telling me what he's dont is not that big of a deal and that I am wrong for not forgiving him. I got to a point in which I only talked to him out of obligation and doing that granted me no pleasure, seeing him only made me remember what he told me back then, and I felt overall sickness because of his presence in my life. I told myself it would get better. I told myself it was just a phase and things would turn around fine, that I shouldn't break up with him because of this, that I still love him and losing him would make me feel horrible. 
Then this guy came into my life (call him Henry). I've known him for almost 4 months now and we never got to see in real life, we shared out love life dramas together and helped each other out with different problems, we talked a lot and laughed a lot together and he seemed like a very good friend of mine until we finally met. We were at a event and I got a bit drunk and told him everything about my relationship with Bob ( he didn't know the ""you disgust me"" part), and he really was there for me and made me feel a bit better. He convinced me that night, after I sobered up, and I made up my mind that the next day I will break up with Bob. After that, Henry told me that he liked me and was very scared of the outcome of his confession, I was really really confused about that because since he told me Bob doesn't deserve me and that I deserve much much more I realised I may like him quite a lot, and I haven't seen that because of my toxic relationship. Then as we hugged he touched my lips very gently and kissed me. First time I pulled out, thinking I was being a bad person for doing this to Bob, but then I realised he didn't even care about me anymore, all he wanted was to mantain the relationship because it was easier for him. Then I kissed Henry. We spent all night outside because I forgot my keys and couldn't get into my home and we had to wait for the friend who got them to wake up as he didn't pick up our calls, and the kissing thing happened by the end of it. When morning came, I texted Bob what happened with my keys and that I spent the whole night outside in the rain, he said I'm not careful enough and changed the subject. I got pretty mad and realised he doesn't care a bit about what happened, and texted him I want to break up. His response was; ""ok"". He didn't even try to ask why or to apologise.
* I must say that it was not only me with Henry that night, we were with 2 more friends and we only got to be the two of us for a couple of seconds because I got drunk and started to cry and ran away and he came after me to see if I was okay*
Me and the other guy are still talking and he's been very nice to me, saying I don't have to officialize anything until I feel ready, that he'd even give me space if I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore. He said he'll wait as long as it takes in order for me to be happy and content.

My ex made me skeptical about any other human and as hard as I want to trust Henry I think it s just scam. How do I get over? And am I the villain in this story? Am I a slut for kissing Henry in those circumstances?",02Jun2019,1
254,"so basically my best friend (we will call him Larry) and my other really close friend (call her Sarah) weren't really friends before I introduced them to each other. I had kind of always had feelings for Larry but was too scared to admit it and as my only coping mechanism I thought omg I should get Sarah and Larry together because maybe I will get over him. Anyways they dated for around 4 months and I never stopped liking him, they had been broken up for quite a while and I was always like if anything is going to happen between me and Larry it will (if that makes any sense).

He and I stayed really close where Sarah and I kind of drifted apart but she is apart of my friendship group and it's wrong of me to have had those feelings because everyone else in the group is a strong advocate for girl code. Anyways around two weeks ago he had like a small gath of people over at his house and we were all drinking, we ended up hooking up and staying up all night talking and in that moment I had never been happier. We decided that he and I were going to be ""seeing each other"" without telling anyone else and we did so. We hung out a couple of times after school and i was genuinely so happy.

Up until last night, we were good and I was so happy, until my drunk ass thought it was a good idea to ask if he even liked me like that, anyways after around 10 mental breakdowns at the party turns out he doesn't anymore and thinks we would be better just as friends. It hurts me so much to know that I won't be that girl for him and I know I'm young and I'm going to look back at this in a couple of years and probably laugh at this situation, but right now I'm in so much pain to know that I will never be that girl for him and I want to stay friends and I think we will but I don't know how I will ever get over him.

257,"First off, new account because one of the roommates I know uses Reddit. I moved into an apartment with 3 other people a couple years ago. They are Josh, Brandon and Ashley. It should also be noted that Brandon and Ashley are a couple. Part of our lease agreement with our complex was that the only way we could break our lease was if we enlisted in the military. They gave specific examples saying that needing to move due to transferring work or school did not absolve our responsibility for the lease.

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning things were Ok. Not ideal, but tolerable. Josh and I mostly kept to ourselves, Brandon and Ashley however used the rest of the apartment however they wished. They used the kitchen regularly and never really cleaned up after themselves in a timely manner, they would host people for things and again, never really clean anything in a timely manner, never cleaning the bathrooms and such. Stereotypical nightmare roommates. I believe they both have really strong gaming addictions. It got to the point where Josh and I no longer felt comfortable using any of the common spaces unless we absolutely needed to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to some unrelated issues Josh ended up moving out in January, but due to the bindings of the lease has been paying rent still. I, having my fiance coming over to visit and not wanting to have her subjected to the garbage dump that has become our apartment, moved into a different place in April and have also been continuing to pay rent. I only moved the bare basics as I just wanted to get out fast. Our lease is up the 15th of June.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back to the apartment in May to start looking at moving the rest of my stuff and slowly start cleaning and what met me when I opened the door was appalling. Literally everything I've described but multiplied like 10 fold. It stank of garbage, as there was just piles of dirty dishes and random garbage on all the counter spaces, food sitting on the stove still from who knows when, and random clutter and garbage everywhere that they weren't sleeping. Fortunately they didn't touch my room much. I've been back there 2 other times thinking they might pull themselves together now that we have to be moved out in like 2 weeks, but it's only gotten worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that we should have addressed this sooner and it should never have gotten this bad to begin with. I would like to know if there are protections I can take for myself to protect references for future rentals and such?",02Jun2019,1
258,"    I don’t know why or how but it clicked today that some of the stuff I’ve been doing is borderline or already stalker shit. Mostly to my ex girlfriend I haven’t talked to in a while.

I’ve checked her snap score periodically 

I’ve made multiple different accounts on social media using different names to follow what she’s doing.

    I’ve never followed her or showed up at her work or anything like that. She works at a restaurant by my house that I eat at maybe once or twice every week or two. I always go after the morning shift cause I know that’s when she works, and I’m not trying to run into her when I’m looking for food.

I feel like a creep honestly. I never thought I made that        waltz into stalker territory. I’ve never wanted to hurt her or anything like that. 

Despite that though I can’t believe that I’ve become this. When did my lines on reality get so blurred that I thought what I was doing was normal? 

How do I stop doing this stuff? Please help",02Jun2019,2
259,"I have always had a very unstable relationship with my siblings. We didn't get along for many many years. To keep things short, I'll say that I have worked very hard on my end to become tolerant of them and change my own bad habits. Though, I have not seen the same from them.

Until a few years ago, when I became a tattoo artist, they had no interest in spending time with me.

Since beginning my tattoo career, they have used me to get many tattoos. Which is the limit of my interactions with them for the most part, outside of family gatherings.

At this point I feel used. It feels disingenuous to pretend we are siblings. It's feels like a one side trade off for me as a benifit to them.

I guess I am simply asking, how would you deal with a situation that included ""close"" family only having time for you when it benefited them?

261,"I mainly want to make sure the short speech I wrote to say when the group has arrived at my house sounds good. Here it is:

I suppose, I, being the person who arranged this gathering, should say a few words before we walk to the pond. I'll keep it brief. 

Firstly, I would like you all to know that I am aware everyone grieves differently, so this place here, and while we're walking to the pond, and while we're at the pond, until we go our separate ways is a safe place.If you want to cry, if you want to talk, if you want to stay silent and listen to your thoughts, I want you to feel free to do that. It's ok to be sad when terrible things happen. It's ok to be sad about nothing at all. We're human. We feel pain, and we have brokenness. If you push the feelings down they'll eventually bubble over and that's how unhealthy and self destructive behaviors and actions start. So, just let yourself feel. Let your soul do what it needs to do, because here, we support each other. I support all of you.

Secondly, I like hugs alot, and I know some of you do as well, but some people prefer not to be touched when they're upset, so please ask to touch. I just want you all to be comfortable.

End

I hope that's sounds alright, the situation is, we're in middle school and  everyone in the group I've put together knew him, and are hurting from his death including me. I set a date and a time, two days from tonight (the day of his death) to go down to leave flowers by the pond where his death occurred, then release balloons, pray, and light candels at sunset. Just generally honoring our fallen classmate. Any improvements I could make to my opening statement and anymore ideas to honour our deseased pal, would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway, in this portion of the night ive forgotten, at some point, photos have been taken with me and my friend kissing in the background, its not clear but you can tell. I saw these at the same time as my boyfriend and was horrified, because literally the morning after that night I asked my friend if anything bad happened cos I didnt remember leaving or anything and he was like nope all is normal. Me and my boyfriend questioned him and he kept switching stories ""we were just hugging"" ""I dont remember"" ""nothing happened"" ""I did it"" ""i didnt"".

266,"I've known my friend for four years, we met at university and I'm not sure how to help him.

Throughout that time, he's been trying to get a girlfriend through dating sites and not been successful, rarely getting matches or even messages back. Understandably, this has left him miserable. 

What worries me is that he seems to partially blame this lack of success on the women on the dating sites, who he characterised in a rant as 'basic bitches' or 'sheep, rejects &amp; fundamentally broken people'. (however, this could just be that he's exaggerating due to feeling angry in the moment. Or at least, I hope so). In the past, he's also said it would be impossible to get a girlfriend anyway as he's not tall or rich, and is generally very negative about himself.

Me and his other friends have tried to give him advice over the years, including stop searching for love and focus on other things, don't overthink/ pathologise human relationships so much. But it just falls on deaf ears, and if anything he's gone further into the rabbit hole as the years have gone on. I think he's also prone to a black-or-white view of the world, which may be part of the reason he has this mindset in the first place.

What I'm concerned about is that he'll slide into a full-on incel way of thinking, making it less likely that he'll have a girlfriend, and making him more angry and isolated from the people around him, I'm also worried that anything I say won't affect him because it will be something he's heard before or he'll feel like I don't understand.

Her: Hey so is there like zero chance of whatever between us being like a thing? Like you’re very happy with your relationship and want something strictly platonic here?

Him: Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation.

Her: So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

Him: I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth

269," 

So... I'm not sure how to repair my bond with my mother. The thing is, I was basically rising myself up. With my dad as an alcoholic, my mother being obsessed with social media and my younger sibling being always outside of the house (she either sleeps the whole day and night, shutting herself in her room or just goes outside with her friends who are kinda bad influence). With no-one to look up to from my family, I just decided to decide what I want to believe in and what I think is wrong or right.

The thing is, she always gets mad at me with no apparent reason. I have good grades, try my best at school and help around the house. I even went on to fight my drunk father so he won't hit her. But if I make the smallest mistake she just goes crazy with screaming and insulting me. It's hurtful to my feelings, and I can do something as simple as to trip and she would throw insults right my was. It feels like she might hit me at any moment. It makes me scared of her.

Right now she is thought an operation, and right now I'm the only one doing chores at home. I've pointed that out to my mother, saying that my sister is already 13, and she should help out too (I was helping out already at the age of 10). But my mother seems to brush of the idea every time. Today she snapped at me, saying something along the lines of  
""At least she goes outside"", which didn't make sense, because we were talking about cleaning and not about activities.

To clear things up I want say that I take the buss to school at 7.15 and I'm there at about 8.30, and when my class ends at 14 or 15.30 I would still need to wait for the buss and I would be home at about 17. So the way to school and back home takes me almost 3 hours total. I do it everyday. Then when I get back home I do the chores, homework etc. So I'm quite tired when I get back home, and the time when I go outside is when I go out with my dog. Meanwhile my sister is the opposite of me, really. She has somewhat good grades (good enough to pass), doesn't help around the house and spends the time with her friends. Other than that she uses a total of 20 minutes to get to school and home.

Back to the topic, I don't know how to approach my mother. Doesn't matter what I do or say, she will always be rude to me and insult me at any chance. I can try to be the best daughter but I don't know... It seems pointless to me. If just feels like I'm the hated child and my sister is favorized. At this point I might as well stay with my father instead.

I'm sorry for this rant, but I had to get it off my chest. I wasn't sure how to name this thread or how to approach the topic. I also added this thread to the r/relationship_advice if anyone wondering.",02Jun2019,1

271,"So I've been friends with this guy maybe 1 year now. I've always kind of liked him, but about 5 months ago, I really started to like him.

Because of his job, I couldn't see him too often (he works maybe 80 hours a week on a start up company). Maybe 1 time every two weeks. Anyways, I decided a while ago I just needed to tell him me feelings so I could move on,but the time never felt right.

One day I asked if I could call him. He said sure, and told me I could call whenever I wanted. Maybe a week later, he called me out of the blue, so I was really happy. Then 2 weeks ago, I called him, we talked the longest we ever talked on the phone.

 2 days later he calls me. He was worried about calling me late. After the phone call, I text him and say I was really happy he called me, because I wanted to call him that day, but then he'd told me he was going on a short business trip so I hadn't wanted to bother him by calling.

Things look up and I decided on Monday, when we planned to meet, I would ask him what he thought about us. I've known this guy for a year now, and I can't keep pining away forever. I need to move on if he isn't interested.

So Monday comes, and we hadn't set a time to meet. I end up having to contact him, and his response is a little slow. So I start thinking maybe I did something wrong.

 He tells me his answer was slow because he's flying out the next day. Then he asks if instead of eating together, we can eat with his brother instead (his brother is also a friend of mine). I'm kind of annoyed at him for changing the plans, and now I have to wait to tell him, like I planned. 

He was way more himself, though. Very carefree, and invited me to sit next to him on the couch. Then he casually tells me he will message me as soon as he gets back from the business trip. I didn't think anything about it at the time.

He come back from his trip 1 week trip in 2 days, and now I'm wondering if maybe he meant something by this?  Did he want to put distance between us? Surely at this point he knows I like him. Am I reading too much into this? 

Tl;dr
I've liked this guy way too long. I want to ask him what he thinks of us so I can move on. Then things start to look up, like maybe he's interested. But then he tells me he's going on a week long business trip and he will contact me when he comes back.

272,"I don't know when it has started but there were a few incidents that triggered me and i remember them perfectly. For example one day i was walking in a street in a residental district and i saw a cute girl walking so i went after her and followed her to the alley where her apartment's door was located and watched her as she walked in. In that moment i just thought what would it be like if we could be friends right here and me and her would spend time in her room? And i could spend more time there and have a dinner with her family anf talk about my life and sleep there and leave in next day?  Why not? What is stopping us from being friends randomly? I just left that place but i kept the memory and next times i would stick to the houses for a longer time. Once i saw a family who has arrived to their house with their car and it seems they went shopping as they had stuff in bags. There were the parents, their young daughter and a teenage son. They were so happy and they were laughing. It was satisfying to watch them. So i just stayed there for a housr after they went inside and i could hear their talking from outside. ""Edward you are going to share that with me.... No i am not it's all miiiiine! Come on eddie don't be mean to your sister!... Kate you better go hang out with your boyfriend go go hurry up hes calling!... [everyone laughs] i'm gonna teach you manners!... let's make some chicken nuggets for tonight what do you think dad?..."" and i remember everything i've heard in that day. It was so interesting for me to hear a part of a family's conversation and try to relate to them somehow. I would imagine to join them and have a new exprience. A good memory. A nostalgic moment. Whatever you want to call it. I've been doing these things since that time. I've even memorized some of the addresses and i went there multiple times and collected much information about some target families. I even know their names, their lifestyle, persoanlity and even some workplaces. I feel like that i am secretly a part of lots of families' lives. I am present in their lives without them even slightly noticing anything. As you can see most of the cases include girls in them. They make attraction for me and motivate me for sticking to the houses. Sometimes i make eye contacts with those girls and i even walk to them and ask a random question. I try to behave so friendly and humble like we know eachother and it's intriguing for some people. They may know that i am someone different but they don't know that i am stalking them. One night i was in a alleyway in a rich residental neighborhood full of lights while there was a mild wind blowing. It was such a amazing atmosphere. I saw a girl wearing just a top who was standing behind the window of the second floor and she had a glass of drink in her hand. She looked pretty and i stared and her and smiled. She was cluless but after a while she giggled and walked away. It was adorable. I have lots of such memories and i just have a romantic and nostalgic kind of feeling towards these stuff. I do everything silently, carefully and professionally. I like sticking myself to everyday lives of people and knowing their true behavior and collecting information about them.  I even trck down some people i've found online. I i know their full name, it would be easier. 

Do you ever have the feeling to do something like this? Do you think that i am abnormal? Really what could be the root of my actions? What does cause me to feel so curious and adventurous in residental areas?",02Jun2019,6
273,"I found these texts between them. They literally talk every so often and he texts her way more info than she texts him. They’ve met up a few times in real life. Is he stringing her along? 

Her: Hey so is there like zero chance of whatever between us being like a thing? Like you’re very happy with your relationship and want something strictly platonic here?

Him: Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation.

Her: So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

Him: I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth

274,"**Throwaway account.** *I don't browse reddit often, so I don't know what thread this belongs in or if it's appropriate here.* Never mentioned or talked about this for fear of judgement and the fact I don't really want to admit whats happening to me. I pride myself on being strong and independent. I'm scared for my sanity and I don't have anyone I can go to for this.

&amp;#x200B;

 Recently, I made a big change in my life, and moved away from home with less than 500 dollars in my pocket about 8-9 months ago with the help of my best friend of 8 years. I had intended to move off by myself, but my friend convinced me to move up with him. I've always been a reclusive, reserved and rather apathetic individual- and have always known there were issues with my head, regarding some troubling thoughts/whispers and odd visuals every now and then, but I convinced myself i was being dramatic and chalked it up to stress/overthinking.

&amp;#x200B;

However, since I've moved and after having lost my best friend only 3 months in (presumably because of my dumb fucking apathetic nature) things have flared. Really bad. Paranoia. I just thought it was a coping mechanism for some shit from my past, but lately it's getting a bit too irrational. People I've no reason not to be okay around- I second guess constantly. Even though they've always done me right. I sleep with a gun under my fucking pillow in this low crime rate town. I can't focus anymore. I notice I can't remember important memories or small tasks people have asked of me but 30 seconds ago. (I know I lost ones that mattered, because I had this journal and have been going through it. I only put things that have influenced my character as a whole in there and think about those experiences often.)  It's hard to listen to people with several things going on. I find myself getting trapped in delusions, such as where I'm a god of this universe, or I'm here as punishment for hours before I snap myself out.  The funniest part is, I only realized it was a big problem when a girl I had basically just met and know nothing about was the ""love of my life"" and I spent a week thinking we were destined to be. Knowing me? Absurd. If anything, I usually hurt myself in the long run because I'm so guarded with my affection regarding women. Its cost me relationships. I've always been rational, logical, and methodical and I feel out of my element, because I'm slipping away.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go to a doctor, because I don't want this on my record. I don't want to block any career paths if there even is the slightest chance of me overcoming this... yet I know with how I'm changing I don't feel I can. I don't want to live a fucking life on medication or have to be taken care of. I don't want to be trapped in my head.

Is it schizophrenia? Psychosis? Dementia? Or am I just being an anxious bitch in a new environment. What can I do to calm myself, or stall whatever is going on. What should I do?

292,"Throwaway account as I think some of my friends know my username. 

Like the title says, I am 25 years old and have never had any kind of sexual or romantic contact with a woman; no penetrative sex, blowjobs/handjobs or even romantic kissing, and have never had a girlfriend. I’m not proud of this, and it’s not something I go around telling people, but it’s kind of an open secret among my circle of friends as they all know simply because we’ve all known each other for a long time and they know I’ve never had a gf or done any of these things. I’ve never admitted it to anyone and don’t like the idea of people finding out (luckily I’ve never been in a situation where someone has directly asked me as I’m not sure how I’d respond). 

Recently, one of my friends suggested that we take a group trip to Amsterdam next year, which I was enthusiastic about, but he went on to suggest that I “finally” get laid by paying for sex with a prostitute (prostitution is not legal where we live.) Although I would like to lose my virginity, I’m uncomfortable with the idea of paying to lose it - I’m aware that a lot of men visit prostitutes, but I don’t like the fact that the only reason a woman would ever be intimate with me is because I’ve paid her to do so, as opposed to all my friends who have had sex with women because the women were genuinely attracted to them. Furthermore, although I am ashamed of being a virgin, there is a chance that I could one day lose it the “normal” way by meeting a woman who is attracted to me - if I feel ashamed about having paid to lose it I can never go back and un-lose it, so the shame would be with me for life. 

On the other hand, another part of me says that sex shouldn’t be this big of a deal and I should probably just get it over with, and that I have all my life ahead of me to meet and have sex with women without paying them for their company, but I still can’t shake the feelings I described in the above paragraph. I also wouldn’t want anyone to find out that I paid to lose my virginity, possibly even more than I don’t want people to find out that I am a virgin at the moment.

294,"Hello first I'd like to start off my story with a little background, I am a 22 year old Male who has been with my girlfriend for almost 5 years. Within our 5 years we have been through many hardships, we even have a kid together he is now almost 4 years old.

So my story starts off 2 years ago when me and my girlfriend(who at this point was my fiance and we lived with my parents.)  We always struggled financially because we bought a brand new car and it held us back and I was the only one working as my girlfriend just barely started nursing school. We barely managed so we had to stay at our parents house. I had been the only one making money on minimum wage jobs without going to college for the last 3 years supporting us, she had a few part time jobs but nothing too serious because she got pregnant and had to watch our son. Anyways 2 years ago (2017) she started nursing school and I had to support us again while she went we made it work because my parents were able to watch our baby. Whenever she was home she was either studying or relaxing thus making it my job to do most of the chores like clean, take out garbage, change diapers and I did a rather D+ job at it ( I could've done better). It was like this for the whole year she went to school, eventually when she graduated we promised to move out of my parents house and into our own. We eventually managed to do that.

Fast forward to mid 2018 and she lands a nursing job and we eventually are able to move out after buying another car and adding a personal loan on top of it. Us being pretty young had pretty bad credit so our payments were extraordinarily high for these cars about 950$ a month for both. And our new houses rent was 675$ not including any bills. At the time we had her little sister and her friend living with us as roommates (they hardly ever helped pay the bills) life her was pretty simple clean after yourself, dont leave messes. But unfortunately the roommates did not listen to that at all they left piles of dishes, clothes everywhere dirty or clean, and smoked weed all the time in our basement. Me being the responsible one with the part time job who watches our son was expected 444⁴",02Jun2019,1

297,"Bit of background. I'm a high school dropout in my early twenties, I'm currently working a dead end job at a local gas station. I work 24 hours a week on minimum wage. I steal from my job every shift. 

I've been working here for about 2 years now and the stealing started maybe a month or 2 ago. I realised I knew cigarette prices well enough that I could just take the cash from customers and give them their change without ever scanning the item. This way the cigarettes don't show up in the system and the cash is not logged in the register meaning I can just slip in into my pocket and keep it. 

This is where the rabbit hole began. I've been doing this for 2 months or so at this point. I won't try to justify it because no matter what shit working conditions there are or how little I'm getting paid it doesn't justify stealing. I'm just at the point where I've been backed into a corner and I'm about to be caught. My manager doesn't suspect anything but he's told me there's a large variance in the stock and the money coming in and our retailer as called for a stock take where they will count all the items in the store and compare it to the inventory to see what's missing.

Cigarettes are kept behind the counter and only the cashier has access to them which means me and 4 other people are the prime suspects. When they check the CCTV and see me slipping money into my pockets that corresponds with the stock missing I'm done for. My manager told me about another person who was caught doing what I am and they made him work off the money and then fired him. I'm also worried they'll escalate this to a criminal matter with the police.

I won't try to defend myself by saying I needed money for x and y reason. There's no excuse for what I've done and I am fully guilty. I am just wracked with guilt, I feel physically sick and scared all the time now. I just don't know what to do.",02Jun2019,12

300,"As a guitarist, my musical taste has changed hugely over my life (im 20 at the moment). From dadrock like metallica etc. to indie to experimental/noise music, to techno. By the time I really get a feel for a genre i start to get sick of it as I see other artists really overdo the tropes common to most genres. The rate at which this occurs is always faster than i can really put together original music and have it recorded. Often when i try to create stuff this process even accelerates.  


Similarly, I came out of school with a huge passion for philosophy. over 2 years into my degree im quite dissatisfied with the field as I feel like most of philosophy is just a way for opinionated people to dress up their ideas to seem more convincing. Obviously I have new academic interests (atm im pretty interested in organisational studies and information science), nonetheless from experience I am worried these new interests will fade away and be replaced with something else before i can spend years of my life committing to a PHD.  


All this makes me worried - I want to do interesting things with my life, but i feel like i cant just keep picking new things up without finishing what I started previously, like someone browsing netflix for longer than it would take to just watch a movie. I worry that if i continue being like this ill end up just settling with a shitty corporate job that i have no interest in and die a sad man.   


However, i truly cannot find motivation to pursue things once I feel like they're not worth pursuing anymore. You cant really force stuff like that and have anything good come out of it, at least in my experience.   


How do I approach this problem? does it come down to just accepting this issue and coming to terms with the fact that pursuing something im not particularly interested in anymore is better than ending up doing nothing at all? or is there some way i can reconcile my desire to create with my desire to do things i have an authentic interest in despite those interests constantly changing?",02Jun2019,2

304,"I'm the founder of an early stage start up. I have an investor company, that also holds a co-founder title, because they've contributed a decent bit into formalising the idea and giving strategic advice from time to time. Other than that, on ground, I have always been a single founder. 

The problem is that it seems like they've zero faith in the idea now. So I gave an ultimatum saying it makes sense to move forward only if we all believe equally, and they went on to give me another interim round of funding (part loan to the venture and part convertible to equity/returnable in cash). 

The problem is that I hold the director of the company in very high regard as a mentor. But everytime he gives his feedback, it feels like what I'm doing is hardly worth a thing. And it absolutely demotivates me and makes me want to walk away from the entire thing. 

On his good days he is super supportive but his emails make it seem like I'm doing nothing worthwhile and this is making me extremely anxious.

310,"I started working at a menial part time job. Morning cleaning, only job available in town, start at 6 but there’s no busses so I have to get up at 4 and walk for an hour to get there. 
We’re understaffed, there’s me, A who works often and is genuinely friendly and helpful, and K who has some arrangement with the managers that means she can come in late load her work off on me and A and not really work. 

The issue is, while I get along with A and I have been working roughly 3 weeks now, I consider him a decent coworker especially considering the alternative in terms of who I work with at least. 

But... well I know he’s young (16-18?) and he likes video games so it might just be an edgy joke.. but more than 3 times he’s out of the blue walked in, said “sieg heil!” And raised his arm in a salute. He’s said some other German things but I don’t know German. (He’s also originally from Hungary)
Other than this, there no real warning signs I can tell. (I might be missing them because I’m autistic) other than the rather normal youth comments. Like I teasingly offered him a hello kitty bandaid I had because he cut his knee and he said (roughly) “I wouldn’t wear that. People will think I’m gay!” Which, I shrugged off because most straight boys around his age think that stuff. 

I’m not sure what I should do? I can’t tell if these are jokes or him trying to signal me (really won’t work I’m liberal and tick many of the LGBT boxes with a mixed race family). 
Should I report this? This isn’t the kind of job where anything is really taken seriously, I bet even if I reported him to Human Resources (Which I’ve never been told if it even exists or is just the managers doing it), I feel like because he’s good at his job and we’re so under staffed, he’d be fine, but then I’d be in trouble for reporting it. 
And if they did fire him then we will only have two workers and I’m not mentally or physically healthy enough to work full time and with someone who doesn’t pick up the slack, K.",02Jun2019,0

315,"Ever since my wife and i met she has always been a very conservative virgin girl.  I knew she had a BF before me but she insisted she was a virgin and it was very important to her.  This has throughout our relationship, at first it was her making sure we took things slow and making sure she took each step carefully as her virginity was so so so important to her.  After a while (and after we were married) it became more form me not believing her about her past BF as gaps in her stories and insistence started to appear.

&amp;#x200B;

Now like 10 years later she was drunk and admitted to me she had sex with her bf all those years ago and has lied to me ever since.  She says she is sorry for lying to me and causing so many arguments about it, but it was only with him and only while they were together as a couple.  She was also open about what they did together.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week i was cleaning in the garage and in an old box buried in the back i found some old old pics of her taken just before we got together as a couple.  They were black and white pics of her on the beach, appeared naked but not showing anything.  She tried telling me they were pics taken by her best friend and was def never naked just looked that way, always had clothes on.  But then i saw when they were taken it was a time when her best friend was over seas.  then she admitted it was taken by her ex BF like 2 years after they had broken up, and she was completely naked for the pics - left her clothes in his car.  She said nothing else happened she just wanted some nice sexy pics, there was definitely no sex that happened, not even kissing.

&amp;#x200B;

She says its no big deal and she is sorry and i should just get over it.  But i feel like its a big deal she has been lying to me for all this time. Its not so much that she had sex, its that she lied about it so much and took it so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Also i am not sure i buy the explanation she took those pics and nothing else happened with her EX like a few weeks before we got together.

Do you believe her nothing happened with her EX taking those pics?",02Jun2019,26
316,"Ever since we were little he always played video games on his computer. But it was never as extreme as it is now. He is 45 and he spends all his time playing on PlayStation. We can't even watch the damn TV. He's there since 7am to 7pm. Literally. Not overexhagerating. Everytime I go into living room he's there just clicking the freaking buttons and I have to tell him everything five times because he's just not listening. My mom always tells him to stop playing but he never listens.

He actually bought the PlayStation for me when I got diagnosed with depression so I could play my favorite games. All he does is playing on it. Sometimes he doesn't even eat. I finished only one game because he's always there. We never go anywhere other than grocery shopping because he doesn't wanna stop playing.

I'm so sad and angry right now. All we do is stay at home because my mom can't drive and he won't take us anywhere. If he's not playing he's on his computer. Always. I wanna cry because it's just so crazy.

He won't let us talk him out of it. He's not listening. He has little breaks while playing to go smoke three cigarettes and a beer. And then he plays again. I know he won't let anyone talk him out of it. I wish he was normal.",02Jun2019,1
318,"So my roommate and I have been living together for 11 months, it's been good. We were high school acquaintances, now we're 27. 
We've talked about getting a dog, even went to a shelter once to look around months ago. We had the dog ownership discussion on responsibility if we got one. I specifically said I don't want a puppy. No dog talks since then.

I got home late last night from a wedding, amd saw a dog lease. I figured he was dogsitting for a day or something. This morning, there's (an adorable) but TWO MONTH old rottweiler looking puppy at my place. 
I love dogs, but I have an idea of what it takes to raise a baby or a puppy. Fuck. That.

My concern here is that puppies need to pee like every 2 hrs and will need constant care amd attention.
Luckily, our lease is up in a little over a month, and he is a teacher amd summer just startedn(so he can be home to take care of and train the puppy) but he is going on a vacation with his boyfriend to Cuba in a few weeks, before the lease ends. I'm not waking up every few hours to walk the dog or coming home early from work to walk him. I leave at 7AM, work 30 min away, and get home at 7PM, M-Fri. 

Basically, since he did without consulting me (and I specifically have said I didn't want a puppy), I'm going to tell him this is completely on him and I'm not being dad while he's away. I have enough sleeping issues already, and waking up in the middle of the night multiple times would leave me dead tired during the day. I am an analyst in a corporate office and my job is dependent on being able to think critically. Shit sleep = I can't do my job.

I'm extremely mindful of other people, so I'm not going to be a dick about it, but I'm going to be firm in that he did this without consulting me, and I would never get a puppy, so he needs to own his decision amd make alternate plans for who will take care of the puppy while he's away, because I'm not upending my life for this, especially when he's moving out immediately after, and I don't see us being close friends after that.

321,"Hi, I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but I apologize in advance as I tend to ramble.

So a while back, I was in a really bad place. I was working in the video game industry as a game designer, and as anyone who has worked in the industry knows, it's incredibly toxic. I was treated like dirt by my boss, worked insane hours, and constantly found myself getting laid off and going for a while without employment. I was in a really bad place and at one point even considered suicide. A good friend of mine, let's call him Eric, pulled me out of it. Eric was the only one I confided in,  as we've always been pretty close. He told me that with the money I had saved up, I should quit and start developing an indie game. I've never been one to believe in myself, but Eric made it seem possible. I decided that I was going to take his advice, and I did it!

Eric and I stayed up until the wee hours talking about concepts of gameplay ideas, and together we came up with some cool stuff. It was an action-adventure RPG with some really neat gameplay mechanics. After a couple months, everything was coming together for our game idea, but the one thing that I really didn't like was the story. Eric has been an aspiring writer his entire life, so I figured this could be his big break and I let him come up with the story for all the characters that I came up with. It was the least I could do, as this entire project is happening because Eric believed in me. However, his story is very disjointed and I'm not sure it really would hold anyone's interest. I feel like he plays up the powers of the villain too much, neglects the main characters, and overall I'm just not that pulled in by his story.

A couple weeks ago a friend of mine was in town visiting. Let's call him Max. I confided in Max what had been going on, and he was horrified that had been through this and not told anyone. After a pep talk, he asked what the game was about. I gave him the concept (not including Eric's story). Now, Max is a published science fiction/fantasy writer. Immediately upon giving him the rough concept for the game, I could see his brain start working overtime. He immediately and excitedly told me a story idea he had for my game that he literally pulled out of his ass, and it was fucking fantastic. I was sucked into his every word, and started furiously scribbling the notes on napkins. We were there for almost three hours listening to his story ideas, and I had used pretty much every napkin in the napkin dispenser at our booth. I was literally moved to tears by the ending he came up with. Upon seeing my emotional reaction, he offered to be the writer for my game and be involved in my project for free. I insisted on paying him with the game sales, and he told me to pay him whenever. He was just happy to be involved with something so important to me.

I'm an idiot and I immediately said yes. I didn't tell him Eric was already the writer. 

I don't know what to do now, Max has been sending me page after page of dialogue, and they're all fucking incredible. I can practically hear my character's voices saying them when I read it. The words jump off the page. Meanwhile Eric has also been working on dialogues trees and Scripts, and I cringe upon reading them. They read like anime fan fictions. Eric is so passionate about my project and so excited to be involved in possibly get his big break, but I can't imagine that my game is going to do well with dialogue like his. 

Neither of them knows that the other is involved, and both of them are mutual friends which makes it even more complicated. I know that if I tell Eric about Max, he'll immediately leave the project, but also probably never speak to me again. Eric has been struggling for years to try to get published, and Max enjoyed success from nearly every book He's put out there. Conversely, if I tell Max about Eric, I know Max will leave the project because he would never want to steal Eric's Big Break.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm in some kind of bad sitcom where the main character is going on two dates at once. If any outside observer can maybe give me some guidance, I would be forever grateful.

TLDR: started a video game project with a friend as a writer, and accidentally involved another friend who is a superior writer. The two don't know about each other, and I know that they will not work together out of mutual respect for the other.",02Jun2019,1
322,"Right from my childhood I have been thoroughly targeted and harassed, by teachers, classmates and women relatives. Now I am 50. I discovered myself very late. I do not know if there could be another person like me in the world. ( could be that I am autistic or of low IQ ) I am mostly met with extreme hatred though I mind my business. Men look at me in wonder, but later leave me with respect. My ex (arranged marriage, from India) showered a lot of physical and mental abuse and threw me out of the marriage. My parents though educated ( dad was professionally qualified, mom is 10th-grade pass) were also very self-unaware, relied on others for their happiness and not at all self-confident though there were quite talented and good looking. They never ever counseled me or my sibling. They refused to, in fact. They rebuffed me when I went begging for help.

Only 3 years ago I discovered 3 years ago that I am blessed with extreme good looks. All the backlash I got in life now I understand was because of this and my unawareness of it.

I am not here to boast. Actually, my life is lost and a tragedy. What I want to know here is, how do really good looking women manage to tread in society and in a career. I work with women. It is really harsh. People are very cruel. Thankfully I have rarely worked with men . Once or twice now I realize, things did go out of the way. But miraculously I have escaped. My students and my son are the only ones in this world who adore me and shower me with love. I think if there is a God, he compensated my lack of love this way. I teach a rare subject that does not have many teachers. Hence I got this employment. I had lost having faith in my ability early in life as teachers were very cruel in evaluating my papers and my work. I was always a bundle of nerves.

I have also suffered from slight incest. On this, I am wary. Hence before anything untoward could have happened, I escaped away.

My suffering is mostly because I did not know my state and how to handle it. I request peoples guidance. How do people with extremely good looks handle others? Nobody has helped me in real life by teaching me how to. I have a few good friends whom I acquired late in life. They tried to help me.

I've been working in this industry for a few years.. I'm not going to lie, it's crap. Stress, overwork, the expectation to sell your soul for money... The thought of doing this my entire life makes me want to step in front of a bus. Most days I look out the window and dream of doing things I've always dreamed of, something related to what I actually studied, something engaging and meaningful.  


I was offered the opportunity to move abroad with my same job. I took it.  
I'm supposed to moving there soon.  
Since then, I've been having extreme second thoughts.  
Should I be moving to a new country for a job I don't want to do?  


Another option:  
The person I'm in a long distance relationship with has offered me to come live with them for a stop gap, while I research career changes, apply to stuff, sort my head out. We're very in love, they're very supportive,  we get on very well, despite only being together for 6 months. But it's a risk. Giving up my steady salary to go and live with someone for the first time?  


One thing is for sure.. I can't stay in this current city with no job. It's like throwing thousands of dollars down the drain.

331,"Hi everyone, about 5 weeks ago I met this girl at a board games event by a 20s and 30s Meetup group in Brighton in England and we got on well, chatted quite a lot and had a laugh with each other and played a couple board games together with another friend as well. 😄

But I have not seen her again since the board games event and recently in the last week, I have got in touch/contact with her by text on the Meetup website basically how she is doing and what she been up to and she replied with a big positive response and I replied back that I told her what I have been up to as well and how I have been as well. 🙂


She is a really lovely, friendly, fun, easy going and really attractive girl and she is definitely my type for a girlfriend(if we get that far) and since that board games event that we met at, I have been thinking that I would really like to ask her if she would like to meet up and hang out with me one day in the next week or 2 and get to know her as a friend more.

But the problem is that I don't really know if it is actually ok to ask her to hang out despite only meeting her once at the board games event 5 weeks ago and the thing is that if I keep just waiting and waiting and hoping and hoping that one day that she will go to one of the events from the 20s and 30s Meetup group again and she never gone back then before you know it, I would of definitely lost my chance to see her again by asking her to hang out with me.

So yeah ladies I really need some advice, Is it to ok to ask her to hang out with me one day in the next week or 2 despite only meeting her once at the board games event 5 weeks ago?? And what would you think if a guy that you met once ask you to meet up and hang out with him, would you think positive or negative?? Despite both of you got on well with each other?? 🤔🤔

She comforted me and we where hugging, but that's when she kissed me. It was not just one kiss, we made out several times through the night after that, and I haven't honestly been happier in a long time. She had to go home and would come back the next day. I was ecstatic to see her again because I actually thought she had feelings for me too, but when she came back she had a friend with her. They had only just meet a couple weeks ago and I know they have been spending a lot of time toghter, but I didn't think much of it.

333,"So I've been with the same guy for 5 years (I'm 24, so is he). We recently got married. Our relationship was close and sex wasnt an issue at all. Out of the blue, he hands me divorce papers and says that he doesn't love me. I couldn't believe it...we just got married and he never acted differently. Well I did some snooping and found out that he and this other woman have been texting NON STOP while he was at work for a month. Even slept with her too.  He's convinced that our marriage broke because of how he can't love me and not because of her even though he is still seeing her. He also doesn't show any remorse. I'm struggling because this isn't the guy I married. I want to save our marriage but how can I if he keeps seeing her. She's also married with 3 kids (different dads) and her husband is in the military. I'm just lost because I never saw this happening with HIM. We've loved each other for so long, and I could see how he felt about me through his actions and how he looked at me. How is he able to just leave and not care about his actions or our history together. It's a complete 180 from the guy I've known and been with for so long. He doesn't even want to try to fix our relationship because he legitimately thinks he can't love again even though this issue didnt happen until her. And he's still seeing her.

Most has to be finished earlier even. 22 days is way, way too little time to get all the points I need to pass the first year and not get sent home. The big problem (I think) is that I just don't see myself working as a game or software developer in the future... The crazy thing though is that that's still the subject I enjoy the most in my programme. I feel like I'm not gonna make it this year and that's enough reason to start thinking about just giving up.

Here's the thing: I went to get treatment for social anxiety this year and after a dozen sessions my therapist suggested I may have an avoidant personality disorder and she offered to refer me to a long-term therapist. I simply tend to avoid situations that make me nervous or stressful, whether that be in social settings but apparently also in my professional career. I feel like whatever I have doesn't merit treatment because I can live life just fine. Except for getting close with people. Or keeping a study program up for more than a year. Or just being content with my life. I really feel like I should decline this offer and get just try fixing it myself but I know that won't work. I'll keep living with extreme procrastination, social isolation, and an ever-present feeling that I'm too lazy to fix my problems and myself. I really don't know. Maybe I am. Or maybe there's really something not right in my mind and I do truly need a helping hand. Can anybody offer some advice?",02Jun2019,2
335,My mom is currently confined at the hospital. She was diagnosed 2 years ago with breast cancer then after her treatment it was found out that it metastasized to the pelvic area. Treatments were done but the tumor didn't shrink. It even became bigger by a couple of centimeters. I don't have anyone left. My mom is the most precious thing to me,02Jun2019,3

337,"Hey guys, so I’m currently doing this really expensive post grad uni course that I asked my dad to pay for since I knew it was something I really wanted and it would secure me financially. It was meant to be a 2 year course however since it requires on the job training and experience it is gonna take a bit longer for me to finally finish. 

The problem is I’ve had to live really far from home and 2 years in now, im kinda really hating it and I just feel so trapped that my whole life revolves around this now and I can’t move on with my life I’m just stuck until it’s done with. I don’t know when I will finish... my training contract doesn’t even mention an end date... I don’t know if I wanna do this anymore, I just want to leave and quit this course but if I do that I’ll have nothing else.... 

What should I do...",02Jun2019,1

341,"We are encouraged to respect ourselves when we feel unsafe.  But how do we know if we aren't just being irrational.  The best thing I could think of was to provide a list of clues for me.  *I didn't think each of these individually meant I was unsafe, rather it was the accumulation.*  Yet, I still doubt myself and wonder if I'm irrational to feel unsafe.

Them, romantic context, dating partner:

-  Telling me early on that their roommate said our signs are incompatible.  I don't believe in astrology, but the comment made me feel self conscious.
-  Telling me that their roommate didn't like me, and I barely even knew them or had interacted with them.
-  they were always profusely thankful whenever I'd do certain things, like ask them questions, or listen to them talk for longer than 3 minutes (they always seemed self conscious about talking for extended periods), or expressing affection in some way.  This heightened gratitude made me feel awkward.  I don't know if it was wrong of me, but I eventually expressed to them that it made me feel uncomfortable, or that I was trying to understand it.
-  carried out an April fools joke where they told me they had found someone else to go to a concert with them.  I took the joke in stride, but it felt slightly off.
- Telling me that they used to shoplift.  He apparently no longer does, but the random confession felt odd.
-  their texting me felt more often than felt appropriate for 3-4 weeks into dating, like always good mornings, checking in, good nights, etc.
-  early on, they set up a shared music playlist for us.  I noticed that he would add very overt love songs consistently.  I felt weird asking about it, but I did.  They said they hadn't realized and that they tend to focus on musical aesthetics, not lyrics.  This just felt insincere to me, but I still wasn't sure.  
-  over time, as I'd calmly and politely reference little tidbits that felt odd, they said I was trying to get in their head and assign intention.  They called me a ""Nancy Drew"". 
-  a month into dating, they revealed they'd be moving from our city likely in the near future, had travel aspirations with their career.  This was kind of upsetting to me.  It was a detail I wish I had known about sooner.  I have no interest in rushing a relationship, but this detail made me wonder if I should still pursue it.  They ended up clarifying it as something more vague.  Like, I got a weird sense they were just saying it, not dishonestly, but also not as serious of a plan when they first mentioned it.
-  I had a leg injury with mysterious origin.  He's a professional dancer and could empathize.  I went to various practitioners and did a lot of work to heal it, and at one point he expressed that it may be something I'd always have.  I mean, I was kind of expecting the worst, too.  But it seemed like an odd comment.  A month later it was healed and I figured it out.
-  two months into dating, he revealed to me that he had an incurable and infectious std.  We had not been sexual up to this point, but I was still gobsmacked (for various reasons).  I later found out that he had never actually been formally diagnosed, only visually by a doctor (itself, a grave error).  It felt odd to me to live for six years thinking you have an std, without ever being tested, but I also understand you can be a product of a faulty medical system.  Still, I'd want to know.  I couldn't imagine going six years not knowing with certainty, but still telling others with certainty.
-  as I was processing the std, researching, etc, he seemed to continually struggle to get tested without health insurance.  It was stressful for both of us, and at one point he broke down asking me if I'd break up with him if he had it.  I was still processing everything and didn't even know if he did have it.  While I felt badly for his situation and tried to comfort in any way I could, the question also felt pressuring, because I was still trying to understand my risks (also having a health trauma history).  I felt very afflicted and guilty for having to process it.
-  when I asked one time what our relationship meant to him, he said we were friends with a few things in common.  This was despite a very clear romantic context.  He also described me as a distraction.  These really hurt.  And his explanations for my misunderstanding felt still confusing.
-  Telling me his roommate said I needed to get new shoes.  When he sensed I was uncomfortable by the statement, he said that he likes my shoes.
-  Telling me his step dad used to call him a sociopath and pathological liar growing up.  He expressed a tad confusion of self of if it was true or not.  When I ask if he thinks he is either, the answer is so convoluted and lacking in a direct answer.
-  Telling me on three separate occasions about a closeted friend of his who is married and is madly in love with him.  Seeming to be fascinated by the situation.  Then telling me he's handsome then showing me pictures of him.
-  over time, as I reference some of these things, his responses seem to give a kind of reasonable answer, but I'm left feeling odd about them regardless.
-  revealing to me once that he felt he liked me more than I liked him.  This comparison hurt, because I genuinely did like him a lot and highly valued so many things.  The relationship felt significant and important to me.  After he saw that I was hurt, he changed his meaning.
-  an overall sense of guardedness on his end, or a sense that he is trying to adapt to me, like people please.  But that makes me feel uncomfortable.  I want to just see him as he is, rather than someone who is trying to make themselves likeable.
- an overall sense that his language is confusing, or even maybe dishonest.  

I *feel* unsafe with the accumulation of these factors over time.  But because of my trauma background, I wonder if I'm actually being unsafe or have an abusive mindset in that I believe the feeling I get at times.  That, at times, I believe that what I feel is the truth, even if I don't tell him.  (But mostly, automatically and initially I doubt, and try to give him the benefit and try to understand his vantage).  I actually have become dysregulated *by the experience*, not being dysregulated or confused or paranoid before (at least as a single person).  I've never tried to assert that my perception is the right one, but I do try and understand what he means by these various things that catch my attention.

The part I struggle with is that I *have* had this unsafe feeling before in romantic dynamics.  But I've also had experiences where I didn't.  I don't want to be a victim, nor do I feel I walk around assuming such, but part of me wonders if maybe I am enacting a victim complex by reading too much into things here.",02Jun2019,1

343,"Was with a girl for almost two years. One year into it we decided that her car(which was not reliable at all) needed to be replaced. She has horrible credit and no savings(should of taken this as my first red flag) so I offered to help her out if she pay me monthly installments for the vehicle. So we went to a dealership and got her a nice used car under 10k. She has been paying me every month since we purchased the vehicle. Fast forward to now, I’m ready to move on and away from the relationship(it was toxic and just didn’t feel right). So here I am. I have the vehicle in my name still and 6k is left on it. She still has horrible credit(so she couldn’t get approved for a conventional loan to put the vehicle in her name) and no savings still to buy it out from me cash. We live together, and it’s so stressful and toxic I don’t know what I need to do. I just checked the value of the car and it’s worth what is owed(we decided to get an extended warranty when purchased). I would like her to move out but I don’t necessarily trust her enough. I know she will pay me(that’s not my concern). My concern is that she is going to drink and drive and either get pulled over or hit someone. With the car still being in my name and her having no money, I’m worried that I could potentially get sued. She has a habit of turning to alcohol when she’s going through issues, and I just know it will happen. I also have had to take her car privileges away at night while I work because I caught her countless times drinking and driving when I got home. I gave her 4 chances. I just feel like a damn parent to her! Help! :(",02Jun2019,2
344,"Recently I feel as if my friends have been kind of pushed away from me. Like I’m the friend that no one really seems to want around. I never get texted willingly by a lot of them, and I always feel like I’m just the friend who’s “ohh yeah, he’s here too”.

I don’t think they know how much it hurts, I try so hard to reach out to them, help them through things, and just generally be there for them, but lately I just haven’t been spoken to, I feel like I’m always an afterthought, and I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t know if this was my fault or not, I don’t think it is. But I’m so lost, and frankly worried. And this has been on my mind because it’s actually my birthday tomorrow, and last year they threw a huge surprise thing for me, and it was great. I loved them all so much back then and for months after we were amazing. But for the first half of this year, things have just gone downhill, and they never wanna talk to me it feels like. 

I feel like none of them will do anything for me this year, even though I’ve given my heart and soul to nearly every single one of them in times of trouble, when we hang out I’m always there, and I try and be a best friend the best way I know how. 

What can I do? I can’t just find new friends because the ones I have outside of my group aren’t exactly my best friends. These guys are really some of the only ones I’ve had and I’ve had them for years. I just feel really saddened and like it’s imperative to do something.

I also like being creative

I took this job and said let's see how is the real world, it's in a big company which probably won't find an opportunity like it, the advantages are it has a good salary and health insurance and I manage a big place and I'm the second agriculture engineer in the company, besides there are more opportunities to work in coastal places full of blue and green area... I can get experiences on paper for migrating to other countries with no doubt about if this experience is real or not because of the insurance and the taxes in this company.

the disadvantages are, I gain no technical experience, my manager doesn't guide me at all, I even thought he doesn't have the knowledge, I'm not that curious about this field, I'm not passionate about this field and I feel like I'm becoming someone bad because I started to gain my manager attitude (lie, not honest about what he is responsible in a position like that).

357,"Thank you for reading and replying, if you do. I really appreciate it. So torn about this

Background:
I work for a labor union making $42.63/hr net. With benefits my package is worth $63.00.   The union also actually takes $4/hr from my net pay, leaving my net at $38~/hr.   Union also wants union dues monthly, I’m not sure exactly how much they are, as I am a recent initiate, though I am ‘journeyman’, the highest tier. Benefits are excellent but I won’t see them until November! Pension, 401k but no employer match. 
The union is kind of a pain in the ass, and they take a good bit of money from me. They say they do so much for you, but I can’t really tell you what that is. Ideally legal representation, but when do you need that? Rare circumstances? I know I pay them a lot of money out of each check...

I have a job offer from a company that pays $~60/hr. There is a chance that sometimes I will have to work at a straight wage of ~$25/hr, but not likely very much.    There is a chance that this job will fizzle out as the projects are completed near the end of the year. This job should last at least until school starts back around August. I think they offer health insurance but don’t think it’s great. 

I have friends at both companies. Union is more professional, new job offer is more laid back. Both will shoot for 40hr/week. Union does overtime the offer will probably not. 


What would you do?    What should I do?

TL;DR— stay at my more stable but lower paying job(42.63/hr), or take a higher paying job(60/hr) that may not last the end of the year?",02Jun2019,2
358,"Over the summer I’m working an internship in a town that’s not my own. I found an older woman that was offering her home and decided to stay with her. The house is beautiful and it’s in an amazing location so it almost seemed too good to be true. Turns out it kinda is.

The woman is older and lives alone. I think that she’s a little lonely because as soon as I leave my room in the morning I’m trapped in a never ending conversation. On weekdays I’m able to avoid this because I leave for work before she wakes up and get back before she’s back from work. However this weekend has tested my patience.

Here are some examples of her behavior

1) Talking for up to hours without letting me leave the conversation. As I am her guest I try to be as polite as possible. However when I say things like ok I need to go do something, it just doesn’t register with her and she continues to try to talk to me for hours longer.

2) Criticize the work I’m doing over the summer. She doesn’t agree with what I do and spent one night trying to challenge me on what I’m doing. It didn’t seem like she had malicious intent but it came off as very rude and intrusive.

3) Call me lonely. This one was just plain rude. She constantly tells me events happening in the area. While some are very cool, I’m working 40 hour weeks for the first time and I like to just take a day off to work out and have some “me” time. Yesterday was my first Saturday here and apparently there was some big event. She kept pestering me to go and constantly brought it up. She had to have brought it up 4 times. I showed disinterest every time. Then when she came home Saturday night she said “oh I’m worried you’re not going out because you’re lonely and have no one to do stuff with”........ what the hell? I mean yes I’m new to the area but I’m going out with a coworker today and I have friends an hour away that I have the option to hang out with. Even if that wasn’t the case, why would you say that to a person? And that was just because I took one day to myself. I am a person that’s fine just entertaining myself and honestly work has been overwhelming with meeting new people so I really savored my alone time.

4) Insult my plans with a friend. My coworker and I decided to go on a hike and when I told her of this she legitimately followed me around the house even yelling into my room when I had the door closed telling me how there were much better options and how I could be doing so many other things and that my plans were stupid. While I do appreciate when she gives me some suggestions, her inability to accept it when I don’t follow them is really annoying. She kept asking for explanations as to why I was going on a hike ...?? Why does it matter? 

There are a few more things but they’re mostly personal pet peeves.

I just have no idea how to deal with this in a way that’s respectful but shows her that her behavior is really putting me off. I want privacy and alone time and I don’t want 2 hour conversations that I feel I can’t get out of. She seems like an older sweet woman who is just lonely and I understand and don’t want to hurt her feelings but this isn’t ok to me. I just have to spend the rest of the summer here and idk what to do",02Jun2019,1

I just got a new job at my company with better everything; pay, benefits, vacation/sick time- the works. I've never been full time before (always part time with just under 40 hours) so this was a big deal for me. I also got my friend the same job because we use partners when cleaning and there was an extra opening, so I put in a good word for him. Being partners means we do the exact same job, together usually, at the same time everyday.  

My job started great but after a short amount of time I noticed that the other 5 guys we work with (all older gentlemen who've been at this company a while) started to give my friend tasks and have him go with them to help them do things. I didnt mind this at all, in fact I was happy for him that he was learning new skills that I already knew (like drilling, wood cutting and some really basic maintenance stuff) but after a while the other guys started to tell him that I was lazy and that he was doing a the work. After he told me I began to ask them if I could tag along next time they take my friend and usually they said yes but if I didnt ask, they'd just grab my friend and go.

I'm starting to feel like the guys dont ever talk to me and still say that I dont do any work- despite being a partner with my friend and us requiring two people to do most of the work. Now when I pass them, they just say things like why aren't you doing or why are you doing this but not that. I now try my hardest to look for things to do but I just hate being here anymore. 

I dread waking up in the morning to go to work, getting a little bit of anxiety sometimes when I think about it on my days off. I'd go go HR but all the guys here are good pals and have been for a long time, there's no way that I'd get anything done.",02Jun2019,5

362,"So my boyfriend and I have had our Shi-tzu dog for 2 years now. When we first got him we were super excited, my boyfriend didn't REALLY want a dog but I basically made him. I thought it would be good for my boyfriend as his other dog of 17 years had just passed away a few months prior to that and he was his best friend. So we get our dog and I was excited, he was spoiled and we adored him. 

The older he gets the more irate he has become, I work from home so I'm home all of the time but now he is just a nuisance. He constantly pees on my carpet, I had to replace FIVE carpets even though he IS potty trained, goes outside and has doggie pads to use. So I got rid of my living room carpet because be destroyed every single one and now he constantly pees on the floor, poops on the floor, pees on the bedroom floor, destroys toilet paper, we quit using the toilet paper holder because he was always fucking with it. Then he would always drink the toilet water so we had to leave the toilet lid closed but then he would hop ONTOP of the toilet and start fucking with shit, toilet paper, my makeup brushes whatever he could find he would destroy. When we were gone he used to hop on the couch and eat our charger cords so we had to start leaving him in the bathroom. He has peeled the floor in our bathroom, there's like a huge spot where it's just been wrecked, he has scratched a HUGE hole in our bathroom wall behind the door, I had to start putting the plunger away because he would just chew on the stick of that for no reason. He has had all of the toys, attention, love, treats and everything he could possibly need yet he is such a MONSTER. 

I've HAD SO many other dogs before and so has my boyfriend and none of them were even remotely close to acting the way he acts. My boyfriend woke up this morning and he had scratched an even bigger hole in the bathroom and now my boyfriend has had enough. He got dressed saying he was going to get rid of him, just leave him on the side of the road that's how pissed he is. I talked him down for a bit but he's saying if he isn't gone by tomorrow that's what he is going to do.

367,"Background:

I am a teacher that was chaperoning on a school trip two days ago and collected numbers from my group. One kid did not want to give me his number and wrote down a random fake one. I sent out a group message when we arrived basically telling them that it was me, let me know if they run into any trouble, check-in times, and to have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago, Friday, I started receiving prank phone calls and text messages/inappropriate pictures from some kids(based on the voices). This went on for at least a full hour. It started with one number that was spread around to friends. I was getting prank calls about my race(known by my name), and photos. After finally contacting this original number and arguing back and forth they sent me a message basically saying sorry for the misunderstanding, I believe they felt guilty as the conversation did not end in any resolution.  I sent them a text ending with ""Please tell whoever you gave my number to, that after that last message I received (random dick pic), that any further messages or phone calls I receive from them will be reported to the police"". 

&amp;#x200B;

It is now Sunday and I have received no further contact, but I have since found out the names of some of the kids contacting me, and what school they go to which happens to be within 7 minutes of where I live. Since I now know they live in my town I want to report this to the police or at least to their school. I do not necessarily want to report the content of their messages/phone calls because I myself am pretty young and as a current teacher of the same age, understand how kids can be, but I am more concerned about the fact that they know my race (in my town there are little to no other like me), I don't know how far my number has spread but have been contacted by at least six different individuals, and the town I live in is not a very nice one, I know nothing about what kind of people they are/are associated with. I feel uncomfortable even stepping outside.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the fact I sent ""any further messages or phone calls I receive"", would it be wrong of me to continue? What steps could I take?",02Jun2019,6

370,"Lately I'm really depressed and I really have no idea why. I've got a fantastic girlfriend and a lot of good close friends and have every grade (except for a few) higher then B. 
Yesterday I was really tired after I finished playing in front of 4000 people. It took all of my energy because I never played in front of so many people and as soon as I got home I went to take a bath. There I was really sad and noticed the fon(the thing you use to dry your hair, I don't know how it's called in English) next to me.

371,"I am looking for some work advice, specifically transitioning from PR/ad agencies to an in-house role in a company that would be better suited in the long term. 

So I've been working in agencies (digital strategy, client services and project management) for about eight years. It's been great, but the type of work - fast-paced, heavy multitasking, not being the final decision maker, often impossible deadlines, quickly becoming an 'expert' on any topic the client needs - isn't for me anymore. 

Earlier this year I started a side project that isn't commercially driven and doesn't have anything to do with my work. It is a human experience storytelling project. It's really rewarding for me personally and the response has been great. It's even given me the opportunity to get involved in helping charities with my new-found photography ability. This is part of my project and people seem to like the style. I've never been a photographer or thought that would be an interesting part of my project, it's a bonus.

I'm not looking to make my project a full-time thing (yet. It would be really cool if it did further down the road). My immediate focus is to make the transition to the client side and an organisation that I can see myself with in the long-term. Somewhere focused on helping people, human rights, influencing society in a positive way, telling human stories, that kind of thing. I'm not necessarily thinking charity, it could also be a media organisation or something else. 

I feel I'm in completely new territory. I am never sure if my CV is good, my skills are relevant or my achievements impressive enough. If I was going into another agency, I'd know what to do to 'sell' myself. Client side, I'm lost but I am pretty sure that if given the chance, I would do well.

I've sent my CV out to a couple of places but haven't heard back. So I'm clearly not hitting the sweet spot, but also don't know how off I am. Feedback is very rarely given on unsuccessful applications. 

Which brings me to the advice bit. I would be so grateful for any advice on what to do that might not be obvious, thoughts people who have made 'the transition' and what I should especially be highlighting about my experience. 

Thank you for reading. This is much longer than I'd planned so if you made it through I'm so appreciative. Thank you.",02Jun2019,1

373,"I used to constantly have a really strong passion in a particular science field. The longest of which was paleontology. For a long time I was set on pursuing an academic career in paleontology, and I really showed my passion. I spent hours reading websites, my state’s geological survey’s publications, local geology, geologic history, etc. every day. Sometime between 7th and 9th grade I fell out of it. At first, I was confident it would just be replaced by another passion. In the past I was extremely interested in marine biology and astronomy as well. However, I am now a senior in high school and have no strong interest in anything. I love the world of academia but I know that I need to really really really enjoy my academic field to survive in that ultra competitive environment and I just don’t have that type of passion right now. I don’t know what to do.

She used to cry to me about how my other siblings hated her and I'd pet her hair and tell her she was a good mom, I was like 5.  


Then once I turned like 11 and my siblings moved out, she'd be fighting with him over something completely irrelevant to me, and she'd say to him ""I'm leaving you! You and Anon can go f yourselves!"".  


She'd also threaten to leave me on the side of the road all the time if we fought while we were driving.  


I was just thinking, I gave her all this support but when I hit puberty and no one wanted to be my friend, she told me it was no wonder and just tied it into me not cleaning my room or something and be like, ""no one wants to be friends with a lazy ass"". She'd have slapped the shit out of me for that.

 I always had to protect her feelings above my own and I was really good at it.

381,"\*\*Trigger warning - Self-harm/Suicide/Death of Loved One/Weight\*\*

**MENTAL HEALTH -** I'm a 28 year old nurse currently working full time in an office based setting. My currently physical and mental health is at an all time low. In brief, I was in an abusive relationship ages 17-23; in September 2018 I lost a close friend to suicide; in December 2018 I lost my Uncle through a severe stroke which left him brain dead (his life support was turned off). The latter was somewhat traumatizing for me as there was periods he was in ICU in which they would wean off the sedation to assess his brain functioning and he would open his eyes, thrash around the bed and looked very distressed. 

**PHYSICAL HEALTH -** In addition to my poor mental health, my physical health has plummeted and I now weigh the highest I ever have. (172cm, 98kgs) but always fluctuating - which gives me a BMI in the obese category. Yikes. My self esteem has gone down and, especially since my Uncle died from the stroke, I really worry about my personal health.

**JOB -** I have been in my current job for a little over a year after moving interstate. I like my current job, I loved it - but I have found it to be a trigger for me at times after losing my friend to suicide (as it is predominantly mental health related). One part of me knows the large possibility that I won't get the job back again if I quit, but the other part of me knows that my health comes first; and that my issues may continue if I don't take time off. Especially after recent events, I am reminded of how short life is. (Job pays 82k yearly).

**FINANCES -** After my abusive relationship ended I found myself at square one financially. In terms of taking a year off I do not have a mortgage/significant bills. I am currently living with my now (extremely caring &amp; supportive) boyfriend's family with little rent, and would be able to stay with my family for the same reduced rent. I have no debt/credit cards etc - My current savings = $35,000. Come end of the year (as I do not plan on quitting in the immediate few months) would give me an extra $30,000 (post tax) from work. I also have $3800 in shares which I would never touch. I am very frugal with my money, and especially so if I was to quit. 

**WHY I WANT THE YEAR OFF -** I struggle at the moment with my current full time work and mental health, to make time to exercise and to pursue my passions (writing, photography). I would love to focus on a healthy relationship with food and weight loss (60kg is my goal) - to get it under control before the years keep ticking by. I also want to focus on my mental health and am thinking about the possibility of a mental health related 'retreat' or similar (depending on cost). The year would also involve some travel to Thailand/Bali (ie - cheaper destinations). I want to remove all of life's distractions and focus on myself and 'be selfish.' With working full time and not having extended time to myself I feel like I haven't been able to process everything &amp; life just keeps moving on without me.

384,"High school junior

Leading up to this summer, I was hyped. I finally had a good group of friends that I had been spending time with all of the school year. I assumed I would be seeing them quite a bit after the school year ended. 

Now that our summer is here, I’m starting to fear that I am more interested in hanging out and being friends than they are. None of them ever hit me up online or invite me to things, even though many of them are hanging out together in groups. 

Usually whenever I contact them and ask them how it’s going, they respond with the shortest or most disinterested answer possible. “Have you guys done/planned this activity   yet?” “No.” Which isn’t that big of a deal, but I feel like they aren’t that interested in talking to me.

Thus, I haven’t done much this summer. I definitely haven’t hanged out with (let alone seen) any of my friends so far. I spend a lot of days bored at my house.

Any advice on how to reach out to my friends and get together? Or should I try at all? I have trouble getting to know new people, so that’s part of the reason I’m so attached to this group.",02Jun2019,1

388,"Ok so this one is going to get quite personal so I’ll just make up a random name for the girl I’ll be talking about, let’s call her Lucy. So I’ve known Lucy for about 5 years but we were never close and we still aren’t but we are in friendly terms, just not friends if that makes sense, we see each other every Sunday because we go to the same church and she is about a year younger than me. Lucy has 3 siblings and a dad but bout a year ago her mum just up and left their family, it was very suddenly and it was a shock to everyone who knew their family. A few months after Lucy’s family found out that their mum now lives with another man which is even more shocking because everyone who knew her never would have thought she’d do something like this plus she is still married to Lucy’s father. Now Lucy is more or less an outcast against kids our age at church, some of the boys quite explicitly dislike her but most of us girls just don’t talk much with her not because we dislike her or anything, we just don’t have much in common with her and she is a bit less mature so that creates a gap. I don’t know anything about her school life but I have a feels she might also be an outcast at school although I really hope she has a good friend there. So anyway most of the parents at our church are close Lucy’s dad so they know a lot of the stuff that’s happening in their family and today my mum was talking to me again about how we (my friends and I) should spend more time with Lucy because my mum often sees her alone and I felt rly bad again because I don’t really try to include her that much because 1) I just can’t seem to talk with her about much but maybe I’m just not putting in enough effort and 2) I feel really bad about this but I’m kind of embarrassed to get close to her because she is an outcast and I hate that I feel this way. But anyway as my mum was talking to be about including her she told me something that really shocked me even thought I should have seen it coming. She told me that Lucy has been in a really dark place lately because of the whole Hong with her mum leaving the family and living with someone else but to put the cherry on top her mum sometimes comes to the school that Lucy and her older brother go to and tells them that she is gonna take them away from their father to live with her and sometimes she just sits next to them on the bus as they ride home and doesn’t say anything and that has just made things even worse to the point bag Lucy has depression, she doesn’t want to do anything or go anywhere, she is never happy hear says and she is always alone. Her dad knows this but he doesn’t really realise it’s depression, some of the women in our church who know about this have advised his to try take her to a psychiatrist or at least talk to her about counselling or something but he says it’s fine and that she doesn’t need it. Hearing that broke my heart I was crying today because I feel so bad for her but I don’t know what to do about it, I want to get closer to her but as I previously mentioned it’s hard when you don’t have much in common. Plus would it even help if my friends and I tried to be friends with her?? I was wondering what to. Does anyone have any advise in how to deal with this situation? And how can I get closer to her? How could I get over this embarrassment and fear of also being shamed for being friends with her? And just in general is there anything I could do to help her?

389,"About 1 year ago I was approached by someone close (family) who had the capital to start a business, but no technical knowledge. I had been struggling financially and they knew about it... it was promised to me that after the business became profitable, I would be hired and they would compensate me for the time I worked for free. It sounded like a partnership where I would bring my technical knowledge and they would provide the money to sustain the business in the beginning.  
After a few days I found out I wasn't going any say in some very important strategic decisions that I knew would harm the company, and in the following months, that's how I was treated, even though my own wages would be conditioned to the business actually turning a profit, how could I not have a say in anything, if they were not paying me and I was the one doing the coding, setting the website, and even the ONLY person who understood taxes in the company?  


For the past year I've been giving about 11 hours of my day to the company, and I still haven't been paid... they're family and my heart is really divided, I don't know what to do. I've been cut from financial reports, and they always claim the company isn't turning a profit... well, they ALREADY hired 2 paid employees and I'm still unpaid.  


I believe in the company's potential, because I believe in myself. I'm hard working and good natured, I always try to do my best, I really don't want to sue my family members, but I don't know what to do. It seems they don't value my work at all. I KNOW that if I left the company tomorrow, it would go under because they wouldn't have the cash to hire someone to do my job, **but I have the feeling that they're waiting for the company to HAVE that amount of cash so they can dish me**, especially because they don't seem to have the intent to really give me a real partnership.  


There are some details that really bother me. I see them purchasing wine and commenting on wine varieties and tastings that they're going to do... but they still don't pay me? Worst of all, I'm not even offered wine. They've also installed very expensive cameras in the whole company building and one camera is directed straight to me, it's really messing with my emotional condition. They leave the company and they keep an eye on the cameras to see if I'm working.  


I've never felt so devalued in my life, I really don't know what to do. I'm afraid to sue, I'm afraid to leave the company suddenly and become a renegade in the family. I been thinking about moving to another country and starting afresh, this whole situation seems surreal to me, I feel like I became a slave and I have no way out.  


Please shed a light on my situation, I don't even know who to talk to about this.",02Jun2019,1
390," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

394,"To put it bluntly, I don’t really have friends. I only hang out with one girl in my free time and no one else. My social skills are kind of underdeveloped and I have social anxiety so it’s really hard for me to meet new people without getting too anxious and it’s hard for me to relax and have fun. Nobody texts me throughout the day. Nobody really reaches out to me except for her.

This one friend that I have, let’s call her jenny, is very extroverted and has lots and lots and lots of friends. I can’t even count how many people she hangs out with. It seems like she goes out and does stuff with people who she’s not even really close with. 

Last summer, it was basically just me and her. She has always gotten on my nerves a lot because she is extremely self-centered and sort of mean at times. I remember last summer I vowed to distance myself from her when I got to school and made new friends. And when highschool started she started gaining friends left and right like crazy. And I didn’t. Since I didn’t have any other people to hang out with, I stuck with her, even though I didn’t really like her.

Now when we hang out, I can’t help but feel sometimes jenny leaves while we are together for other people, without telling me. I always am the second person for her to meet in a day, before or after she does something really exciting with other friends. If I can’t do something with her because I’m preoccupied, she will find something else to do with a group of 7 other people. She does things everyday that would be the most exciting thing I’d do in 3 months. 

She sometimes says hurtful things to me while she is trying to joke. A few days ago, we spent a few hours together, and she looked at my phone and said “wow you haven’t got a text all day”. That made me sad for her to point it out like that. She does things like this a lot. I notice her and her other friends tease each other constantly, so maybe it’s normal and I shouldn’t be so sensitive? But I can’t help feeling that way. 

She does other annoying things too, but I can’t list all of them. I think we have just grown apart since we used to be so close. She seems totally oblivious to this though, and I think she still wants to be friends with me. (Just for the record, we do have some fun times, but I’m always left with a bad taste in my mouth after she leaves)

In all of this, I don’t really know how to feel. I only have about 2 months left where I live before I move, and I want to have a memorable summer before I leave. It makes me feel weird that she has so many people and I have just her. And I don’t even really like the one friend I have. The only thing is, she is the only person I could do things with this summer before leaving.

My question is that am I overreacting? Am I the toxic friend for feeling weird about her new friends? Is it worth distancing myself from her? 

I think I’m just insecure about this, and I’ve mixed up my values from taking advice from her on how to make friends. I feel like things she claims as normal are not for me, and it’s messing up my perception of right and wrong.



Sorry for the long post! Thanks in advance for your opinions! :)",02Jun2019,1
395,"So my mother doesn’t have much time left, we’re not sure how long, but her condition is deteriorating rapidly. 

So, I have a decent job, good hours, and my contract doesn’t end until August. If I quit now, breaking my contract, I will lose my opportunity to continue with this company in the future. I’m afraid of not being able to find another job, since I’m living in a foreign country and I don’t speak or read the language very well, and it took a long time job hunting to land this job. However, I’m pretty sure my mom won’t last until August.

I want to keep working because I don’t have much in savings and obviously there’s things that need to be paid for and daily expenses, etc. But, I don’t want to keep working and end up regretting not spending more time with my mom. How should I balance this situation? 

1. To quit and stay with her, but have no income whatsoever coming in. And also, losing my chance to be able to rejoin the company in the future as long as I finish up my contract. The upside is I’d be able to spend more time with her. Be less tired from working all day and then taking care of her when I get home. The downside is the financial insecurity, and also just giving up my responsibility to the kids that I am teaching (I am teaching English to preschool aged kids), and finding a replacement teacher is difficult especially with the school year coming to a close.

2. Don’t quit and spend my time off with her as much as possible. It’s tiring, but doable. We have family that can help with caregiving. I’m just afraid she will be hurt if I don’t quit this job, like I’m putting her second to my career.  And also, that I’ll regret it in the future that I didn’t spend this time with her.

I’m also afraid that I’m just using my job as an excuse and can’t deal with facing death like an adult should.  And because we are Asian, there is definitely this culture that the child should be there for their dying parents no matter what. 

But the financial insecurity is also real, my savings could last if I didn’t work for eight months maybe stretching to a year. That should give me ample time to spend time with her, deal with funeral things and all that. But what if I can’t find another job soon enough and the money doesn’t last. What if there are surprise expenses. There’s just so much uncertainty, that knowing I can have this job as a safety net (I’m guaranteed a position if I want to reapply to this company, as long as I finish out the contract) makes me feel less anxious about the whole situation.

Just wondering if anyone has their two cents. Thanks.",02Jun2019,1

397,"So I’m a 14 yr girl in high school and I wondered if anybody has been through a similar experience as what I’m about to share. 

I’m not sure if I should mention this but I have a mild case of Asperger syndrome, when I was younger I would never want to make or talk to new people. But since coming into high school my social skills and gaining of friends has increased dramatically. 

So when I founded out that the so called popular group of friends were asking me to hang out I got really hyped. I would text them often, ask to hang out. You know the basics. 

But after a while I found out that most of my friends and others that weren’t included in that group were saying how I can be very clingy and over friendly when my only intention was to build a stronger connection with this new group of people. 

And I always think it’s my behaviour that drives people away because I found out they were talking about me for a long time and only one girl who was honest and still a good friend of mine, confronted me and told me what the deal was. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to become less clingy or to build relationships up without coming across as too needy / clingy? 

Thank you so much ☺️",02Jun2019,1

406,"Hey All,

Everytime I smell perfume I hate it. I can't breath and I get very dizzy. It's so hard for me to focus in uni that I dropped out in second year. Everywhere I go there's fucking perfume. I'm not allowed to wear a mask during an exam or wear a hat. (Obvs) But I can't avoid perfume forever. I'm literally like a mess always running away from people and covering my nose. 

I've talked to doctors about it and they said all I can do is avoid... really now. I've tried to avoid. But fucking people are inconsiderate and literally showers themselves with fucking nasty ass perfume that I can smell from 3ft away. 

I hate how my brain just shuts off when I take an exam due to smelling certain scents that trigger my brain. I get a massive headache. I've tried taking reactine but that doesn't really help anymore. Taking benadryl just makes me drowsy. I can't be living off of pills for the rest of my life because of perfume. In the past I've talked to a TA/prof to let me sit somewhere else in the classroom. I can't live like this forever. Does anyone know how I can decrease my way of smell besides covering my nose?

407,"Hey guys! I'm Pri, and I'm 19 years old. I live with my parents, but I'm moving to college next school year. I've been diagnosed with depression, body dysmorphic disorder, anxiety disorder, and several other mental illnesses, and because of that, I'm on a cocktail of medications (Lexapro, Geodon, and Klonopin which is a benzo) to help deal with my conditions. I am happy to say that these medications along with therapy have brought me from being dysfunctional to fairly normal, if there is such a thing as normal.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also prescribed birth control a few months ago to deal with painful cramps during my cycle. Fast forward to 36 hours ago. I mistakenly believe I've taken my cocktail of 3 medications but I've only taken my birth control. This repeats again, twice (I take medications 3 times a day) when I think I've taken medication but haven't (there's been a lot on my mind recently, and I'm getting sick so I'm tired). 

&amp;#x200B;

So because I'm getting a cough, I went to bed at around 11 pm last night and lay down expecting to go to sleep. I can't. For another 3 hours. My mind starts racing with worst case scenario thoughts regarding school, relationships, health, death, etc. and I try to get my computer out to write the thoughts but they are too fast for my fingers to type. My computer runs out of battery and I try to get in bed to close my eyes, but I feel restless and start pacing the room. I sit on my bed. My mom and sister then come into the room to go to sleep and they're surprised I'm still awake (we're in my grandparent's house this weekend and we all share a room). My sister turns on her phone flashlight and points it to the ground and it is absolutely blinding, I get a headache looking at it and the dim hallway light looks ridiculously blinding as well and I tell her to turn it off. She turns it off and heads to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I know it, I hear both of them snoring. My heart at this point is probably at around 200 bpm and I don't know what to do. I blame it on my anxiety because at this point it hasn't registered in my brain that I've forgotten my medications. I look outside and everything looks unnaturally bright. My palms are super sweaty, and my stomach feels unsettled. I feel like I'm in the midst of a panic attack mixed with a stimulant high. I feel extremely jittery. I keep switching positions and clutching the blankets or I start shaking uncontrollably (almost like a shiver).

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, things start becoming cloudy because I'm not sure if I was asleep or drifting in and out of consciousness due to possible seizures. There are city lights far away outside the window, and they are reflected in a large mirror. Every time I look at these, I see trails behind them as my eyes move from one spot to another. Everything looks as bright as early morning when it is actually around 3 am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I drift out of consciousness, I am hit with disturbing visions and emotions, so bad that I wake up nearly crying each time. Things involving corpses, betrayal, feelings of guilt and shame, things I've never thought could be problems are now magnified and I feel like my emotions are controlling me. I feel as if I can predict my dreams and the next occurrence. Every time I am conscious, I can't stop staring at the lights reflected in the mirror, I probably got lost looking at them while completely paralyzed head to toe for around 4 minutes each time while my body slightly twitches from being so tight. I am scared of drifting out of consciousness due to the scary feelings again. I feel like vomiting and crying out for help but I am too paralyzed to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

This cycle repeats for what feels like until the sun rises.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to tell my parents about these symptoms because they will just get mad at me for forgetting to take my medications and possibly be more reluctant about sending me off to college alone. I don't know what to do. I am now in a horrible emotional place due to the visions I saw in my weird paralyzing dreams. Every possible worst doubt I have about every person in my life is magnified, and I feel like reaching out to them to make sure that these fears aren't true, but at the same time, I don't want to be too emotional or seem psycho which I already have the reputation of having. :(",02Jun2019,0
408,"I work at a very popular attraction in the UK, currently an entry-level position that has all kinds of age ranges, students up to retirees. I have a diploma in Animal Management and a bachelors degree in Wildlife Conservation &amp; Ecology, so naturally when their seasonal employment opportunity came round I jumped at the chance - I knew it would be menial tedious work but I figured it put my foot in the door. 

I’m 25 and over the years have collected numerous wildlife-related volunteering stints to put on my CV, and my previous job was working in a nursing home (no interest whatsoever was just the most available work in my town at the time, but gave me plenty of opportunity to prove I can work long and hard). 

A few weeks ago I queried my higher up about getting in contact with either the volunteer team or the ranger team to do some shadowing to see what their job role was like and get some experience, one that’s far more related to my interests and qualifications. I didn’t hear anything back. I’m sure they get that kind of thing all the time, but I thought such a large company like this would be willing to help their employees improve and progress through their career. I’ve no interest in cleaning up after sloppy guests forever and at the moment I’m barely making money because the drive in every day is costing me what I’m earning almost. 

I feel like I’m going to be doing menial work for the rest of my life, I feel like at 25 I should be moving up by now with all the work I’ve put in to get experience and qualifications, it’s very disheartening.

410,"I’m writing this while currently being very upset.
I am a teenager and my father and I don’t always get along. 

It feels like he has a image of what he want me to be like and I just can’t reach his standards.
He wants a girly daughter who’ll wear dresses, Skirts and bright colors. And that’s just not who I am. As long as I can remember I’ve never liked that stuff, I was a girl who grew up loving to be more like the boys. Interested in trucks, Climbing trees, fighting and just hanging out with the guys. You can’t climb trees and wrestle while in a dress and that’s mostly why I hated them as a kid. Now I just feel really uncomfortable in them, Especially since I’m also really uncomfortable in my own skin and I like to just cover it up with jeans and t-shirts.

My dad like I mentioned, Doesn’t like that. He also doesn’t like that I spend time on the phone. Or if I get bad grades. And I completely understand that. But I’ve got issues, I’m not diagnosed with everything but I feel down alot. I’m tired all of the time and I just want to spend most of my time in my room when I get home from school. But since I know that’s not what my dad wants, I’ve tried to change. I’ve got a bunch of new friends and I hang out with them around two times every week. My grades have gotten better and I’ll most likely have two As. I used to get F in Spanish but this year I’ve been able to raise it to an D. I’ve also started to wear more colors and girly stuff. and like I said, do other stuff then just spend time on my phone in bed. But it seems to still not be enough.

I have bought a jumpsuit to wear for a party, But while doing that my dad complained on me not wearing a dress. 
And my grades which has become so much better, All I get in respond from him is a short ”that’s good” and then the subject is dropped.
I buy clothes that are more colorful, He says they are pretty and that’s it.


I find it super hard to be social and I have alot of anxiety, So changing myself to be more open and talk with new people like I’ve been doing lately, Has been extremely hard. And wearing clothes I’m uncomfortable in isn’t any easier.
I do it all for him and he doesn’t care or even seem to notice.

I realize it’s not normal to be the way I am and I ones got the courage to ask my father to let me speak to a professional. But he said I could just speak with my family instead. I don’t have the courage to ask again. 


I’m so tired, I’m so emotionally exhausted. No changes I make is enough. I feel like a disappointment in his eyes, It feels like he’s never proud of me. He gets mad at me all the time and I just feel like locking myself in my room and never step outside again. And I don’t know how to talk with him about this, Because he’s a person that doesn’t take stuff he doesn’t understand seriously. I have times where I feel extremely down for no reason at all and after a while he’ll ask about it and then get mad when I’m not able to explain why I’m sad.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t talk with him and I can’t continue changing more than I already have because then I’ll feel even worse. It feels like im out of options.",02Jun2019,1

I'm sorry this is a long one, but I would really appreciate the advice.

We were together for three years. He owns his house, so I ended up moving in with him. We now have three dogs. For a while, we were in a bit of a rut. He'd been fired. I had recently been without a job, but was working again for little pay. My car had been repossessed, but things got better for us.

I was able to save a little bit of money, and as our relationship was on the ruts I was considering using that money to move out. I instead ended up using it on a down payment for a car. He got his car working, and got a pretty decent job.

This is where things go wrong. I am bisexual, and in the past we had mentioned me having a girlfriend. I had experience with open relationships, but explained that there cannot be jealousy, and we'd have to have open and honest communication. He met some people online, and ended up hanging out with them and hitting it off. I was ecstatic for him. He's been wanting to make more friends with similar interests. He admitted that some girls had come on to him when giving them a ride home, but out of respect for me nothing happened. We talked about the open relationship and I told he should go for it. Flash forward to next weekend, he had hung out at their place. This girl was a cam model. Makes porn and everything. He told me he had been felt up, but once again out of respect for me nothing had happened. I was turned on by the fact, and ended up blowing him while he talked about it.

By this point, he had been talking to her a lot. She knows about our situation, and she even refers to me as ""Mrs."" He wouldn't give me details, but I know they were planning on having sex this weekend. I was totally okay with it. On Thursday, wanting to go out and explore myself, I asked about my interest and wanting to explore with other men as well. He immediately lost and told me no. He said I was able to go out with girls, but not men. Feeling the tense, I figured with this jealousy, the open relationship wouldn't work because he would only be benefitting. I told him I was uncomfortable with him having sex with this girl. HE. LOST. IT. He told me they had already been talking, and he couldn't go back on his word because he had finally made friend and didn't want to seem like he was going back on his word. I asked him what they said that he couldn't take back and he told me it was none of my business. I try to explain that if they are a part of the poly community, they will understand boundaries. Eventually he told me I could do what I wanted, but there would be consequences meaning he would kick me out. He refused to stop his relationship with other girl. We ended up breaking up. I didn't sleep at all that night. I was a mess. We didn't talk, but he kept asking me if there was anything I needed to say as he has always been bad with communication and waits for me to start the conversation.

Yesterday we're back out the house. He keeps asking me what my plan is. I have low self-esteem, and just out of habit I ask him to have sex. I'm absolutely disgusted with myself as we're doing it and even end up crying. Part of me is hoping he might just change his mind. Stupid. I know. I have absolutely no friends and no money, and at this point I'm looking into what options I might have. I am pretty drunk at this point, and he is showering. It is very obvious at this point that he is getting ready to see the girl. He's kind of beating around the bush, but tells me he's leaving in an hour, and I can't stay there while he's gone. 10 minutes pass and tells me he's leaving now, so I need to go. I'm pretty drunk, but he makes me leave. I have to work in the morning, but he tells me he's not staying the night, so I can come back and get ready in the morning. I'm too drunk to drive, so I end up driving to a park nearby and ""sleep"" there the entire night (I maybe got 1 hour of sleep. I am on the edge at this point.)

I end up getting back to the house at 6:30. He doesn't get home til 7am! I don't ask questions cause I know what happens. I'm just absolutely disgusted with myself. He's being a rude dick, banging on the door while I'm showering and such. He tells me in the future I could've found a girl, and tries to blame the whole situation on me. I lose it, but am still kind and make sure to say anything I don't regret. He tells me I need to figure out a plan because I can't come back.

I've been looking in to homeless shelters and will probably continue to sleep in my car. One dog is his, one he says he will watch until I find a place, and the other I'm taking to surrender. I'm absolutely broken. In a span of two days, I'm losing my dogs, my home, my best friend, and boyfriend. He's made me completely dependent on him. He's a terrible human being,and I can't stop crying but I want to apologise and try to do whatever I can to stop this. Help. Where do I go from here?",02Jun2019,1

414,"I guess a bit of history is required. My parents had a love marriage (contrary to the arranged marriages that are common here) (Indian here) and even after 27 years of marriage, mom's family hasn't accepted their son in law. I'm the younger 19 year old daughter while I have an older 26 year old brother.

Mom has depression from work stress and the fact that she feels lonely. That she has no family for herself. Both me and brother are away for our studies. I'm home right now for my summer year end break. My brother will be home in a weeks time.

My dad has anger issues and depression and takes meds on and off. He usually blames work stress for it. Yesterday, after already being stressed about work, mom and dad got into a fight.
About not travelling for vacations enough (mom) but being too sick and tired to actually travel (dad). I knew the fight was going on but actually kept quite and didn't interfere at all. Mom was giving dad the silent treatment at dinner and finally he broke. He slammed the plates and shouted. He even shoved mom/ hit her and it got nasty. He spent the rest of the night in his room in a huff. Mom already had  issues related to her spine and neck and this only worsened it.

Dad had never been physically abusive and she was so scared that she spent the night on my bed with me. Both of us didn't sleep. The next morning dad apologized (of sorts) and even went on to say that she has to stop with the tantrums as he was feeling suicidal and that he didn't want his children to be fatherless.

Dad went away on a business trip tonight and I guess that will serve as a breather for both of them. But I doubt things will ever become normal again. They've had nasty verbal fights ever since I was 12 and after years and years of butting in and trying to solve it, I had given up. No matter how many times I tried to mediate, it never worked, but it rather affected me quite drastically and my friends and therapists had suggested I stay away from their issues. Me not butting in yesterday was my attempt in doing so. (Eventhough I did make him stop hurting her and shooed him away after that). Leaving for uni (I'm done with 1 year now) was refreshing as I didn't have to know anything about the fights. Which made me resent my brother now.

He's been away since age 17 and that's when the fights were beginning. He never had to deal with any of their fights while I'm constantly having to butt in and help. I hope that he can help with the issue, once he's here, a week later as I honestly don't know how I can help solve this problem.

420,"Me and my boyfriend have had a rough relationship and it had become physical on both ends a couple years ago and we decided to break up and about a year ago we got back together. In the beginning we were both very apologetic about our past behaviors. We still have issues we’re working through as people and as a couple but about two months ago we went on vacation and got into a huge argument and he pushed me. Today we got into another argument and I got in his face, I didn’t touch him and I realize I shouldn’t have gotten in his face and when I did he told me he would punch me if I got in his face again. So after we make up about whatever we’re fighting about I obviously must ask if he would really punch me if I got in his face and he says yes! Am I wrong to think this isn’t okay? I know I shouldn’t have gotten in his face or in the future shouldn’t when we’re arguing but am I crazy to think it’s completely unacceptable for him to tell me he would punch me for this? Or at all for that matter??",02Jun2019,1

I lost my motivations.
My ideas
My skills
My emotions
My will to live
And not so recently even my memories, to a point I don't remember my past, things I've done or stuff I was good at, I sometimes have memories and I can't tell if they are real or fake anymore, if I was really there and when.
Leaving that aside I recently quit college, I'm not currently in a place were I can nor want to study  at least I'm at peace with that decision, but I need to work and I want to (I have a strong works ethic) the problem is that work is scarce here, so I'll move up north of Italy and try to find any kind of jobs and licks  hopefully and work my life out.
I really don't know how tho. 
I need advice, on what to look for  where to sleep, hostel tips, cupons, thrift stores, I have no idea were to begin guys
I'm atm with my some off family  but I'm being a nuisance to them so I'm thinking of going away before they can kick me. 

All I have on me is clothing, a good phone and little over 100€ (I'm dirt poor I know..) 
It's not much but it's more than most had at their worst and I should be grateful.
I'm not old, I'm a good looking young man, I'm just lost and void inside I need to go away from the madness that echoes on my mind by my incompetence before I do something irreversible that I might regret.

423,"So here’s the story: I live with family and have never had my own room. I had a futon I would stay on in my uncles room but they recently have moved out to their own place, thus leaving me with my own room. I’m taking on all their bills which now includes half of the rent, internet, utilities. Etc. 

Granted I haven’t had my own room since I was about 15 years old and I am 26 now. I’m extremely excited to have my own space and furnish it and do what i want with it. But my grandparents, who I’m staying with to support financially as they are on fixed income, are against a lot of my ideas. I made it clear I don’t need a futon and I don’t want a television in my room, among other things.

They have been arguing with me with the sole fact that my room should now be a more community space since family is always visiting. My nieces, aunts, all live in the area. Their arguments are “where will the kids watch television or take naps without another bed ?” 

I need advice on how to go about this. Am I wrong to assume this should be my space and my space alone? I don’t want to drop the “well I’m helping you guys financially” card.  And further, am I wrong for having half a mind to finally move out and let them handle themselves? I’m 26 and I don’t mind helping family, but privacy is essential.

Anyway.. I’m 21F, and I live with my dad. After my parents went through a nasty divorce after 27 years of marriage. When they’d went their separate ways a few years ago I decided to stay with him. I’m in college and I have a job but not financially stable enough to get my own place. 
We’re usually really close, and I love him to death, but we recently moved to a new neighborhood and things haven’t been great between us. I help out where I can, and I should help out around the house more, but I’m 21 and stupid and spend most of my time when I’m not working out with my friends. I feel like my dad is taking out all of his anger and resentment he has for my mother on me, and expects me to provide a lot of “wifely” duties around the house that he doesn’t have from my mom anymore. Ive been struggling with mental health issues for about 2 years now  and his hot and cold unstable behavior makes for a really unhealthy living environment for the both of us. I’ve tried to tell him how I feel, but he’s really hard to talk to and does a great job of dismissing my feelings and making me feel stupid for feeling anything.
I’ve been dealing with subtle jabs for months now. Small arguments, usually which I’m the one to resolve. I contribute financially where I can, but as I’ve mentioned I’m 21 and in college with a job and still broke as fuck.
Last night I went out and got pretty trashed. When I got home, him and I started to argue and I absolutely just lost my shit. There’s no excusing my behavior, it was bad. Extremely out of character for me, but I snapped and screamed and threw things and said the most hurtful shit and it resulted in one of our neighbors calling the cops.
They showed up briefly, realized I was just drunk &amp; irrational and left. As I said earlier, we just moved into a new neighborhood and the fact that we caused such a disruption in the middle of the night is embarrassing for him and me. 
My dad is completely done with me. He wants me out of the house, to kick me off the car insurance, pretty much told me to sober up and get the fuck out. 
So now I’m here. Sitting in the living room of my moms one bedroom apartment. My mind is in a very dark place. I don’t know where to go from here. What to say, how or when to apologize, what to do with my life, where to get another car when he inevitably takes the one he pays for back. Where to live long term, how to save money and get my own place eventually. I’m just completely lost. And need advice. If you read all of that, I love you. And help. Thanks.",02Jun2019,1

I guess paypal doesn't allow you to pay with a savings account, so when I go on ebay, I pay for things using my Bank Account, but the money is never taken out.

So far, I have bought and received 3 items without paying for them, and I don't know what to do.

This ""glitch"" only doesn't work when it's a real person selling an item, as the payment never goes through. But when it's a company or bulk selling on ebay, it goes through and I get the item for free.

My first purchase I got for free happened about 5 months ago and to this day I have never gotten charged for it. I asked the seller if they received money but only got an automatic reply, so I guess they don't care. 

  
Do I keep buying stuff for free since no one has noticed, do I stop because I could get in serious trouble, and could I get in serious trouble for this? It's not my fault technically, it's a glitch in the system, but would I get in trouble for exploiting this? Has this ever happened to anyone before?

Using backup for obvious reasons. They other night was my partners going away party, and I got a little too drunk. 

I can barley remember what instigated me to be angry and moody, but my partner noticed. when we got back to her place she called me out on my behavior, and I instantly lashed out. Saying some horrific things things about her and her friends. She kindly asked me to go home then see her the next day, but I took that rather personally and went off. At that point I knew I was going to say some shit I’ll regret, I said “I won’t come back “ threatening to leave her etc, absolutely disgusting and cringeworthy stuff. I know I was blackout, but I love this girl so much and do not want to leave her. We ended sleeping together to sleep it off. I kept apologizing and she said to move past it.

Is there any way that I can ensure her that was just a bad episode ? What can I do to be better ? It’s been a couple of days and I’m sick to my stomach anxious thinking about it, I feel absolutely awful thinking about the things I said.

We have had issues with me overreacting to things, as she’s quite rational and composed.

He doesn't want us to work as he was hoping that he wikl heal fast. But a year later it just gotten worst and my older brother is turning 18 and his allowance is about to be removed. My dad is hoping that my brother is going to find a work but he didn't, so my sister try to find a job and got accepted in McDonald's. 3 months later, my sister referred me to the job and got accepted. But I have problem with my memory and having a hard time remembering things so it took me so long to learn a basic job.

Since I've been missing out a lot of sleep, I'm failing English and Math, but thats not it since my brother is a dodge when I got home from work at 12 am and woke him up he gets angry but I'm just so depressed that I didn't care anymore and replied to him you're a piece of shit and you worth nothing you dumb bitch. Well he stayed quite, I forgot to wright that my dad is over controlling and manipulative. He always say something about my big brother which just pissed me off and just keep complaining. So I popped and say I don't care about your little fucking temper so shut the fuck up. Month later, my dad is asking for money as we have so much debt now and doesn't have anything to pay for rent, so me and my sister gave him money.

439,"I finished writing my first novel a few months ago. I've been looking for places where I can find people who may want to read my story. I've found several sites that have beta readers for hire but I've been saving my money for an editor and creative writing classes. I couldn’t afford to hire any more than one or two people.

I was wondering if anyone knows about a website or community where you can share your story for free and let people read if they so choose? Places that prefer print books would work too. I self-published the novel on Amazon in order to test out the cover I designed. I'm not advertising it at the moment, I just wanted to have it up so that I could order copies as I please.

I don't care about being compensated for my work at the moment. Truthfully, I'd just really enjoy having someone read one of my stories as I don't have a lot of people in my life willing to do so. Constructive or even harsh criticism is encouraged. Writing for so long and never being able to share my work makes working feel rather pointless.

If you'd like to know about the genre and plot of my book:

""The Paper Ghost"" is a science-fiction/fantasy dystopian story centred around a murder mystery led by the ghost of the victim and the necromancer who accidentally brought them back to life. The Necromancer, Lenore Laymon, is a wanted fugitive who works in an underground theatre with her lover, Odell Averill. They are trapped in the city they live in under a glass cage by the city’s dictators. While trying to create a mechanism to destroy the cage, Lenore accidentally uses her powers to resurrect the ghost of some unknown person. The ghost and Lenore embark on a journey to discover who the ghost was while unearthing the extent of the city’s corruption and the price for burning the midnight oil until the lamp runs dry. The book is around 119,000 words with mature/adult themes. The story progression is quite slow and it is the first book in what I plan to eventually be a series.

445,"I work at a grocery store, produce to be exact. It’s alright, can be pretty damn boring but I am a decent employee and I get my work done. However, these past couple of months it’s starting to show it’s real colors. 

First off, I have a boss that won’t communicate with me at all (or it seems like he won’t). The only time I will hear a word from him is if he is telling me something I need to get done, or if I did something wrong, outside of that I don’t get anything. I don’t know, not a big deal but just shows that I’m not really valued or cared about. My assistant boss is okay though. 

About a couple weeks ago, they brought me up to the office and had a chat about how awful I was doing. I agreed with them, but it wasn’t all entirely on me. I close the department, and with that I usually have a list of stuff to do/they will tell me what needs to get done before they head out. So what I am saying by that is that if they don’t tell me to do it, I won’t put it as my priority. Well they talked to me and showed how poorly I was doing, *with everything that I wasn’t being told what to do.* I remember the night before the stuff they wanted me to do and it was all done and in a pretty good fashion. However, since some of the displays were empty and I wasn’t told to keep my eye out on them, *it was my fault.* I had a problem with that and me being the sole problem of that, but I bit my tongue and moved on because it wasn’t turning into anything more than just a talk. 

What I didn’t like about the talk was that they started comparing me to somebody who has been working there for a couple of months. Before I go on, I am only a part time worker, I go to school full time and really only work 2-3 days/12-18 hours a week. I just have this job to have some pocket cash on me so my parents don’t have to spend on my extra necessities (lunch, gas, etc.) The lady they are comparing me to works 4-5 days/30-40 hours a weeks. She is almost working full time hours, so I don’t like how they were comparing me to her when we are two entirely different employees. And since nobody tells me anything about what’s going on, I’m sure she knows more than me.

On Thursday (the day before my birthday, and I am still suffering through this), I had a nasty stomach flu episode. I have thrown up all day, was dehydrated as hell, I couldn’t even get out of bed. So I had to call out. Neither of the managers were there, so I had to tell one of the coworkers that I couldn’t make it. I don’t know if this is gonna happen, but I am just preparing for a write up since I am gonna assume that they have there eyes all over me at this point. 

Tbh, I should have quitted from this hell hole months ago, however the only reason why I stay is because they are very lenient with my college schedule (when college starts i’m pretty much a “can only work weekends” type of employee because I book my semesters so i can finish up school). Tbh, only like 4-5 people there are only really respectful to me. I don’t feel like they care about me. I can’t even get a short sleeve shirt out of them, I have been asking for about a month from them and they just aren’t giving it to me because “they don’t have access to it” while I am seeing a bunch of other people getting short sleeve shirts. 

What should I do? Should I just leave? I really don’t want to, but if it’s the right thing to do I will.",02Jun2019,2
446,"Hey!

I'm trying not to sound entitled here but it will probably come off that way. My parents and I agreed a while ago that I'd be getting a switch for my nineteenth birthday. I was away at college for my birthday a week ago so when I didn't recieve any word about a gift from them, I figured they were waiting for me to get home. However, I just got home yesterday and I still haven't heard anything about it. They gave me other birthday presents people left for me but nothing from them.

Honestly, I've been really really excited about this gift for a long time so I don't know whether asking about it would be rude. I'm sure they have a good reason for doing what they are and I'm not upset at them in any way, I'm mostly just really excited about it (and, it should go without saying that if something happened which made them unable to get me that gift, I would completely understand and would not be upset. I just would like to know). 

Do you have any advice about this?

447,"Okay just to give some context i've recently split up with my partner of 10 years it's been almost 3 months now (I'm completely over it) and after the breakup i met a girl on fb who is best friends with one of my girl bestfriends. We quickly became friends with benefits and she's always said she isn't wanting a relationship due to not being ready for one. But over the last few months we have been talking on the phone for like 8-10 hours a day for the last 2 months nearly every day. We don't get a chance to meet up very often due to the distance between us but she's been acting alot more coupley and stuff by saying stuff like ""Oh i miss you so much i wish i could come see you"" and ""Sorry for phoning so late i just wanted to hear your voice"" Now her best friend who is also mine suggested to me that i'm only infatuated due to her essentially being my rebound. Her friend kinda pushed me into the idea of just fucking someone else to show me that it's just because it's a rebound. So i met up with a girl from tinder and we ended up having sex i just felt like shit and sad after it and overall a bad experience overall.

451,"To start with all the information I have is second hand from my mother and sister, and this is what I know so far.

So, my sister calls me today and tells me that  our brother has been sending voice messages on PlayStation to his friends asking them if he should ""jump out his window"" or ""bang his head against the wall"" or ""get a knife and stab himself"". 

Apparently these friends of his have been saying mean things about him and this was his attempt to try get them to ""like him"". He is a very sensitive kid so he gets extremely upset when he thinks people are laughing at him. 

I know he doesn't understand how serious these things he has been saying are, which makes me more worried that he may actually try something. 

I am going back home tomorrow to speak to him but I am not really sure how I should go about it. I know he looks up to me so I think I may be able to get more out of him than my Mother and Sister have.

To be honest my gut feeling was that of anger. I am angry at him for saying these things, and angry at these kids for talking shit about him, but I know that's not the right attitude to approach him with. 

But what is the right attitude? What can I say to him that will resonate and make him take it on board. Apparently at the minute, he's mostly concerned with having his PlayStation taken from him! 

I really want him to understand that what he is saying in no joke, but at the same time I don't want to be the scary adult shouting, telling him he's done wrong. 

If anyone can offer any advice I would be extremely grateful.",02Jun2019,2
453,"My mother in law dropped a bomb on my husband last week. She called him out of the blue and told him she’s 99.9% sure the man he believed is his father was NOT.

We’re trying to find a DNA test kit that he can do with his possible aunt to find out if they’re related. She lives 2000 miles away though.

We make out and talk about how we each other when we drink but otherwise not really. She also seems to have a little bit of a drinking problem. Last time I had communication with her was a few days ago when she said she's still trying to figure herself out and if she likes men are and I said that we probably shouldn't drink together then. She said it feels like we broke up but we were never official and she asked if we could still be friends and I said I didn't know but I want to. She also teared up a little.

457,"TL;DR: I cooked some meat in oil and watered dishwashing soap

When I'm done cooking and I'm lazy I will leave the old oil in the pan and reuse it later, if it's not burnt, but if I'm feeling less lazy I dumb the oil and let the pan sit with some soapy water.

I come back hungry, not thinking, and just dump some fresh oil with what I thought was old oil and add my burger patties to cook. 

Now that I am done I was gonna be diligent and actually clean everything only to horrifically realize I never finished washing the pan.

Whenever we are alone in the kitchen, my sister plays YouTube.

It’s not even like she’s trying to get back at me, as I always use headphones whether people are around or not.

I suck it up and move along

I whip out my speaker and blast Vsauce

459,"Hi, my name is (J). I recently got out of a relationship that cost me alot of energy, tears, and money, etc. I thought I loved this girl (E) but I soon found out that she was cheating on me and talking bad about me behind my back. I’m not sure if I what I did after is completely healthy but maybe after a week of drinking and crying and talking to this one girl (M) who helped me through the whole ordeal, ended up coming over a couple of times and while nothing happened, last night something did. Now, I know for a fact I need time to recover after a serious relationship and space to fond myself and evaluate what I/E could’ve done better in the relationship but I honestly thrive in relationships. I can’t see myself without being in one. That being said, I feel extremely guilty because when I do have sex with M or kiss her or even touch her in a romantic way I think of E and how she screwed me over so bad. I feel like I jumped into this without much thought because I was hurting and was essentially touch starved. M is a very sweet and caring girl and from what I have seen she seems very genuine compared to E. I wouldn’t wish any harm on M and would like nothing but to see her happy but I’m not sure if she would stay in this complicated mess of “Sex but no relationship”. I know myself enough that if I jump into a relationship it wouldn’t be fair to compare E to M and I don’t think I personally have the energy nor the trust to put my time and effort into another one, not right now atleast. I can definitely see myself with M and being extremely happy and the way that we interact with each other is never a dull moment so I know interest won’t go away anytime soon.

462,"Hi all,

On Tuesday, a close friend of mine messaged me on Whatsapp to generally see how I was doing. I told her about my suicidal thoughts and my plan to kill myself in the future. 

She was very supportive and obviously tried talking me out of it. She did also message me to ask if she can call me, I told her that she could. She said that she will call me after she has finished what she is doing and that was fine by me. This was in the evening. 

On Wednesday, I sent her a follow up message in the morning to ask her if she still wants to speak on the phone as she didn’t call me on Tuesday and there was no response. 

After I sent the follow up message, I checked a few hours later to see if she replied and it said that she was online. This means that she intentionally did not check my message because it would show that she has read the message. I understand that she may have been busy at the time so I shouldn’t worry. 

The problem is that I saw her active on Instagram on Thursday. She followed a few people and managed to view my story on Instagtam too. I had a breakdown, felt like shit and became more suicidal. I felt abandoned. 

She still has not responded to the message I sent on Wednesday and I have not sent any messages since that day. I do plan on confronting her about it but I’m looking for advice on how to approach this situation. 

Just to clarify, I have tried to be rational about this situation and argued that she probably didn’t respond because she is leaving Italy (place of study) in a few days. My counter argument is that she could have still gave me a heads up about it instead of ignoring my message and if she didn’t want to speak on the phone she could have simply declined to do so.",02Jun2019,1

That was at the beginning of the year and since then I thought he was clean. But last night he came home, clearly high of some dabs and wanted to talk with me. He said a friend of his gave him some blue or green pills and he took some. I think he said they were Xanax but I cant remember, but either way there was a pretty good chance they were fake. I don't want to break his trust and tell my parents right away, but pills are fucking seriously dangerous. 

My brother has a bright future ahead. He already has a scholarship offer to play baseball and is pretty smart grade wise. Everytime we talk to him about these types of things he just acts like a totally different person. He hangs out with wanna be gang members and is definitely getting involved with some shitty people. He is a 16 year old white kid from the burbs I just don't know where he gets it from.

But a couple days ago, it was my birthday and me and my boyfriend were having sex. And our bedroom door doesn’t close due to the fact my little brother somehow jammed it doing something incredibly stupid. And in the middle of it, my dog bursts in and jumps on the bed and bites his ass. He has no pain tolerance so he shouted in pain and fell off the bed. Did I laugh? Yes. Was it a shitty move? Yes. But I did help him and put her in her crate and asked if he was okay. He said he was fine just now irritated.

I asked him if everything’s okay and he told me he wasn’t going to do anything with me or to me as long as my dog is near. I told him I could put her in her crate but he already seemed irritated so I dropped it.

479,"I just wanted to post to receive clarification on an ongoing issue that’s been occurring in my workplace. I am a girl in my young 20s (cocktail waitress) working with a man in his 50s (as a bartender) in a casino.
     Over the past few months I have been working I have been called in a couple times to see my boss. The first happened after the bartender I work with, let’s call him Steve, reported me . The policy at my work is to only allow individual customers to have drinks in a 20 minute interval. I am fine with this and try to follow it to the best of my ability.
     When this incident occurred a group of men came up to the craps table which I was serving. I brought them four jagerbombs and when another group of three men came up they requested the same drinks . I brought them those three drinks.
    A bit later Steve told me I was over serving and threatened to report me. I tried to explain the situation - that I was not serving the same initial four men again in a short period time but rather a different group of customers - however after attempting to explain I was told if I was in the right I should explain it to the manager.
     I did so. No problem.
    This seemed to set off a series of conflicts I had never previously had with the bartender.
    After this I was turned in for smelling bad. All throughout my life in high school I was actially frequently complimented for smelling good. When I went to my manager I was told that the bartender reported me to my manager for not wearing deodorant and repulsing customers with my body odor. I then became crazy about applying antiperspirant all around my body and spraying myself profusely before work. Before I had always bathed regularly and took care of myself in a normal manner but I was so humiliated I didn’t know what to do.
     I was then reported for talking too much to the casino dealers. I admit that I spoke to them too much. I work graveyard and there are many times where there is not a single person in the place, I have done all my cleaning work, and I am looking for someone to speak to. This does not excuse my actions but this is why I did so.

*if you didn’t read my last post here’s a summary*
My mom is emotionally abusive and I’m trying to leave her

How do i leave her? I’m very scared and don’t know how to go about it. Do i tell her straight up? Do i pack my things? Do i even bother doing anything and just leave? I obv can’t carry all of my things out myself (but i also don’t have a lot of stuff). Where do i go? I have a few friends so i could ask them? Also I’d want to move back to my old state but idk if my family would be able to give me any money to do so (I’d obv pay them back when i get a job). I also won’t have a working phone if i leave, since my mom has to pay for it. I have an old phone i could use on WiFi hopefully. I also don’t have a real id yet nor a passport so i can’t go onto a plane, but i could go by bus. I’m just so scared of doing anything when the outcome is so uncertain.

I’m also isolating myself from everyone cause i just can’t feel like i can talk to anyone irl about this. I feel so alone and so stupid for not being able to make myself go through with anything. I feel so lost and boxed in and idk what to do.

483,"As you can infer from the title, I'm having body image issues - kind of.

Body positivity is about embracing your body, no matter how it is, which I agree with. For me, personally, the fact that I'm healthy usually outweighs (lol) the mental/emotional pain associated with my changed body. 

I'm a 5'10"" woman. I lost 130 lbs in the course of 14 months, and have managed to maintain for another 10 months. I still look heavy, but most of that is due to skin and another 20 or so lbs to go.

As you can maybe imagine, this kind of extreme weight loss comes with a lot of emotional struggle to begin with. Learning to cope with the fact that I'll be hit on and figuring out how to respond to it has been difficult for me. I had never really had to deal with that - when I was younger and more proportionately shaped, I was socially unaware enough to not pick up on those sorts of cues, but am much better educated/more aware through experience, now.

The worst part, outside of dealing with an increase in garnering unwanted attentions, is the skin.

I can't escape it.

I'm trapped in it on a daily basis (though, I guess we all are, right?).

I know my boyfriend loves me enough that it isn't this huge deal. Especially since I plan on having it removed. I'm fortunate that I only need surgery on my abdomen, as my legs and arms are toned enough to have filled out the extra skin.

It just hurts so much to know that me, topless, would make every person making pass at me run for the hills. That under all of my clothing I'm repulsive, essentially. That I've gone from ""you have such a pretty face! If you'd lose some weight, the boys would be swarming,"" to having a pretty face, if only I'd lose the excess flesh.

I'm not normally this cruel to myself, or speak/think this harshly, but today is a really hard day. I don't know why. It just is. And it hurts. Really badly. Thankfully, I see my therapist tomorrow.

Unfortunately she does not find me attractive, which is of course absolutely fine, but I have been struggling emotionally on how to proceed. A part of me wants to get over my feelings for her to go back to how it was, I really enjoyed talking to her and vice verse, but it's also the case that I will not be able to get over my feelings for her if I keep talking to her regularly. I very much care about this person, and I know things will never be the same again and that our friendship is now jeopardised because of my feelings for her, and that from now on simple things like if she started to see a guy would hurt me and therefore I am not sure whether I should completely go no contact as in the long term this may benefit me. If I lie to myself and continue to hide these feelings I can see this very negatively impacting my life, but at the same time the pain of not being able to speak to her hurts just as much if I went no contact.

485,"I’m 23 and have recently been given a new option. My girlfriend’s parents just bought a house that’s a bit of a fixer-upper in New Hampshire that they intend to use as a summer/retirement home. We live in Utah, but they’ve offered to let my girlfriend and I live there for free in exchange for labor for repairs since we both have construction and maintenance experience. The town has lots of options for jobs and we would probably both work two jobs to get some debt paid off and occupy our time when we first get there. 

Here’s the rub. My girlfriend and I while we’ve known each other for years, have only been dating for a couple of months and the move would be in a month or two. I don’t want to put excessive strain on the relationship and only make both of our lives miserable while being stuck on the other side of the country together. I don’t think that it would be an issue, but with the relationship being so fresh it’s hard to say. 

I also have a fair amount of credit card debt and while rent would be free, I still have bills to pay. We need to pay utilities, cars, phones, insurance, etc, and the move itself I’m sure will end up costing a couple thousand dollars. Plus the time it will take from getting there to getting hired on somewhere is another concern. I could afford a month or so unemployed, but much more would really be a burden. 

Here are the positives of the move though. Due to some unfortunate circumstances last winter I currently live with my parents who are very Mormon. Without going into detail, if they knew the shit I got up to pretty much daily I would be kicked out in an instant. It’s only a matter of time now before I have to find somewhere new to live. Probably several months, but who knows. They absolutely won’t support the idea of me moving in with my girlfriend, but I’m an adult and they know that. 

I’ve also gotten into a bit of a slump recently and feel like I need a change of pace and environment. I go to work every day, come home and take a nap, and then go watch sports with the guys or hang out with the girlfriend. I don’t have an education and am not working in a trade at all. I need to figure out what I want to do with my life and the change in environment might really facilitate that. 

I use marijuana daily to control chronic nausea, back pain, and anxiety. I don’t qualify for medical in New Hampshire, however it’s decriminalized there and my chances of going to jail over my medicine are significantly lower, considering how strict Utah’s laws are. It’s also entirely surrounded by recreationally legal states, so I’m sure as far as the green goes, things are much better over that way. 

The living situation itself is amazing. It has a huge yard, 5 bedrooms, and is in a town of 10,000 so it’s a smaller community which is preferred. I have a dog so she would love the yard and we both have lots of reptiles, so having a reptile room wouldn’t be difficult to facilitate. I’m a bit of an outdoorsman and it’s located right outside a state forest and built along a river. It’s absolutely gorgeous. 

I’m not sure how long we would be living there for, but I would imagine a bare minimum of 6 months, but probably closer to a year+. I’ve moved a few cities over from my parents in the past, and was a Mormon missionary in Arizona for a couple years so I’ve been out of the home before. Being across the country is just a little more worrisome, but having my girlfriend there will help a lot with that.  What would you do? I’ve just been given this option a few days ago so I’m still wrapping my head around it a bit and just am not really sure where to start on making a decision.",02Jun2019,2

but she won’t listen to me, and now she thinks resorting to starving herself is a good idea, this has caused me much stress and many mental breakdowns (i’m not exactly mentally stable to handle things sometimes) and she just doesn’t care and won’t stop nomatter how much i tell her no, starving isn’t the answer.

489,"My roommate is an extremely sensitive person who does not take criticism well at all. No matter what it is about or how much she's in the wrong, her reaction is to get super angry and defensive-- she just can't see when her behavior is wrong, period, and she always finds a way to ""justify"" it.

We both have kids. Sometimes her kids will irritate me or piss me off, but unless it's something important I tend to let it go and I definitely do not ever snap at them or yell at them. She, however, snaps and yells at my kids all. the. fucking. time. My oldest son is autistic and often doesn't understand that he's doing something wrong, WHICH SHE KNOWS, but she constantly snaps on him anyway. The way she yells at him makes me want to rip her face off but if I confront her head on she's going to block out what I'm trying to communicate because she'll be too busy being offended. NOT confronting her is starting to make me hate her and I shouldn't have to keep my kids away from her all the time since that means hiding in our rooms. Any advice on how I should deal?",02Jun2019,3

Here is the thing, we are looking to move in together in a year or so. My career has year long contracts. There is one place that is willing to give me a chance and want me to grow within their company professionally. The pay is about 3 grand lower annually, but puts my foot back into my career. I would have to move out of the area- the place SO and I are looking to move in is about 30-40 minutes away from this place. Though it is not official. He may want us to stay where he is. I am not sure what to do, for us to move in I need a steady job and this place is giving me that opportunity.

However, in the past few days, I’ve done a last minute look over my financial situation and the outlook is not great.  I’m likely going to be cutting into my savings every month, as while I can (barely) afford all of the bills and student loans and such, I don’t have enough to cover gas, food, etc. without taking money from my savings, even if I spend nothing on fun or “want not need” purchases.  

What should I do in this situation?  I’m searching for a better paying job but so far have had no luck, and don’t know how risky it is to gamble on that being the deciding factor on if this works or not.

497,"I just wanted to post to receive clarification on an ongoing issue that’s been occurring in my workplace. I am a girl in my young 20s (cocktail waitress) working with a man in his 50s (as a bartender) in a casino.

     Over the past few months I have been working I have been called in a couple times to see my boss. This first happened after the bartender I work with, let’s call him Steve, reported me . The policy at my work is to only allow individual customers to have drinks in a 20 minute interval. I am fine with this and try to follow it to the best of my ability.

     When this incident occurred a group of men came up to the craps table which I was serving. I brought them four jagerbombs and when another group of three men came up they requested the same drinks . I brought them those three drinks.

    A bit later Steve told me I was over serving and threatened to report me. I tried to explain the situation - that I was not serving the same initial four men again in a short period time but rather a different group of customers - however after attempting to explain I was told if I was in the right I should explain it to the manager.

     I did so. No problem.

    This seemed to set off a series of conflicts I had never previously had with the bartender.

    After this I was turned in for smelling bad. All throughout my life in high school I was actually frequently complimented for smelling good. When I went to my manager I was told that the bartender reported me to my manager for not wearing deodorant and repulsing customers with my body odor. I was confused as fellow coworkers and customers had actually told me I smell good (I shower regularly, apply scented body lotion, deodorant, and perfume). I then became crazy about applying antiperspirant all around my body and spraying myself profusely before work. Before I had always bathed regularly and took care of myself in a normal manner but I was so humiliated I didn’t know what to do and felt horrible about myself.

     I was then reported for talking too much to the casino dealers. I admit that I spoke to them too much. I work graveyard and there are many times where there is not a single person in the place, I have done all my cleaning work, and I am have no more duties to complete Despite this, I recognize that it does not excuse my actions.

     I curtailed this behavior after being reprimanded. However, today I faced trouble once again.

I have a lower level manager who I am on very good terms with. I was venting a bit about being turned in constantly. I know this was a bad choice on my part - however I considered this manager a friend, we had drank and joked together many times. Steve, the bartender, overheard our conversation. He pulled me over after my shift.

He asked me whether I thought that I didn't deserve to be brought in to the boss each time. I told him that I genuinely tried my best and that while I accepted my mistakes, I was a bit confused by all that which was going on. He then told me, verbatim, that I was the coworker that had brought him the most embarrassment out of everyone he had worked with in 20 years.

On a side note, besides everything I mentioned before after being reported, I must note that he consistently would take small passive aggressive jabs at me, make me feel stupid in a myriad of ways verbally, and generally had conducted himself in a way which seemed to border on harassment. 

After all this he then told me that I was not exactly a model employee and that my actions warranted what happened to me. He questioned me about my absences and told me that, as per the boss, he recorded everything I did in my shift down to when I went to the bathroom.

   This is my mistake, I admit. I have a very bad anxiety disorder and when I have panic attacks I vomit a lot. Sometimes I call in sick due to these, but in an attempt to be a good employee I often times have my panic attacks in the bathroom, vomit, clean myself up and go about my day. I am certainly not incapable of working, this only happens once every couple weeks, but I always assumed that since my stomach sickness did not result from illness that I should carry on.

This conversation with the bartender ceased. I started crying and he told me not to. I felt humiliated and put down. I had never heard his feelings spoken so blatantly, when in the past his feelings towards me were implied. I don't care particularly about his opinion of me but it is so continuously hurtful when I try my best and am continuously struck down.

I know I am not the best employee. Sometimes I am too chatty. I make mistakes. But otherwise I have satisfied customers and met the expectations for customers in every way that I can. My friends and family members are advising me to report the bartender I work with to human resources. I am scared of losing a great source of income while I am pursuing my education.

There's this girl I met online, she's really nice and we get along well and stuff.. she says she likes me a lot and I like her, my problem is that she isn't always very talkative and has a lot of guys always flirting with her and she acknowledges it a lot, so I feel unimportant almost.

But any time I post how I need space for a bit and she knows she's responsible so to speak she tries reaching out and tries to help.

I don't know if she's just needy for attention all the time that isn't mine or she's just not interesting and playing with me or what. She always tells me how much she love some and likes and comments on all my shit. Showing all the love she can and she doesn't do that for anyone else.

So I'm just stuck not knowing what I feel or think because I'm just constantly getting mixed signals.

I want to just ask her what's going up with it all but I feel like I'm just going to get a response like ""I love you so much, I'm sorry that you think that I'm not trying to do anything to hurt your feelings."" Or some shit. Which feels generic but she's also just not a very good at communication in general.

501,"So I have a friend who has been living with me for the past year and over that time I’ve become increasingly worried about his relationship. His SO is incredibly toxic and he’s delusional about it. For a couple examples, she has been calling him stupid on a regular basis, even going as far to say “I’m not joking, there’s no need to joke, you’re just that stupid”. She also killed the snake they bought together because it was her responsibility to feed it and she didn’t. She then blamed him for the death and he’s still depressed about it. She had forced her way into the house several times, she pushes away anyone that gets close to him leaving him with only a few friends now, she insults his cooking (going as far as to tell him to throw it away), she talks behind his back, and she surrounds herself with very sketchy men whenever my friend isn’t around. 

The tragic part is whenever I mention any of this to him he gets really defensive. He always claims that is due to a social anxiety. But that is a bandaid excuse that is  ignoring most of the things going on here. Multiple people including family members have reached out to him but he refuses to listen. In the past couple weeks he seems all too consumed by the mental abuse. It’s gotten so bad that she will keep him up all night on the phone when he is supposed to get up early for work. Then she will follow him from work home the next day. This is a really good job for him, but even his boss has mentioned that she’s a problem and he still won’t listen.

505,"I had a bad falling-out with a good friend about 3 years ago, and ever since then, it seems as though she's been competing with me on social media. For example, if I make a post on Instagram or Facebook, she'll be sure to make one a few days later. I noticed once that when I made a post that got a lot of likes, she started liking her own posts to make them look more popular. If I become friends with someone on social media that we both know from high school or something, she will all of a sudden be friends with them as well a day or two later. I have even noticed that she's been dressing and styling her hair very similarly to the way I did when we were both friends. After I noticed these trends, I stopped sharing things publicly so that only my real friends could see what I shared on social media.

I do admit that I keep tabs on her from time to time (after all, how would I even notice that she was copying me otherwise), and I'd be lying if I said I didn't internally compare myself to her as well, but I've for the most part moved on from the friendship and think that an outward display of competition via an avenue like social media is petty as well as unproductive. I even reached out to her once after the friendship ended, saying ""Happy Birthday!"" via Facebook messages, and I know she saw it, but she never responded. If she wanted to say something to me, good or bad, I don't understand why she just doesn't contact me - especially since I reached out to her first.

Almost two weeks ago, my girlfriend of about 5 years who i was going to propose to in a few months told me we needed a break so she can work on her mental health issues stemming from past trauma and bipolar disorder. I’m not sure where we stand. It seems hopeless, but at the same time she has said that she doesn’t want to do it, she just feels that she has to and that it has no reflection on our relationship. Three days after that, my grandfather fell seriously ill and I am his primary caregiver. My father lives with us as well and he has serious issues stemming from debt, no savings, and underemployment. He is severely overweight and in his sixties and it’s causing us a lot of issues regarding finding him enough employment to sustain himself. Today, I met with the owner of the company I work for and he offered me a substantial promotion about 2 hours away. The promotion would come with a $10,000 raise in salary bringing me to $55,000 annually, as well as additional commission from the people working under me and as well as covering relocation expenses in full and paying for 6 months of rent in a 2 bedroom apartment in the area with another representative that is moving out there for a similar opportunity. Basically I would be running a retail location and would get 5% of the stores monthly net profit. The store is underperforming currently as the current manager has basically given up but even then it’s a higher volume store than where i am currently and the net profit averages about $35k-$40k/month meaning about $1750/month in store commissions on top of my own commissions which have consistently averaged between $1,200-$1700.  

I have no damn idea where to go from here. I have so many balls in the air and no idea how to juggle them. I would like to take the opportunity, but i also have all of these other factors to consider. 
Who will take care of my grandfather?
How will my father get by?
And the one that is the most difficult emotionally is am I willing to risk losing the love of my life forever? 

Additional information:
She is still in Uni finishing her masters and already stays on campus 45 minutes away from where I currently live. That would be about a 3 hour drive if I take this job. 
My father is about $30,000 in debt and lives off money he makes driving for a ride sharing service.
My grandfather lost all of his money when the stock he owned tanked and he refused to pull out. The value went from $168,000 to around $8,000 over the course of two or three years. 

Sorry about the formatting, I’m on mobile. 

TLDR: A substantial promotion was offered to me about 2 hours away but the move would effect my family and likely end my currently tenuous but very loving relationship.

I fucking hate being belittled, I get that's it something I have to deal with because of my genes but I was mad and that negative energy carried with me when I got back home. My younger sister was using the TV and I shoved her off and said I'm not in the mood to argue, I admit it was rude but I own the house and needed to relax and chill.

So she flipped out and I said angrily that it was my house, if she don't like it she can fuck off. She asked why I was angry so I told her and of course she tried to explain to me why it wasn't a big deal and that I just need to work on myself and blah blah. She's sexy, busty, young and most importantly a woman like she doesn't really have to work for anything so she's not going to understand. I told her to shut the fuck up and she ranted at me saying something along the lines off ""this is why your a fucking loner"".

515,"Hello reddit world! 

I am looking for some advice (obviously). 

I live in a pretty small 2 bedroom apartment and share it with a friend of mine. We moved in together last summer because we were both in dire need to move out of then living arrangements and decided to do this together. I knew her before we moved &amp; knew she was a hard working &amp; responsible human. So here we are. 

The problem. 
She is a MESS! Complete whirlwind disaster. I am constantly coming home having to spend an hour + on cleaning up after her. I am 28 and she is 25 (I think) &amp; I know she’s never lived in her own like this before but. I am extremely frustrated. Her room looks like something off that Hording TV show and I am at my wits end. I have tried talking to her, explaining that I need some help..to no avail. I also have my son here with us as well. 

Now I know that I have some serious OCD going on as well so I try to be patient. But I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to keep nagging her because I’m not her mother, but I also don’t want to keep cleaning up after her because, well, I’m not her mother.  I am so frustrated and angry. 

I just came home from dog sitting over the weekend and I walked into again, a disaster. But this time she had been smoking in the house- which we had a conversation about in the past. I am a former smoker and now that I quit when I smell it, I can REALLY smell it. It’s disgusting and I have my son here with me during the week. Also, everything besides what’s in her room is mine. All the furniture, mine. Which retains the smell of smoke and I just hate it!!! I asked her to please not smoke in the house. We have a back balcony with some comfy outdoor furniture, christmas lights around the railings..it’s nice here. I have worked very hard to provide that for all of us. 

I am looking for advice on how to deal with this because I feel like talking isn’t working anymore. I would ultimately like her to move out but I know she doesn’t have anywhere else to go. No family around here or anything. 

Thank you for listening to my rant. I know my thoughts are all over the place, I’m emotional. If you have any words of advice on how to help me cope / deal with this I would greatly appreciate it.",02Jun2019,1

I used to have a best friend a few years ago. We were pretty much inseparable and did everything together. He was an important part of my childhood and someone that helped me through a lot. However, because of the way of life, we got separated and haven't interacted much.

He has tried reaching out to me via text but I always keep forgetting to reply because I have the bad habit of reading my messages and not replying to them. 

The other day I found his mum on the street and she greeted me happily. She called me out however, telling me how her son was sad that I hadn't reached out to him anymore. I feel really ashamed of neglecting him and I have decided I want to reconnect with him.

However, I feel so bad that I don't know how to begin. What should I tell him? How can I excuse my behavior? How can I be certain he will accept to reconnect and not be done with my shit?",02Jun2019,1
521,"Hi-in a pickle here and need advice what to do next.  Hubby and I bought three row homes in a city that was supposed to be up and coming.  We bought them priced high (unknowingly) then the market crashed in 2008.  Our hope was to flip them after a time and use proceeds for kids college (have 4 kids).  Houses are all underwater now (think we paid 100k+ and all worth 39k now).  In one, we have a tenant with two little boys who took over a month to month lease from her mom who moved out bc she said her daughter was lazy and relied on her too much.  Anyway, my hubby has been collecting rent these past 14 years but we haven't had money to put into these bc rent covers only mortgage and our kids had to go to college.  I'm taking over the job now as rent collector/overseer and inspected all the units to find them in decent shape except for this one.  It was an absolute dump.  I convinced my husband that we needed to make improvements to pass our Section 8 inspection.  So we put about half the homes value into updates.  Sanded/refinished floors, installed new bathroom, painted, installed new windows, doors, and so much more.  Put this family up in a hotel for two weeks.  She is a single mom and does not earn a lot and reminded me of my own single mom who had to figure out how to make it work with two kids and $20 per week child support in the 70's.  I bought her new towels, cleaning supplies, sundries, rugs, toys, books, etc.- set her all up.  I told her last week I would be by today to pick up rent and inspect her care of the house.  Pre-Reno I can't even begin to explain the filth.  Think hotdog rolls on counter with mice holes chewed in them.  Now, I told her that ability to stay hinges on her good care and respect for this property, which we still have a mortgage on.  She and I spoke last week and she told me how excited she was to live in the house now and bugged me all week to pick up rent bc her former boyfriend now paying child support.  I told her I was giving her a week to clean up filthy basement, kitchen and bedrooms and would collect rent and inspect house today.  When I texted,  she said she is going to the beach and thought it was next Sunday.  What would you do next?  I hate to kick someone when they are already down but does kindness really have to always = being taken advantage of?  Are the pricks really the only people that live without this kind of disappointment?  What would you do next Reddit?",02Jun2019,1

523,"So a little backstory to start off.
Just before Christmas there was a party that occurred at one of my friends house, it was a good party to be fair and everyone made there ways to bed etc.
Two of my mates slept on one sofa then my female friend ‘Alice’ and ‘Kyle’ for the purpose of this story slept on a separate sofa. Suddenly in the middle of the night Alice got up and left with no warning.
Fast forward a few months and Alice held a party, later in the night me, Alice, Kyle, ‘Matt’ and ‘Tom’ all went out for a little smoke of the green and then came back as usual.
Fast forward even further and me Matt and Tom are chilling at Alice’s house, the topic of Kyle came up and she mentioned how in December Kyle had tried to touch her and she politely declined and went to sleep, she then awoke to find his hand under her shirt on her breasts to which she decided she’d had enough and left. Then at her party he had tried to grab her hand on our walk back to which she said no and caught up to us where she felt more safe. Then when she went up to bed he had repeatedly messaged her asking to go into her room with her and generally creepy messages. I’ve known Alice for over ten years and I do not believe for a second that she would make this kind of thing up, but at the same time theres no evidence that any of this happened just what she’s said. I have grown to hate Kyle more and more I see or hear his name being spoken to the point where me and Tom have spoken about taking physical action. Overall I’m in a huge dilemma whether I should trust my friend and whether or not I’m being unreasonable in this situation.",02Jun2019,1
524,"First off: I really don't feel like being patronized right now. All I need is some honest advice.

I (16M) recently confessed my feelings for a someone (16F). She eventually says that it's mutual between us. So I start texting her a day after the confession. I'm not trying to push anything/start something and I'm just being myself. Casual jokes, honesty, the whole works. It starts off well. After a few days, the conversations become boring. One-word answers, long times between responses. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. And remember: I'm initiating these. Every single time. I've thought that maybe it shows I'm ""clingy"" or ""needy"". That's up for you to decide.

Some people have suggested that I do something childish such as ghosting her to see how it takes for her to initiate. I hate that idea. However, being honest and possibly confrontational is something I don't want to do so early on in this situation.

So, how should I handle this?

539,"So for some backstory, I have a pretty shit mother. She has always been the type to value a man over her kids.
Three years ago, I was molested by one of her boyfriends. It took me a while to speak up about it and when I did, a friend of mine phoned the police for me as I was too scared to. They took me to the station, got my story, worked out a safety plan and I spoke to a forensic investigator. After they sent me to my father’s home, they called my mother and asked her and (we’ll call him Jim) Jim to head back home as they had gone to a concert an hour away. They came home the next day and Jim was immediately arrested. Mom was pissed. She called me screaming and yelling that I needed to take back my statements, that it was all lies. She said that I just wanted attention and that I was jealous that I didn’t get to go to the concert. I didn’t know about their concert, and never listened to the singer, so I still find that ridiculous.
They did release Jim on bond.
This brought up a huge CPS investigation, her custody was taken away as she had completely sided with Jim. She said that my sister and I were no longer welcome in her home.
Fast forward to two months ago and Jim has been released from jail. I supposedly have a restraining order against him, but physically I dont??? (I honestly don’t know what’s going on as the people at the courthouse don’t tell us anything, but legally I’m supposed to have a restraining order against him.) I’ve been told that he isn’t allowed to contact my family? I can’t fact check this as I just don’t know how to find this information. Mom is still seeing him. She has admitted to it, though only on call or in person. She’s smart enough to not put it in writing. She told me that she can go to jail for talking to him, but I really don’t know. I just want a restraining order against her. I don’t want her around me or my sister or even my father. I know she’s still dating Jim.
Last time I spoke bad on him around her, she hit me and told me I needed to be nice when speaking of him as “he’s gone through a lot because of you.” She is also trying to get my sister to go around him. She wants Jim to teach my sister how to play guitar, which my sister is not okay with. So I know she’s not really worried about protecting us and is actively trying to bring him around us even now.
She’s also threatening to press charges against me for talking about this. She says I am “harassing Jim through her” when a) I’m not harassing him, and b) how can she claim that she has nothing to do with him, yet think that I can hurt him through her? She contradicts herself. 

Is there anything I can do to protect myself and my family from her? I don’t trust either of them and he gets off his gps bracelet in a few months.

The problem is I struggle to make friends, not only do I struggle to find opportunities to meet people (thus what made Meetup so great) I also struggle to make friends as I have autism. 

So despite all this happening a year ago I still haven't made new friends, certainly not a big group I could go out with like I did with this social group.

550,"I'm a freshman in High School and our year is about to end but boy, has it been hell. Let me give you some context.

&amp;#x200B;

This all started the year prior. Some people started up rumors and lies that I was doing some *shady* stuff. Back around that time, I used to love to bike everywhere in town (I live in a semi-small town so it's not hard to get around.) and some people assumed I was going to certain places at certain times where certain people were. I'm not gonna get into what, but you can assume. These lies completely destroyed my reputation and ruined the rest of that school year for me. I'd always get weird looks and get stared at in the halls. It was hard to deal with. Summer eventually rolled around and I completely forgot about it. Summer comes and goes and it's time to start my freshman year. The first couple of months, no one seems to remember/ care, so neither did I. Although, as the year progresses it slowly, but surely comes back. There were a few new kids that came to our school, and from what I heard, the first thing they're warned about, is me. Even though I've done nothing wrong. They're told that I'm a creep, a stalker even. This is a lot for a fifteen-year-old kid to manage. I was on our school's crew team, so I talked to the older guys for some advice, which helped, but not really. The worst part of this all is, since everyone thinks that I'm some sort of demon, I can't really date anyone here, so I have to talk to girls from other towns. I had been talking to one recently and we had been hitting it off and were going to go on a date. Until one of her friends who knew of me told her the lies. After that, she completely ghosted me and is ignoring me. I've tried to talk to some of her friends, but to no avail. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do to clear my name. I'm a good guy who has good intentions. It's hard for me to really deal with this and know that I'm a public enemy.

A close friend of mine applied and got an internship at the same production company I’m at, and we’ll be working most of the same days. she didn’t bring her car but the metro is less than 2 miles away from my apartment.  

I tried to discuss the rent situation for weeks before but there was clearly miscommunication.  The day before she arrived I had to text her regarding the rent and she agreed to pay half for the two months she’s here. 

3 days after picking her up she tells me that she can’t justify paying half the rent  ($718), without being closer to transportation, shops, etc. and thought that just paying for groceries and occasionally gas would suffice. 

I’m not sure where this assumption came from that it would be fine to stay with someone almost for free?

But my parents don't let me have one. I just don't understand!! I hate this! They always say that I can have as many pets as I'd like WHEN I'll move out... ( I wanna get a ball python) I have the money; I'm responsible (my mom said so); I'm old enough; we don't really travel anywhere for long (some hours usually); we have our own apartment; I do well in school; I don't do drugs, don't smoke and I don't drink; I don't ask for expensive things, tbh I never ask for anything; and the list could go on and on. I'm on my last straw... Why they can't just let me have one?

To add, they don't believe in the benefits of pets. I can't show them videos because they know nothing in English and the videos in our language are bad.

I'm so jealous of my classmates who can have pets. One of them hates cats but he got one anyways because why not. It's just like suddenly everybody have or will have a pet except me (no, it's not peer pressure).

Do you have any advice?

561,I met a guy friend of mine in 8th grade fast forward 7 years and our friendship was still going. It is going to be 2 years in October since we do not talk anymore. The thing is ever since high school I had met his girlfriends and helped him with serenades and surprised for his girlfriends. Thing is at one point I started to develop more feelings for him but when he got a girlfriend I just bottled that up. As time went I kind of just forget about it. We had been best friends for 7 years but 2 years ago he had broken up with his gf. One day we hanged out just him and me and he asked me out. When that happened it kind of just brought back all these feelings and I said yes. We ended up kissing and in the moment it was nice but after I kind of just felt like things were awkward. Anyways when I agreed to go out with him he told me that we had to keep it a secret because his ex girlfriend had friends and if they saw us she would find out. Anyways that kind of made me change my decision because I didn't want to be a secret. Days passed and he messaged me to see when we would go out but I kept avoiding him. So after 2 weeks of avoiding and making up excuses he just stopped messaging me. He ended up going back with his gf. Idk was he just using me or did he really want to go out with me. I do miss him sometimes and I feel like I should apologize but idk. What should I do?,02Jun2019,0
562,"I'm 16M, and I have depression. I have been ousted from every social group (School, clubs, etc.) and as a result, I'm completely alone. I have 0 friends, and no matter how hard I try it either ends up people not wanting to talk to me because I ""don't contribute enough to the conversation"", or I ""talk too much"". What the hell am I supposed to do. I feel insanely empty. It's come to the point of self harm here. My only real defense mechanism is laughter, which is usually okay, but not always. Some guy at an end of year recital tried singing Danny Boy, this irish folk song. It was horrendous, couldn't hit the top note, couldn't hit the bottom note, forgot the words, forgot the rhythm. I tried extremely hard not to laugh, to no avail. Got a lot of looks, even though a good amount of people laughed harder than me. I started getting really nervous about this and my Stage 2 of depression started. When I get nervous, I start scratching my arms and neck. I started scratching a ton, and eventually I stopped feeling it. After the recital I got a lot of weird looks which were different from before. I found out it was because my wrist and neck was bleeding a lot. Anyway, I'm not too successful with the females either as you can probably tell, so I have no idea to talk to the one I like. She's nutty good at violin so I was thinking the only way to get her to go out with me was to be as good or better than her at violin. Other than that I got nothing. Even though I have a relatively tough time at school I prefer school over home. Father doesn't talk to me unless you consider talking yelling at me when he has a bad day. When he has a good day he says nothing. Mother is okay, she's just a bit unaware when it comes to me.

563," am a [23F] and my entire life I have been a quiet person. I wouldn’t necessarily say that I’m “shy” because I’m not scared to talk to people, but I have always been very quiet. All my teachers in school would say this during parent/teacher conferences, people always describe me as “the quiet girl”, and people constantly ask me at work why I’m so quiet. Honestly, I’m really bad at small talk and I am not very good at being outgoing with people that I don’t know very well. I’ve gotten better over the years but I’m still seen as “the quiet girl”. I’m not afraid of people. I’m not shy. I’m just reserved. I also have social anxiety and it makes me very nervous to be loud and outgoing in big group settings (like at work). And I know this sounds weird, but I and other people do consider me attractive. I get a lot of compliments and male attention. But, I feel like all of the other pretty girls are super outgoing and popular and then there’s me. I never fit in with them because of this. I’m not really ever invited to hang out with anyone or invited to parties. It hurts. I have very few friends. I’m not weird or ugly or rude, just quiet due to anxiety. Has anyone else had this problem? Has anyone ever over come this? I feel like at 23 it’s too late for me....

If they do keep on beeing together how should i keep in contact with her ( write her every 2 weeks ? But i means she has a boyfriend is that oky?)  so even if they stay together i can be there for them?

How can I convince my family (mainly my older sister) that aesthetic is subjective?

I tell her, but you said you shouldn't care what others think! And be pretty for you and not for others! She said this and I think is the most empty piece of advice she has given since she doesn't even actually follow it. Aesthethic is subjective!

I tell her, I want to be pretty for myself, not for others, so I will follow my style, then she says, fine but don't complain later about how people treat you, if you dress like a weirdo people will treat you like a weird and they will ignore you, but then I say, no, I have the right to complain, society says 'be yourself', but when I am myself they just ignore me, I think society is so hypocrite and it makes me so mad, .""be yourself but under the standards"", and I do whatever I want because this is how I am, and is my kind of protest, I'm not even that weird at all!

Us arguing makes mom sad, but I’m not gonna ignore his childish and shitty attitude just because my mom is sad; sorry not sorry. I told her “If you make someone sad a lot of times in the past, you will be made sad by that person many times (though I try to not sadden him for the same thing).”

So in the last couple of months, I’ve been catching my boyfriend in lies. Some were small stupid ones, and there’s been a couple big ones.

A couple of days later, he wanted me to get something out of his bag, and I saw her name on a receipt. We kinda got passed it. I just found out today he’s been using a texting app to text someone behind my back. He said it was a coworker (which is another female) to get her insight on our relationship. He started doing it the morning he got the girls number (shady) and stopped doing it the day I came home from staying w my cousin (bc I left when I found out about him asking that girl for her number) there’s also been other things he’s done and lied to me about. So of course, there’s little trust, so I would go through his phone (he never had a problem with it before, before I even started going through it) I just started going through it a couple of months ago bc he gave me reason to. When he didn’t give me reason to, I never once thought about doing that. So he’s mad at me and is telling me to stop going through his shit, and it’s none of my business, and that I need to apologize for it. He also said he didn’t feel bad for doing or lying about it.

But I can’t afford college or qualify for a big enough grant. after moving 8 times in the past 2 years. I’m completely homeless again.

597,"I know that this should probably be posted in r/turtles and I did post it there. I haven't gotten a response and I'm really worried about keeping it too long. I don't want it getting too used to us and not be able to adapt to the wild.

My mom was doing yard work and found a baby turtle  that she had accidentally racked. She originally thought it was a Gopher turtle because she had found a turtle nest that was buried in a tunnel. She brought it in the house and wants to keep it as a pet until it gets bigger.

I keep telling her that it is illegal to take one from the wild and that I am pretty sure it is illegal to own in Georgia. She told me that if I am not willing to take care of it to give it to my sister since she doesn't have any pets. I have a cat and some fish.

I'm trying my best to keep it happy and healthy. I found a old pet carrier and I turn into a make shift turtle habitat. I gave it a little hut made from a plastic meat container. I put some water on a saucer. I've been giving it some leaves, dandelions, and some blueberries. It seems to only want to eat the blueberries. I have a lamp that I've been keeping on all day to provide some warmth. I take it outside on to my porch to give it sunlight. The bottom of the carrier has some towels to act as a substrate. Our house typically stays around 75°F. We have had it for about 1 day now.

I'm trying all the little tips that I found online or have learned from owning fish. I'd be lieing if I said I didn't want to keep it and are willing to put the effort forward, but I want to do what's best for it rather than my own personal pleasure. What should I do it's living conditions until I can properly release it? What should I do about my mom's refusal to let it go?",02Jun2019,1
598,"I’ll try and keep it short. I’ve had a fall out with my friend of 5 years. We’re normally very close, but she’s become unbearable to be around this past few months. She’s always talking bad about people. 

Rather than brushing off her comments about others, I have recently started to call her out on it. Her behaviour towards me one night was absolutely unforgivable, yet I tried hard to move in after she apologised. I’ve since found out that she’s been telling people thar I cause her bad behaviour.  Which has led me to believe that she’s not sorry for what she did that night as she’s not taking responsibility for it

Truth is, she has low self esteem and I’m constantly trying to help her despite getting back handed comments thrown my way.

I haven’t risen to any of her lies, yet. I don’t intend to either, but I can’t have her smearing my name for no reason. I’ve asked her how I cause her bad behaviour and she can’t give me any reason whatsoever. So she just talks about it like it’s fact.

She’s hiding a secret from her husband too. Something bad she has done that he doesn’t know about. I know she’s terrified of him finding out because her whole mask will drop off. I’ve told her what she has done is incredibly disrespectful to him. I believe this is why she is trying to discredit me to others now. Don’t get me wrong, though he probably has a right to know, it isn’t my place to expose it, even though it would clear my name. 

It would affect their marriage and kids etc and I’m not the type of person to take any comfort from that. I just want the endless drama to end.

So my problem is, I will be running into them both tomorrow after not speaking for a couple of weeks. I know she’s going to play the victim again in front of him as I’ve not spoken to her. He will probably have something sarcastic to say to me too. We were really close before. I feel I can’t say anything so am just being smeared instead. It’s her husbands birthday tomorrow so I was planning on telling them we’ll talk about it another day but I feel she’s going to push things. I just hope my temper doesn’t get the best of me.

Any idea how to deal with this in a tactful way? I’ve been nothing but nice to her and falling out over one disagreement where she was way out of line has caused all this. 

Tl;dr: had a disagreement over friends behaviour and she’s turned people against me by telling lies.",02Jun2019,1
599,"I am an middle aged adult, with grown children, i am the oldest of 4 siblings, all adults 
My parents died 6 and 2 years ago so now there is just us.
Growing up our family was weirdly dysfunctional, it wasnt until I went to a therapist for 5 years that I really confronted how dysfunctional our family was.
So for the last 10 years I have been living with this in an weird way of knowing how dysfunctional they all are but yet never really being able to call them on it (Denial is very strong including myself until I went to a therapist) I was ok with it until the last couple of years. When my father died 2 years ago things seemed to slowly unglued   even for these guys. They managed to alienate my other brother, they blew up and disow

Things came to a head at Easter, my sister was asking probing questions of my fiance, is she and her family ok with my previous partner dying 3 years ago, are they ok that I had been married a number of times before. 
And then my brother and his wife seem to fly off the handle mad at my fiance, it felt like a trumped up excuse , they didnt seem to like her for reasons they will never speak of, they wont even admit they have any kind of problem with anything.  

So here is my problem, if my sister has any problem she never discussed it with me in the last 3 years so it's weird she asked my fiance (who knows all about my past) but not me. And with my brother despite repeated attempts by me to reach out they refused, dont say anything negative about my fiance and blew up at her over something petty.

602,"My fiancés mother has just been given a very tough ultimatum.

The backstory. The Boyfriend and myself do not get along, he tries to power trip me all the time. My fiance and I are staying with her mom short term while we find a place to live.

Her mother does not demand much of us, just clean up after ourselves, that's it.

Her boyfriend disagrees and thinks we need to be doing a lot more around the house (everyone's dishes, laundry, etc). When he first confronted me I just blew him off and thought he was having a bad day.

But over the last couple weeks he has escalated his actions severely.

Im a full time reseller, and he doesn't believe this to be a real job. I got home last night after an auction and brought my stuff inside to clean up and take pictures of. He came inside and told me to move my stuff upstairs, I replied with ""I will in a minute"". He then yells ""no right now! you're going to do what I say!"". I kept my calm in all this (I've boxed and done mma for a couple years so it wouldn't be a fair fight). I simply told him I was working and I would shortly, he said ""I'm tired of you not doing anything around here! You don't do dishes, or laundry, or help at all! You need to get your junk and get the fuck out of my house right now!""

Fun fact:It is not his house, it is my Fiancés mother's house. So I told him ""It's not your house, so go away.""

He then grabbed me pretty hard by the throat and told me he's tired of me and that he wants me out of the house immediately, and then lets go. I simply sit there and tell him ""no, it is not your house"" and went back to working on my phone.

He then strikes me once in the side of my head and takes my phone and tosses it on the floor and says ""get the fuck out!""

I simply get up and stare right at him and say ""no"" and walk upstairs and wake up the mother and tell her what had just occurred. I also call my fiancé and tell her what just happened and she heads home from work early.

The mother comes downstairs and asks whats going on and the boyfriend goes off again saying he is tired of me not doing anything. I simply say ""not your house"" again and he gets in my face saying I need to shut my mouth, I stare him down and he backs up and throws his arms up and says ""what?! Lets go then!"" I simply laugh. The mother tells him to stop it immediately or leave.

My fiance arrives home and tells her mom ""tell him to leave forever right now, or you are dead to me. You will be uninvited from our wedding in two weeks if you don't get rid of him immediately!""

Her mother hasn't decided yet.

604,"My parents drink a lot. I don't know if it's enough to be considered alcoholics or not. They drink a lot, though most of the time is casual and my dad doesn't get drunk as often as mom but I know there are functional alcoholics and etc. 

Last year- 2 years ago, the drinking got really bad. It was like 2 martini's when dad came home from work, 1-2 cocktails at dinner and 2-3 bottles of wine with the meal. Then it was like a glass of wine with dessert and then an after dinner drink. And then of course they come home and would drink who knows what, at least another bottle of wine. In the morning, mom would drink bloody mary or mimosa or sangria. 

Anyway, I got sick of it as it was giving me bad anxiety (I lost lot of weight during that time) so I said they had 1 year to fix their attitude or I would leave even though I'm only a minor. 

It didn't stick immediately but eventually, like a month later they cut back. They didn't quit but only started having wine with dinner and maybe after dinner drinks. 

For whatever reason, the alcoholic behavior is coming back. Dad will come home and make martinis, we will have dinner and they will drink a bottle or two of wine, maybe after dinner drinks and then my dad will go to bed but mom will stay late drinking. At first, this was only every one or two days behavior but now it's becoming a nightly occurrence again. 

I'm displeased with it cause my mom is a mean drunk and my dad is a spineless drunk who lets her say whatever without standing up for himself or me. 

My family, who all live outside of our country, will come and visit us next month and I don't know if I should tell them to talk to my parents or let me live with them. It just it isn't as bad as before so I don't know if I should say something. And I know taking care of a teenager is difficult and costly, I don't want to be a burden especially because I'm not their child and all my aunts/uncles and grandparents are retired/retiring so I don't want to be a burden. 

I have an older brother who doesn't live with us but he knows how they behavior. I think he will help testify because he was there when I gave my parents the 1 year ultimatum but I don't think he is as serious as I am about them being clean because he drinks a lot and he tries to keep pace with our parents when they drink which I think is very bad because he is still a young man. 

Can someone please talk to me about this because I feel lost on this decision.",02Jun2019,2
605,"I am 17 and she is 16. Asked her out about a month and a half ago and she said yes and gave me her phone number. Later on when we were texting and I was trying to plan a date, she said she just wanted to be friends as we worked together and didn't want to make things awkward if we broke up, but still wanted to hang out. She then cancelled twice on me within the next few weeks so I tried to move on, as I just assumed she was uninterested. Then these past few weeks she has done several things that make me think she likes me but im not sure. She kept touching my arm, called me cute, asked me to lift heavy stuff, and when someone complimented my eyes she asked if she could look at them. These events all occurred on separate nights throughout the last month. So my friend who is a few years older told me im dumb and she obviously likes me, but there are a few things that make me think otherwise such as; doesn't laugh at my jokes all that often, and rarely talks to me other than asking how my day has been and saying bye.

606,"There's a lot of moving parts to this but I will try to be as clear and concise as possible. My sis has been planning on getting married for somewhere around 4 years. We are both 1st gen americans, with all extended family living in both India and Germany. She decided to have a destination wedding to India, and has been flip flopping on the year, roughly around christmas this year she finalized it would be this summer. No invites were sent out and none of our German family was invited. For prior knowledge to better understand my side, I very recently 1. Found out I was raped as a child in India and 2. Came out of a very intense controlling domesticly violent relationship about 3 months ago. I have been unable to talk about my rape as when I realized i was with my abuser, and he denied it and disallowed me to process my trauma and further shamed me from discussing with my family. In relation to the DV, I see a lot of red flags in her fiancé. Multiple of my family members have expressed concern but it gets brushed aside. The examples of, his red flags are; playfully hurting her, down talking her trauma, talking badly about our parents, insulting and talking down to her. To put it lightly in the 6 years they've been together, I've never seen him act as a loving partner should. He has insulted her cooking, taken pride in ""teaching her how to use spices,"" made her cry at a family dinner, and is consistently late for family gatherings anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours. My family and I agree that her fiancé wants the wedding in India because he likes being catered to constantly, which is typical Indian hosting behavior. To me this reeks of a self-serving attitude and narcissistic tendencies. I have informed them of my incident in India and I made it clear to my sister as to how I feel about her fiancé while also telling her I don't have a say in her relationship and I do not expect to change it in anyway. I don't want to see my sister wed into an abusive future in a place I'm already deeply dreading being in.

607,"There was a guy who I thought of as my best friend for a year, but he was my ex's long-term friend. After the bad break-up, he slowly talked to me less and less, and although I suggested meeting up, he did not wish to. I saw on facebook he had met up with my ex and his new gf. After this I felt my friendship with him was probably gone, and at worst he would only be another reminder of last year, so I removed him from facebook.

He just messaged me today that he noticed and wondered if everything was ok. I don't know what or if to reply.

I feel like he will never be a friend to me again, but just a connection on fb, and he will still remind me of some horrible experiences I've been trying constantly to forget. I'd only keep this connection in the hope one day we'd be friends like we used to, but I don't see how that would ever happen again.

My parents are...well idk how to describe em

I am not allowed to have a smartphone anymore,so I use one of those old Nokias. I am not allowed to use Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, WhatsApp,etc. I have a PC but can only use it any time between 4pm to 9pm on weekends for one hour total. I am not allowed to choose my future(in a way), though I have decided on my preferred career, my career path shall be decided by them. I do not have a personal room, can't lock the one I usually sit and sleep in. I can't have a girlfriend (that's kinda normal) and can't spend money on anything that they don't like. Neither do I get pocket money. They try to enforce their decisions on me.

Yet after all this, they are kind, caring for me, take care of my (basic) needs , trust me(with everything except tech) so much that I know their bank account details, are (sometimes) understanding and patient when I have something to say. I am given a lot of freedom to do anything (well that's what they say).

Their behavior perplexes me, annoys me. The fact that they dictate my future makes me cry myself to sleep (almost)every night. I try to be positive and happy but end up being a dick and hurting others around me, talking back to elders, being cranky, not being able to concentrate in school,etc

I feel I am at fault here but I honestly have no fucking idea what to do with my life. They tell me I can do anything, as long as I have finished my daily tasks satisfactorily that they decide, and that's kinda saying ""No"". Even if I get admitted to the best college in my country, I'd be sad and not feel any sense of accomplishment.

621,"Hey [r/Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/)! Longtime lurker, made a new account in order to post stuff like this.

I have recently started therapy behind my parents' back. We haven't even BEGUN to make any progress and already I know this is going to blow up in my face.

Before I go any further I want to make this clear: I love my parents. I know they've worked hard to give me a life that few kids, let alone an adopted child, could dream of. It's only because of them that I have a job with insurance to cover my therapy in the first place. I'm fully aware and appreciative of everything they've done for me.

But I'm... not doing well. It's getting pretty bad. I feel guilty for feeling so miserable, because I know I have no right to be. But that doesn't change the fact that I'm bawling every night, feeling trapped like I will never have any life outside of my family, and having terrible nightmares.

My parents have always been vehemently against the idea of me going to a therapist. I asked a number of times growing up only to be shut down and guilt tripped. The last time I brought it up to them was when I was starting college (an accelerated PhD program for Pharmacy). They told me that I wouldn't be able to work in the Pharmacy field if I had any record of mental illness, and that I was gambling away my chance to achieve my dream by trying to go to treatment.

I believed them.

So what do I do now? Just lie? I know my mom will eventually get suspicious and dig into where I'm going Thursday nights. They always find out everything. Honestly, I don't even care what they think of me at this point, I just want to minimize the drama and keep them from crying to me about how they ""tried to do everything right but it wasn't enough"". I just want some peace so I can try to find my happiness.

622,"Hi all,

I've been thinking about this problem for a while but I really don't know what to do. I'll start with the beginning.

The title of this post isn't exactly right. I do have friends, but sadly it's really only one (we'll get i to that later)

I never had problems with having friends in middle school, mainly because all of my old friends were in the same class as me. When our class got split up into different classes me, my friend and another girl who I didn't really know ended up in the same class as all the really popular kids. For some this may sound like a dream: I can finally be popular but the  sad thing is, is that all these kids already knew eachother and they formed this big friendgroup toghether and it was IMPOSSIBLE to get in. The moment I knew who I was going to spend the rest of year with I knew that this would end wrong, and I was right. My friend and I tried to stay away form everyone else in the beginning of the year.  We wouldn't really talk to them. We ended up being the quiet kids when we were actually not and could talk for hours and hours. Another problem is that, me and my friend were always together but as I said, another girl from our previous class was in my class this year and she also didn't belong with the popular kids so she stayed with me and my friend. And she was not the only one, another girl had the same problem so they both stayed with us. At first I didn't think much of it, but my old classmate was a really weird girl. The other one would just stand with us and say litterally NOTHING. Since they were both kinda weird and everyone saw them hanging out with us, and labeled us as friends, we were not only the quiet kids but also the semi weird kids. You could say that my chances of getting anymore friends were 0 at the time.  Me and my friend were always together, we didn't have anyone else.  We were together at lunch, in class, during breaks,... People started to notice that we didn't really hangout with anyone else. During the middle of the year, I talked with most of my classmates but that was it. I wasn't completely alone in class anymore. Now, at the end of the year I decided that it was enough. I didn't want to cry myself to sleep anymore because I was so lonely, I didn't want to wait for my friend anymore every morning before school because I had no one else to go to if I was early. I wanted all of it to stop. My friend told me about a school where she knew a lot of people because they were all of her old friends. I also knew 2 people there because I did a camp and they were my roommates.  The school is very close to my house and it has everything my parents want, it's catholic, not famous for bullying, close to my house, I can go with the bus,.... I talked about it with my parents and they didn't say no but they said they would be kinda dissapointed and sad if I went to that school. My dad said that I could end up with nicer people next year in a new class, but here is the other problem: people already know me. Everyone at school knows me because of my sister. My sister is 1 grade above me and she was like really popular. Everyone expected me to be like her but I really was the ugly, small, flat version of her. I don't think they want to be friends with a loser girl.

What should I do? Go to a new school where I have a really big chance of having a lot of friends or stay at this school and keep my parents happy but I have a small chance of meeting new friends.

I went to a movie with my friend and 3 of his friends. At times he was more interested in talking to his FWB (friend with benefits) via Snapchat than watching the movie. Which was distracting but it was what it was. Post movie we decided to go for a drink/dinner as a group. On the way to the restaurant he mentioned that his FWB was in town and as it happened just 2 restaurants/bars down from where we were. We ordered a drink and then it was clear he was excited his FWB was so close. I suggested his friend comes and join us. So he left to ask, couldn't ask over Snapchat...... He was gone for 30 or so minutes, conveniently leaving his jacket with his FWB. When he came back he skulled his drink ate some food and then left again to never be seen again. So there i was sitting with his friends, feeling abandoned. We discussed going to go and join in with him at the other bar but before that could happen they were off to another place. He asked me if i wanted him to walk me back to my car and if he should wait for me. But he didn't actually wait, he was off - so it felt like his offer was disingenuous. He made it as they were going off to their next destination. He could've said ""let's just wait and see what my other friend is doing"" rather than rushing off forgetting about me.

We're meant to be close friends, tell each other everything, but now i am really pissed and hurt he left me with his other friends so he could hang out with his FWB. He'd just been with him that morning.

So my question is do i have a right to be pissed. I feel like I've lost all perspective.",02Jun2019,1
631,"So my dad got a new job a month or two ago making roughly six figures, which I know is nothing to sneeze at but we live in a fairly expensive metro area so it's not uncommon. When I asked about the health insurance they kept making excuses, saying that he'll make up for it in commission, and that the company ""would shop around for better health Care but the ceo really likes the agent"" which to me just sounds like corruption. We are paying double what we used to for our medication. I know the American health-care system is a clusterfuck but I don't think it should be this bad. Is there anything we can do so he doesn't have to quit? 

We are in Virginia if it helps",02Jun2019,1
632,"I've stuggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for about two years now. I've started therapy and I'm working on myself (supplements, forcing myself to work out, trying to eat).

Two weeks ago my girlfriend said she needed a break and now we aren't talking until after a month or two. But I feel she is just moving on and this her way of softening the blow. She said she will always love me tho.

Since we stopped talking I went down the rabbit hole. I've cried and done nothing for two weeks now. I'm gonna mess up my finals for sure.

What do I do? Can I contact her? Should I just leave this Earth?

TL;DR: I'm depressed, suicidal and my girlfriend broke up with me. Where do I go from now?",02Jun2019,1

634,"Hey all, hope you're all having a nice day/night. I need some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation as me here. I apologize for the long post in advance and for the grammar mistakes if any, typing this from my phone. TL;DR is at the bottom. 

So some background, I'm the last born in a family of 6 and my dad retired like a year before I finished HS (British system) in 2015. I've been learning German since before I started HS and after, I took 2 years off any form of education, went to a German institute to really learn to be fluent. I went to Germany in 2014 for the first time and I was blown away and always wanted to go back to study and since the education fees is extremely reasonable there, I saw that as an absolute win for me. 

I've always had a real problem with saying when something isn't right and so before my graduation my teachers asked all the students in my class if anything was wrong, if they needed help with any *applications they didn't complete or if they had no spot in a Uni*. I didn't... But I didn't say anything because it was really close to graduation and I didn't want to look like my life was definitely going to be in shambles the next several months or like I'm a fool who doesn't know what he's doing. 

Well, in July right after HS, I started an internship at an animation studio thanks to my older sister's concern for my future and started to learn the ins and outs of animation which is great but after the beginning 2016 I became very ineffective as an intern. By May in 2016, I left the internship and my dad urged me to apply here in Kenya and I did, I found a Uni that does offer animation and I got a spot in that Uni and oddly enough, when I got that admission, I was relieved, like I could finally move on in my life but then my mom questioned the Uni saying they're less advanced than in Germany and that I would be wasting money studying here rather than abroad because ""c'mon, you went to an International school, why would you go here?""

So then I doubted if I wanted to even study there and then decided to hide my admission form from my dad and still wait to start studying in a place better than we have here. So I just to stayed home and did YouTube and played videogames. Did this for a year then in 2017 went to sharpen my German tongue, so to speak, at a German college. 

Fast forward to now in 2019, I have job transcribing German audio that I got thanks to a friend that I met at the German college. It pays as much as I want it to, so like the more work I do, the more I get paid and I get to choose my hours and thanks to my job i've invested in my gaming and learned more and more about how games are made in relation to animation, the games industry and in fact, I've invested so much into gaming that I am running out of games to play and I see that as an opportunity for me to invest now in my career. 

I've grown mentally, I'm helping out with the bills and around the house where I can. I have more friends than when I left highschool, i've become more confident, I also have a girlfriend who I care about and love to bits. But for all of this there are some negatives, I've already had countless arguments with my dad about me still not being in University yet, ""wasting the years like (my older brother's name) has"". He keeps trying to get me to go to do apply for a course here which is ""related to animation"" but I don't buy into his method of doing things because it feels like he's the one making the choice for my life, not me. And it also kind of sounds like that course he mentioned could be something that I won't be able to put my heart and passion in.

But what i've noticed is unsettling, almost scary even... I'm getting older every year, and the people who were in my class have either graduated or will graduate this coming year and yet here I am... With no undergraduate degree which is part of the issue but I'll get to that in a minute. 
I don't like comparing my life to other peoples lives for this reason, I mean we all live at our own paces, I understand that. But it it's just damn hard to see how little I've achieved in terms of my career. 

Well, just now me and my dad had a discussion revolving around a PC which I need help buying the parts for and building for adding more to my digital portfolio for animation and as a means for applying to Germany next year (some Universities over there require you to complete course work digitally and my current laptop can't do that) and he basically said that I can lose nothing from *AT LEAST* starting to study animation here in Kenya, I can ""gain fundamental knowledge for the course and then use that knowledge when in Germany"". And I considered that. I also feel like I have a direction in life but I'm not moving towards it fast enough if at all. So when I agreed with my dad that we'll go check out this course he was talking about, it's strange but, I felt relieved again. Almost like I'm finally moving towards my destination. It's almost as if my gut is telling me something. 

To end this post, I sent an email to the University that I  was admitted to saying that I will be attending studies elsewhere and haven't been in contact with them since. I want to see if I can reapply to that same Uni again, 3 years later. Is that possible? 

TL;DR - Father wants me to at least start studying something similar to animation/game design in Kenya but I've been pushing to go to Germany for 4 years and still haven't started an undergrad. I already speak fluent German and technology is more advanced there BUT I am really considering just FINALLY starting my undergrad here",02Jun2019,0
635," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence and I worried she hated me for it also she sometimes look at my hair funny sometimes :/",02Jun2019,1
636,"I’ve been going through a lot recently but let me sum it up.

My father was arrested for domestic abuse against me and my mother, in the past he’s kicked me out the house for weeks but I’ve really got used to it. He tried to commit suicide last week but was found and is in a mental hospital 

I’m going through my final exams, I have my final biology exam tomorrow. I’m really really stressed 

My dog of 10 years has cancer

My guitar string snapped, and due to dad issues i can’t pay to fix it at the moment, this was one of my massive passions so without it it’s kind of hard to get away from everything happening.

My best friend moved countries, I can still play with him after school, but not for long as I have to study a lot. I used to be really popular around a year ago but depression led me to be isolated and lose friends.

Older brother going to get surgery soon, lives in America (I live in England)

I haven’t actually been depressed for a while, Last time I cut was June 18th 2018. I’m really losing motivation for everything due to everything  that’s happening.

Any advice?",02Jun2019,1

What advice can you give me?",02Jun2019,1
639,"A few weeks ago my best friend(17) decided to commit suicide. I knew he was depressed but didn’t talk to him a lot lately. I felt like I had bigger problems of my own, nothing could be less true. The last time I spoke to him was in April, when he wanted to play some games with me.

He was one of my only friends who I liked going out with and party with because he was so outgoing and happy all the time, when we were partying he didn’t care about a thing in the world. Then he stopped going out, he was tired all the time and I kinda left him alone. I regret not talking to him more and I would do anything to see that smile again. See him so happy and careless as he was when we were partying.

All my other friends are moving on, I can’t seem to do it. I keep dreaming about him, I can’t stop thinking about him and I cry all the time. Today was a beautiful day outside and I couldn’t relax because I wished he were here to enjoy this with me. Also people are getting all hyped up about my birthday while I can’t imagine a birthday without him.

School is hard to go to and about everyone around me forgot all about the situation I’m in, they’re expecting me to move on but I can’t. I can’t focus and talking doesn’t help. When people ask me how I’m doing I say I’m not doing fine, and it’s true. 

My rational mind says I need time to process this, but my emotional one says I will feel this way forever. I’m scared I’m going to follow the path my friend went in. 

I guess I just needed to vent to some strangers but any advice will be welcomed. Thank you all for taking the time to read this",02Jun2019,1
640,"Im at a place in my life where im extremely lost. Im not sure what im doing and everything feels like a floaty dream. My troubles begin 1 year and a half in the past. I was enrolled in senior high after achieving decent results in my GCE/IGCSE's. I studied and failed exam after exam. Paper after paper. My parents blew the cash on me for tutors after the first examination and since then they've spent somewhere around 12k to 15k USD and I cant seem to produce results. I've felt guilty and depressed for the past year. I took my AS examinations last year and only passed in 2 of the 8 subjects Im doing. I've resit the papers I failed again and I feel like I've fucked up those again. At the rate im going i have no future. I feel as if i dont have the strength to face the A2 examinations in October. School makes me want to drop dead and bury my head in the ground.

School aside other aspects of my life is either going downhill or already hit the ground and the gravel below it. Things with my gf of 3 years is fading away. Regardless of whatever piss poor results i get she's going to go abroad for studies. Things have tensed up between us because of my anger issues i cant control anymire and im wondering whether if its for the best to break up now and save both of us from future pain wince neither of us can do long distance relationships. My parents have begun to detest me which i understand. I dont give enough compared to what they spend. I genuinely try and study my ass off  to no avail. The only words my teachers gave to me when i presented this problem to them was that ""some students just dont have that capability"". Im tired of putting my parents through this. My friends who've been there with me since high school are there but they've got their own issues which theyre trying to get a hold off. Some of them do nothing but indulge in drugs and some depressed hitting up therapy or both. I wish I'd never embarked on this fucking mess of a journey. There was a time where i was optimistic, healthy, joyful and i lived life with a dream and now im a fucking fat mess that breaks down and loses their shit every other day. I've tried picking up good habits and finding a hobby so that i can have something that i enjoy doing that doesnt make me into a sad piece of shit. My days now are just spent laying on bed listening to music and wishing i could turn back time by a year and a half so that i had another chance. Some of my family members and friends are studying in the same school as me but enjoying the exact opposite life that im having and i cant help envy them even though im happy that theyre doing well. 

I dont know why i came here but i dont know anyone in my life i can tell this to. Even if this gets buried i dont care because writing this was so fucking therapeutic.",02Jun2019,1

It wasn’t unfortunately. I haven’t really got anyone I can speak to about this as I live with just my mum and there aren’t really any males in my life I’m comfortable speaking with this about. Basically I suppose I’m worried that my penis will be different and that it won’t ever feel the same as apparently there’s a lot less sensitivity in uncircumcised males, making sex and masturbation less pleasurable? This is one of the things I’m worried about. I doubt really know what I’m asking here but I just really need someone to talk to about this.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",02Jun2019,0
646,"I have a friend, I’ll call him Tim. TL;DR at the bottom.

About 5 weeks ago, I asked Tim what his u/ was. We are very close friends with a 3rd guy(Rob) and I send Rob funny Reddit posts all the time via direct message. I wanted to make a Reddit group message with those 2. Besides I had no reason to hide my profile, we are all 3 very close and share everything with one another. Or so Rob and I thought. Tim gives me his u/ eventually in the middle of the night. I wake up, make the group message, then decide to look at his post and comment history to see what subs he’s active on. (We share many interests maybe I’d find some new subs I’d like.) What I saw completely changed my life. Tim had been active on several gay pornographic subs commenting things I wish I had never read. Needless to say, Tim had never mentioned any of this to us. I asked Rob, who was also completely taken aback and we decided it would be best to tell Tim what we had found and ask him about it, try to start a conversation. As it turns out Tim tells us that he’s questioning his sexuality and is bi-curious or maybe gay. He doesn’t know. He says he’s been questioning for roughly the past 3 years. Being that I’ve been extremely close to him for almost 7 years this is a huge shock, especially since he has been playing the role as some tinder womanizer for at least the past 3-4 years. I feel a little lied to since I thought we had deep trust and he hid this from both of us for 3 years, but I understand that he is uncertain and that is a very hard thing to bring up. Whatever, I’m not mad at him for that and I accept that he’s in a period of uncertainty. Rob and I tell him that and make it clear we are here to support him. 

Now only a few weeks later Tim starts seeing a guy for what he tells us is the first time. Without going into all of the details it’s important to know that Tim has a history of telling white lies, but coming clean. Except ever since I found those comments the lying has gotten much much worse. He tells Rob one thing and me a different thing. Each time he tells us about this guy something changes. It would take me hours to type out everything, but basically his entire life has become a web of lies that Rob and I are unraveling with proof and Tim admitting to the lies. 

Anyways, at first we were happy for Tim and going out with this guy. From what Tim tells us he’s a nice guy and they get along great. Tim begins to become a little obsessed with this guy only in a matter of days. They are in constant CONSTANT communication via text. 5 plus hour phone calls every other day. 2 12+ hour dates until 5 am in 4 days. We start to be a bit worried for Tim, but just let him figure his thing out. But, Tim trips up one night and says something that conflicts with what he’s told us before. We find out Tim’s been lying to us about this guy again. 

Now this is where I need advice, so I’m going to be very blunt. I do not mean to sound mean, but these are the facts. This guy is in his mid 30’s, Tim is early 20’s. This guy is on zero social media. He is completely untraceable. This guy tells our friend a sob story about being in an ugly divorce and that’s why he has no social media, but I looked up the divorce paperwork for this guy at our local courthouse (where this guy claims to have lived his full life) and I don’t find a single document of the divorce. Granted it could have been at a different courthouse but still a red flag to me. This guy just so happens to be extremely well off in all of Tim’s interest areas. (Cars, business, etc) This guy has apparently offered to buy Tim a car after only knowing him for 4 days. This guy has asked Tim to go on 2 out of state far away road trips with him after only knowing Tim for 13 days as of today.

After mulling over all this information with Rob and seeing a picture of this guy for the first time we decide that we don’t trust him for a second. We think that this guy is a predator, and that he’s attempting to take advantage of Tim. It’s also important to note that Tim isn’t very smart... at all. And he’s also very stubborn. He doesn’t listen to our advice, and often almost chooses to be dumb. He has a history of being insecure and he is very very impressionable. Tim would be a very very easy person to manipulate. 

But we can’t go to the police because we don’t have any proof. We may even be wrong, but we’d rather be wrong and look like assholes than be right and let our friend get raped or abducted or worse.

With this in mind we tell Tim everything, tell him that we are only saying these things in his best interest and because we care for him and just want to be safe. Tim is furious. He’s calling us homophobic out of no where, trying to defend this guy and changing all of his stories, and flat out refusing to take our advice. He’s still contacting this guy today (we told him last night) after we asked him not to. He still plans to meet up with this guy after we told him that’s a bad idea. I’m out of state so I can’t physically stop Tim from doing any of this. What should Rob and I do?

TL;DR Found our friend is possibly gay through Reddit. He is easily manipulable, and a bit obsessive. Seeing a guy for the first time and all the things we know about this guy point to predator. Friend won’t listen to us, still trying to hang out with potential predator. What should we do?",02Jun2019,3

He’s awkward and I don’t like that he can get very touchy with me sometimes. I don’t like getting touchy with people that I haven’t known for too long. I told him this and he was like, ok fine, but things got awkward. He may have come onto me too strongly and now I have a  bad taste left over from it. Sometimes he will text me randomly and ask when are we hanging out again. How do I tell him no, and I’m uncomfortable? Do I just tell him the truth? Do I just ignore him? But I don’t want to be rude either because I’m a nice person.  Oh, and we are connected on social media too.

651,"From 2015-2016 I used Omegle 3-4 times a week to masturbate in front of women. I was lonely and depressed at the time, and it made me feel good about myself when other women gave me attention. I always made sure they were legal by either asking their age, or skipping if it was ambiguous (I know this isn’t fool proof). For those who don’t know, Omegle is a webcam chat site that connects your camera, to someone else’s so you can see each other. **I quit doing this for good in October 2016 and haven’t done it since.** I was never caught.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while it didn’t bother me. I had moved past it and was proud of myself. In August of 2018 I started dating a girl and about 8 months into our relationship the guilt of me doing this became strong, I told her about it. It was hard for her, but she accepted it.

&amp;#x200B;

The following day I still felt guilty about it, like there was something I hadn’t told her. I thought about it and realized there were two more things related to my Omegle use that were giving still me major guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

1)	I would almost always click through people with my clothes on, but on occasionally I would sit naked in front of the camera (face obscured), and I would connect to someone who looked like they could have been a child. I would immediately hit “next” in less than a second, but I still flashed them. I know my dick was just one in a sea of dicks, but it was still giving me guilt that this happened.

2)	The other thing was there were a few times where someone was broadcasting what could have been CP. Again, I hit “next” immediately but it was giving me guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

So I told her about this too, and even though it was hard, she truly accepted it. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. She understood my addiction, and understood that the two things I mentioned above wasn’t what I was trying to see/do, and just an unfortunate by-product of my addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I felt relieved. I had told her everything that I had experienced when I was using Omegle, and even though it was hard for her to accept, she knew and understood I was a good person who wasn’t trying to harm anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward two months later and I broke up with her. The reasons for the breakup were unrelated to what I mentioned above. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I am single, I am absolutely terrified of the fact that sometime down the road, I will have to explain this to the next person I’m in a relationship with. I don’t like to keep secrets in relationships, and the idea that I will have to tell someone about this in the future is occupying my thoughts 24/7. I have a very guilty conscious and I don't like to keep secrets.  

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk to a therapist about this, but I know therapists have to report any suspected abuse of a child. There is a chance I’ll be reported if I share this with a therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

This problem has completely consumed my life. I think about it all day, every day, and have been suffering major anxiety and stress because of it.

654,"ok so in about a week a group of acquaintances planned a trip out at the beach while renting an apartment for about a week. I decided i’d go for 4 days and was excited. I thought it would be fun and everything but what i didn’t realize was that the main reason i wanted to go was that my crush is going, and now that he’s not i feel desolated. A close friend was supposed to come but i the end she isn’t, so now there’s s couple of acquaintances and some of their friends. I have trouble socializing and now i’m freaking out and i just wish i could not go. In theory i could but i feel it would just be rude to say it on such short notice and after having confirmed. I know it might sound ridiculous but now i’m freaking out and i can’t sleep. if you have any advice please help",02Jun2019,1
655,"**TLDR**: Korean media company has stolen copyrighted educational content and I need help exposing their unfair business practices.

I am the creator of English educational content based in the US. The materials included textbooks, stories, worksheet problems, videos, quizzes and tests. The copyrights are registered in the US.

I began consulting a private children’s education company in South Korea beginning in October 2013 on how to provide value in their markets and how to use the content that I created.

I learned that they took my content, printed them as textbooks and other materials such as workbooks and then distributed them throughout their institutions in South Korea and to another company in China which has over a million student members.

The company behind the people I was working with is no other than the media giant JoonAng Ilbo ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoongAng\_Ilbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoongAng_Ilbo) / [https://joongang.joins.com/](https://joongang.joins.com/) / [https://www.facebook.com/joongang/](https://www.facebook.com/joongang/)). Although the company we were in direct contact may be a subsidiary of the larger company by the name of JoongAng G&amp;E, they market themselves publicly as JoongAng Ilbo by using the same logo.

They have leveraged their connections in the media industry to advertise the business and have access to high-value partners.

They have stolen my content and used it in however way they see fit. We do not have any licensing agreement in place and they are in no way the owners of the copyrighted content.

I am at a lost of what to do because I trusted their brand name and their seemingly solid reputation as an international company.

Doing a bit of background research on the leadership of the company,  Mr. Hong Seok Hyun is the former chairman and owner of Joongang Media Network (Parent group of all the subsidiaries). When we started our business relationship, Mr. Hong was the chairman of JoongAng Media. I know that he is a close friend and alumni with the CEO of Joongang G&amp;E, Mr. Kim Jin Ki. Mr. Hong received his Ph.D in economics from Stanford University in the US. and was a US ambassador in 2005. Throughout his business career as the former chairman and president of the JoongAng Media Network and JoongAng Ilbo, he has been received many prestigious recognitions and is recognized internationally in media.

As I am not in a financial position to get into a long litigation with them as they no doubt have a large team of lawyers and so I am resorting to more creative means to give this matter some needed attention.

As such, my thoughts are to put social pressure into looking into this matter if he is not yet aware this is going on in his company. I am confident that such a high-profile individual such as Hong Seok Hyun would not ignore this since it would be harmful to his reputation if this was publicized. In May, 2017, he was dispatched by the Korean government to the United States as part of a special envoy to meet with President Trump, Vice President Pence and Mr. Kushner in White House.

My worst suspicions are that this was a coordinated effort of a malicious nature linked to Chinese Communist Party (CCP). If this is the case, this is an international political matter especially in this environment of harder sanctions and policies against intellectual property thefts involving the CCP.

Is there anyone that may know more about what my options are or if they have any experience in a similar situation? I will post updates as I conduct my own investigations into this and provide more information. Please let me know if you have any questions about this case and I will do my best to provide answers.

**Disclaimer**: I am using a throwaway for anonymity purposes and to avoid potential liability issues. Also, I am fairly new to Reddit so please let me know if I am not reddit-ing the right way or if I need to post to another sub.

656,"I used to be really bad at social situations until I got into college. I can talk to people better now, but when it comes to flirting, my mind just stops, it goes completely blank. People just say ""Be yourself"" or ""Just do the first thing that comes to your mind"", but I'd be staring at the wall with nothing to say, pounding down another shot.

I have a hard time making eye contact, I cant even think when I do. When they lead the conversation a little flirty, I impulsively say something that runs the moment because it's funny. I have the reputation of being a funny dude, definitely not a flirty one.

658,"So, background: my older brother and I never got along and every single time we had to talk to each other, it was only to fight.
Two months or so ago we had a pretty big fight and he ended up saying that I would never know what college life was because I had an IQ 5 and in the future I was only going to be the prostitute that I already am.
So yeah, that hurt like hell, coming from someone I grew up with, I spent the rest of the day crying, breathing was a difficult task sometimes and I ended up all night thinking about it. And two months later here I am, doing the same shit.
The thing is: at the time no one did anything about it. No one punished him and every singles person that he meets ends up loving him because he is such a nice person to be with and bla bla bla. Yet I came to a point where the simple thought about him makes me angry and anxious.
I mean.. Am I wrong? Am I an asshole for hating him? Should I just try to change myself? I don't know what to do anymore..",02Jun2019,1
659,"yeah I’m 13 male basically my parents won’t let me walk 5 steps alone without them. I can’t go outside at all alone and most days I’m stuck at home until late afternoon. I just play video games all day after school (am homeschooled) until I go shopping at night.

They refuse to let me even take out the trash or check the mailbox alone. I had to beg them for like 20 minutes just to go get my phone from my dads car, while they were watching me from the doorway.

I think my mom is hiding some type of mental problem because she can’t let me go. Idk, but she said I can go outside alone when I’m 16, and I don’t trust her because she often goes back on her words and conveniently “forgets”.one time I asked her if I could make a YouTube channel and she said yes then a week  later she yells at me for having a YouTube channel..my other siblings didn’t go outside alone until 17-19 almost.

I had a lengthy discussion with my mom (who is I think the one who won’t let me go) about her overbearing helicoptering and she denied it all, saying “where do you get these ideas” and shit like that, in the end I just left because she wouldn’t listen really. So talking is no longer an option

My dad on the otherhand, I don’t think minds me going outside. Idk I get mixed feelings, I’m not so sure.. I was thinking just tell my parents where I’m going (they have a tracker on my phone) and when I’ll be back and just walk out the door, not asking them or anything, but I’ll be grounded for sure. My mom will never change her point of view.

662,"My sister is just a regular asshole, and she has been all of her life. She disrespects those who don't treat her like royalty, and mistreats those who feel like they've done something good. Over the past 2 years, she has told me to kill myself in an average twice a month. I've monitored her behavior over the past couple months, and noticed she only down talks me to my face and to my past teachers (I know that because I walked up to my former Algebra I teacher and she told me that my sister had been telling everyone that my mother had put a trespassing order on my boyfriend). My mom is literally watching her swear and mock me and has given up on trying to control her, so now I'm left to fend off my mentality by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I was at Earthfare a couple of hours ago and as usual, I'm quiet, afraid of being mocked and insulted. I ask my mom for a couple of things because I wanted to make myself some dinner (my mom doesn't cook us meals, we all cook our own individual meals). I grab a couple of colorful carrots and a small celery stalk and my sister starts complaining, ""Why are you only getting stuff for yourself, greedy little bitch"". Keep in mind, I'm a year and a half older than her. I keep quiet because I know if I say anything I will dig myself a deeper hole. I get my items and move on.

We get home after checking out and my mom tells me to reorganize the entire fridge/freezer, which I don't mind doing; it's enjoyable for me. I clear up a WHOLE bunch of space in the freezer that we never had and I'm super proud of it and my sister comes downstairs and says ""Wow! Look at you! doing something useless as usual! what do you want? a medal? a sticker?"" I sigh and continue, she basically said that about everything I was going ""heck yeah"" about.

&amp;#x200B;

I've visited friends houses and many of them take their parent's/siblings compliments or thank you's for granted. What I want more than anything is to feel like I've done something good enough for my family to say, good job! I crave the need to feel accepted and wanted, so when my boyfriend or my friends tell me I'm good enough, I don't really want them to stop because I'm never told that at home.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've heard from others is you have to show your dominance on someone younger so they listen to you, but my sister has become spoiled rotten and with my depression on the rise, the opportunity for her to strike me down is even higher. I've also heard that keeping quiet will just bore someone out of trying to fight with you, but really, none of it is working. Asserting my dominance creates more fights, and results in me being emotionally and physically distraught and being silent destroys my mental state and I don't know what to do anymore. When she tells me to kill myself, sometimes I think about it long and hard, because if someone in my own family sees that my life has no meaning, why would anyone see different?",02Jun2019,1
663,"Hello Everyone, this is my first post on this subreddit and I typ this on mobile so sorry in advance if anything is done wrong.

I currently work at a large supermarket with within it a restaurant. I am a shift manager in the restaurant and work at it for 4 years now. I do this as a part time job because I also am studying at a university in the same city. This is also the city where I live myself. 

Now in my department  I have a lot of nice colleagues and I really enjoyed working here. Since one year I have been depressed because of medicine I have. Now I am climbing out of the depression and it costs me a lot of energy to stay positive and not give up on my education. In the past four years I also saved a lot of money so thats not really a problem. 

Now I am very much doubting to leave this place because I sometimes feel like it drags me back down in my depression. But I also feel like its a waste to just leave there, because the depression is in my head and is something I need to fix myself. I don’t know if I should leave or just wait it out a little time before giving it up so easily.

664,"Hello, I am an eleventh grade high school student, and I am here to ask a question on how I can talk, and hang out with a girl that I really like, during the summer, and the future. I am a seventeen year old, I am Hispanic\\Latino, 5'7, brown skin, dark hair, dark eyes, very skinny, I have been wearing glasses for a year and a half now, I am not a very shy person, but I have never really had friends in my life, very few friends, I have had crushes on girls in school, since I was very young, since I was six or seven, I've always lived in the same place, but the crush I have on this girl is bigger than any of my other crushes.I just met her a few months ago, when the school year started, I have only one class with her, I saw here before, but was not interested, anyway I barely saw her before we spoke. She is Hispanic\\Latina, pale skin, brown hair, brown eyes, 4'10, she is also skinny, has glasses, we are both in the same grade, we are both American born(I'm pretty sure she was born in the U.S.) I did not have a crush on her until about six months ago, she came from a different middle school which is also in the city where I reside, and go to school. She has several friends, almost every time I see her she is talking to someone, many times more than one person, I see her with mostly boys, maybe 7 out of 10 of the times I see her she is with boys, she talks to the students who are in the creative arts of the school, such as the students who play instruments, or act, but she is not part of the programs, she also speaks to the intelligent students. She is very nice, she almost always smiles, she smiles with almost everyone, the class I have with her is English, which is a small class, only about thirteen students(I have another class with about forty students) our class only has five girls, and the rest are boys, several of the boys are friends with her. Our teacher has a habit of making us work in groups every week, and sometimes I am in a group with her, I remember the first time I talked to her it was in a group assignment, our group went of topic talking about religion, and how her and this other student in our group were talking about how they are not very religious, and one of the boys was religious, and how she and the other guy did not believe in some things, I then got into the conversation, saying that I also did not believe some things in my religion. I then spoke to her several times while we had group assignments, I was never shy or intimidated, I can maintain eye contact with almost anyone, she seems shy very few times, since she is mostly talking to people, I remember I would go of topic many times when I spoke to her, which I do with many people, we spoke about what teachers we had in the past, and other topics, I remember not having a crush on her at all the first few times we spoke, I always thought she was attractive, other boys think so too, but I am mostly attracted to girls that I bond with, I could tell she enjoyed talking to me, since she is nice, then I remember all of a sudden, I had a huge crush on her, I remember not being able to stop staring at her, I made it obvious that I was staring at her, after that I still talked to her few times but I never flirt, I remember asking her random questions, then I remember missing her some weekends, waiting for school to start so I can see her, on the days that I don't have class with her I almost never see her, about a month ago I was talking to her after school, on school grounds for a few minutes after school ended, since we both live close to the school, we talked about random things, I honestly felt nervous, since I am Anxious, I've been anxious ever since I was young, I know what things she likes, some she told me, some I heard. I've seen her walk with this 12th grade male student who is probably close to her, which one day without looking for her Instagram(which at the time I was beginning to use it) I found it since she folwes, something school related, and I did not really view the posts, but recently she was tagged on a post from that dude, who is a 12th grader, which was at prom, the dude also posted photos where he was with other students both boys and girls, if she likes her, I don't blame her at all, the guy is very attractive, blue eyes, light hair, and athletic, he is shorter than me, but yeah I think he is kinda popular, so I have not really spoke to her in the past few weeks. There is this dude in our class(religious guy) who is maybe in to her, we all sit close to the teacher, and they still talk to each other, the dude was my friend since middle school, we were never close, but yeah I don't dislike him. Around this time, this dude who went to my middle school, who is close to her came in the classroom, and I saw him walking towards me, and he asked me if he could ask me a question, I was a decent mood, I know he was going to ask me something out of the ordinary, since he hardly ever talked to me, I calmly said sure, he then asked me if I liked the girl, and normally would of told him the truth, but I said no, he probably didn't believe me, I then told him, that I think she is very nice, and then he said I understand, I never had a problem with telling other guys what girls I liked, but I didn't want to tell him the truth, I now wish I could have said more, and I want to know how long he wanted to ask me if I like her. We only have two weeks left of school, and I don't know what to ask her, I normally spend my summers watching a lot of football(soccer), and ""exercising,"" I have recently gotten my first job, which I will continue during the summer, but I don't know what to tell or ask her, her birthday is coming soon, another thing to add is that, very few boys flirt with her,but yeah guys thank you for reading, answer if you want, what should I do I really like her, and I never thought of nothing sexual with her, I just love being with her, wish me luck, and thank you very much.",02Jun2019,5
665,"These are our interactions for the past: 

 First year:

1) I tell her that her backpack is open. Showed way more emotion than people regularly do. Example omg you are so sweet thank you so much compared to other people who say thanks 

2) Same year we are in a line and I catch her glancing in my way. 

Now this year (about 8 weeks ago):

1) I’m in the library and I ask her a question about a book and that was that.

Now recently we both end up in the same study quite room

-She sits in front of me in a somewhat empty study room and instead of sitting in front of someone that she knew.

-As stated this was a quiet room but she was on her phone and I guess some tea was being spilled and she  was out spoken if you will. Like it wasn’t obnoxious but noticeable if you are close to them. Phrases like oh my god-no way stuff like that.

-I’m pretty sure that she was looking at me because sometimes I would look at certain directions at people moving around behind her (these people were mostly quiet and she was wearing earphones on) and she would quickly turn her head at the same direction. 

-Also during our time there she moved her laptop to the side which made her more visible. 

My opening when I got her contact was that hey you seem familiar. Her response oh yeah your the guy from the library. Also she remembered the backpack thing. 

Anyways I usually remember people if they stand out. Does it go both ways? With the info given do I have a chance? 

Tl;dr I’ve had interactions with this person in the past. Sits in front of me in quiet study room, I get the feeling that she is trying to get my attention as she was kinda loud for a study room, moved laptop to make herself more visible, and glanced in directions I looked at. Asked for contact info gave it and remembered the interactions we had. Do I have a chance?",02Jun2019,2
667,"Okay so there's quite a bit of context here, but i'll try my best to keep it short and i'll include a tl;dr at the end. 

I am almost 21 years old. The last few years of my life have been filled with all sorts of missteps and mistakes. 

My first year out of high school i went halfway across america to a college in a state I had never been in before. My gf of three years broke up with me after a suicide attempt that resulted in me being hospitalised for about a week. I dropped out of that school right before the first semester ended. So i got no credits from being there. 

I went back home for a few months. Took some community college courses. I was still sort of trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces of my life at that point and ended up failing 2 of the 3 courses i was taking. Then I applied to another college that was only 2 hours from where my parents lived. I took more summer classes there and got A's in all of them. Then the fall semester started and I became really social and started hanging out with friends all the time and ended up having to withdraw from 4 of my 5 classes to salvage my GPA. This last spring semester I pulled off one A and failed my other 4 courses. This was due to a few factors: my roommate (with whom I formed a very close bond) and I basically decided that college wasn't really for us. So I tell my mother about this and she is understandably upset.

now my family has decided to move about 2 hours away (in the general area of the college i've been going to). so the thing is I was fully ready to not go to college and just go to a trade school, take up an apprenticeship and go that route. but so much of my family thinks that's a godawful choice and that i'd be limiting myself for the rest of my life. but i feel like i've started to recognise the things that really matter to me, and for the most part it's not money or girls or material things... instead it's literature and philosophy and art. i feel like i'm torn between this image my family has for me and my somewhat hazy image of myself that i'm not really sure how to actualise yet.

my stepfather has given me an ultimatum. Either I move down there with them and go back to college under the conditions that i must: get good grades, get involved in extracurriculars, and start making connections with the staff of the school to help me figure out job opportunities. (at this point i feel like i should mention I'm an English &amp; Philosophy major). Now, I'm on probation this upcoming semester so if i don't do well, not only will the school kick me out but my stepfather will demand that I repay him for his lost money. Normally I would say this sounds pretty reasonable. But my stepfather and I have a disgustingly bad relationship. Not only has he been a jerk to me since i was 12 but he has physically attacked me on occasion. (and in one particularly humorous instance, yelled at me that i was a failure for smoking weed *while he was high*) (although i technically wasn't supposed to know he was high, i just overheard my mother saying that he was, but she made me promise not to let him know that I knew. so i had to stand there and take him yelling at me to protect her.) also if i do go back to school i essentially still have four years of schooling left. I wouldn't graduate until i was at least 25.

my other option is to stay here. move in with my grandparents for a few months while i save money working some job and then move into an apartment. but if i take this option i have no idea what i would do for work. i had the idea that i take some shoddy job while trying to publish books and short stories which has always been my passion that doesn't sound too bad to me. or should i try to go to a trade school so i can find something a little more challenging and fulfilling?

originally i just thought i'd go back to school and get a degree (my original plan out of high school was to become a teacher or college professor). but with so much failure under my belt it's hard to see how i could make such a huge change by sheer force of will. also it makes me nervous to have my stepdad paying for my college. before my mother was making all the payments, but she lost her job a couple weeks ago. 

I have until next saturday to decide. i feel like i have so many thoughts on this but i can't really get them all down clearly right now because it's just so stressful. sorry for the long post. anyone that made it this far, i genuinely thank you for taking an interest in my life.

Over the years I have been asked by family and friends if I think my husband might be gay. I always had the thought in the back of my mind, but I decided that it didn't matter. 

Flashforward to now, we haven't had a sexual interaction of any kind in almost a year. Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I do get a fair amount of attention for my looks, so I do not think my appearance is the issue. 

Some of his mannerisms (the way he carries himself, the way he says certain things, etc) does give off that vibe, but I wasn't concerned until now. 

I am a very sexual individual, so this lack of interaction is negatively impacting me. 

What should I do? Should I blatantly ask him if he likes men? Should I explore separation? Should I suck it up and deal with it? I need advice.

Well she started messing around with a boy and I got upset because I was worried and scared that he was going to hurt her (everyone knew this boy was a fuckboy and didn’t give a shit about the girls he was “dating”) we got into a fight because of it and she said some pretty nasty things to me. 

Even if I’m angry, I always try to censor my words and make sure that I’m not insulting whoever the person is I’m arguing with. She didn’t care. She blatantly insulted me, told me I was shit, I was emotionally exhausting, and controlling. This obviously hurt me a lot and she continued to bash me even after the fight. 

My boyfriend became friends with her after he started dating me and they weren’t ever super close. In fact, my friend constantly told me that she hated him and that I shouldn’t be dating him (which when I called her out on this, she called me a liar). Well my boyfriend continues to talk to her even though she hurt me a lot and it makes me extremely insecure and anxious. I know that she’s been talking shit about me and I’ve been completely honest with my boyfriend (even the bad shit that I did I was honest about it) so I know that she would try to twist it around on me to my boyfriend.

I know jumping into full time work is not the best thing for me at the moment, I'm in a bad state and I know my limits, however whenever I talk about part time work I get looked down upon by certain members of my family, they call me lazy and retarded. I don't know how to feel anymore, I just feel like I'm trying my best to stay strong and people around me just put me down. I don't want to be horrible to my family, but I just feel like they don't fully understand me or any of my problems. They even know I'm on anti depressants and they still just see me as a joke. I don't know how to feel about it anymore, I want to give up, but I know deep down that isn't the solution. I just feel lost. 
I guess I'm just looking for advice on what I should do or if anyone else has been in a similar position and how it worked out for you.",02Jun2019,1
672,"Okay so he's actually my cousin (3rd cousin) but we are more like friends I guess. We have always been super close since we were little and I really do care for him but he has a tendency to behave a certain way that gets pretty annoying and I have come to learn that he's never going to change because I have directly told him numerous times that he's doing this and he acknowledges it and says he will try to change but he hasn't. 

So here is what I mean by ""his ways"". He lives in fantasy land, is a know-it-all, and a MAJOR one-upper. Let's start with his arrogance and know-it-all ways. So he thinks he knows everything about everything. And sure he's pretty knowledgable about most things, but he gets SUPER annoyingly competitive about it and wants to like ""throw it in your face"" that he knows more than you cause I guess it brings him some form of satisfaction and it just makes him an intolerable person to be around. 

I also think he's a very envious person. He tends to downplay everyone else's accomplishments but as he's gotten older he's adopted a new fake humble personality; he's one of those people that puts on a face that says ""I'm so happy for you"" but deep down he's wishing the worse on you and I think it stems from jealousy. And this behavior isn't just towards me, the reason why I know he's like this is because he has friends who, for example, have gotten engaged or idk... bought a new car or got accepted into whatever school and he will call me and literally talk about it in the most bitter tone and I'm like... you should just be happy for them and he'll say something like ""no no I am but it's like.... how are they even able to afford such a fancy car..? or like how will they even be able to handle married life...?"" and I just don't get his mentality. I think it's because everything he wants to have, he hasn't achieved (probably because he's so bitter and judgemental). 

Now, his fantasy-like delusions. He falls for girls who have ZERO interest in him, these girls literally go and date other men and get engaged to them and he still finds ways to justify why they're not into him and I'm always trying to bring him back to reality and tell him things like... just accept it, she wasn't into you, its okay.... He is overly delusional about his career ambitions and future too, like he wants to get from level 0 to 100 in a blink of an eye without putting any effort or hard work into it. Also, he's never had a real job. He works for his dad's company, always has and most likely always will. He works remotely in Miami Beach and his dad pays for his waterfront apartment. He began work there straight out of college, he's never even been to a real job interview, has never had to deal with the difficulty of the job market that others his age are dealing with. I mean in one sense he's very lucky yet he complains endlessly about how horrible his job situation is. 

He's 29 years old and he gets major FOMO if a group of friends (unintentionally) exclude him out of a gathering and he'll call me and be like I always go out of my way to include everyone and I'm so understanding of other people and their time and blah blah blah and in my head I'm thinking honestly yeah when you do these things it seems so phony and ungenuine, it's almost as if he does it so that other people can reciprocate, it's very conditional but I proceed to tell him how we're all like older now and these things shouldn't be a big deal... we're not in high school... if someone leaves you out, it doesn't mean they don't like you. Let me note here that the group of friends who left him out in this scenario were 3 sets of couples who were MARRIED with PREGNANT wives.... maybe they were doing something that interested them and didn't want to invite their single male friend...? I tried to reason with him and explain this but he thinks like a teenager.

Is this behavior normal for a man who's almost 30 years old? Of course, he has other sides of him that I love, he's funny, he can be enjoyable at times, it's not all bad but some of the things I mentioned above really get under my skin.... He is an only child and I sometimes wonder if his issues stem from that, his parents REALLY spoiled him (with attention and material things) and still do. I seriously think he's delusional about the real world.",02Jun2019,1
673,"My dad and I went on a camping trip together over the weekend. We left Saturday afternoon and spent the night out in the wilderness in a tent (We live in Texas). We were driving back this morning and my dad said he really had to go poop, but there were no bathroom stops for like 10 more miles so my dad just pulled over and said he was going to shit in a nearby field. When he went into the field and pulled his pants down to shit there was a donkey in the field that started chasing him around. I was just sitting in the car reading the map so I did not realize what was happening until my dad fell face first on the ground and the donkey got on top of him, pinning my father down and putting his penis in him. I panicked when I saw my father getting penetrated by the donkey so I just yelled that I was gonna go get help and got into the drivers seat, started the car (my dad left the keys in the ignition) and drove off (don’t worry, I’m 16 and have my license). I kept driving up the road  for about 20 minutes until I came across this Mexican restaurant where I pulled in and got something to eat since I was very hungry and I really like Mexican food. I was at the Mexican place for over an hour since they were busy and I ordered a lot of food. I paid using my dads credit card since he had left his wallet in the glove box of the car. I was pretty tired so I just drove home. It took me about an hour and a half to get home and when I got home I realized that I left my father out in the field where he was getting raped by the donkey. I had totally forgot and I feel like I should go back for him but I don’t even know where that field is and I don’t feel like searching. What should I do?",02Jun2019,0
674,"So here's the story,

I met this girl who we'll call Ashley back in middle school, we were in the same activities and we both liked pokemon and video games etc. and also she had a best friend who we'll call Ella. The three of us were pretty much hanging out together all the time and made a pretty good introvert group but at the time I had no feelings for either of them and I don't think they did either. We were really close and I was even being bullied a little for hanging out with girls but that didn't matter to me.

So for absolutely no reason at all after 2 years of hanging out we lose contact over the summer break one year and I was a very shy person too so even though we were so close I never actually approached them after that. A year passes and me and my best friend are talking about what every preteen talks about, who do you love? I say no one because that was the case but then after giving it some thought I realize that I actually am pretty into Ashley but being the shy little shit I am and with the added nervousness of having a crush on her I never approach her that year as well.I do however do my best to make mutual friends and I become friends with a guy who was friends with Ella.

After a painfully long time of trying to get myself to talk to either of them I finally start regularly texting with Ella. Then comes around high-school and Ella and my best friend go to a different city but me and Ashley went to the same school and we were in the same class too. By this time I was relatively close friends with Ella but I still hadn't really talked with Ashley. So I make a woe that no matter what I will at least say something to Ashley in the first week, and I did. I had never felt so nervous about anything in my life before and it was absolutely exhilarating actually talking with her. So slowly we start talking more and more and after some time we start texting too and we actually become pretty close and people say we'd make a great couple. 

The first semester goes like this and I think that was the happiest period of my life. However because I constantly wanted attention from her and tried to make up stupid shit just to chat I got pretty annoying and I wasn't even acting like myself anymore. So she got more and more distant from me and I kept being more and more persistent because I was afraid she was growing away from me which made everything worse. Also in the mean time her and Ella also were growing apart because Ella was becoming more of a popular girl along with other reasons too. 

At the end of the first year Ashley wasn't really talking with me anymore and some of our other friends who we played video games with also didn't want me around anymore so the only people I was left with were my best friend and Ella. After I accepted that Ashley hated me and gave up on pursuing her although I still very much loved her I was trying to get myself away from thinking of her.

So the summer break passes and I've still been texting with Ella all this time and right after a school starts Ella indirectly confesses to me. Obviously being the third densest thing in existence after a black hole and a neutron star I don't actually notice that she has confessed to me and we text like normal but more awkwardly for a week. This is where my best friend steps in after learning that she confessed to me from other people and tells me to settle it with Ella.

I honestly don't know what I was thinking. I didn't like her in a romantic way, although I did my best to get over Ashley I very obviously still liked her but for whatever reason I said yes.

Ashley learnt that me and Ella were going out and texted me, quoth the Ashley, 'congrats'. To which I replied 'thanks' and ended it there.

We dated for 6 months and although it was a long distance relationship she'd come home to her parents on the weekends and we'd hang out most weekends. However after the first couple months things weren't going very well with Ella too and we eventually broke up in the summer brake.

School starts again, where's Ashley? Oops she went abroad to continue her studies there. Nice. At this very point I started talking with some old friends and what do I learn? Ashley was into me too during the first year but I was so off putting that she couldn't stand me anymore. I hate myself. It dawns on me how she must've felt when I started dating Ella. I for one know how I would've felt she started dating my best friend like I did with Ella. I am a piece of garbage. 

The year passes 

Last year of high school starts, this year. Eventually we make up wih Ella and we agree that we were meant to only be friends and thats fine. Ashley hates me and it's been so long and I've been thorough so much I don't even know how I feel about her. A part of me says I love her but another part isn't very sure.

Present.

I learn she's come back to stay in her hometown for the summer break. I am going to talk to her. I will tell her how I've felt and how I feel but I'm not expecting her to accept my feelings or for anything to happen. I know she hates me, she's said so but she has all the right seeing as what I did. I can't expect to make up for anything but I don't want things to stay like this either.

So what do I do, what should I say?

No matter what I've made my mind that I will talk to her.

Next year I'll be enrolling in uni so I don't know how things will be in the future but she's going to go back abroad to continue her studies there.

I know some people will mock me because I'm ""too young and naive"" and I don't even ""know what love is"" but please leave spare me the treatment, I've already had my fair share.

Sorry for the long post but I don't want to do anything wrong. Even if she doesn't love me anymore she is a very precious person for me and I at least want to make up with her. 

Thank you. 

TL;DR: I had a crush on an old friend who also had a crush on me but I was too annoying so she grew distant and the very next year her now ex-bestie who now she hates confesses to me and so we date and after we break up my original crush has gone abroad but now she's coming back for the summer and I want to talk to her.

I have told SO I am finding it tricky and will let him know when I have some options as right now I want no one to influence my decision and so that he knows I am not keeping secrets. Here is the thing, we are looking to move in together in a year or so. My career has year long contracts. There is one place that is willing to give me a chance and want me to grow within their company professionally. The pay is about 3 grand lower annually, but puts my foot back into my career. I would have to move out of the area- the place SO and I are looking to move in is about 30-40 minutes away from this place. Though it is not official. He may want us to stay where he is. I am not sure what to do, for us to move in I need a steady job and this place is giving me that opportunity. I am just worried that the initial distance ( hour and half away from each other) will cause a strain and ruin our relationship. We are 27 and 31.

Today we ended up having an argument because I expressed my anxiety about looking for a post and he basically said I need to grow a pair and think like an adult. It seriously felt like a slap in the face because ideally I wanted to have a career change but I’m purely forcing and pushing through this career so that we can get a place together. We are obviously an adult couple but we have been together for 11 months. I get that he is 31 and wants to get on the property ladder but this whole thing is causing me so much stress.

Since this is so long of a text I cannot guarantee that the grammar is the best of the best in this post (plus written on a phone at the middle of a night)

*I cannot risk telling too many details on this since I'm affraid someone who knows about this so far could be reading this. (And if you know me, I'm sorry)*

So about two months back I had a one-nighter with this guy (I'm a guy too) at one weekend. It all started as a weekend with friends and stuff so we were hanging pretty late and at 2am we decided to go to sleep since we'd have to wake up relatively early. This guy who I had known about for half a year (who also seemed straight af) pretty much stated the whole thing leading to that night. It was just some friendly poking as we sat next to each other while we were watching a movie. I thought it as casual but friendly teasing so I poked back. Then at one part when we started to get tired he started to lean on me. He didn't say anything but he just did and I let him do it since, well, that is what friends (like brothers I'd say) do.
But then comes the part when we went to ""sleep"". For some reason since we all had our own beds in a one big bedroom, we thought it would be funny to put every bed next to each other so we would have one massive bed. I was sleeping next to him.
So some *bro* stuff happened there but nothing sexual. And as we stared to sleep, I could feel the guy touch my crotch. I did recoil and almost stand sitting to my bed. Now at this part my memory of it is kinda fuzzy since I've forced myself to forget it (more on that later) Some talking happened which lead to some... idk... third-person-roleplay and what all ended up on me giving me him a handjob. After that we both were like ""wtf was that"" but in a positive way. So we had some small talk about it, nothing much, like that we would never tell about this to anyone (whoops) and we too started to sleep. (It had been long since everyone else started to sleep).
So after that the morning came and we went home. And after a week of pondering ""what the actual fuck was that, why did it happen, why did I do it"" and so on. I messaged him asking that do we have something going on between us. He responded saying that he didn't know what lead him into it, that he was completely straight and didn't want anything from anything at the moment (I'm implying that he didn't want any relationship then). Then he also said that what happened there, should stay in there.
After this I drifted into a sort of limbo where I felt depressed about it but then guilty of feeling depressed because that would be selfish. So I started labeling myself as a sex offender and a *niceguy* for I couldn't let it go. And then I wanted to forget it. And that only has been some bad time drinking but I still can remember it.
The feelings built up enough that I had to tell my closest friend and she theorized him being just shy and having a too big of an ego to keep up so he couldn't ""be honest with himself"". I was ready to give him my all but now I've felt semi-ok but I still couldn't let it go. Now that I've thought about messaging him again about what the fuck was it in actuality, I've been held back by my own thoughts of me being too desperate or maybe manipulative, which both are against my morals, but I couldn't text or talk to him because I need to keep up my ego and not let anyone know how desperate of a person I really am.

What on earth should I do?

Should I text him about him in honesty or just keep trying to forget and live on.",02Jun2019,0
685,"A couple years ago a couple of friends asked me if I would help them make a baby – I agreed and after a lot of trying (first the turkey baster method, eventually through a clinic), I was able to help them. One requirement was that I never share my involvement with anyone – they don't want anyone to know I was involved, at least for the near future.  Fair enough.

Recently, a \*second\* couple asked me the same thing. They of course know nothing about the first couple. So here's the thing: the first couple own a bunch of vials(?) of my frozen ""material."" Maybe 10 or 12.  They are unlikely to use it all (I doubt they want even a second kid, but who knows?) So, given the difficulty that went into creating the first kid, and the fact that a bunch of my frozen material is already in existence (which was expensive to have created), it seems like things could be made much more simple for the second couple.  They could literally just go to the same clinic and be inseminated from one of the samples already on ice, after all the testing and the contracts etc. etc.

Of course, I can't tell the second couple about the first, and I shouldn't tell the first couple about the second. But if I could share this info, it would not only possibly make it easier for the second couple, but I'd imagine both couples might want to know that their kids will have a ""half sibling.""

689,"My bf and I have been dating for almost a year and a half. He is graduating in about 10 months and will hopefully begin training to be a pilot for the military. We never really talked about what would happen once he graduated as I still have three+ years left at this uni. Towards the year mark of our relationship I began to feel as though he wasn’t as invested in the relationship as he was before and he no longer cared about what I felt about this relationship. 

(A great example is that I told him time and time again about how excited I was about our one year anniversary and when the day came all he said was “cool”. The worst part is that we had a really low key Valentine’s Day because we acknowledged that our one yr was coming up and wanted to save our money for that) (another example is that I had severe pain and thought it was appendicitis. The next morning I had to walk to his house bc he had my car and after begging him to wake up and take me I had to drive myself. He then made no effort to see me in the hospital or during my recovery and chose to drink every day of that weekend. This still brings me sadness) 

I am a very chill person and will go with the flow. I have no complaints about doing what he wants to do. I have compromised quite a bit for him but he refuses to compromise for me. I brought up my concern that he was dating me to fill up his time before he left. He declared that to be outrageous because “why would I waste my time if I didn’t really like you”. 

It has recently got to the point that we hadn’t had sex for three months until a few nights ago we had been drinking and he got blackout drunk and he sloppily decided to get it on. 

We hardly hang out alone anymore and when we do he just plays video games and falls asleep on the couch. I’ve tried talking to him about it but all he said was that he was leaving after he graduated (I thought we had a little over a year left) and that we would be breaking up at that time. Later on he told me to have realistic expectations of our relationship. I just realized what he meant by that and that he is basically only half dating me. (Does this make sense? Half the effort?) 

We knew this going was going to be hard and most likely end at his graduation but we agreed to be all in. I love him and he says he loves me. I am the kind of person who loves to love who I am dating and expect the same. 

Should I just deal with this type of relationship where we don’t try hard to treat the other? How do I manage the emotions?

My dad has been mentally and (what may or may not count) as sexually abusing me (sticking his figners, foot and other objects in my butt) since i was arround 6. 

He has delfated my confidence and my self worth by constantly making comments ,which he calls “jokes”,
about my appearance, smell, personality, hobbies, taste in food, intrests, intelligence, friends, girlfriends, (what he thinks to be) sexuality and basically anything he can make fun of. These include “faggot”, “cock sucker”, “Racist”(i have one black friend that I occasionally visit, hes basically a neo-nazi , said on multiple occasions that the whould of been better if hitler finished his work, when ever i dont go to my friends house for a while he asks “is that n****r gone training, ect) “fucking retard”, “window licker”, called both of my girlfriends (didn’t have two at the same time obv) “slut”, “trash”, “ones you feel sorry for”, ect. There is more but i am running out of time as i need to get to sleep.

He makes every car ride hell with the most recent one being two women on the radio talking about body modifications and one of them saying “didn’t you snog a guy with a tattoo on his face?” to which my dad turned to me and said “you whould like that whouldnt you”.  He makes the most ammount of comments in a car on the way to get food as my mum isn’t arround and I can’t exactly jump out of the car and run home. 

Any time i try to confront him about it he either calls me a faggot or a snowflake (me being a avid youtube user in 2016 I actually know what the term means unlike him). I have tried to compile audio recordings of him doing this but each time i have failed, either with the recording software not working or whenever i turn it on he doesn’t do anything.

Also it is not just me (par from anything sexual) he does the same to everyone else in my family with comments about my mums family including my grandparents who have pasted away who me and my mum both adored. And general insults to everyone par my baby sister who is 3.

Every time i raise my voice to him (my speach is very fast so i have to repeat and raise my sentences alot) he threatens to hit me) he threatens to hit or kill me. He calls my every name except my own and when i call him out for this he says “look retard, i dont care what you think and i never had” then continues to order me about although one time he did say “i want to shoot you so fucking bad” and he has multiple shotguns and rifles so he very well could.

I don't feel as insecure as I used to. My friends are amazing and they're always complimenting me but I know they're being nice. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm the least attractive but girls find me funny so I guess I make up for it personality wise, Idk.

697,"I’m (19M) at my third semester of college/uni and I’m studying to be a pharmacist. Two of my older brothers studied at the same institution and I chose to study the same out of fascination with the topic, but I’ve always been kind of a slacker. I’m not that stupid I guess, cause I got in to one of the best universities of my country,  but since elementary school I always aimed for the least effort route, which usually meant studying and doing every single assignment at the last posible moment leaving the rest of the time to play games or watch tv, until I bearly had enough time. I’m really REALLY used to do this, and I managed to pass the first year with relative ease failing only one course, but as I’m taking more “advanced” courses I’m starting to see how much of a shitty habit that is.
The problem is I can’t seem to change it!
No matter how hard I try to study or do my assignments on time I can’t seem to concentrate or muster enough will power to do it, instead I trail off to watch stupid memes or simply lay on my ass and do nothing all weekend or after I come home, until all I have left is the pressure of knowing I don’t have time left.
And pharmacy is not exactly an easy career, which leaves me really depressed these days as I’m thinking I won’t be able to graduate ever.
I think I already failed one of my courses and the rest are in danger of going down the same route, and one of those I already failed it once! I don’t know what to do and quite frankly I’m sick it, I’m sick of thinking I’m just a mediocre mess and not knowing what to do about it.",02Jun2019,1

701,"My husband and I opened our an automotive repair shop. We both quit our jobs for it. He turns the wrenches. I do everything else and some of the ""lube tech"" kind of jobs. The physical space is much too large for just our needs, so we rent half to a towing company. It's the logical thing to do. The towing  company literally brings in work for us. Totally mutualistic. 
The problem is that I cannot stand the owner of the towing company. (TG for ""towing guy"" from here on out.) I find TG to be one of the most narcissistic, sexist people on the face of the planet. He's profoundly unprofessional, and it's just a matter of time before his lack of professionalism starts affecting our bottom line. 
I've talked to my husband about TG. My husband says he's talked to TG. Nothing has changed. There's no point in me talking to TG because I'm a woman - he won't listen.
I've told my husband that I want to find a different job, and he's said that he needs me at the shop during the day. I'm torn because it's my business too. I expected a certain amount of sexism because I'm a woman in a male-dominated industry, but this is constant woman-bashing, rape jokes, and dismissiveness. BTW, I was raped; I didn't find it funny. 
Also, TG and my husband are now besties. Our families do almost everything together. TG blows up his phone constantly. We can't do anything without him interrupting. It's super annoying. This is not a man I want to spend time with or expose my young daughters to.

So, what should I do? Should I  get another job and give up my stake in a business I helped create and have been operating?

My last job I was a medical biller for a small chiropractic office, that job took me a while to adjust as well but I feel like I'm having a few more difficulties with this one. I'm young and still pretty new to the job field so I feel inadequate compared to those with my experience. 

2 weeks into this job I had surgery to get my appendix removed, I took a week and a half off to heal and did half days when I came back. I only started doing full days again about a week ago. Then my doctor started adjusting with my medication, which is common but it's tough adjusting when I'm being put onto new medication (Seroquel). The medication is working, but I definitely do have off-days where it seems like none of it works. Embarrassingly, I had to go home early on Friday because of how bad I felt. 

I feel like I'm slacking and it honestly makes me feel overwhelmed. Every weekend, especially this one, the anxiety builds up about walking back in on Monday.

715,"Backstory: My grandma had terminal lung cancer and was on a heavy dose of morphine (?). My Mom was fairly hammered that day presumably to help cope with the grief. My brother was at a bowling alley having some beers with some friends and I went to Houston to visit a friend from work.

When I got back around 12 am I went to check on my grandma. I saw that my mom was sprawled out sleeping next to her. Now, my Mom has always been a wild thrasher in her sleep, constantly moving and adjusting in what one could call an aggressive manner. When I looked at my Grandma, I immediately knew she was dead. But here's the kicker, the oxygen tube that fed into her nose was laying beside her. I went to get my brother and confirm what I already knew, and we surreptitiously inserted the oxygen tube back into my Grandma's nose. Waking up my Mom, and her realizing that her Mom had died sleeping next to her was a face of anguish I'll never forget. 

Who knows if the oxygen tube accidentally came off and my Grandma wasn't able to put in back on due to the morphine, or if my Mom accidentally took it out through her sleep thrashing, or maybe my mom made the executive decision that she didn't want to see her mom suffer anymore (which I doubt). Either way, I'm taking that secret to my grave.

I've been leaning towards never telling my Mom what happened that day, because what would the point be? I feel like it would only add to her anguish. But, a couple of buddies of mine said that if they were in her shoes they would want to know the truth. While I heavily disagree with them, what do y'all think?",02Jun2019,2

This old classmate in my school has depression (diagnosed by a psychologist and takes pills) and we are sort of friends, but in reality we don't know each other that well. 

We sometimes chat on Instagram, and then he tells me about his life or how he feels and his emotions in general. (Sort of like a psychologist, even though he goes to one already) 

But one day he told me that he's feeling exceptionally bad, and he told me things like this: 
(The following quotes are literally what he said, but translated)

- Nobody can know this, I have been thinking about it for a while 

- I want to do things that people can't imagine 

- I want to hurt so many other people 
(I asked who: everyone)

- I want to destroy them fully

- I can't talk about this with my psychologist

(I asked if the thoughts had lessened) 
- No, they've gotten worse 

(I asked if he really wanted to hurt others) 
- No I don't, but if there is no other way I will

724,"Get ready for a story. I have a very good friend I’ve known since college, we’ll call him Andrew. Andrew worked at a top 10 consulting firm for a bit then went off to start his own company we'll call AeroCots with a friend names Jack. AeroCots will make a few million dollars in contracts next year. AeroCots has an institutional lead investor we'll call BigVest and will soon raise a second financing round to fulfill these contracts next year. Currently, AeroCots works out of an office provided by BigVest. I’ll be graduating with a STEM degree in about 9 months and Andrew wants me to be the CTO of AeroCots once I do. The pay would be above market salary, in my field and with the autonomy of an executive, basically a dream job.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s the issue. One year ago, another student, we’ll call her Olga, also went to the school Andrew and I did and I TA’d one class Olga was in. I never even introduced myself to Olga during the class until the end. At one point, Olga was on a team of 4 students giving a startup business presentation as part of the final project. The day before, I held a practice session which was basically me listening to the students’ presentations and telling them things to improve. It was clear during the practice presentation that Olga was supposed to be the original speaker, but she left it up to one of her teammates, say Sam, last minute. Sam clearly had not seen the presentation, much less practiced it enough. I informed them this would look very unprofessional and that either Olga should be presenting or that Sam should have been more prepared and it might be too late to hand the reigns to Sam last minute like this. I also told Olga this wasn’t a nice thing to do to a teammate and that it hopefully doesn’t reflect her behavior on the team outside of class. She nodded and agreed. I never spoke with another student from that class again. When I spoke to the professor, I told him about Olga's group and how despite however their presentation went, he should maybe talk to everyone on Olga's team and ensure that everyone felt comfortable about work contributions. Three months later, I get a facebook message request from Olga saying ""Hey, I wanted to ask why you want to give a 'warning' to AeroCots about me?"" I did not respond nor accept the request. I'm not sure what trail of rumors lead to her believing I wanted to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Through a series of connections unrelated to me, Olga ended up working for AeroCots and actually is their ‘current’ CTO.  Andrew tells me that the day after he announced I was to be the next CTO to AeroCots, Olga went to BigVest behind their backs and made up stories about how I sexually harassed her and would do the same to BigVest and AeroCots if I were brought on. Andrew and his cofounder, Jack, know this is nonsense and this kind of behavior, coupled with inadequate technical abilities and inability to receive criticism were cited as the reasons for wanting to find a new CTO. However, BigVest does not want one of their portfolio companies to become another MeToo story and for now, I am persona non grata until BigVest finishes an investigation, since as it turns out, Olga also reported Andrew and Jack too and painted us all as mysoginists (a mistake if all she wanted to do was prevent my hiring, but she probably did it as a last ditch effort since Andrew would've fired her anyway). AeroCot's attorney on retainer and will be representing Andrew, his cofounder and me.

&amp;#x200B;

Andrew told me he would fire Olga 58 days after this post regardless of anything because Olga is seriously hindering progress and that the problems would be gone before onboarding me (although I think Andrew might be underestimating that it might take up to a year before we truly clear our names and legally prove Olga wrong). The evidence (and lack of it on Olga's end given I never even talked to her out of the context I've written in this post) overwhelmingly supports me and I'm 90% sure this false accusation won't impact me long term, but I have now decided not to join AeroCots. Of course it isn't Andrew's fault, or BigVest's fault, but even with an Olga-less AeroCots, I don't feel comfortable working for a company with a lead investor which is so fearful/inept/whatever that they would throw one of their investments under the bus and now blacklist a person they don't even know (me), without actually examining evidence first. Right now about the only thing that will convince me to join AeroCots is a long series of notarized legal documents and apology letters from Olga herself just to make sure she can't surface again to harm me. It really is a dream job, but I feel like it's best to walk away. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

I am still job searching and will be lining up other employment offers soon, but this whole mess has increased my paranoia to an unreasonably high degree. The fact that an insane and insecure person can accuse me of something and ruin my whole reputation irks me greatly. The fact that Olga tarnished the reputation of all women to harm others to try and keep her job irks me. It irks me that the next time a woman comes up to me saying someone has done something to her that I now have to doubt her. I used to just believe anyone and was an unconditionally supportive person (after all, the mandated harassment training told us to say ""I believe you"" and ""It's not your fault"" to any victim who comes up to you). I'll still do this for people, but Olga was the first person to ruin my trust like this. Now when I go on dates, I actually ask my dates to sign incremental consent forms via docusign right before we head to a private area, then have them send texts right before doing anything sexual. Gah, it's annoying, but based on this experience, it feels like the only way to keep a reputation and keep out of jail. Because even if I'm in the right, the damage of going to court and being blacklisted by companies is irreperable and maybe just maybe these pre-emptive moves will convince someone to act rationally if I happen to cross paths with another sociopath.",02Jun2019,2
725,"This probably seems very insignificant but I need advice and can’t really go to anyone so here goes

I’m a teenager with a brother three years younger than me. My mom died when I was 8 or so and I don’t really remember much but it’s been taking a toll on my dad and I’m starting to notice it more

He’s just been getting... angrier I guess. No physical abuse or anything he is a good father but he’s starting to scare me a bit. He just yells so so much and my brother starts to cry and he stays mad for hours and I don’t know what to do

Something small will happen like me and my brother fighting over who’s turn it is to take the dog out (we got her a little over a year ago and she’s really made the house brighter) and he’ll just snap

He’ll yell at me and my brother and (this time just because of circumstance) threatened/deliberately stated that we were “giving the dog back” and curse at us. He doesn’t say verbally abusive stuff it’s more like “you’re always fucking arguing!” Or something

I think my brother and I sometimes act out to get attention (or I may be completely wrong I don’t know) because he’s a single parent my dad doesn’t really spend time with us and when he has free time he usually does something alone to wind down.

Sometimes I think about asking for him to spend time with us instead of destiny or whatever but then I feel like that would be being ungrateful because he does so much.

I have a pretty good life. Financially stable with a vacation every few years and I get good grades so I feel like I have no right to not like something about my life but this has been happing more and more and I can’t ask friends because I don’t want other people to get involved and my brother can’t know how much this is affecting me as well.

Lots of people came around as the ambulance came for me the kids had ran away as blood poured out of my face and I woke up. My friend was there but his parents where out of town so instead of helping he had run away protecting my belongings and came back saying he was so sorry. He’s black and he didn’t want anything to do with the cops and I can understand that even though we’re on a military instillation so they’re MPs but anyways he made it up to me during my recovery giving me his 2001 UNC Jordan 11’s that he knew where my holy grails. Anyways I went to the hospital I have a scar from it and a broken nose and a concussion but it’s been 6 months now. After the fight kids asked the MPs what had happened they told them some autistic kid got beat up, I also learned my dad hadn’t been in the hospital because they arrested him while I was passed out because a kid pointed to the boys house and he ran to it and the tackled and arrested him. He is a lawyer and got out and they apologized, because he did nothing illegal by using his right to run down.

731,"I've had a pretty difficult roommate situation this year.  I moved into an apartment with 2 girls, and quickly learned they were quite entitled, had no intention on cleaning, and were generally inconsiderate and messy/boring on unhygenic.  From the beginning, they haven't done dishes or taken out their trash, and hosted multiple loud parties on school nights (we are college students) without any warning or consideration for how it might affect me.  Being the passive person I am, I avoided confronting the problem (aside from kindly asking then if they could do their dishes in a more timely manner) and instead just continued to clean up after them, never getting help or even a thank you.  Now, they are moving out.  May 31 was the last day of their lease, and we were all supposed to chip in for the new people to come.  When I got to the apartment, however, the living room was entirely full of their stuff, clothes were still in the closets, and my roommates were no where to be found. I spent hours cleaning, but due to the clutter, could not thoroughly clean the space.  My roommates did not clean nor remove their belongings from the apartment despite their lease being up, and instead put their stuff in my room so it wouldn't get in the way of the new roommates who were moving in. They still had stuff in the apartment this morning, 2 days after their lease was up, and don't seem to understand that they no longer have legal claim to the space.  The new roommates are now (rightly) complaining that the apartment is disgusting and want to hire a cleaning service, and subtract it from my old roommates' security deposit.  When this was mentioned, my old roommates pushed back and said that I should pay a portion of the cleaning costs as well, despite my cleaning the space as planned, and went on to claim that they had been cleaning the apartment all year. It's not a lot of money, but on principle I believe that I should not be paying for cleaning that they neglected to do, especially since I have essentially acted as their maid all year.

He said he planned on committing suicide and just wanted the drama to be over already, so he’d have a bit of peace before he did it. Everyone on the server started spamming messages about how his life was precious and how things would get better. Though he had been our enemy moments before, we offered to be his friend and help him through it. He refused all of our offers. He said if he was AFK for a while, it was because he had killed himself. He suddenly went offline and hasn’t gone back online. I hope he listened, but I’m just really worried he didn’t.

Or at least the friends I do have are only people I talk to in school to pass the time but they never actually want to go out and do stuff with me. I spend my days in my dark room just binging tv. I have nothing to do, nobody to see, no motivation etc. I’m always the last resort for everybody. I never see people chose me as a first option. It always ends up with me having to constantly ask people to even just come over to my house and visit with me and it feels like they’re always reluctant. I can’t remember the last time someone else has made an effort to spend time with me. It’s always me begging to spend time with them.

742,"Please excuse the title...it sounds a bit too much like a book title.

Now, I am Depressed, but that doesn't mean this post has to be depressing. We can try to keep things light. ;)

&amp;#x200B;

Short-ish backstory:

**First depression:** Bullied as a child. (Which was a superb crash-course into human psychology.) Picked every piece of that depression apart piece by piece during my teenage years and saw how all factors strengthened and weakened me.

End of the First Depression: With 16 my depression was over; I took a breath in life more vivid than any experience ever before. I learnt about everything! My school hadn't enough material to interest me, so I spent 2 days of each week pulling all-nighters just researching any topic I wanted to learn about. I became top of all my classes. I had friendships, but knew they wouldn't last

**Beginning of my 2****^(nd)** **Depression:** I tackled the next challenge: The meaning of Life...My meaning of life!...Nothing. I ground to a halt, I had a sudden melancholy of life...I was happy in the moment, but it all seems pointless in the big theoretical picture; a very bittwersweet feeling...which turned into my second and current Depression.

&amp;#x200B;

**2****^(nd)** **Depression: As far as I can tell these are the chracteristics, that now define me:**

I would not call myself intelligent, for merely researching some big topics online and reading a few books.

Infront of other people I am a very honest (except with my depression), calm, overly formal, polite and unconfrontational (due to past bullying and the feeling noone deserves harm) person, who is however extremely uninteresting (since I am truly no longer interested in anything), aimless (No goals in life; Currently get money through a free social year in a hospital FSJ), and far to philosophically minded (....Damn, they got me XD) person.

Therefore I have no friends.

&amp;#x200B;

These have been my attempts at solving my Depression:

* Eat healthily (Since I work in a hospital...PEOPLE, stay away from sugar, smoking and brain dead levels of alcohol; what are you doing?!?), 
* go for walks, 
* try to think positively (listen to happy music), 
* no substance abuse, 
* look at other cases of Depression (Stephen Fry for example), 
* Read about Depression and its' cures,
* Philosophies, Presentations, TED-Talks, YouTube Videos about finding meaning in life,
* speaking to those past friends about Depression (blank-ish faces, and I am suddenly a charity case, that requires different treatment.),
* questioning, whether I would ever find love in this manner -&gt; if not, learn in advance how to become independant, as though I am the only person in existance -&gt; I am quite managing that,
* not speaking to people about my depression (Combined with the last point, it put my mind at more ease than imagined),
* Creating a folder with all my thoughts and feelings explained (20 pages),
   * After a suicide attempt, I had a psychologist...I showed him my folder, with my detailed explanations...His advice was: ""You must appreciate the little things in life""...and nothing else.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oaYZEXwTc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oaYZEXwTc)....I tricked him into thinking I was cured of my Depression and was out of there quite quickly. (It always makes me so insanely angry, but laugh at the same time.)

**And now:**

I am male, 20 years old, about to be 21. As you can see from my Reddit posts, I draw a bit with MS Paint (I know, it hilariously is just MS Paint) and play video games as distractions.

I am an atheist, because (to me) all my research has just confirmed multiple times over, that there is no god...and if there is such a thing as the roman or greek gods...ok? So, what's the point, then? They don't know what they are doing themselves.

I analyze morals of stories as distractions. I have stopped fighting that Depression (with this post being the exception).

&amp;#x200B;

Psychologist Jordan Peterson: ""No job + No relationships or no friends + Addiction problem or health issues = Almost impossible to help you."" I have one of those points; Two more strikes and I'm out.

And here it finally is: Why do you live your life? What do you recommend me? Why sould I live my life?

What makes you happy? What have you done differently, or similarly?

For once, I'm interested in any reply...

Have a nice day!",02Jun2019,2
743,"I'm in a strange situation where I must choose where to live. My dad decided to cheat on his girlfriend (which we were living with) and I now live with my grandma.

744,"Need some advice on the professional courtesy of giving adequate notice.  I’ll be leaving my job to return to school in two months, but I’m planning on a vacation and down time to mentally prepare, so I’m having my last day be 7/2. The problem is, there was a paycheck that was supposed to be direct deposited in my account that my employer missed. Check was from over a year ago and I realized this when organizing files and found the live (stale) check. I let them know about this check May 23, but the HR person said it would need to be sent to corporate before a new check being written. The HR person said I should get new check by June 8th..It was for approx. 2000$ so I would prefer to have my new check written before I give my notice. Waiting til the end of this week would only allow me to give a 3 week notice.

I was really planning to give 30 days notice since I could see my job possibly being hard to fill. It is a physical therapist position in metropolitan area. I know for a prior position, I signed an agreement saying I would give 30 days notice, but I’ve been in this current job for over 3 years and honestly cannot remember if I ever signed anything like that. I’d prefer to maintain good relationships with this company if I can.

745,"Hey all,

Last night my father hit my mother repeatedly and I called 911. This isn’t the first time it has happened. The police came and arrested my dad after he admitted to hitting my mother. He was released today and going to court tomorrow for the incident. I’m looking for some moral support and wondering if I did the right thing. 

In my heart, I kind of know I did the right thing but I’m getting vibes from a neighbor that I shouldn’t have done it. My brother flat out told me it was a mistake after telling me I did the right thing last night. So I think he’s a little conflicted about the situation and worried about us financially. Either way, I want to know what I did was right because what my father did is illegal. 

Also looking for guidance on the situation. My brother and I are currently unemployed and living with my mother (in my fathers place, he pays the rent). My father is probably going to live in his car because it’d be easier than having to move 3 people out (sort of talked to him about this today.) I plan on getting a job in a day or two to support financial needs and my brother has been looking for a job too. My mother cannot work due to mental issues. Is there any other financial support we can get? 

And lastly, is there any resources for helping my dad get anger management and/or counselling to relieve some of his stress? (Preferably with translation resources because English is not our first language.) 

My father only ever takes it out on my mom for reasons I believe to be the cause... other than that he’s an ok guy. How can I get my family any sort of help through this? 

Thank you.",02Jun2019,4
746,"Lets call her ""c"". Last week I saw her three times (I initiated the plans twice - once for her bday and once to go to the beach- and the third time was an event we went to. She kept saying how much fun she had at the beach and how she wants to go about every other week this summer. She said we will plan the next beach day on Sunday when we see each other (today) then mentioned that she's not good with making plans. I saw her today and no mention of planning a beach trip was made. I don't believe that she's not good with making plans- she knows I will agree to go and we've known each other for a long time.  I think she just wants me to keep asking her to go out as an ego boost but it's annoying- why can't she say something? She isn't really shy or awkward so that's not an issue. Why are people so incapable of going out of their comfort zone and living their lives? I notice this pattern with many friends who expect me to do all the asking and I'm tired of it. Would she really rather sit at home then ask me to go to the beach- is something wrong with her? What do I do now?

754,"Ugh, where to even start... 

For the past few years I've been extremely depressed due to a multitude of reasons. Neither sex or romance have been on my mind in many years- and most certainly not to the point where I'd want to pursue a relationship with anyone. 

Then five days ago I was at the liquor store, where I struck up conversation with a girl who worked there, inquiring about a particular bottle. They didn't have it, but we chatted for a good 45 minutes when she asked for my number and IG. Already *whoa*, because I'd never been asked that before, nor have I been spoken with in such a forward manner. No later than 20 minutes after I left the store did she start texting me. Immediately she let me know that the moment she saw me her ""girl parts went zing"", that I was exactly her type, and that she had to fight the urge to openly flirt with me as she'd of been fired. At this point I was seriously taken back. I thought to myself (and even asked her) ""Me?! Someones type?! Ha! That's hilarious..."", to which she rebutted asking whether I'd been bullied or abused to have such a horrible self-esteem. The truth is, I'm quite overweight and my issues all stem from that. But she's in her late-30's and knows what she wants, I guess. After exchanging several details about our lives (some good, some tragic) things got ***really*** heated and before I knew it she was sending me closeup photos of her anatomy, telling me stuff that would make the most hardened of sailors blush, and trying to organize a time to come and see me (I live almost three hours away)... you know, in order to hook up. All the while she's intertwining talk about her boyfriend who she just moved in with at the start of May, but telling me he understands she can be attracted to other people, which in my mind suggested perhaps an open relationship. I won't lie, it felt awesome to be this intensely desired and I got off thinking about her a few times. She kept pushing for us to meet up ASAP, but then hitting that she felt wrong about the whole thing- and kept going back and forth, eventually caving and saying she's sorry, but that's a horrible person, a serial cheater, not normal sexually, etc. I assured her that everything was okay and that all I ever expected from any of this was a friend, nothing more. While I entertained her propositions, I never would of gone through with them out of sheer respect for her boyfriend whom I've never even met. Yesterday she ended with ""I like you... I like you a LOT, but you're not worth risking my relationship"". I told her she was absolutely right to think that I wasn't worth it and that she did good by arriving at such a conclusion on her own. We went back to normal friend talk, but then today the super vivid sex talk and photos started up again. I kept refusing to engage. 

Then it happened... after visiting the shop she works at this past week, I was crossing the border back into Canada and stupidly chose not to declare the two bottles (two whiskies totalling about $650 USD) I was bringing back with me. Of course as luck would have it, that was the one day in my entire life they decide to send me for secondary inspection and they find- and subsequently confiscate/destroy- the bottles. I'm out $650. I mentioned to her what had happened and she was as devastated as I was. Well, today she informed me that the same two bottles (of which the shop had one of each left) were paid off and waiting for me there next time I visited. She said I didn't even have to see her, but that they were there for me. I started shaking and violently refusing to accept this. She's only known me five days. She kept trying to ease my mind and saying she called in a favour with one of the reps, but I know it's a lie as both bottles are long discontinued and very rare. I got into an hour-long argument with her, forcing her to take them for herself or two stop messing with me, but she wouldn't relent. Nobody has ever done anything remotely like this for me (aside from my parents) and I have no idea how to move forward or reciprocate. Any ideas? I'll be seeing her sometime over the next week. It'll take a lot of effort for us not to jump each others bones, but we've discussed it and will be on our best behaviour. Still, how can I pay her back for this? I'm 29 and she knows I'm not doing so great in life right now, financially and otherwise, and that I'd been saving up to treat myself to those two bottles ahead of my 30th birthday. I just can't believe that someone like this exists in todays world.",02Jun2019,1
