1,"Trying to look to join UT austin, I'm an american Indian, yes I have american citizenship. I am a 1st year rn in a college in India.
Our course encourages transfers for the 3rd year onwards and my plan is to try and transfer to UT

The problem for me is getting the funding to go. I can apply for FAFSA but my dad earns well above the 50,000$ eligibility. But because he's trying to pay off other loans he can't and won't be able to foot the bill. I also dont want to have to give him that pressure. 

So any advice on what loans are best to take and what I should do? I'm really confused. Any advice would be appreciated

Edit: also if you guys are wondering why I dont ask my college for help, its because my college already has a list of colleges they tie up with and encourage us to transfer to. If you want to transfer to a college thats not on their list of tie ups then you are on ur own.

10,"Hi reddit! This is a very broad question because i really don’t know how to narrow it down.

I’m a 22y female with a questionable personality. People have labeled me as “intense” if that gives you a better picture?

I’m loud, I’m opinionated, I’m bouncy, tall, chubby, hyper, emotional, sensitive, talkative, overall I’ve been described as obnoxious on MANY occasions. Not all the time of course, typically the times when I’m at my happiest and then someone reminds me my personality type isn’t welcomed so I get sad and quiet.

What I’m asking is what is it that I’m doing wrong? If people have pointed out that I’m loud and talking all the time should I stop myself from talking so often? If they mention my ability to somehow always take up more space in the room should I start taking more extreme measures to lose weight? I mean I can’t really fix my height but maybe if I wasn’t so fat? 

I am genuinely at a loss as to why I can’t seem to form any lasting friendships.
I have been officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and so I’ve struggled with this issue my whole life due to the chemical imbalances in my brain but if there’s more I could do I would love to know. I’m so tired of being so completely alone every day

11,"Sooo I’m a senior in college graduation next month with my bachelors of science in nursing. I go to school in RI and live in CT. Two summers ago my mom moved away to NC, and my dad is very financially unstable and is bouncing around house to house. Whenever I come home, whether it be to work at my hospital job like I did this weekend, or for holidays, I get very depressed. I have no where of my own to stay. I have an average amount of money for a struggling college student, I buy all my own food and pay my utilities at my house at school, and it gets a little stressful. Now I’m sitting here at my friends house who isn’t even home (still at school for the holiday), and his parents aren’t even home. 
I hate this feeling. I’m graduating next month and will be living with my brother and working as a nurse, and am about to enter a world of a lot of student loans and working. I come home and have to search for a couch to stay on. I can’t even go out tonight because I didn’t even bring clothes to wear out, and my license is expired by 2 months because I don’t wanna pay the $100 to renew it. 
I just feel like my life is a complete mess compared to my friends. They all come home to their own rooms, own homes, families, and are just excited to have fun.

however, just a few things his mother does repeatedly is: take out her anger on him by swearing and calling him not good enough to go to college/get good grades (he got a higher ACT score than my mom and she went to medical school!), she has said to him that she does not like him having friends, and she very constantly changes her mind about plans we have made for pathetic excuses like he has to clean the yard. this is mostly because she suffers from a borderline personality disorder that apparently can not be treated. 

I feel as if this can’t be excused for how abusive her behavior becomes sometimes. my mother and i have discussed that I cannot do much about the situation. but i’ve been getting more and more stressed about the next time she will let him see me as well as having developed a strong hatred for her.

I am stuck in a very difficult living situation, and don't have the what I would need to leave it. I have no credit, references, work history, etc. I had practically zero social presence for many years. I also lack many general life skills that are needed to function as an independant adult, though I am learning well enough as I go along.

There are resources available that would help me, but those which I am aware of would require me to interact with a subset of my local community that 'triggers' many of my issues, or trust someone in the context of a traditional counseling or therapeutic relationship which is even more difficult for me.

**The question**: How do you learn to trust and feel safe around people when the professionals who are meant to help in this area feel the least safe? Where do you find 'safe' people to build trust with, or what can one change in themself to make that easier?

I always though i would just get over it as I got older, but it just didn’t happen. I meet this guy and we became very good friends and I thin well this might work so after almost to years we decide to be more than friends, but take it slow. 

It didn’t work. I know I didn’t give it a very long time, but I panicked and broke it off.

Today I broke it off with the guy I thought I could like. He is very nice and sweet and I wish I loved him. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t even do it face to face. I feel horrible. But in the few weeks we got together I just couldn’t relax and was nerves about the relationship. He didn’t take it as well as I had hoped. He felt a lot more for me than I for him. 

He wasn’t even the sexual type. And didn’t push me to anything.

Anyway, I think the problem was my relationship to intimacy that made me so nerves about it all.  And the fact that I don’t really know when I like somebody. (But that wasn’t what made me nerves )

I’m not from a religious background and my family or social circle is  anti-intimacy.

27,"My recent visit with my parents:

For most of my adult life I’ve always had to help my family financially, signing on to mortgages, helping pay bills, paying a portion of the mortgage, helping out when my dads been laid off.... most of this adding up to not having an opportunity to finish my undergraduate degree as I would need to give my money to support them rather then to be able to pay for school. 

Recently I had a conversation with my mother about the fact that a lack of a degree has limited my ability to move up within the company I work for... she questioned why I didn’t complete it and I for the first time instead of being evasive and placing the blame on myself, I was honest and pointed out it was because I was helping them financially when I was younger. 

I came back to visit them this weekend and my mom and dad sat me down to talk to me as to why I was unable to complete my degree now( I work for a post secondary so classes would be free) I reminded them that I work 7 days a week (2 jobs for a year) as the job I started last year pays me less than previous jobs but has opportunities to grow that my previous jobs doesn’t. I live on my own, and I pay all my own bills and have never asked for anything from my parents or anyone else... while working 2 jobs I also managed to finish a management skills certificate. 

They questioned my rent amount (by the way I live in one of the most expensive cities in Canada).... then wanted me to break down my other bills because they don’t understand why I can’t quit my second job and go back and finish my degree (I have about a year and a half left to complete it full time). I got a bit upset at all the questions. 

Ps- I was at my parents place a month ago to sign onto a second mortgage for them as my dad just lost his job and they needed money to do some house repairs before they could sell the house.... I’m also on the first mortgage and I helped my dad find another job.

I have this friend (I'll call her Mary) and we have been friends for over two years now, we spend ample amounts of time with each other: mornings, lunch, afterschool, and at night either by texting or by talking in person. We are very close and both have become best friends to one another. However many days I find myself becoming jealousy as she begins to hang out with other friends and I begin to feel that I might not be her best friend anymore and I begin to feel sad. I try not to bring this up because I realize it's unhealthy and I lose this jealousy whenever we just hang out together. But when we're not and she's hanging out with her other friends I start to become jealous. 

The problem is I don't have any other friends I'm this close to and because of past relationships with friends and family I have a very difficult time trusting anybody. This means that I have little friends who I can spend time with, if any. And even then I still don't find myself close to them and will still tell my friend all the good and most of the bad stuff in my life. I have begun to counter my negative thoughts with realistic thoughts of our close friendship but I feel like it might not be enough and I might drive the friendship down the road. 

I also have the lingering feeling of mistrust because I found out about her breakup by accident as she dropped it and I wondered why she didn't trust me as much. She has trusted me with other problems in her life and I know she won't tell me everything and she doesn't have to, but I still have a small part of me that wishes she would. 

This almost happened in February but we fixed it yet I feel like I'll enter into old habits again and I don't want to do that, she means so much to me. I don't want to lose this friendship because of its importance but I don't want to drive it into the ground.

However, right now I’m just picking inventory and shipping orders and it seems it will be that way for a long while until they grow large enough to create more/new positions. I currently make $35000 a year. 

The work environment is very lax, no dress code, and I can say that I like (not love) my job. It brings me no anxiety or stress... other than when I think about how I don’t have flexibility to travel. We earn time off, yes, but frequent traveling isn’t as easy compared to the schedule of a bartender, server, working in a school bc of holidays, etc. I am currently in a long distance relationship and miss being able to see my boyfriend so easily and my mother is a flight attendant so I have free flights until I’m 24 and had travelled quite a lot up until I graduated from school. 

Should I stick out this startup job, hope it’s worth it, and just travel less frequently, or is this the time to be free and flexible with my time? I have no idea what I want to do with my life so it’s hard to make the right decision. I feel like so many of the people I went to school with are somehow working and traveling at the same time and I have no idea how they are making it work so any help is appreciated!",21Apr2019,1
52,So basically I’ve been talking to this girl for about 2 months and we hit it off from the beginning but my only issue is that she’s a huge party girl. At least 4 days out of the week she’s drinking and partying and going to clubs. I just don’t know what to do I like her but I don’t want to date someone who’s into partying that much.

So, I was looking for people to voice a character for my thesis project for college. I got some auditions, and I got someone who is perfect for the role. My problem is I'm on a limited budget, the last of which is going to the voice actress. I can't afford to hire this actress, and I feel it would be wrong of me to try and haggle pricing or whatever.

The actress's talent is worth more than I can afford right now.

So me and my now ex-gf have been together for a little bit under a year but over the past 3-4 months her depression had started to overtake her. She wouldn’t want to leave the house or do anything in which we could both have fun. Eventually she started to become distant and I would always have to reach out to her and start conversation. This kept happening for a while and then she started to get really upset that I wasn’t putting any effort into the relationship (when I was but one person could only do so much) she had multiple breakdowns and she started saying that I made 2 months of our relationship miserable for her. She started to get more distant and started to hold a grudge on me for those 2 months. I apologized multiple times, even though really I don’t think I did anything wrong or evil, in an effort to calm her. Well earlier this week she broke up with me saying that she “lost feelings” for me. I’m confused as to how people just “lose feelings” but I’m convinced that it was actually depression that made her feel that way because not even 3 days before that we hung out and she was kissing me and cuddled up to me. So I guess my question is: is there anything that I can really do since she’s pushing me away because of her depression? Should I just give her time or should I just leave her? (Mind you we have had our small break ups in between in which she’s come back and apologized). I’m not upset I’m just confused and feel like if I don’t do anything I would be giving up on her.

A bit of backstory: One branch of my extended family (my grandpa's family on my mom's side if that makes sense) is pretty well connected and we meet up 2-3 times a year for holidays and my great-grandmother's birthday (she'll be 106 in a few weeks I think). It's a pretty big family gathering considering there's technically 5 generations there and they can get pretty overwhelming, but I do like going for the food and catching up with some of my second cousins. There was one cousin who I was pretty attached to when we were younger, let's call her E. E and I are a few years apart in age (I'm 20 and I think she's a sophomore in highschool idr) but I remember she would also come up to me, give me a big ol' hug and call me her ""pikachu mama"" (I think that that nickname came from a game we played as kids). We also have a love for animals and bonded over that whenever she was raising a new pet. I never really got super close with her, but I still developed a bit of a big-sisterly love for her. 

I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for a large majority of my life but it got really bad in high school. I would walk into class at the beginning of the day, start have a anxiety attack and begin crying my eyes out, and end up in the nurse's office with my parents' permission to head home hardly 15 minutes into first period. Just the thought of going to any large gathering of people would make me panic. I began cutting myself and on a few occasions I tried strangling myself in a suicide attempt. I dropped almost all my classes and nearly dropped out entirely. I ended up getting a 504 plan, seeing a therapist once a week, and getting on prescription meds just to keep me afloat. With a lot of help from friends, family, high school staff, and a team of professionals, I managed to graduate high school and get to where I am today. I've still got a ways to go with managing my GAD and depression, but I've come soooooooo far in the past 4-5 years. 

The reason I bring up my story with mental illness is because, from what I've heard, E is dealing with something similar to what I went through, if not worse. There's a bit of a trend of anxiety and depression throughout my family on that side, especially in the other great-grandchildren. Two of my other second cousins both deal with crippling anxiety to the point where one of them has been diagnosed with social muteness. For E, though, she didn't get it from her parents (the ones I'm related to by blood) because she was adopted as baby from China. From what I've seen and heard from other relatives, she's been transferred to a private Christian school (she wants to transfer back tho and honestly good the one she's at now is wack) and is getting support from her parents. She's apparently been administered to the ER a couple times and maybe a psych ward (I'm not sure about it though) and didn't come out of her room during our family's Christmas party (I don't blame her tho I did the exact same thing). It sounds like she's in a really dark place right now and struggling to keep going. 

It sounds a bit like what I went through just a few years ago. 

There's a part of me that really wants to reach out to E and provide whatever support I can, but I know how it feels to hear half-hearted statements like ""I know what's it's like to be in your shoes"" and ""I dealt with depression too, and I got better"" and how it feels like they don't really understand what you're going through. I don't wanna idly sit by and watch her suffer, but I want to avoid coming off as insincere and self-serving. I've never really been in contact with E, so is this even the place for me to offer my support? What should I do?",21Apr2019,1

I don’t tell her about my boyfriend because of my racist and conservative parents and I don’t tell her where I’m going because she doesn’t “let me” even if it’s with my friends. But she contradicts herself because she always says “it’s your life do whatever you want” but then stops me from going shopping at a mall alone.

How do I confront my mom about this? She’s not exactly the easiest person to talk to and always makes herself the victim but idk how to make my boundaries with her.

I sent a second text (26 Hours later) joking that it was a stupid question by me. The text was not rude. The friend never replied. I grew concerned. And, was convinced I was being ghosted. The following morning, Saturday, I asked “Can you say something? This is not like you. Are you alright? Please do not play games ☹” To my horror, the friend replied with “I am not playing games my grandma died the day you texted. I do not have time for this right now.” I immediately apologized for my disgusting behavior. I also told her if she needed anything to contact me.

I feel guilty. Awful. I am also worried I lost my friend. She hates when I demand attention. I know I made assumptions. I know I should have left her alone. My insecurity has been a recurring issue in the friendship. When I am ignored, I push for a response. This insecurity arose last year when she ghosted me. She recognized that was awful and reciprocated. Yet, the damage was done. So, this week I assumed she was ghosting again.

Right now, she needs space. Yet, what should I say or do? In two weeks, I’m thinking of sending her an apology/how are you going with the death text. She would not appreciate a call. I am conscious that she is going through a lot. My needs are secondary. Her needs should be first. I would still like advice as I feel guilty. Did I destroy the friendship?

this is also my first reddit post so i dont exactly know if im doing anything right,  also my grammar isnt the best so i apologise in advanced. 

&amp;#x200B;

i guess i will just jump straight into it.

&amp;#x200B;

im a female in my late teens and for a while now i have had depression (talking 5 years or so) along with other things that i might get into further down.

during my school/college years it was bad but it wasnt as bad as it has ever gotten, but recently this is probably the worst stage it has been at.

&amp;#x200B;

the main thing i wanted to talk about was the fact that i feel so alone. 

and i have for a while. but i did have friends. they werent very good friends, they never cared about me at all, we hardly ever hung out and i usually got left out pretty much all the time.

i stayed with them because i didnt want to have no friends. i didnt want to be alone, but i was probably hurting myself more being with them.

but now they dont want anything to do with me. this has happened a lot during my school years too but now that we are all out of school and college it feels so much different.

i went to a completely different college than they did so i never had any friends at college either, i had aquantances but we werent friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

i do have very bad communication skills, i find it so difficault to talk to people, i cant look at them, i can hardly even get words out. 

i was a bit of a shutin too back when i left school.

which has not helped my social skills in the slightest, but because of this i find it hard to talk to people.

&amp;#x200B;

i was put on anxiety meds and then changed to anti depressants but i have not been taking them for about a month since i am not seeing a difference.  

even with taking them i would and still do get very bad breakdowns, they can last for hours and its usually during the night and very regularly too. i will also admit i have hurt myself in the passed and have done lately too.

i dont like the thought of selfharm i never have but i cannot control what i do when im like this.

i feel like i should mention that i write all this down im my diary too but i dont let anyone read that apart from myself, ive been keep a diary for just over a year now.

&amp;#x200B;

i just really dont know what to do about any of this. i have no one to talk to about this not even my family. they are supportive and understanding but they already have tons of things to deal with.

i dont want to add the the pile. 

&amp;#x200B;

i dont want to feel this miserable anymore. i want a normal teen life (of what i have left), i want to hang out have fun , go places or just hang around chatting. 

i just want to have these small moments. i just want to be happy but i feel like it will never happen. i hardly know what it feels like to be happy anymore.

i just really need help with what i should do.

Had to move to a different city to live with my parents because I couldn't afford rent anymore. Starting my 30s with a huge gap in my resume, my dream of saving money and going back to school was pretty much destroyed, and the depression was almost literally crippling - I could barely move out of bed and if it wasn't for the fact my parents would have been crusheded, I probably would have just killed myself.

&amp;#x200B;

What pulled me out of it was that my longtime crush recently got out of a long term relationship and for some reason saw something in me - we started dating and I saw something worth fighting for. Except the longer the relationship went on the less interested she seemed to be in it. She doesn't want to commit to a label, saying she wants to fall in love with me first. It's been a few months, and I told her that the ambiguity isn't the best for my emotional health. She says we'll give it another month and see. The fact that she didn't feel that I was good enough to invest in right away and that she needed to convince herself just made me double down completely on all my insecurities and here I am feeling like absolute garbage typing away at this post.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that if she decides she doesn't want to commit then I'll be in an even worse spot than where I started - and I'm terrified of going back there. I realize that the way out is to find a job, move out of my parent's place, and work on myself - but I'm just finding it so ridiculously hard to find a reason to do that. I keep thinking what's the point of investing all that effort when it's just so much easier to end it. Therapy isn't an option because I'm living hand-to-mouth.

We've been living with her family for the past 4 years, helping take care of them. Her mother is in a wheelchair and in renal failure. Her grandfather is just old and senile and slowly just going more and more crazy. We haven't had time for us at all and I have been trying to adjust and adapt.

Finally, this morning happened and she got real shitty with me over something that I didn't do and I finally told her I don't think I can do this anymore. After 4 hours of talking, she kept telling me she didn't care and that she's been trying to tell me the same thing.

86,"This might be a long one but its necessary because this story is long and confusing.

Me and my girlfriend have dated for a while, and known each other for even longer, so sometimes shed vent to me about things and I'd listen to her. She told me that she was molested by her father when she was 10 years old, and more recently, she was molested again by her father. He even asked her if she felt anything later that day. Me, caring about her, wanted to help her. I asked her if she wanted to go to the school about it, she said no. Therapy? No. Police? No. I couldn't figure out any way I could help her at all. And it hurt me. This is where the issue began.

Basically I broke a promise to her that I forgot about, where I told her that I'd never bring it up to anyone without her permission. I asked my mother for advice on what I could do to help her because I had no clue what to do and it hurt me hearing that she had to see this man every weekend. And so I told my mother what happened and asked for advice on what to do. The next morning, she gets called down to the office by our school and questioned about what happened. Essentially, my mom told the school what happened to her and now police and cps are investigating. 

She understandably still loves her father but now more things are being found out, like how they were supposed to have supervised visits but weren't, were only supposed to see him for two hours and other things around that subject. Shes been putting the blame on me and its been affecting me mentally. I love her to death but I cant constantly deal with this. Now her mother might be getting arrested through cps and shes telling me that she'll never forgive me for this even if she doesn't break up with me. This shits been going on for the past week and its driven me to almost attempting suicide. The only reason I didn't is because my brother came home to me crying. He didn't see what I was doing though.

Theres more personal shit that I'm dealing with that doesn't involve her thats starting to affect me in this way. I want to stay in a relationship with her but I don't know how wed move past this. I know I was wrong for breaking that promise but it's something I cant change. And I don't want to leave her myself because I still love her and want to be with her. I want to work through this with her. And she told me that she somehow still loves me too so my mind is everywhere right now and I'm extremely confused on how to get out of this situation, if there even is a way out. Its tearing me down and killing me inside to the point where its making me question myself. I had the purest of intentions when I was asking my mom for help but she keeps telling me that I wanted this to happen and I wanted her family to split apart when I didn't. Since her mom might be getting arrested she said shes probably going to move to either a place about 20 minutes away (not saying for privacy reasons) or Maryland and she said she'd probably go to Maryland to be the furthest away from me and anyone else that would harm her or her family. 

I just don't know what to do at all. Do I just not talk to her and wait this thing out? Should I break up with her even though I really don't want to? Should I tell my family about my thoughts? What can I do to change anything, if I can change anything. My mind is scattered and I'm lost and confused. Please help me. If you have any questions just comment and I'll answer I really need help right now.

TL:DR Girlfriend was molested by father multiple times, and now her mother is being arrested presumably for endangering her but girlfriend doesn't want to talk to me but also doesn't want to break up and neither do I. Im confused on what to do if theres anything I can do, and how to help my self as this situation had pushed me to contemplating suicide.",21Apr2019,2

88,"My wife is once again looking for a job. 30 years of marriage, and keeping her employed has been a constant struggle.

She has severely limited her options by never learning to use a computer. I'm saying the things we all take for granted like using a browser, Office programs, anything...she's managed to ignore her whole life. Just within the last couple years has she learned how to do some internet related things on her iPhone, but in front of a PC in a work situation she'd be completely lost.

So many times I've sat here trying to figure out how she can go back in time 25 years and learn how to use a PC like most of the rest of us did in the mid-90s.

I feel so hopeless on this it's killing me. I hope this reaches someone who had dealt with similar circumstances. So many of the jobs that existed when we were in our 20's have been automated or sent to China or India that I just don't know what kind of a future she has anymore.",21Apr2019,1
89,"Hi, so um this is my first post on here and I kind of just had nowhere else to turn to. Since I was about 5 years old, I developed this really weird habit of bumping my head on my pillow before going to bed. My parents believed that eventually I would grow out of it, but I never did. Later on, when I got my first Walkman I started to listen to music while bumping my head on my pillow. Once I incorporated music into the regimen things began getting worse. I started doing this not only at night but WHENEVER I could find time to do It; it has become like an addiction. When my parents tried to get me to stop by taking away my earphones or Ipod I would get very angry and cry, and they would have to give it back because I wouldn't leave them alone. Then as I began getting older and entered high school, I realized what it was doing to me. I was giving up socializing with my friends giving up studying and going out, all because I wanted to listen to music and bang my head on my pillow. I have tried so hard to make myself stop, but I find when I don't do it I get agitated, annoyed and even depressed. There are times when all I can think about is going home so I can listen to music and bang my head. I have tried so many things to try and get myself to stop, I cry by myself because I am so embarrassed and its destroying my life. When I started university in a program that I love, I thought I would stop because I know I needed to study hard to pass and get good grades. I almost failed first year because of my habit. Now I am in second year, and I have failed courses because all I want to do is listen to music and bang my head. I try to study at my desk or at the library, but I always leave early to go home to bang my head or leave my desk to go to my bed and bang my head. I just want this to stop, I want this to stop ruining my life. I want to be able to study and get good grades, to be able to have a proper social life. I am 20 years old and have been doing this for 15 years, I need help but what can I do? What can anyone do for me? I want to talk to my doctor about this but it's too embarrassing.  In the summer when I have no school and only have part time work, I band my head for up to 8 hours, and I can go even longer if I had the extra time to spare; it's so bad that my elbows are dark and bruised because of the stress I put on them. I know this is a lot and sounds so silly, but I need help, I need this to stop. I am so scared I'll be doing this for the rest of my life. I have let this horrible habit destroy my social and academic life. I want to go to my doctor, but I am afraid she'll just tell me there's nothing she can do, I'm scared of being turned away and finding out there's nothing that can help me. Has anyone experienced this and if so, how did you get yourself to stop?",21Apr2019,1
90,"&amp;#x200B;

I've posted this elsewhere but I think it got taken down, so I'm trying again here. 

I'm going to try to keep this relatively short, but basically I was friends (I thought) with a guy who was interested in more but I'd made it clear I didn't feel the same way. He was always respectful about it and he never pushed or made me feel unsafe. We were two of several housemates, and one night I was drinking, hanging out with him and one of our other hm's, Mandi. He stopped after about half a glass and she wasn't drinking at all, but he was making my drinks all night. The last one hit me like a ton of bricks and I either blacked out or passed out. I woke up on her bed, disoriented and without a stitch of clothing on, which they explained by telling me I'd been having trouble breathing, my heart had started beating like crazy, and my body temperature increased so they put me in the tub and got me out when it leveled off. I was underage, (I had just turned 19 the week before), so I'm not surprised they didn't take me to a hospital, I understood why completely. We talked for a while, them teasing me for getting so drunk, but after a certain point I got tired and just started drifting. I stayed like that for a while, but then a short time later when I tried to move I realized I couldn't. I also couldn't communicate or make a sound. I know how crazy that sounds, but there are drugs that will do that if you're given a large enough amount, although I didn't know that at the time. It scared me badly, I've researched it to death and even talked to a few medical professionals to see what could have caused the paralysis and other symptoms I had. They named a specific drug that they thought it likely was, they'd seen it used this way before, but I'd prefer not to name it here.

So I was still on the bed, and when he started talking about how he'd been trying to sleep with me for weeks, she didn't seem to have a problem with it, just kind of said ok and left the room. Neither of them asked me if I was ok with it that I remember. He seemed to already know the condition I was in and just started positioning me like a ragdoll without ever saying a word. I know I teared up, it was the only way I had to let him know I didn't want to do this, but he didn't seem to care. It may have made him think it was wearing off because the next thing he did was bite me hard enough to break the skin, I assume to check that I wasn't able to resist, and when I didn't react he went ahead. It wore off several minutes after he was done, I started saying no as soon as I could and then passed out again.   


The next day he started questioning me, subtly trying to see how much I remembered, and as soon as he knew I remembered too much about what happened he got angry and said it was fine because I had consented earlier. I do not remember saying anything like that or even having the subject come up when I was still able to respond, and I don't think I would have, but it's always bothered me. If I did, then it may really not have been wrong in his mind. I've always had this sense of guilt that if I did consent, then whatever happened after that is on me, regardless of what he dosed me with. I've talked about this in sexual assault groups and every single one has said it's rape, but I've always been afraid to pose the question outside of those forums up until now. I'm getting to a better place emotionally and I want to know how an ""average"" person would see it. It's a safe, anonymous way to see what I may be opening myself up to if I talk more about it in real life. Thanks for any answers/insights you can provide. Please don't worry about legalities, it's too late and that's not what I'm concerned with at this point.",21Apr2019,1
91,My brother has had drug problems on and off for many years. He's been bad the last couple of years and managed to screw up his relationship with his wife very badly. He also is usually unemployed. For a short amount of time they were ok and she got pregnant. He has a 5 week old newborn with her now and he's been terrible. He is verbally abusive and has a short temper. He is still using hard drugs regularly and definitely drinking a lot. He doesnt seem ok at all and he may be at the end of his rope. I dont know what he could be capable of whether its suicide or violence. He recently went through 3 months of rehab but started using drugs and alcohol as soon as he came out. He wants to keep his relationship with his wife together now that they have a baby. She wants to leave with the baby and be with family in the Carolinas as soon as possible. She doesnt want to be around him anymore and I cant blame her. He told me the other day that he wont let her leave with the baby. My dad and I dont know what to do. Is there anything we can do to help my brother get better or help his wife and baby?,21Apr2019,1
93,"hi! 

for starters im a 19 year old college student n this is my first real job. its at a retail store and i’ve been there for a year now. i know its just in retail which makes me feel embarrassed to even have such heavy feelings about this. 

earlier in the week i found out through a coworker that my job had a full time position available and would be interviewing for it on yesterday. this already had me taken aback because i wasnt aware the position was open. AND the managers had already started training another worker, lets call her samantha, a month before this. i thought this was really unfair n honestly i was hurt because i’ve expressed my interest in advancing my job yet this wasn’t bought up to me. 

i ended up asking my manager about it and got an interview in on yesterday. before it tho, i made sure to ask if samantha, who already started training, didn’t have an unfair advantage. and my manager responded saying she has no bias. tbh i see how i was naive here but i really wanted the position and felt so confident in my abilities.

so i interviewed and i feel i did a great job. i waited until today to hear the managers decision which they waited until before i clocked out to tell me.

of course they went with samantha. but that’s not exactly what im upset about. they’re reasoning for it was that she already has “managerial experience”.

now flashback to me and samantha having lunch together. she tells me if her previous job and how she TRIED to go for a manager position, but a coworker was chosen over her. 

i immediately bought up what samantha told me after hearing their reasoning to which there wasn’t really much of a response. then i said that they knew they were going to choose her before even interviewing me so why get my hopes up ya know....which they rejected but whatever. 

i was so upset. im still upset. and its only because of how much work and time and my health that ive put into my job. i work very long shifts, coming in early or staying late if they need help. i go in on my off days. i’ve been threatened by customers at work which management didnt do much about. ive been disrespected and belittled by coworkers and just endured it to not start any work place drama. i’ve learned how to work in every area of the store. last pay period i worked 11 days straight with two of those shifts being 10 hours. not to mention ive been at this job for a year while the other have just been there for 6 months.

i feel like ive gone above and beyond for that place for basically no reason. again i know it’s just a starter retail job but anything i put effort and my wellbeing into, affects me a lot. instead of getting a promotion based on work ethic and performance, they went with experience that the one promoted DOESNT EVEN HAVE.

i held my tears in until i could get in my car. my heart feels like idek what right now. i dont know if im just way too invested or if im totally justified for all the work i’ve put in. idk if i should stay at that place and just wait for another opportunity to come up or quit and find a new job. idk if im right for thinking i deserve that position over her. i just don’t know. what do you guys think",21Apr2019,1

96,"Im at tanner 5 in puberty and am decently matured, but there has been a lingering concern of mine. I’m uncircumcised; no inherent issue. However, when I try to retract my foreskin, I can’t go past the base of my glands. The foreskin just piles up around the neck and won’t go further. It feels like my frenulum might break, and I’d like to not tempt fate. Some may cry phimosis, but it’s not stuck around the top, but rather won’t go any further than the neck.

98,"For perspective:

I'm a teenage girl and I have no health issues next to some minor insomnia and depressive thoughts. I like puppies and kittens as much as the next person, I like frilly things, and I'm a genuinely sweet person. I've got a good group of semi-popular friends and we like to do stuff like go to the arcade and do basically friend-group stuff. I'm the complete opposite in real life persona of what you're going to read. Think of a basic high school girl, that is me.

Okay, so--I really like gore. I have an obsession with it. I have always had it, and when I was little, I would go outside and scoop up some frogs for anatomy practice. I like to think I was a smart kid, only because I knew how and where to hide my unconventional hobbies. My dad (though he never found out about it) probably wouldn't care about it too much, because I mean, he's got some similar interests as me and was an even weirder kid. My mom is a different story and consulted my pediatrician who said it was most likely a phase and tied into my night terrors and to having new siblings.

There was a bit of tug-of-war between my parents on getting a pet for me. Something that I couldn't quite harm, but something that would bond with me enough to stop my sleeping problems (it was the only option for me at the time since I couldn't take medication and my sleep terrors were so bad I wouldn't eat or drink). I loved the dog I got with my life, but I still harmed her and threw her because I didn't know how else to get out those urges. I would choke my siblings and play mind games with them, but that didn't mean I wasn't lonely when I was at school without them.

I wouldn't say what I harbor now is guilt, more of the wonderment if I'll get into Heaven.

I get random images in my mind that are so visceral and gory I have to think of nostalgic things (yellow submarine, flowers, etcetera) to get me out of that momentary rut. I can be in class and my teacher walks by, and one of the immediate thoughts in my mind is what would happen if I pulled out a knife and carved their spine out of them. I don't understand why these come to me, but they give me adrenaline and I secretly like the images, as edgy as that might seem.

I feel indifferent to each person in my images. The person doesn't mean anything to me, just the amount of blood and guts there are. I could see my mom strewn across the floor with her organs out, and it wouldn't feel any different than having a complete stranger in that place. My feelings towards the images are extremely mixed. I like them, they look interesting and catch my attention, but they fill me with excitement that I can't take out. I become so utterly frustrated that I've even been pushed to the edge of crying.

I just want to hurt someone so badly, to know what it's like and to replicate those daydreams. I would never harm anyone because I'm scared of being locked up, but if I had a choice on a menu, it would probably be some kids that bother me at school.

I'm not sure how to control such urges. They bother me so much and they won't leave my mind.",21Apr2019,1
99,"This is going to be a fairly long post, but I feel like it's necessary. Just to give some background I (24M) had grown up in a very conservative christian family. Being a christian was a cornerstone of my very existence, and it's what managed to keep me going for the first 20 years of my life. Part way through my third year of college I had a complete breakdown which caused me to give up on my faith and almost on life itself. I didn't know how to move on and to this day am still trying to figure it out. It had the unfortunate side effect of causing me to lose trust in the only people I was ever close to, my immediate family. Just to clarify, they are amazing and have always been amazing. They don't judge me for my decisions and have made it abundantly clear that they still love me. That being said, I struggle with talking to them anymore because they remind me that I have no meaning for my life anymore. Everything bad that's happened to me has no higher purpose, and being around my parents and siblings just causes that thought to loop over and over in my head.

Anyways I, Dan, (22m) met someone we will call Susan (23f) on an online community. We hit it off really well since we shared many similar interests, and at the time I didn't expect much from it. As the weeks went on, the conversations shifted from just the games to our real lives. It started getting personal very quickly, and it's something that I'm still not completely sure I was prepared to handle. I had no one to really confide in, and Susan was missing that kind of person as well. As the conversations grew serious we agreed on a couple of things. One, we would be honest, and two, we didn't have to talk about things we were uncomfortable with. I'm not going to get too specific about what was said, but Susan often spoke about friendships never working out and people always betraying her. It occurred to me that it was possibly a red flag, but I wasn't concerned since I never betray people and I assumed I could handle losing her if it was something she was causing. As we spoke one of the other things that became clear was that we both dealt with the same sort of existential pain on a daily basis. Having someone who felt the same way about life was comforting, and she was the one who eventually convinced me to try out therapy. Things were going well, but the problem was that I underestimated just how isolated and lonely I was. I ended up developing feelings for her, and was panicking since I was certain it would end poorly. I guess it's bound to happen if someone spends every day with the same person online for three months straight. It was nearly every day from when I woke up to the exact minute I went to sleep. Since honesty was our modus operandi, I ended up telling her how I felt. Sure enough, I was told she didn't feel the same way, and it hurt much more than I expected. I ended up in a position where being around her was hard, but she was the only person who I enjoyed being around anymore. I might have made a stupid choice, but I chose to stay around her and bury those feelings as deep as possible. I told myself I had to be strong enough that rejection wasn't going to trash the closest friendship I ever had. It's been alright since then, but I fear our relationship isn't a healthy one. Talking to Susan continues to make me happy, but she can become so depressed and it kills me to see her feeling that way. She talked about wishing she would die today and it occurred to me I have no idea what I would do if she left. Sure I have a job, but I hate it. It's made me realize that she might be what I'm living for right now. I'm completely lost. She deserves a happy life, and I want to help make her happy, but I can't. I have been spending nearly every day with her for six months now, and I don't know what I should do. Should I remain friends with her? Do I put a hard stop to speaking with her or just slow it down? Do I tell her how I have been feeling? I'm so coiled up with confused emotions I just don't know anymore.",21Apr2019,1

Buying a house is a gamble, I have to live in specific areas because of my job requirements. The houses that I actually like are well out of my budget, (300,000 + ). My boss gave me the option to live in a cheaper town.. houses there are 100,000-200,000 ish and are iffy. I got approved for 180,000. I have excellent credit (730). I am also single and in my mid 20ies, no kids. I have three pups ( two weenies and a labradoodle). I have an excellent and reliable career... 

I have searched high and low for an affordable rental.. everyone wants 1,400 which I can’t afford ( I take in 1400ish every two weeks) if I find a rental I can afford, pets aren’t allowed. 

I’ve asked my parents for advice and they are about useless. Saying stuff like “I didn’t buy a house until I was in my 50ies.” And they don’t give me any solid advice. They keep telling me to rent and get rid of my pets.. I’m not that type of pet owner, I’ve had my two small dogs since I graduated college. I’ve been fortunate to find rentals in the past that allow pets. This county is very wealthy  and rather sell then rent. 

I can either buy a house, which I worry about picking a house that is a trap. And stress even more because idk what I’d be doing.

116,"Hi guys,

I need some advice on whether I should apologize or not due to some comments I made. I was playing board games with a few friends and coworkers and it turned out for one of the games that we formed teams. It turned out that all the men are on one team and all the women were on another. Basically, battle of the sexes. We were joking around about it, the women said that they were going to win, and I made a comment about how ""men are the superior sex"" as a joke since I like trash talking during games. Just casual fun since it was men vs. women. As the game went on, the women were losing since the board game was horribly unbalanced. They were complaining about how OP our side was and I joked around that it was male privilege. I made a few other jokes too, but I can't recall them off the top of my head. Now, I didn't mean anything malicious because of these comments but it did seem I made a few people uncomfortable. I think people thought I was serious that I really thought I held sexist views when I was only kidding. I have no filter, which is something I need to work on, and what comes out of my mouth as playful banter might not seem that way to someone else. Should I apologize to the people I play with? Honestly, the last thing I wanted to do is make someone uncomfortable or offended. I also have to admit I also don't want my friends to think I'm sexist. I'm an avid supporter of feminism and it would really suck if my friends thought that I think poorly of women. What should I do?",21Apr2019,2

Background: I work in pharmaceutical research. So plenty of my coworkers are a bit odd as science people can be, but I suspect the coworker in question may be on the autism spectrum. 

When studies are in house, the activities can be very busy. We typically have a lot of staff members and a lot of participants in one largish space, but working space can still get tight. The coworker (CW) tends to get in the way and is completely oblivious of it. For example, I had to re-draw someone. I was making my way over so he started the prepare the participants arm. Great, thanks! That will save me time. There is a little under two feet of space in front of each participant at the tables, so he is directly in front of them. He is done preparing them, but is still standing there. I have arrived and am now waiting for him to finish. He saw me walk up, but is still just standing directly in front of the participant waiting for me to draw them. I need to occupy the space that he is currently standing in to do this, and he is training in phlebotomy so he knows this. I waited for him to move for what felt like 20 seconds, but time is of the essence in any clinical activity as things come down to the seconds. I simple asked him to step aside so I could draw. He did move, but not far enough. I brushed it off and assumed he just wanted to watch where I was successful in getting the blood. He isn’t being creepy or rude by any means, but really just oblivious to other people’s personal space. I am a female and sometimes I will bend over to be at a good height to draw from an arm and he will be close enough to me that it makes me very aware of where he is. I have a pretty small bubble, but I will just bluntly ask him to step back a bit. I could keep just instructing him on moving, but I want to be able to help him realize he is in the way so that long term he might be more self aware. 

I’ve seen him block in other staff members and watched them not quite feel comfortable telling him to move so they will either wait, which can cause issues in the activities, or go the long way around, which can also cause issues. I would like to kindly make him aware of his surroundings. How should I go about this conversation? Has anybody had to have a similar conversation with someone or been the receiver of this conversation?

Every time he'd bring it up, I'd kind of shoot down the idea. Not because I don't want kids but because I didn't feel ready/scared. We both have full time jobs, paying down our debt, but I felt like one reason why I wasn't ready is because we don't own a house yet. Growing up, I always felt like I \*had\* to be married and own a house before even thinking about the idea of kids. Funny thing is, no one put that in my head, it was just some ""requirement"" I set for myself. Not only that, but I worry I won't be enough for my future kids, I want to be the best mom I can be. Things like postpartum depression, miscarriages, and unable to carry a baby to term scare me. All of the women in my family usually had some sort of issue at the end of their pregnancy and I think of that often.

126,"

So me and this girl are fairly good friends. I really like her but I don’t know if she does as well. She has told me “I literally love you” and also called me a full course meal and a snack on separate occasions. She stares at me sometimes during school and we are BFFs on Snapchat. We talk on FT a lot as well. She will never talk about boys around me either. She will smile and blush and send me kissy faces too. She also has social anxiety. She laughs at everything I say. Half the time she will send a ton of selfies but the other half she will send pictures of random stuff on Snapchat, I don’t know if it has to do with her makeup being on or not. She keeps reminding me that she is single. She sent me a picture of her in her bra.

However a couple weeks ago she tried to set me up with her friend. I don’t know why she would do that, I don’t know if she is serious or if it’s a test. After I refused she questioned me about if I like anyone but I didn’t answer.  I felt like she was trying to get answers from me. The friend she tried to set me up with told me that my crush liked me. She is also shy or something and doesn’t talk to me in person but will snap me during school. She will talk about other boys that are obsessed with her but she doesn’t like, but has not complained about me. She likes tall guys but I’m 5’ 7”

So after presuming the set up thing was a test which I think it was, I tried asking her to go to the zoo with me. It was a pretty week plan. She asked me if I had a ride and I said I didn’t. Then she said maybe but we didn’t go. Fast forward two weeks and I asked her if she wanted to go bowling. She said she it depended on if she had to go to her workout or not (I am unsure if the workout was for track which means it might be mandatory) She said she would keep me updated but the next day she fell ill and had to go to the ER. She didn’t update me.

BTW she has social anxiety

I ended my relationship of almost two years abruptly. I dont know even where to begin or what should I should be asking for. Im lost. 

This man, that I loved, hurt me three times, to the point where I lost my confidence. These three times, evolved one of his female friends, which, I expressed my concern and ask to respect my wishes and not talk to them. One female, I knew I was the one that was wrong and apologized. The other two were friends of his, were clearly hitting on him. He went as thus far to try to hang out with her alone and said “i miss you”. There was no day we didn’t argue or I got annoyed of him. I felt he never put effort into anything such as anniversaries or something simple as talking. I didn’t agree with his ideologies and that lead to constant arguments. We were off and on 24/7. I think my breaking point was him moving away not once but twice away for work and having limited time together. He said it was for a better future for us but i dont know. I know I made the right choice ending the relationship as it was toxic but, it hurts that I did.

So since she said she had a cold sore in the past we were okay with kissing since we assumed she must also carry the same virus as me (since we're both virgins and we also never had genital herpes (HSV-2) so we assumed we both must have HSV-1) and she said if she develops a cold sore it will have been worth it since she's not scared of a cold sore. 

Now it's one thing we kissed with tongue and I can only imagine how bad that is having read a lot of articles now about herpes. But since we're both virgins and wanted to experiment, one thing led to another and for the first time I performed oral sex on her. I went down on her and kissed and licked her all around her vulva, including inside her labia minora (but not inside her vagina) but on top of that I also fingered her vagina at the same time (so I did go inside with my fingers)

135,"I manage an employee at a retail location who is in her 30’s and is constantly gossiping about other people that she knows, including our own coworkers and coworkers at her other job. She has a negative attitude and she fabricates stories and makes outrageous claims such as “I can read your future through egg yolk”, and “veterinary clinics burn mass piles of dogs to get rid of them”. She is heavily into astrology and brings her interpretations into the environment unwarranted. Most of that is beside the point, just a bit of background.

Mainly the issue is that if you confront her on anything that she says, she becomes very defensive and confrontational and the issue never really is able to be addressed in a productive way.

She is a stellar employee by all accounts other than her attitude and unwillingness to take constructive criticism or stay focused on work and not gossip.

This evening, we were working together and she spent a good amount of time explaining her dark past to me and that she has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and that her entire extended family also has schizophrenia, and she knows this because she can sense it in people‘s facial expressions. After quietly listening and being as non-responsive and non-confrontational as possible, out of fatigue I offhandedly remarked that “you don’t seem to be schizophrenic to me” and she got incredibly defensive and told me that “I don’t know shit about her and that I’m not a doctor and I don’t know her past” and then she told me that she had “once stabbed somebody when she was 17 and was in a psych ward for years and is now on numerous medications” etc.

While this information may or may not be true, I’d prefer her not to speak about things like this when they directly affect morale and create a toxic work environment if she’s not asking for help or coming to me with a sincere concern that I can address as her manager. I’m wondering in which way I should go about approaching the situation, because confronting her face-to-face is going to create a very defensive and awkward situation for myself and her going forward. I do not think she deserves to be disciplined or fired - she just needs to understand what is expected in a work environment, and specifically that arguments about mental illness and constant negativity are not expected.

I’m wondering if I could send her a message that would be something along the lines of this:

“I don't feel it’s appropriate to come to work and argue about personal issues and I don't like consistent negativity at our job.

If that's something you feel you need to address, then take some time off so you can address it and have a more positive time at work.

If it's not, then let's work on not being confrontational and treating each other respectfully.

In any case, I'd like to keep the conversations work-related and not personal from here on out.”

I’m also wondering if the community can give me some input on whether this is an acceptable course of action, or if there’s a better way to handle this situation moving forward.

136,"Holidays are very rough for me but I have always sucked it up and gone. I lost my dad a few years ago and ever since then holidays have felt hollow and meaningless to me. If it was up to me I wouldn't celebrate anything, but my brother seemingly still loves holidays and I feel guilty for being ""weaker"" than him. If he shows up and I don't, it would make me feel like crap because everyone would know I had no good reason to stay home. 

The drive to my grandparents' is 1.5 hours each way and I have spent every holiday there my whole life. If I even hint at my mom that I don't want to go she freaks out and says I need to be there because everyone else is going to be. I don't live with her or see her very often (she lives an hour away) but there is no reasoning with her about why I may not want to attend. 

I also don't really get along with my family. We'll talk a bit, but for the most part I kinda just fade to the background at these gatherings and keep to myself, counting down the minutes until I get to leave. I just want to be able to opt out without the massive guilt that comes with it. 

I want to stay home tomorrow and forget there's even a holiday going on. Before you say ""you should really go, it would help take your mind off your dad"" it doesn't help. My parents got divorced when I was 9, so they had to share us 50/50 on holidays. Prior to their divorce he was the only sane and down to earth person at the holiday table, the only person I could count on to help me feel less anxious around my mom's family. It sucked after the divorce, but now more than ever I feel increasingly disconnected from them as each holiday passes. I just don't want to be involved in any of it. 

Would it be a terrible thing for me to do to pull the ""dead dad"" card? I have never done it before in the 4 years I've lived without him, but I'm tired of grinning and bearing it. I'm tired of all the driving, pretending like I'm okay, and all the stupid traditions. I wanna wake up and have tomorrow be just another regular day for me. I feel like I should be putting myself and my mental health first and not care what they think of me for not showing up. I just can't shake the feeling of how guilty I'd feel, and how upset I'd make my mother and grandparents. 

I should also mention that I live with my brother, so I'd have to deal with that shame directly. We always drive separate for holidays bc he does stuff with his gf's family afterwards, and I just don't know what I'd tell him. 

I feel stuck. I know attending would be the right thing to do, but I'm totally fed up with this shit and ready to never celebrate anything again. What would you do in my shoes?

139,"Alright, beforehand, I apologize for the formatting. Here’s some context before my question. 


I study at the study area inside the bookstore on my campus a ton, and about a month ago a beautiful girl working there helped me buy a textbook. It was a quick encounter but she was extremely nice, helpful, laughed at my jokes, and smiled a ton. The next few times I went in there to study I saw her again. Practically every day I saw her I tried to talk to her at least once in some way. Our exchanges didn’t last too long (I asked where to find stuff, if she’s ready for spring break, etc) and I never got her name, but she was always her same, smiling and cute self. 

About a month ago I never saw her throughout the week every time I went in there, as well as multiple weeks after that. Then suddenly, about a week ago, I saw her again out of nowhere working at the store.  I guess she has a different shift now?

Here’s where it gets really awesome/weird. She randomly appeared on my recommended friends list on Facebook. We have no mutual friends, but I saw she is also apart of my old college’s Class of 2019 Facebook page.  I used to be heavily involved on that page talking to students before my freshman year at college, and looked up her name within the page. Apparently she’s liked tons of my post on there (mostly memes and jokes, but all sorts of stuff). 

Lastly, we were even *Facebook friends* in the months before she ended up not going to my first college. She liked tons of my statuses on my personal page as well. I friended tons of the students on my old college fb page cause I wanted to make new friends the summer before my freshman year started. I probably friended her awhile ago since I saw she liked a ton of my posts and what not. We’re not friends anymore, probably cause one of us realized we won’t see each other. 

Anyways, here’s my main question.  Do you think it would be creepy of me to shoot her a friend request again  saying “hey this is random but you appeared on my fb recommended friends list and I recognized your face from the bookstore since I study there a lot. “? 

And if she responds, bring up how we were friends in the past and I recognize her from my old schools fb page? Maybe she would remember me from a few years ago when we were actually Facebook friends? I can kinda tell she was trying to get my attention back then, cause she liked a lot of my posts regarding being alone on prom, and asking people to come see my senior one act play I wrote.

142,"So I don't know that much about the internet but I do use it practically all day and have made several accounts for several services.

I responded quickly to the sign in e-mails by changing passwords to much better ones (though I would like tips for password making if you have some) and even made a new Netflix account.

Its because of these experiences that I am asking;
       1. Can I do something to make my internet browsing more secure (mainly Samsung, newer version but would like to know how to make internet browsing for everyone in my family secureif possible, devices are game consoles, laptop+/PC and phones)?

146,"I am a 19yo male in the midst of college. Or at least, for now. 

I had a good life before college. I wasn’t popular or anything, and was mostly shy. I had some great friends that I miss to this day. My family moved away from most of my old friends.

Right now, I have some wonderful friends whom I met in college that mean the world to me. I’m lucky to have met them and for them to be so great.

However, everything is coming apart now. Something changed in college. It had begun in high school but finally took form and is attacking me daily. 

I no longer am the hard-working student I used to be. I skip classes and miss homework. I sleep in when I need to finish projects. All of a sudden, every bad habit I built up in highschool became fully fledged and now I face a huge dilemma.

I did very mediocre in my first semester of college, passing all my classes except for one. Second semester was when it came crashing down. I procrastinated choosing my major and ended up getting kicked out of all my classes. I was barely able to get back into 2 of my classes.

I failed both of them and was suspended for a year. I was able to reduce the suspension to one semester and came back this semester. I thought by being around my hard-working friends more I would be pressured into working just as hard. Turns out, there are no easy solutions for bad habits.

This semester is set up to be the end of my college career. I won’t be able to recover from this. So here’s where things get more serious:

2 things. First, my family. My family means alot to me. Especially my little sister. I want to protect her from the same struggles I went through. I used to be a rolemodel for her and now I’m the absolute opposite of what she should be like. My cousins also mean alot to me as they are effectively great friends. 

My parents, however, have been doing their best to be supportive. But in the end, we are at odds with each other. I’m constantly arguing with them. They constantly remind me of my failures and my faults. It’s so bad that I dread every weekend that I come visit. 

Not only are they verbally abusive, my dad is physically abusive towards me. He has choked me (only stopped because my mom rushed in to stop him). He has knocked me down and kicked me as a kid. I shrugged most of this off early on in my childhood but it grew into detest and indifference. 

Granted, I’ve said some bad things back to them, but only out of frustration or response to verbal abuse. The one thing I want most of all is to leave them for good, to get them out of my life once and for all.

The second issue is something I realize may be depression. I used to scoff at the thought of suicide. I never gave the idea any attention as things never got so bad. But right now, it’s a real possibility. I consider it every now and then. I sometimes think to myself what it would mean for people around me. I always end with the same conclusion that I don’t want to hurt the people I care about, but one day I might lose this convinction. 

I don’t know who to turn to. I don’t want my friends to get involved as I’ve caused them plenty of trouble already. My parents are part of the problem and talking to them pushes me even deeper (hell I’m making this post just after one of our clashes). I’ve talked with a therapist, but I can’t seem to bring myself to talk about it.

The only bright side is that I have signed an off-campus housing lease with my friends that doesn’t care if I’m a student or not. I will have a year to get my life together after this college nightmare. One whole year where I’ll probably be shunned by my family for the ultimate failure.

I don’t know what I’m asking from you guys, only that I needed to get this off my chest. 

Thank you for reading this wall of text.",21Apr2019,1
147,"So a little background: a couple of years ago, my wife's grandmother passed. It wasn't completely unexpected - she had been diagnosed with a form of dementia years before and had been going for a while.

Not even 6 months pass, and the wife's grandfather has a lady friend, who also had a spouse just recently pass. 

Not the first. She has survived at least 2 spouses, possibly 3? (I've heard it both ways, noone seems to sure.)

This woman is....at best...abusive. Pushing for marriage, complaining about the amount of time he spends with family (which has diminished GREATLY since she's been around. We haven't even seen him for Christmas the last 2 years since  they've started dating.) They both live in Florida; his daughters all live in different states. They now have a cruise planned for the weekend of one of his granddaughter's weddings, and she doesn't want him to cancel it. Who tried to stop a grandfather from going to his grandchild's wedding?

I say at best abusive, because there is honestly a (largely unspoken concern) she has tried to kill him. They were on a cruise and he started taking ill. The on board physician gave him a couple of medications to take, with a strict schedule of when to take them. She ignored the schedule and gave him both together. It nearly killed him, and 6 months later he's still recovering, though doing much better. The doctors back home also said that (and please forgive me, I am not a medical person at all and I don't remember the terminology here one bit,) he had something in his blood that didn't belong there...some form of protein or something usually found in muscles that normally only is found in the blood when someone has had a heart attack (which he had no other signs of,) or had suffered some form of damage to the muscles (like as if they had been beaten.) 

Why she'd try to kill him? He's wealthy. Not Bezos money, but enough...and the fact that she's survived 2-3 previous husbands, is pushing for marriage, and we're concerned she may be trying to hurt him.

So what kind of advice am I looking for? How to find out more about this woman. I think I've found the obituary for her last husband, but can't find anything about cause of death. How can I research that? How do I find out more about her? How can I find the previous husbands obituary? (I think I've found his name but no luck finding the obituary because I'm not sure where he died.) Are paid background check services at all worth it? If so, what's the best?

Please help, Reddit. If something happens to him and I might have been able to do something to stop it, I'll never be able to forgive myself if I could have found out... something.",21Apr2019,1

151,"This might be a long one but its necessary because this story is long and confusing.

Me and my girlfriend have dated for a while, and known each other for even longer, so sometimes shed vent to me about things and I'd listen to her. She told me that she was molested by her father when she was 10 years old, and more recently, she was molested again by her father. He even asked her if she felt anything later that day. Me, caring about her, wanted to help her. I asked her if she wanted to go to the school about it, she said no. Therapy? No. Police? No. I couldn't figure out any way I could help her at all. And it hurt me. This is where the issue began.

Basically I broke a promise to her that I forgot about, where I told her that I'd never bring it up to anyone without her permission. I asked my mother for advice on what I could do to help her because I had no clue what to do and it hurt me hearing that she had to see this man every weekend. And so I told my mother what happened and asked for advice on what to do. The next morning, she gets called down to the office by our school and questioned about what happened. Essentially, my mom told the school what happened to her and now police and cps are investigating. 

She understandably still loves her father but now more things are being found out, like how they were supposed to have supervised visits but weren't, were only supposed to see him for two hours and other things around that subject. Shes been putting the blame on me and its been affecting me mentally. I love her to death but I cant constantly deal with this. Now her mother might be getting arrested through cps and shes telling me that she'll never forgive me for this even if she doesn't break up with me. This shits been going on for the past week and its driven me to almost attempting suicide. The only reason I didn't is because my brother came home to me crying. He didn't see what I was doing though.

Theres more personal shit that I'm dealing with that doesn't involve her thats starting to affect me in this way. I want to stay in a relationship with her but I don't know how wed move past this. I know I was wrong for breaking that promise but it's something I cant change. And I don't want to leave her myself because I still love her and want to be with her. I want to work through this with her. And she told me that she somehow still loves me too so my mind is everywhere right now and I'm extremely confused on how to get out of this situation, if there even is a way out. Its tearing me down and killing me inside to the point where its making me question myself. I had the purest of intentions when I was asking my mom for help but she keeps telling me that I wanted this to happen and I wanted her family to split apart when I didn't. Since her mom might be getting arrested she said shes probably going to move to either a place about 20 minutes away (not saying for privacy reasons) or Maryland and she said she'd probably go to Maryland to be the furthest away from me and anyone else that would harm her or her family. 

I just don't know what to do at all. Do I just not talk to her and wait this thing out? Should I break up with her even though I really don't want to? Should I tell my family about my thoughts? What can I do to change anything, if I can change anything. My mind is scattered and I'm lost and confused. Please help me. If you have any questions just comment and I'll answer I really need help right now.

TL:DR Girlfriend was molested by father multiple times, and now her mother is being arrested presumably for endangering her but girlfriend doesn't want to talk to me but also doesn't want to break up and neither do I. Im confused on what to do if theres anything I can do, and how to help my self as this situation had pushed me to contemplating suicide.",21Apr2019,1

My boyfriend is in his masters program for social work/psychology right now and had to do a client evaluation essay..  

The paper was typically supposed to be on someone from his internship but since his ended a semester earlier.. he had no one to evaluate. 

I have a background of being physically abused, severe depression, anxiety, and I had an eating disorder that I’m now cured of... however still very insecure about the way I look.. 

He was rushing to get his paper done the night before (this paper was 16+ pages) and I offered to check over his paper for him for errors and whatnot and that’s when this blew up. 

“I have a confession to make.....”

Fuck. The entire thing is written on me. 

My life. My battle with cancer. My mental struggles. My weight struggles. My family struggles. My rape. 

Everything.

158,"Apologies I’m not sure where to post this but I’m hoping for some advice from people who have a little more experience in this. 

So I’m currently a history major in undergrad at a school in a big city. I really love history, I’m good at it, I love researching and am currently working on a thesis  that I’m extremely invested in. My school also has a dual B.A/M.A program (so basically you do an extra year and get an M.A. too) that I’m enrolled in and I’m set to complete my B.A in Fall 2019 and my M.A. about a year and a half later.  

I would really love to continue my thesis in graduate school and go into a ph.D program but I’m honestly just so scared. Ideally I’d like to remain in the city and state I’m currently in, which is admittedly really expensive. I’m scared that I’ll do another ~8 years of school only to not find a job in history or be stuck as an adjunct making no money. I also don’t like the prospect of having 8 more years with little or no income, living off stipends. 

I’ve always had an interest in law, however, and recently I was accepted into a great legal fellowship program at my school (and I’m doing a minor in legal studies). I haven’t worked in a firm yet as an intern, but I will have the opportunity to next summer with the fellowship, I just don’t know if that’s too late to decide whether or not I like law and if I should be applying to PhD. geared fellowships instead.  I know law school is a huge financial investment too. 

If it matters, when I graduate from undergrad I won’t have any debt and I’ll have some savings. But I know I want to go into higher education, I have my heart set on history but I’m not sure if a PhD program is worth it? I really don’t want to end up as a public school teacher. Would I have better luck getting a job as a lawyer (and would the financial investment pay off)? I just feel I’m at a crossroads here and don’t know what to do.",21Apr2019,1

160,"I’m a month away from finishing my second semester of college and I’m really not sure what to do from here. Before I explain, my options (as I see them) are to stay in my current school and major for the next 3 years, stay at my current school through the next 1-2 semesters and transfer to another school, or take a year off from school and decide at the end of that. 

Now, the background.

I made it through high school with relative ease (almost no studying) with an over-4.0 GPA and ranked near the top of my class. I didn’t put a lot of consideration into what I wanted to study in college or what I wanted to do after college, but I had just built a PC and was into gaming around junior year, so I decided to go to a tech school. I applied to only two schools: a small, locally-well-known private school with killer job placement numbers, and my state’s public equivalent. I got into both and after scholarships + financial aid I’d pay 25k/year at the private school and I got a full ride to the public school. I went with the private school and entered as a computer engineering major. 

The day before classes started in my first semester, I had a small panic attack and realized that I had barely put any consideration into what I wanted to do with my life and that the computer engineering degree at my school was extremely rigorous and focused. I went to the academic offices and changed to a business major, thinking it would give me more options. I quickly (but not quickly enough to transfer back) realized that the major I had picked, and moreover the whole business school, was something of a joke, at least in comparison to the engineering majors. I finished my first semester with a 3.9 GPA, with my only A- being in the required freshman English class. I was super bored in class most of the time as I had already learned the material in high school or it was easy enough that I didn’t have to pay much attention. Over winter break I started looking into transfer options, but couldn’t make a decision and missed transfer application deadlines for Fall 2019 entry.

I should mention that I don’t know if it’s possible for me to go back to an engineering major. Even if I was allowed to, I’d have to restart as a freshman because none of the classes I’ve taken would count as credit for even basic engineering classes (this speaks to the rigor of the business major). 

This whole time I struggled to make friends and was super miserable and anxious, to the point that I went to bed hungry multiple times a week because I didn’t want to go to the cafeteria alone. Also, the sport I that I used as an outlet in high school turned out to be way harder at the college level, and I went from being a starter to third-string sub. In general, I was super unhappy. 

Now, at the end of second semester, I’ve found a few good friends and started working out and eating meals with them and am generally happier, but thinking about the future gives me a ton of anxiety. I’m scared that if I stay, I’ll end up in a meaningless 60-hour week Wall Street job (the most common placement for my major) but if I transfer, I’ll lose the friends I’ve made and still not know what to do with my life. Recently I’ve just thought about leaving school for a year and finding work/internships to explore some jobs, but I don’t know what to do after that.

I'm a 29 year old disabled man in a relationship. My girlfriend is an awesome independent woman. I really love her but I have realised I'm extremely insecure in the relationship. I feel as if I can't play the role of a protector in her life. Even walking with her, I feel insecure when men stare at her. 

Here's the premise:

Before me she had a relationship with a guy. For 4 years. She repeatedly mentions him which makes me even more insecure. I made it clear to her that all these mentions and comparisons weigh hard on me. She reduced mentioning him however I realise that she's bound to remember him since she was with him for 4 whole years.

We had recently had an argument due to which we were very angry with each other. And weren't talking normally. 

The following incident happened after our argument. 

Last night my girlfriend was coming alone from a workshop and some guy was following her in a car. She was very scared and didn't know what to do. So in that moment, she managed to call her ex. She later wondered why she had done this?

But this has really put me down. Is it because she doesn't feel secure with me? Is it because I'm not a bike-riding, typically macho man.

Should I step out of this relationship? Even though it will be really hard for me. But I think if she requires security from a relationship, I have no right in holding her back because of my selfish love.

It's really putting me down. All of this. I'll be really thankful for any advice.",21Apr2019,1

174,"I (23F) had an ex (31M) we dated for about 2 months before he got overly obsessive with me. Broke up January of 2018.

To start from the beginning, we met at work and he was charming, a gentleman, would go out of his way to do things for me. And slowly I did start to fall for him. When we officially began dating, he became possessive. Would beat up guys at work who would talk to me, would go confront his boss if the boss came and asked me about something and would get angry at me if I needed something from his boss. He turned my friends from work away from me because he didn't like how they acted supposedly and lied about how one particular guy was stalking me home (even tho he lived an hour away in the other direction). And I was iffy about it but at the time I was still believing there is a gentleman in him like when we were initially dating.

He began to cry when I had to be away from him like if I had to go home to attend to my pup who he didn't let in his house. He started to make me feel guilty when I would leave. He told me bs stories about how I was the love of his life and I was everything he needed. He would buy me expensive things whenever I wanted and gave me his CC. Bragged about how his family are multimillionaires in the UAE and said how shit all my jewellery are because they weren't all 24K gold. And slowly he became abusive. He would get angry sometimes and hit me in the car while I was driving and then when I get angry he would cry and say that he was just pretending and go to sleep and wake up talking to me like nothing ever happened.

Then he asked me to marry him because he said in Islam, there is no dating phase in relationships and he was already sinning. I said it's a bit too soon (was only 1.5 months at this point). He then manipulated me to believe that I knew exactly what his intentions are, which was that he would provide everything and I wouldn't have to lift a finger. Anyways, so something in me said to not do it and so I didn't. And he got upset.

A couple weeks later we had argument after argument, I didn't reply to him straight away after his texts so he would give me a tonne of missed calls. Interrogate me as to why I wasn't replying to him, with him knowing I am at work. Accusing me of cheating on him when I wasn't but still made me feel bad. And then he would say stuff like ""if you weren't cheating on me then prove it, just marry me down at city hall."" It went really toxic and he started calling me names like dickhead, asshole, bitch because I wouldn't marry him at that moment. After a while it occurred to me that if I had married him, he would have a citizenship after struggling to get one for over 12 years. I ended it over the phone one day after a massive argument about how possessive he was and told him not to talk to me. He messaged me on other social media networks and I blocked him. If he tried to rock up at my house again I would have filed for a restraining order against him but he didn't. However, I was still terrified of him.

tl;dr

Anyways, just today I saw that my ex married someone after being with her for 6 months. I was stalking his Facebook on my friends account and I'm pretty sure he was just trying to get a citizenship out of her and knowing how abusive and shit he is, I almost want to warn her about him or just give her a heads up.

175,"I live in a basement suite, upstairs there are my landlords. (A Filipino couple )

I heard a really scary yell from a male (but I think it wasn’t my landlord) I don’t really know who lives there or who visits or anything really. I know they have a daughter and that’s it.
There was some verbal fighting and crashing but it was all in their language and it was muffled by the ceiling anyway. 
The yell was no words just an angry yell and who ever it was kept yelling suddenly a few times. 

I’m tempted to ask them about it just because I’m kind of paranoid for their safety. Or at least so I’m aware what it is. But I don’t want to disturb their privacy. 

I very recently had to call the police on a man who tried to stab his wife in the parking lot of my work place... 
plus I have had to deal with various other versions of hearing or witnessing abuse or violence. 
I’m just kind of paranoid.

The thing that seems strange to me is the yelling with no words - so I’m wondering? Maybe it’s something I am taking out of context.

176,"So today I came across something that is really really a major issue and idk what to do. Let’s start at the beginning.

I live with my dad and younger sister, both of us are adults. I saw that a bag of food of mine was gone so I checked my sisters room because she often brings food into her room. So I go in and look for it (she wasn’t home I will admit it’s not cool to go in uninvited into someone’s room at the time but I was irritated). While looking I noticed a book open on the floor in front of her nightstand. She has a hyperactive dog that jumps a lot so I assumed it had fallen over at some point. I picked it up and was about to put it back but I saw the page that it was on.

This is what it said:
“Today I was suppose to go over to my mom’s house for family pasty night (AKA my brother’s, grandpa’s, and cousin’s birthdays). I really didn’t want to go because of my brother. I wish I could just tell my parents what happened to me so I wouldn’t always hate myself for canceling plans with my mom. I just don’t even think my dad would even believe me and on top of that I don’t know what my dad would do if I told him. As for my mom I just will never be able to unsee the way she looks at me knowing she could’ve been there to stop it. I can’t even tell my mom I’m depressed. She had to find out from my aunt. UGH I wouldn’t mind dying.”

Being her brother this had me shaking in tears and grief. I sincerely have no idea what I may have done but from the sound of it it sounds I molested her in some way or worse and the thought makes me want to vomit. I took a picture of the page so that I could possibly show my mom or dad in the future depending on things. She wasn’t going to be home for awhile so I texted her and confronted her because I felt like it’d be easier for her and me this way rather than waiting in person. I told her about what I found and asked her what I did. She was mad and thinks I was snooping and I guess I technically was but I didn’t mean to or plan to. She then told me that she doesn’t want to talk about it and to leave it at that. I told her that this was important and that I would never do anything to hurt her and love her more than I love myself (which is true, I suffer depression myself and feel deep regret because I was very mean to her when we were kids). She told me to respect the fact that she doesn’t want to talk about it. Now I should have let it go but I didn’t and told her this isn’t something we can’t just talk about, this is important. She said please stop and so I finally relented.

I’ve been avoiding her as much as I can today for her sake and mine and I’m deeply troubled by this. I haven’t been able to stop shaking ever since I read that page. I’ve thought about possible next steps such as:
-going to mom about it and showing the picture of the page. It sounded like maybe my mom knew something about it.
-tell my sister that I will turn myself in to the police if she told me what I had done because by the sound of it I had obviously done something illegal.
-or just let it go, finish school, get a better job, and move out and never talk to my sister again. I love her so much but if I make her uncomfortable then I’d gladly have it so that she never sees me again, as much as it pains me.

Please tell me your opinions on this. What should I do? I’m so close to breaking into tears right now.",21Apr2019,4
177,"Now that I have your attention, random reddit user, let me tell you about my not-so-good Friday. I was making my way to school and Ineeded to make a left turn. I do a complete stop, turn on my left indicator, and as I'm waiting, I get hit from behind.  
The person who hit me was a new driver (just passed her road test) and was under the custody of her grandparents. 

Now here's a fun fact about my car, it's a 1997 Toyota 4runner. My dad bought it to pick me up from the hospital when I was born and has been running fantastically for as long as I can remember because it was taken cared of so well. It hasn't even past 150,000 miles yet. 

The estimated quote for repairs is around $4,000 and the auto body shop highly recommended going through insurance. As I'm not familiar with the whole process, I called my dad and he decided to handle all the negotiations. We came to an agreement (that at the time of writing this post, I'm still very upset about) that the grandpa will give us the $4,000 dollars in cash to either repair the car, or use it to buy a new one. 

Now as many of you might know, getting parts to repair an old car isn't easy nor cheap. Repairing it is another story. My father has invested a lot of money and time maintaining it and he's coming to terms that this is it for the car. I sort of agree with him...

Buying a car is such a hassle, and I've been really worked up since the accident, which is very uncharacteristic of me. I just want this to be over and done with, but I'm not sure what to do. Should I use the money towards buying a new car? or should I attempt to repair the car in hopes of getting it up and running again?",21Apr2019,1

179,"A few weeks ago I got to know this guy in my class who I usually didn’t talk to. His name is James, and he moved here recently from  a different state. I eventually noticed that something was wrong, his hands were shaking and he seemed nervous all the time. A couple days later we were at a party and he told me everything. To summarize, his dad started beating him when he was three. He punched James, choked him, threw things, etc. His mom divorced his dad pretty recently but she doesn’t protect him due to her alcoholism. James isn’t really legally supposed to stay with either of his parents at the moment because they can’t take care of him. When he has to see his dad on occasion, it’s really hard. His dad calls him a mistake and hurts him in any emotional way possible. He’s been depressed for years, and even though he sees a therapist and takes meds it doesn’t help. He tried to kill himself last summer and again, about two weeks ago. After that happened, his dad said that he doesn’t care and wouldn’t stop James from committing suicide. Now he’s on new medication that completely erases his personality and emotion, and he’s scared of its effects. His grades are mostly C’s and even though he’s really smart, he’s barely able to function. I’ve been helping him get through school assignments and talking to him about everything. It’s just not fucking fair, I really want James to be happy but it seems like there’s no solution. Any advice would be incredibly helpful, as I obviously haven’t talked to many people about the situation.

181,"I'll try and keep this as brief as possible. Me, my partner (T) and his cat (Leo) recently moved from T's parents house into a little two bedroom unit. Leo had plenty of company there. He had two other cats, T's parents, T, and I to keep him company. 

A bit after we moved here Leo started to come into our room in the middle of the night every night (he had never done this prior to the move). We recently had to kick him out because:

1) He sucks his paw loudly and kneads into my skin which wakes me up

2) He goes onto our pillows and sheds his cat hair which aggravates my allergies and possibly my eczema

So I told my partner we had to kick him out of the room when we went to bed and he agreed. Every night since this decision he's been meowing and scratching at our door and neither of us can get a reasonable night of sleep. We tried locking him in the bathroom while we slept but that only worked for one night. We had to let him out the second night because he was meowing too loudly.

She will do everything in her power to pretend she's not addicted, but everyone from our family, to her friends, to all her exes and their families, to our dog, and the neighbor's dog, and the woman across the street's great-grandhamster knows that if there's anything she is, it's a fucking drug addict. There are few people who even want to associate with her anymore, because they know that she's a lost cause drug addict. Not our family, not her own friends, not even her own children want to be around her anymore. When I say her drug addiction gets in the way of not only her life, but also mine, I'm not exaggerating. She set me back *3 goddamn years* behind everyone I graduatef with because she's so wrapped up in her drugs she couldn't be bothered to sober up for long enough to take me to the DMV so I could get my permit or valid ID until *this year.* I couldn't get a job, I couldn't so much as learn to drive, all I could do was take care of that fucking clown.

Every time she gets on her Xanax, she can't stand on her own two feet, she hallucinates, she gets violent, she does stupid shit, she literally can't even speak coherent sentences. She becomes a danger to herself and whoever she tells to hold on to her Xanax. She just broke my brother's door because she agreed that she would only take ""1 Xanax a day"" (but she technically is allowed to have 3 a day) took it earlier in the day because she's too stupid to plan for these things, and tried to force him to give her Xanax just now. She already took 3. If it weren't for the fact that my brother is so much stronger than her, I would really fear for his saftey. I've taken to hiding all the knives in the house, once because when she was on it she tried to literally cut off her own leg, and now because I feel like she'd do something idiotic and threaten him with a knife over it. And that clown is really trying to pretend she doesn't have a problem. She has been a burden on my life with these fucking drugs since I was 10 damn years old. I don't quite remember what normal for her was, but I want it back. I'm sick of this. I miss when my life was peaceful. I miss when I was allowed to be happy. I miss when she didn't fucking sacrifice our relationships for Xanax. I want to be able to salvage it, but honestly, if she doesn't fucking quit, I will leave her for dead and I won't fucking regret it.",21Apr2019,1

192,"This is a really yucky topic for me, but this sh*t sucks and I don't know who else to ask because the situation is so specific and weird.

Basically, I'm not very close with my parents. They kind of suck, honestly, and so do my biological siblings. I rarely see them anymore because I left my house when I was twenty and that was five years ago. There are a lot of mental health problems in my family that get swept under the rug and have contributed to a lot of grief in my life.

I also have six adopted siblings. Five of them are all biological siblings because the system usually prefers to keep siblings together. I'm the oldest out of all of my siblings, honestly the only one who is empathetic and has basically been the glue when sh*t has hit the fan. I don't think my parents had any business adopting more kids because my dad has a lot of anger issues and my mom is pretty much terrified of him. So they have problems.

Back when we first adopted all those kids, they had these nutcase biological sisters (who are around my age) that believed themselves to be the ""rightful guardians"" of my siblings, solely because they were blood relatives. Unfortunately, as soon as I met them, I realized both of them were a) pathological liars and b) deeply manipulative. I know they were both exposed to a lot of crap growing up with the parents they had, so I get it. But they are far from being acceptable choices to raise my younger siblings. They're severely mentally ill- much more than my parents- and I felt really concerned every time they were visiting my siblings and left alone with them. I can read people like a damn book and I just knew sh*t was awry.

My family has this really terrible habit of not telling me anything when bad, bad sh*t is happening. I tried to kill myself last fall and now that's my mother's current ""excuse"" as to why she's a bad communicator (because she doesn't want to ""trigger me"" which is a load of bs). So tonight I get a call from my mom which is super weird because she doesn't even call me. Not even on holidays or my birthday.

She sounds super weird and I'm starting to freak out already because I'm worried someone got into an accident or something. Then she drops this massive bombshell as she's sobbing into the phone, and tells me that all of my adopted siblings got taken away by CPS. My mom is obviously devastated.

Now I know I mentioned my parents suck. And they do- but the reasons behind this happening are not because the state actually understands how my parents are abusive. Honestly, most of the abuse in my house was bestowed upon me. My dad's outbursts happened to everyone, but I don't really see that warranting someone's kids literally getting taken away. The ""reasons"" why they were removed, as my mom reiterated some of them to me from the various statements CPS collected (from of course, the crazy older biological siblings) were really insane statements about my parents that I knew were completely made-up. Weird sh*t like how my dad might be on drugs or an alcoholic, or that my mom ""tackled"" my little brother and punched him? (Wtf.) Yeah, none of that happened. I know my parents. They suck but they don't do sh*t like that. All of this was being fed from my siblings' sisters to them. 

Obviously I am extremely saddened by this and honestly in shock. I talked to my mom for a couple hours but mostly just listened to her describe the experience and cry. It took a lot of willpower for me to not mention my dad's mental health because it's kind of a lost cause at this point. 

That being said, my siblings are now apparently crammed into a two-bedroom apartment with one of their sisters and her boyfriend. I don't even know how that's legal, but whatever? 

I have decided that this does not sit well with me. I cannot stand by and allow that psychopath to have custody or whatever over them. I can't take all of them to live with me, but I can take my ten year-old brother. I know they're technically not even my siblings anymore (it feels so f*cked up to even type that) but it will be a cold day in hell before I allow her to be their guardian. 

What I'm ultimately asking is- would I be able to be a legal guardian of one of my siblings? Should I just grieve and cut ties? Something about that second option feels so wrong to me and I just don't know...this whole situation feels so unfair to my siblings and their sister is so incapable of taking care of them. This is such a weird situation. But I'm 25. I make literally 40k at my current job. I am in a position financially to take care of at least one of them. But I have no idea if the system would even allow me to be a candidate. Or would it be worth dealing with their crazy older siblings? My heart is just breaking right now and I've been holding back my emotions all night because my brain is in Standby Mode. Any advice or commentary would be seriously appreciated. I just don't know what to do or who to turn to in this type of situation. Thank you.",21Apr2019,1
193,"I used to talk to this girl back in late 2018. I’ve known her for years, and I’ve liked her for most of the time I’ve known her. She’s well aware that I like her. We were never in a relationship, but we were friends and talked a lot. I felt really good talking to her about my life. She talked about hers as well, and I feel like we made each other feel good. I care about her more than any of my other friends.

Around Christmas time, we stopped talking. I was getting too clingy and wanted to talk to her and message her all the time, and I basically scared her off and made her not want to talk to me. We never talked for a while after that.

Recently, I had an encounter with her, and we had a conversation. I apologized for the way I acted, and she forgave me and said that I don’t need to worry about it.

It would be awesome if I could talk to her like that again. I mean, I’m able to, but I don’t want to scare her off again. She makes me feel more alive than anything else in my life. Talking to her makes me stop worrying about all of my struggles.

So I’m not surprised that my father bursts into my room spontaneously and demands me to do chores. I was talking with my crush on skype (he lives a few countries away) and we were on our highest streak of 11 hours straight. I was pretty obviously blushing at his subtle compliments, then my father slams open the door to see me blushing while talking to some dude (and he knows I’ve been talking to him for a long time). I say goodbye, then ask him what he needs. He looks taken aback and angry at the same time, but he just let it go and told me to wash the dishes. He started avoiding me or just giving me  a death stare whenever I see him. He’s really anti-gay, so far as to verbally abuse a gay kid on the street, though I wasn’t there, he had the audacity to brag about it to me a few weeks ago. He once gave my a black eye for sleeping in and being late for school. So god knows what he’ll bring on me for being the one type of person he hates. I’ve been staying in my room longer and avoiding eating when he’s around so he doesn’t confront me about it.

200,"Long post also on mobile, TLDR at bottom 

I just moved out of my college dorms into a student friendly apartment complex with one of my friends. Luckily the complex is an individual room lease so each one of us is responsible for our own room (around $640/month) with no legal ties to the other person. However, no one else was moving out at the same time as us or already has their own living situation and wouldn’t move with us to be our third roommate. The three bedroom option was the only one we could afford, being the two bed is almost $100 a month more. 

We got placed into an apartment with a girl (let’s call her Jewel). Walking into the apartment, it immediately smelled like weed and there were tons of alcohol bottles on top of the fridge. Dishes were littering the sink, there were pans filled with grease and oil on the stove, the fridge was filled with old fast food and unfinished meals. My friend and I moved all our stuff in, avoiding the kitchen situation until we met Jewel. 

When we met her, she was pretty chill and was trying to find places for our dishes and food in the kitchen. She did tell us that she hated her old roommate so she put random stuff in the cabinets to spite her and she didn’t move that stuff for us. Also on the first day, a guy, who I’m assuming is her boyfriend, was over. That’s completely fine and all, considering I gave my boyfriend a key to the apartment so he was able to get in when I wasn’t there. 

It has now been 5 days since we moved in and it has been 4 days since another girl, a newborn baby, and her boyfriend’s (?) child started living in Jewel’s bedroom. This baby cries at every hour, like a regular baby, but I wasn’t notified I would be living with a child. Considering the apartment doesn’t allow multiple people on the lease, I didn’t know that many people would be staying here all the time. Upon move in, Jewel also agreed to only smoke in her room since I am looking to secure a job at a hospital and will need to be drug tested soon. The past 3 nights, music has been playing in the living room extremely loudly until around 4am while the three adults smoke and drink in there, leaving the kids in the bedroom. They also sometimes smoke around the kids. 

Not only am I concerned about the kids, I also don’t know how to approach the whole respect situation. I don’t believe she is used to living with roommates (this place is weird about placing people in the right rooms). I am not a confronting person and I don’t want to come across as rude. I work 2 jobs and go to school full time so I value my sleep. How do I ask her to respect our schedules a little more and ask about the kids now living with us?

203,"So back around August of last year, I met this delightful young girl named Camila, who I mainly talked to over snapchat, and we became close friends. However, I was going through some deep shit and I often threw all my shit on her since I didn't have many other friends at that time, and I just felt a really close connection to her. She lives in Scotland (I think), but she used to live in Boston, and I was actually going to Boston later in the year, and while that is unimportant to the story, it's a detail on how we were starting to connect more. Our friendship was going well, we talked for well over a month, until I began to make a bunch of jokes in my own since of humor, which did go a little further than necessary, but she never asked for me to tone down the offensive level or anything related to that. I never saw this until she blocked me on all social media I followed her on. Snapchat, Instagram, you name it. I was hurt, and I didn't like being reminded of the fun conversations that had been crossed out of my life overnight, so I removed her on Snapchat, not thinking.

I lost all of her usernames too, until I came across the ""My Data"" feature in snapchat about two-three months ago, where I could see all my removed friends, and I re-found her snapchat, tried to add her back, but failed as I was blocked and wasn't unblocked. I found her instagram again after googling her Snapchat, and now I have contact with her if I use one of my other accounts to message her. I thought of doing this two-three months ago, but backed off because I didn't know what to do.

I have since been reminded of the better side of our short friendship, and I want to apologize for ruining it with my sense of humor. At the same time, I don't wanna seem like a fucking stalker of her (even though it's been 7 months since our last contact with each other), and I don't wanna burden her or anything. And maybe if that apology goes well, I don't know but I may wanna start up the friendship again? I don't know. That's why I need your help.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - I had a friend whom I became really close to within the span of a month, but lost her after my terrible sense of humor got out, and she blocked me on all social media, and I recently found it, and I want to apologize to her after 7 months of no contact at all, but don't wanna seem like that guy who is desperate for her because I'm simply not. Thinking of rekindling the friendship if that goes well, but I have no clue what to actually do.

206,"ive been trying to get advice everywhere, but no ones really in the same situation as me. so let me begin, im 18 and i just recently got a new job. its been okay lol. 

i first noticed him (39M) because he trained me and helped me out on my first week, not by choice but he was simply assigned to me. at first, i wasnt attracted to him but i always assumed he was around his mid 20s. a few weeks ago, i dont know why, but i suddenly started developing feelings towards him. i tried to deny it at first, thinking it was maybe being born out of boredom but its to the point now where i cant ignore it. 

the thing is, just recently i found out hes twice my age. to be specific, hes 21 years older than me. trust me, he looks so much younger. im not saying 39 is old, but he somehow manages to look like hes at least 26. after i found out his age, it took a minute before i fully registered it. 

i dont know if i should just force myself to stop liking him before i get too attached to him, or if i should just treat it like any other crush ive had.  i havent noticed a wedding ring on him, so im assuming he doesnt have a wifi, and he doesnt seem to have kids. i mean, i may be wrong but he just doesnt seem to have any but  hey thats just an assumption. ive never liked anyone of this age before so im quite embarrassed to tell anyone my close friends. 

i just need advice on whether or not to pursue this, or just general advice on age gaps. once again, i know im young, but he seems so right and i feel comfortable around him, which maybe is why i assumed he was younger.",21Apr2019,1

208,"If this isn't a specific enough sub, please redirect me, hope this is appropriate here. 

I work full time, 40+ hours per week, and I always work from 2pm to 10pm. I have two big goals right now which I'm saving up for, really hoping to achieve the first goal within the next month or two. Maybe 3. I don't know. 

I do NOT want to get a second job if I can help it because I'm not trying to deal with that rn, my current job is already pretty chaotic/kinda difficult. 

Special skills I have: illustration/acrylic and oil painting/Photoshop so maaaaybe I could do art commissions. Half decent programming abilities. Good with cars? I can fix a lot of stuff. Hardworking and willing to do annoying/tedious things or odd jobs.

That's like about it as far as skills I can make money with. I'm also not trying to be a drug dealer. I just wanna make some money, actually a lot of money. I've thought about something like Uber or Favor but it's probably not gonna work out because of the vehicle I drive. Not a good fit, especially for something like Uber, costs waaaaaay too much in gas and it will get fucked up. 

I would love any ideas you may have or easy ways you've made money on the side. I have a big family so I'm good with kids so I could babysit, but you know, not sure who's trying to hire a guy as a babysitter so I'd probably best find something else. Online stuff, I don't know, like I'd write people's essays for them or do their homework. Honestly I'd probably enjoy that.

212,"(Note: when I say “parents” I mean my dad and his fiance of four years. I’m also 14F if it matters)


So I don’t really know how to explain this, but firstly a thing about me is I cry a lot but only when I’m either alone in my room or when my parents are yelling at me. This will become relevant in a second. Also, my dad’s fiancee has two sons that are adults and are super masculine and love sports. I am  honestly a goofy, extroverted, laid-back person who loves people and hanging out with my friends and doing stupid fun shit, but I don’t act like that around my parents because I honestly don’t trust them at all. They think I’m a shy, quiet, smart kid with good grades. In reality, I had a 2.6 GPA last semester but I scanned my report card, pirated photoshop and edited it to look like I had decent grades and printed it out and put it back in the envelope. 



Anyways, I’m always walking on egg shells around them because for the past four years I have hated being at home and have not been able to be myself at home. They get angry at me for very small things, such as forgetting to do the dishes or being late to a class. They’ll be angry for a few hours or a few weeks, and then suddenly everything’s alright again.

When I was a kid I used to draw and write a lot. I was (and am) super depressed, but especially from ages 10-12 and would write and draw pretty depressing stuff, sometimes mentioning suicide. My parents went thru my room and found these drawings and writings (they were under my mattress) and when I got back from practice that day they were so fucking angry at me. They were screaming and yelling at me for literal hours and I was shaking and crying the whole time. That is a big reason I don’t trust them and stopped drawing and writing. This was several months after I got out of a mental hospital and the shit they found was 99% from before I was put in the mental hospital, but they simply didn’t believe me. This event lowkey traumatized me.

Another thing is whenever they yell at me, or just confront me or criticize me in any way, even if it’s as simple as asking me a question that I don’t know the answer to, such as the time something ends, I will cry. I literally can’t control it. Everytime this happens it escalates the situation x100. I caused a huge argument a couple days ago because of this. They were asking me about how fundraising’s gonna work out for a competition I have in a couple months, and I didn’t have all the information they needed and they were getting frustrated with me. Of course, I started crying lmfao. I donMt know why I do this but I can’t control it. My dad and his fiance got angry with me. They started yelling at me for always crying over nothing. My dad got pissed after a few seconds and grabbed his shit and went to his room. My step mom then went to his room and started arguing with him, I was sitting at the table still while they yelled at each other back and forth for several minutes. Then she started talking to me, calling me a coward and asking why I didn’t back her up and saying none of these arguments would happen if I didn’t always cry over nothing. She then went home (Her and my dad don’t live together)

One last thing: My dad is making me lie to his fiancee for him. I have to pretend to be going to therapy, but really we just stay at his house and my “therapist” just sends me a generic email about yoga twice a month. When my step mom asks about how my meeting went with my therapist, I just have to make up shit. I told my dad how much I hate lying like that and how much it stressed me out, but he says it’s “better than me actually going to therapy, which I don’t need” She also forces me to do the bullshit I told her my therapist tells me to do. She wants me to meditate, exercise, and do yoga. I try to do that shit but it takes up a lot of my time, I already have had to do 5 plays/performances this year, I have all advanced classes which means I have a fuckton of homework, and I still want to have some time to practice my actual fucking hobbies that make me happy instead of meditation or whatever. 

There’s so, so much more but I can’t fit it here.

TL;DR: How do I not cry, how do I cope with not fitting in with my family, I really don’t know why I’m posting here. I could honestly use a lot of help with every aspect of my life, but I really hate being at home and I could use some advice on dealing with my parents.",21Apr2019,2
213,"My boyfriend and I moved in to an apartment two years ago. We chose this place because he can't drive and it is within walking distance of his work, and I just started an overnight job, so I was no longer available to give him rides. 

Move in - a little surprised at how unkempt it was - webs behind cabinets and in ceiling corners, scratches/nicks/dings on wall corners, dust bunnies behind carpet doors and inside floor of pantry, even a mud smear on the front panel of the new fridge. All easily cleaned up, no major problem. 

First year goes by fine - no major problems besides the community gate (which usually breaks as soon as workers leave), we're happy so we decide to renew our lease for another year

First half of second year - same as first, no major problems.

Second half, we notice some mold spotting near the cut pipe above our tub. Thinking nothing of it, a quick spray of bleach and the spot was gone. fast forward a few months, the mold came back ten-fold. I scrubbed at it every day for a solid week, though every day it seemed to double. My boyfriend went to the office and spoke with the front desk manager about it, they said that they would alert maintenance - two weeks go by - nothing.  Mold situation worsening, now making its way down the bathroom wall grout. Still scrubbing, now running the bathroom vent 24/7 to make sure any moisture is whisked away ASAP. Another two weeks - maintenance is here! Surprise! Just here to do the mandatory replacement of toilet, sink faucet, and shower head. When asked, they were not aware of any mold situation. My boyfriend went up to the office again, furious. Their response: We'll put in a work order, don't worry. Flash forward another few weeks, there is a noticeable bulge forming above the tub and the pipe begins to drip. On top of that, our microwave decides it wants to break. We are having our apartment inspection done for a lease transfer - office lady comes over, all is going well and then she gets to the bathroom. She is ""unpleasantly surprised""and ""will put in a work order for it right away"" flash forward a week later, and we get an email notifying us that our transfer request was denied. Their reason? The state of the bathroom... A few days later- MAINTENANCE! - just kidding, only to fix the microwave. That was last week.

Also just found out our neighbors (with a newborn) across the hall has a similar problem, only they have molding baseboards. The ""solution"" the office gave them: an(as in one) tiny air purifier...",21Apr2019,1

But, I always get headaches if I smoke. I like to take the edge off, feel good for a minute, but I'm feeling less than when I went in. It could just be dehydration. But in the case its not, what would you recommend to get rid of these almost migraines? I've never once had any breakdowns of any sort with weed. My anxiety doesn't get worse, no panic attacks, nothing.

217,"So up top I'll apologise because this may end up being very long. 

I was in a relationship with a girl I thought was the one for 2.5 years. She just checked all my boxes. She was hard working, independent and we saw each other as equals, all things that are a must for me. And I'm not a bad looking guy but she was much more attractive than me. Like a hard 10. 

Things were so great until about 5 months ago. I had some things going on and so did she. I had a very close friend commit suicide and her father was arrested for something serious within 2 weeks of each other and it all put a huge stain on both of us. At the same time my job started to get less business ( I'm a Auto tech so I make commission) so we started having some money trouble as I was the main provider. 

We both just started to get distant and we're so wrapped up in what we saw as our own problems we forgot we were in it together. I started coming home from work and going straight to sleep and she started going to some of the less wise parts of her family for advise.

It all came to a head when I found out she has been texting one of my coworkers who is a known cheater and shady guy. We got in an argument about it and ended up breaking up. Later that day she went to dinner with the guy. He's married and has a kid btw. Needless to say I was not only incredibly hurt but also angry. 

I moved out of our apartment and back with my parents for a while. I told my coworker that he needed to stop seeing her or I would contact his wife. On the way home to my parents house ( our apartment was on the way) I saw his car out front. I'm not proud of this next part  but I went to the apartment and kinda beat him down. Got charges pressed then dropped and broke my hand on his face. 

Now I know how that makes me look but that's not the kind of person I am. I pride myself on going out of my way to help people and to as I call it "" follow the Jedi way"" so this was wildly out of character.

After all the smoke settled, she ended up moving back to her family in another state and I kept the apartment. It's been about 2 months now and I can't stop thinking about her. I wish I could go back to when things got back and be there for her for her dad and open up to her about my feelings with my friend. I have a problem sharing my emotions. I struggle to be vulnerable with people. My family is a bunch of tough guys and biker chicks so it wasn't something I grew up seeing. I'm nothing like my family but I still can't seem to get that part down.

I realize I'm mostly idealising the good parts of our relationship but the good parts were some of the best of my life.ive started casually dating some one new in the past 2 weeks. She's been great to me and is very understanding of where I'm at right now. I find my self Compering her to my ex sometimes. I know that's very unfair completely un warented.i mean this is a girl who will come over and clean my apartment for me ( something my ex didn't do even tho she lived here) and all she asks for in return is to pick the show we watch that night lol. She never gets upset when she knows I'm feeling down about things with my ex even when though I feel guilty about being sad when she's there. 

My friends have raised concerns of this being  a co dependent  relationship. I see where they're coming from and they're probably right. I feel the worst when I'm alone. And just to clarify I honestly don't miss her as much as the relationship in it's prime. Even if I could I wouldn't get back with her now. It just hurts to lose something like that. But back to the point I don't want things with the new girl to get unhealthy for   either of us. I like her and I want things to work. I wish we could have met when I was completely back right but life never has good timing.

I've tried to get more into my hobbies and my work ( which I absolutely love) because I thought it would remind me of who I am without anyone else. When I'm doing those things I feel great. Happy and just in the zone.my happy place is elbow deep in an engine bay and covered in grease and oil.but late at night I always get these waves of longing and sadness. Only when I'm alone. 

So I guess what I want to ask you guys is, how do you get past something like this?  I don't want things to get to the point where I have to end it with the new girl but I know priority #1 has to be getting my head straight. I thought I would marry this girl so living without her was something I never thought I'd have to do but here I am. So any advise on moving on and on this new relationship are welcome. Don't be afraid to tell me something I don't want to hear.",21Apr2019,1

It was a message from my aunt, someone I look up to a lot, I think she’s really amazing. The message was about me, but it was destroying me. 

Confused, I looked into it and it was a whole conversation about me, saying awful things about by the people I look up to most.

It wasn’t the,” oh she’s just being a b*tch” They we’re comparing me to and saying I’m going to be my father( A bipolar liar with multiple families, so it’s not really complement, my therapist has talked to her about not comparing me to him as it really really really hurts me) 

They called me extremely  weird f*cker , I mean I foster cats. Which I don’t know how to describe it, I really hate being insulted for my love of cats, which I guess is weird.

And they said every time I have a problem with my life I burry myself with animals. But I don’t. They should be grateful for my cat, she’s walking me off of more ledges than I can count, all caused by my mom and her selfishness.

A lot more other stuff too, but I was to hurt to continue reading so I just ran off. I can’t even look my mom in eye,  I just cry because all I can think of is the horrible things she’s said about me, She noticed too and she said,” You sad because you feel bad that you were so rude  to me today?”

219,"This post is basically asking for advice about how to accept changes in my social life that I know are for the best, but aren't easy and will potentially piss off the only friends I currently have. 

I (F 22) am coming to the end of a gap year between college and med school in a different city. I recently got broken up with (rough, but for the best - it was about to turn long-distance anyway and my partner had a lot of personal work/growing up to do) and my best friend from college just moved out of the apartment we shared (basically for logistical reasons since I'm moving soon anyway). 

My college friend group was pretty rowdy and I think we all bonded over a lot of bad decisions and toxic behavior. My best friend and I were pretty emotionally dependent on each other (and basically attached at the hip) and having her move out has been a double-edged sword. She moved in with another mutual friend we share, and seeing them get closer and begin to leave me out of things has been hard, but I was stressing out right before she moved anyway because of her emotional involvement in my life and how judged I was feeling (making snide comments about my break up and decisions immediately following,  giving bad advice, etc.). She also exhibits some pretty self-destructive behavior on a regular basis that has always stressed me out, but I never found the courage or honestly the point in saying anything because her tolerance for criticism is 0 and our whole friendship was kind of centered around ""not judging each other"" and ""understanding"". I also don't see her changing solely based on the fact I have an opinion (yes, even though we are ""best friends""), so it doesn't seem worth the drama and bad-mouthing I know will happen. 

It's also been rough during this gap year to go out with friends to the same old bars, watch everyone hook up with the same toxic people, gossip over the same boring bullshit, etc. I know that the next stage of my life is going to require a lot of independence and focus, and a lot is going to have to change with my old friend group (including staying away from some of the craziest ones). Yes, I'm moving to a different city, but a lot of them are from there and are either moving back or visit a lot. They are really the only close friends I have right now and the main source of my social life, which is a problem, but it's where I'm at. 

Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to feel okay with saying no to them/my best friend sometimes and successfully distance myself from this whole thing without totally cutting myself out of a group that I was pretty close with and did have good times with for five years. This would mean a lot more time alone and working on myself, which is what I need to do anyway to prep for school, but I don't want a whole bunch of drama to surface because it seems like I'm feeling ""better than them"" when I'm really just trying to be a better version of myself.

222,"I’m going to try to concisely express my situation. 

I was bulimic for a few years. 14-16 years old. And severely depressed. I moved to Singapore when I was 16 because my parents felt that a change in environment would do me good. So I went through local school and I’m doing my A levels this year. My mental state has not changed much. I am still severely depressed and think about suicide a lot. I have recently started to purge again.

My parents are pretty strict. They let me go out once every week. Saturdays from 2:00-10:30 pm. And they expect me home from school within the hour or so. They pile home tutors on me and I can barely breathe. My Father works from home and my Mother is a housewife. They don’t allow me to study in my room and require me to study in the living room dining table so they can monitor my progress. My Father often pressures me and studying in the living room is terrible.  They take my phone and laptop away every night before I sleep (they make me go to bed at 11:30). During the day, when I’m studying on the weekend they take my phone away as well. And I’m allowed to check it every now and then. 

I’m not sure if this is the reason but I am quite lonely and don’t have many friends partially because of these restrictions. 

I’m not singaporean so they tell me I can’t afford to fail my exams. Which is a valid concern since I’ve been doing badly in school. They also cannot afford to let me live in Hong Kong where I am a citizen.

B) say I’m sinning (she’s pretty Christian, I’m not so religious myself) 
C) say I’m a bad influence on my young (19) sister.

I would love to live with my SO for the summer. But I really don’t want to hurt my moms feelings. And with how busy I’ll be, I already know It’s going to be hard to make time for everyone. 

On the other hand, if I decide to stay home and live with my mom, my SO will think I’m letting my mom “control” me. He thinks she still treats me like a child, which I guess she does occasionally, but I do still live under her roof (in the summer/breaks) and she does help out financially a bit. So, I feel I should respect her rules. 

I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. Help! 

TL;DR 
I want to move in the my SO for the summer but it will hurt my Moms feelings and I’m not sure how to approach the situation!",21Apr2019,1
235,"For a bit of context, I'm a mid 20s and somewhat vanilla guy when it comes to body modification (no tattoos or previous piercings) even if I enjoy them. 

So, my girlfriend gave me this cute idea for a celebration of our anniversary: we both think piercings are nice, and neither of us want to pierce alone, so why don't we pierce our nipples on the same day? ""Good idea"", I thought, as I spent the better part of a month entertaining the idea. It seemed ok for me.
Then, yesterday came and we both went to a previously researched professional. Sterilized stuff, aftercare guide, titanium jewel, the whole nine yards, and pierced the thing. It was as painful as it gets, but really well done and all that (pain subsided after a minute) and I was feeling all in all ok, I was genuinely happy. Then, we went back home, still happy; had dinner and watched movies together, still happy; and went to sleep, which is where my existential dread™ kicked in and the thought of 6 months of intensive care + my nipple never going back to normal have made me stay awake for the past two hours contemplating the choice.
wdid? I honestly wasn't regretting the decision (which when I told her was a huge relief to the girlfriend and all that) and idk if what I'm feeling now is overthinking or a sober regret that tells me to undo that asap. So, people with permanent body modifications and bystanders in general, what's your advice?
Tldr - went through with a decision I was happy with, but got hit hard by second thoughts.",21Apr2019,1

239,"I live bear a very busy road, you could say like a high way since people drive pretty fast here. Not only that but every few moments some asshole with ear rape bass music drives by. And the worse part is if their is a red light and they stick around. Seriously bass music cars drive by me regularly every like 10 minutes at most. I have a dad who constantly yells very loudly. While on the second floor I hear him at the first floor with my headphones in my ears at 1/2 volume listening to youtube. My neighbors play bass music as well. It’s 2:30 where I live. I think they finally switched from bass music to a tv show.  My other neighbors also listens to fucking bass but at least they are either farther away or doesn’t have it on for hours at a time blasting it at night. The quietest it gets around here is hearing the cars drive by my house and that would be the only noise and the radiator with its very annoying hum that can only be heard when everything else finally quiets the fuck down.

240,"I just recently had the realization that my mom may have had the thought of controlling me. 

I’m a 16 year old guy.

For as far back as I can recall, she was the no secrets, no private like kind of parent. (I’m living with her only, dad is not in the picture) She taught me that there will be no locks or closed doors in the house. As a kid, This didn’t matter that much, but as of now, it is starting to matter. When I try to nonchalantly bring up closing doors or something similar, she’d either ignore it, or flip out. 

Speaking of flipping out, she’s someone who gets angered extremely easily, to the point where I’m scared to tell some jokes around her. She’s someone who goes from 0 to 100 real quick and over some small petty reason. For example, the other day when I went to wash the dishes, I found some pots that were not sitting in water. This hardens the grease and food bits around the pot making it harder to clean. Since I’m the one cleaning, I usually put it in water first (keep in mind that putting pots and dishes in water is something my mom taught me). So it wasn’t me who didn’t put water. I told my mom that she forgot to put it in water, to which I got a earful of me not respecting her and to just wash it as-is. I tried bringing up maybe soaking the pot for a bit then come back to wash. She proceeded to yell louder for around 5 minutes. 

She also likes taking control of my schedule and what I do and when I do them. She even admitted to doing this one day during an argument. But the thing is, what she said was extremely hypocritical. “I don’t control you much, you have a lot of freedom. All I do is control what you do and when you do it!”
,is basically what she said. This is beginning to take a toll on my social life. Whenever my friends want to go to the mall to play mtg it whatever, she’d say that it’s a waste of time and fears I’ll be snorting cocaine.(I don’t). I mean, if I don’t go, I’ll be at home watching YouTube or playing games and like that is a better use of time. And I can’t have any after school activities unless it’s strictly school related. Oh, my friend want to stay at school to chat? NO! Go home. This rule has been part of my life since I started school in kindergarten. Always go home and finish homework then do whatever. I sometimes feel like doing the opposite and thought she’d agree, being that I finished my homework at the end of the day. Nope, I got a 10 minute lecture about it.

She also likes to guilt trip me in the middle of a disagreement. The most common one is reflecting back when I was like 4 and reminiscing on how much better I was back then. Or throwing a “I RAISED YOU!” card out.

Lastly, she constantly asks what I’m doing if I go silent for a few minutes. She knows what I’m doing, I finished my homework and got nothing to do an a Saturday night. Of course I’d be gaming. Also, if I answer watching videos, I have to go SUPER specific, what am I watching, what is it about, where am I watching it etc. 

What can I do to improve my current condition, tell her how I feel or how to not make this a big deal? I can’t take move out as an option as I’m planning to go to med school and I can’t sustain myself with a job and study fit school at the same time.",21Apr2019,6
241,"Long story short I need some reassurance, I don't think it's likely I have ALS, but from time to time the thought still pops into my head. It isn't nearly as bad as it was a month ago, so I am happy with the progress forward.

I'm 24 years old, white male, and recently began twitching (bodywide). This first started roughly 2 months ago, it since has subsided, maybe a twitch or 2 a day now but way less than before. I never had weakness but about 1 month after the twitching started my hands and feet began aching. It's since gotten a lot better but not 100%. The hands and feet still ache every now and then, but frequency and intensity are way down, its barely noticeable. I am still working out hard, lifting heavy weights and not having an issue ""failing"" at simple tasks like buttoning a shirt.

242,"First off let me say that I’d make a throwaway account but I don’t know how to do that, sorry. Also , very long post, it’s all over the place so please bear with me.

Information I guess you need to know? I’m underage and female. Said family member is my cousin’s boyfriend, definitely older than me.
Okay so as I’m writing this, it’s currently late at night and it’s just now happening as I write this.


So, it’s my family and I, we’re all at a big party, having a good time in the afternoon when the music starts up and everyone starts to dance. I was shy at first because it was the first party I’ve gone to in awhile and didn’t want to go dance. After awhile, my cousin’s boyfriend asked me to dance, and I did. We did dance a lot though the duration of the party. You should know that we danced a lot of banda and norteña, which is basically has us close together. It’s not the first time we’ve danced like, but it really was just for fun, nothing else. Just dancing. (It’s also the best thing I can dance at, i suck at any other Mexican genres.) But tonight, I did notice that as we were dancing we were really close, like chest to chest close. He’s really taller then me, too. So as we danced, his thigh would rub against my crotch area, every time. I tried not to think anything of it. He did end up getting drunk, though. 

Fast forward to 11pm now, and he’s definitely drunk. The party is over, and we all decide to grab some food at a restaurant, and whatever. everything went good. After we finished, we all left in separate cars, me with my parents, and the rest in their own cars. (Don’t worry, there was a designated driver in each car, all the men have been drinking fyi) We all planned to go to my aunts house to “continue the party”, but my mom decided to drive home, saying we’ll go over there the next morning anyways. My cousin and her boyfriend did the same thing too and went to their home,

So it’s 1am now, and I’m home. I’m not necessarily tired, in my room and what not. I get a message from him, saying hey, I replied back, thinking maybe he lost something or whatever. He asks me what I’m doing, etc. 
Then, he asks me that he wanted to see what was under my pants, whatever was hitting his leg while we were dancing. I start to get worried immediately. I didn’t have anything in my pockets. I tell him this,, but he did ask again. This immediately felt wrong, so I asked him “if you’re saying what I think you’re saying what the heck” and he asks what I was thinking about. I was nervous at this point, and I know that I should’ve just stopped texting him but I wanted to try to deescalate the situation. He did end up telling me he wanted to see what was under my pants. After that, I told him it was wrong and it wasn’t a good idea. He said okay. And i didn’t reply back.

So, he was most likely drunk, I really feel terrible now, because I looked up to him as a cool, brotherly figure, we were cool like that. We’re probably going to go over to my aunts house tomorrow morning, and I’m going to see him. I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t know what I did to make him ask me for literal nudes.

My cousin and boyfriend has been together for about awhile now and he’s really a part of the family. They’ve got a kid, and my cousin is pregnant. I don’t want to tell anybody, because my family is so close, and I’m scared this will tear apart the family. I’m terrified if my cousin ever found out, or even knows what just happened. Maybe I’m overreacting. Who knows. Jesus Christ, it’s gonna be awkward and i won’t be able to look him in the eye.

!TL;DR: My cousin’s boyfriend drunkenly asked me for nudes. I’m underage and going to see him soon, and really not looking forward to that. Should I do anything or nothing ? Hopefully you guys will get to see this before morning. Thanks.",21Apr2019,1

246,"Hello! 

To give background, I'm a student worker for my university. Different buildings of campus are for different colleges. Since like half a year ago I was a lab assistant for one college, and then a month or so ago got recruited to a position in the marketing department of that college but in the same building.

I see my old boss regularly, and am still friends with previous coworkers, and am hearing stories of how he has been fucking up lately. I thought I would remain friends with my old boss since we had gone out drinking together with coworkers, had joked with one another, given each other advice, etc. But since I've moved to the new position he has been cold towards me -if I see him in the hallway and call his name to greet him he either stares at me or doesn't react at all. Whenever I do get him to talk to me he is snarky about my new job, and tbh it just sounds petty.

Before I left that job, there was actually an incident where I got in trouble with his two bosses because he said they would fix something. Wrong -I got ripped apart that day because I trusted what he had said, but apparently the two bosses of his didn't know about it at all. That was the first time my opinion of him became iffy.

After that how he acted unfolded before me -he is terrible at his job! He spends too much money on somethings, too little on others, and has the stupidest ideas to drive people to use the computer lab.

Now that I've left, I'm hearing loads of stories about how he is letting his workers take the blame for his mistakes and his incompetence at his job. He is being paid no matter when he clocks in or clocks out, and is currently not being there for the amount of time he should be because he ""doesn't feel like it"". 

Being in my position current position at work, I could report him for his behavior. Everyone who I currently work with hold respect for me as I do them. I don't know if I should report him though. With how he is acting I don't see myself getting a good letter of recommendation or one at all (and I have been nothing but friendly and polite), and I hate seeing him being like this with my old coworkers :\\",21Apr2019,2

Another thing is, we each pay half the rent and utilities at our apartment. I wouldn’t be able to afford the rent on my own and I am in a lease for quite a while still.

My stepdad has some addiction problems that he has been working to overcome and my mom has been really on edge and stressed out about it (which i understand). However for the last month or so he has been better and she’s seemed okay. 
Lately though it seems as though everything i do it isn’t enough and it isn’t what she wants. I’m struggling with it because i am a very individual person and I don’t want to disappoint her.

252,"I am a sophomore in college majoring in mechanical engineering. I currently attend the Colorado School of Mines and I’m considering transferring to Montana State University. 

About me:
I’m a pretty social person. Reasonably smart but have to work hard in classes. Into fitness, the outdoors, party a bit , enjoy smoking weed. 

Pros of Mines:
- Great group of friends and fraternity brothers (emphasis here, seriously good people and friendships built here)
- Great degree 
- 2 jobs on campus

Cons of Mines:
- Very difficult academically
- Poor social scene
- Very little time to do anything other than work, study, work out, and sleep (due to academic demand)

Pros of Montana State:
- Significantly easier academically
- Much greater social life (one of my best friends goes here, my fraternity has a chapter on campus)
- Will have time to enjoy the outdoors, pursue hobbies, etc. (due to lower academic demand)
- Aerospace Minor
- Closer to home

Cons of Montana State:
- Less prestigious degree 
- Will need to start over (friends, job, etc)


Facts/Figures:
Mines - 4,900 Undergrad (70% Male, 30% Female)

MSU - 16,700 Undergrad (55% Male, 45% Female)

I would get a worse GPA but a better degree at Mines, and vice versa for MSU. 

Financially the two are pretty similar with scholarships. 

I have been back and forth on this for the last 8 months and haven’t been able to commit to a decision :(

So I graduated from university this past December and I will be continuing my education, but due to time constraints/poor planning, I have about a year and a half off before I can continue instead of starting again this fall. So in the meantime I’m looking for employment, and really trying to find my first “big girl job” that makes the degrees I got feel a bit worth it (and is a boost to my resume). I applied to my university for a position that I actually would really like and have a decent shot at getting, but they take forever to make a decision (my sister waited three months to hear back when she got hired there). I really want to start saving up, as well as have spending money without hurting my bank account. So while I wait to hear back, would I be able to get a job in retail, and quit if I get hired on? My only concern is that at most it will probably only be a few months (I’m still looking at other places even if I don’t get hired for the job I really want) but it could be as short as a few weeks that I’d need to quit. Is that something that I can just... do? All my jobs up to this point have either been seasonal or I worked there for a couple years so it was never an issue.  I feel really bad looking for something when I know I won’t be there long, but I really want to start saving, as well as some other personal reasons.

264,"WARNING:SEXUAL CONTENT

So I have been with this person for almost three years. Before him my ex was kind of emotionally abusive, and there was a period of time that my relationship with my current boyfriend was toxic. 
So tonight he really pissed me off. He had messaged me about sex, so we were talking and he said he wanted to have sex with me and cum in my mouth. I'm not into that and I told him so. He started asking me why, I told him it's not my thing (it grosses me out) so he asked me if I did it it before, I told him I wasn't sure, but I think I did it with him once. He asked me if I did it with my ex, which I have not thought about the details with my ex for a while. He may be asking because my ex did a lot of creepy things, like masturbate next to me if I didn't feel like having sex even when I asked me to stop or literally hitting his walls if I didn't want to. I told my boyfriend that I didn't know, he told me to try to remember. At this point I'm getting pissed off, I'm thinking ""why do you want me to think about sex with my ex?"" He said he wanted to understand why I didn't like to because he thinks I'm not telling him the truth. He proceeds to say that I'm not willing to try new things and that he feels like he can't express himself sexually with me, but he acknowledges I don't have to, it's not my fault. I tell him I'm sorry but I'm not going to do anything that makes me feel uncomfortable He then brings up issues he has had with my folks and friends? He basically says ""well I have felt uncomfortable with your folks but I kept with it, but sex is different."" I reminded him that this wasn't his first time. He one time brought up these girls that liked him when talking about boundaries and then one time it was about all the shit we have been through. He claims it's not to try to guilt me, but I'm skeptical. It doesn't make sense. He is saying he is trying to ""relate to me"" but I'm not buying it.

266,"So I've been attending Penn State for a year now and early-ish on I decided I wanted to see if I could transfer. My reasons? It's very hard to get out of state college/PA if you don't have a car, and as someone from an area where I had a lot of freedom to ""go,"" this sort of bothers me, not in a home-sick sort of way, more that I hate being confined sort of way, I used to be able to drive wherever but now I feel stuck. The other thing too is that I'm majoring in the liberal arts and I've found that Penn State's liberal arts is lacking in terms of everything from teaching staff to opportunities, career placement etc. Not only that, but I've found that in general, I feel like the faculty seem to care more about their research than their students. I know I should've expected this, with PSU being a research university and all but I didn't expect me- the consumer of Penn State's product, an education- to feel so... consistently sidelined. The other problem I've had is that I don't feel particularly challenged, all the professors just seem like they're doing their job, none of them seem excited to challenge their students, save one professor I've had. I feel like at another school, a smaller one or one with a more liberal arts slant, I'd get more out of my education.

I know there will be some comment that ""I have to be proactive"" about that kind of stuff, and I feel like I am.

He grew up in a poor neighborhood and has been selling drugs since he was a kid. However, he had to do that and drop out of school to support his mom and his brothers. I do find him attractive and sincere, but I feel a little uneasy. I want to move forward with this guy, but it feels as if I moved below my standards. I’m a nonjudgmental person and the type of man I want to date doesn’t necessarily have to be in college. I at least want him to be educated as far as getting a diploma from high school and make an honest living to support himself, but in his case he doesn’t have both. I want to be able to bring him around my family and meet his as well. The thing about his lifestyle is that he’d rather not be seen out too much because of what he does, and legally, things can go really wrong if I happen to be around with him. He told me upfront that he’s been selling drugs since he was young, so he’s used to dealing and the risks that come with it, but I am often concerned about his safety and whereabouts. Aside from this, he seems like a decent person and wanted to know if it’s worth giving a shot? By the way, I do not smoke at all and he respects that. I also have no interest in the money he makes as I’d rather use my own.",21Apr2019,1

270,"OK. This is long, so strap in.

My boyfriend and I (girl) are both 19. We're sophomores in college and have been dating for about 9 months. It's the first relationship either of us have ever been in. We were friends before we we got together. He has always been super nice to me, admires me a ton to the point of idolizing me sometimes, and cares about/loves me more than anyone ever has in my life. He is super sweet and docile (which I admire in guys). But lately (for the past month or so) everything he says annoys me and I realized I am no longer attracted to him, physically or otherwise. Ever since this has started, I fantasize a lot about breaking up with him and dating other people.

  
At first I thought it was because I've been experiencing a bout of depression for about a month, which generally makes me feel either very sad or emotionless, and I don't really have time or energy to put into the relationship, especially since the depression has corresponded with a huger than normal workload in my classes. Also, he's never dealt with mental illness personally and is not as great at comforting me through this as he has been in the past. We had a talk and I told him I didn't know if our relationship would go back to the way it was in our honeymoon phase if/when I stopped being depressed. But I am becoming more and more sure that the answer is no.

  
I feel terrible about it because he really loves me and really doesn't want to lose me. I love him, but just in a general sense. He is my best friend, I tell him everything. If I could return to the time when I thought he was perfect, the best thing that had or would ever happen to me, and my future husband, I would. That was the happiest time of my entire life. But I don't think I can. I want him to be happy and I hate to hurt him like this by not being emotionally present for him. I still want him in my life as a friend (although I know that may be selfish) and I owe him my life for supporting me so much in the past year. In fact, I wouldn't even be able to consider ending the relationship if not for the confidence he gave me. He's helped me with my mental health struggles immensely. He's told me I've made his life a lot better too.   
But we just aren't similar enough (he literally has never listened to music for fun, I live and breathe it...He's uncomfortable with religion, I was born and raised protestant...etc...) and I don't find him attractive anymore. Even in our honeymoon phase, I felt like I had to squint to ignore his flaws. To be completely frank, he is not very attractive or cool compared to pretty much anyone else I know. He's a huge math/CS nerd (not that that's a bad thing, I'm a nerd too, it just embarrasses me sometimes) and wears the same 5 pieces of clothing. He is honestly rather boring to me now that the excitement of having my first S.O. has worn off. I've heard that if you are embarrassed to be in public with your S.O. or introduce them to new people, you should break up. And I sort of am. I know this makes me sound conceited, but I think I'm out of his league. And like I said, I constantly daydream about dating other people I know and how much better they would be compared to him. Now that I'm no longer infatuated with him, I feel like he's holding me back. I want to get out there and date people who might be more compatible with or exciting to me (especially since I am bi curious). I'm young and this is my first relationship after all.

  
But at the same time, I worry I'm ruining the best thing that's ever happened to me and no one will ever care for me like he does. I also worry that I'll become lonely/socially isolated without him to rely on and spiral. I also just don't want to hurt him like this. But I'm just no longer happy in the relationship. As a result I've been rather cold to him involuntarily, so he has been very stressed and worried for some time as well. Neither of us are happy in the current state of our relationship.

  
Also, we are part of the same friend group (which I would like to keep exactly as it is) and living in the same suite next year, and both living on campus for the summer, during which we planned to hang out constantly. I really want to stay good friends and keep hanging out through all those circumstances, but I worry he won't want to, which would be totally understandable.

  
Am I being irrational/impulsive/shallow/selfish? Should I try harder to make things work?  
Also if I do break up with him should I wait until after his birthday and finals week?  (so about a month from now) or should I rip the band-aid off ASAP?

271,"**This is my first time going through this sub so my apologies if I miss something or mess something up. This is something that has been bothering me for some time and I feel like I won't be able to rest easy until I hear some other thoughts about this.**

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend and I have known each other since we were in diapers as we are actually related and around the same age. Between the two of us, we have very different personalities and it's sometimes has been good and sometimes has been bad. I am what you would call your atypical goody-two-shoes, one heck of a pushover type of girl while she is the more passionate, independent and stubborn type of girl. For many years, we've actually been okay with how different we are  and we've admired the traits that the other had that we don't. I've always admired her courage and her ability to say what she thinks no matter what while she says that she's admired my cool headed attitude and ability to do well in academics without trying too hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

For these last 3 years or so, though, things have become a bit more strained between the two of us and I am starting to think its our differences finally catching up with us. We've both graduated high school and gone on our own paths with me at University and her living on her own and working hard. Because of our busy schedules, we both have little time to talk and so the times that we do talk is filled with catching up and asking for advice about problems we have been having. Whilst those conversations should be filled with the happiness and joy of catching up with an old friend, I have been beginning to dread them when they come and try to keep them as short as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

* During our time apart, she has changed quite a bit. Along with her independence, she has honestly begun to stop caring about the thoughts of others to the point where she has hurt both me and her parents because of it. The times we have lent her something to use or hold onto, 80% of the time she has managed it to lose it. Honestly, I wouldn't mind her losing stuff every once in a while if it weren't for the fact that she has not tried changing the fact that it's because of her disorganization in her house that she's lost so many things. It's a problem she has had for years and I have tried to teach her how to keep things tidy, but it hasn't helped at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

* When you lose something, especially when it is not yours. You would normally act sad or regret having lost those things,  but she honestly hasn't been showing that regret. I always hear, ""It will turn up eventually"" or ""Well, what did you expect was going to happen?"" and that shows me that she doesn't even care that she's lost something so important to someone else. The times I have been with her when her parents have asked about the lost stuff, she only goes to clean up not because she is sad about losing said object, but because she ""doesn't want to here them yell at her about it"". During our little talks about recent news, she's always managed to play the victim and says that it's always someone else's fault, it's never her's. Honestly, I am starting to become suspicious about some of the stories she has been telling me, especially because I have seen in person that she can lie really easily and it doesn't bother her. I hate this suspicion and I know a good best friend wouldn't try to question such things, but the more and more time that goes on, the more I am starting to think that maybe she has been telling me altered tales.

&amp;#x200B;

* As of more recently, things have gotten much worse with these issues (and it's half of the reason I decided to make a post). She told my over-protective sister about some of the not-so-legal adventures that I have been with her on, but not necessarily participated in, even though I explicitly told her not to do so. This ended up with me fighting with my sister and parents on my birthday which really soured my mood for that day. Since I still live with my parents,  I have told her some rules about stuff she shouldn't bring or that she should avoid doing at my house because I might get in trouble for it, but she has broken these rules more than a few times and acted as if it is no big deal. Sometimes, she pokes fun at my insecurities and mistakes and acts like it's all a joke when I get upset with her about it.

&amp;#x200B;

* The other catalyst that has brought me to this decision, though, has been specifically about some of her not-so-legal activities. Usually, it's been small stuff like smoking weed when she feels stress and since I understand that there is some science of the positive effects of it, it has not bothered me too much as she has never forced me to participate with her on such things. However, she has recently gotten into some more hard-core stuff like hallucinogenics which I know could be bad for her since she already suffers from depression and anxiety. I told her that I don't agree with what she has been doing, but she has been shrugging me off with the usual ""Does this surprise you? It's no big deal"" again and again and doesn't seem to get why it's such a big deal to me.  It's all been taking a toll on me, since I care about her a lot and want her to do well, but I am starting to get so tired of her antics and the constant negativity she brings to my life. I can slowly feel myself not caring more and more and I don't want to go down that path, especially since we are both still so young and have a lot of potential.  I have thought about cutting her out of my life for a while now, but I also know that I am the closest friend she has and that she has difficulties trusting new people. She has already burned so many bridges with the family and I worry that she might go over the edge if she loses the one that she thinks she can rely upon the most. I also want to mention that she is not always bad either. Sometimes, we have our old chats where we can talk for hours on end and she does care about me sometimes, like when I was worried about finances for schooling and she offered to sell some of her stuff to help me out, so I don't want you all to think she is all bad.

I was supposed to graduate this year in summer but i dropped out of my college and came back to my home country last year.(Btw I'm asian and dropping out college is huge deal in here.) I was really dissapointed in myself, so do my parents. And I think I had a depression for almost 2 years. It's haunting me like a trauma, I dream about my college, classmates all the time and wake up feeling so guilty. Anyway, the real problem is I never said to my friends that came back. Because I felt so pathetic and weak. I didn't want them to know that I'm that stupid.

So I couldn't accept the idea that people will talk about how big loser I am. And  since I came back, I deleted my all social media accounts so that no one can communicate me.

276,"I am planning to work as a chemical engineer and build a startup on the side. I want to wait until the startup has either succeeded or failed until I start to seriously pursue dating. Building a startup while working will leave me so tired that I won't be a good boyfriend and I don't want a relationship to distract me from the startup. I am planning for my career to have stabilized by 35 (or sooner), i.e. either the startup will be able to support me financially or I will be back in a corporate job. 

But then I will be 35 and inexperienced in relationships, which scares me. Should I get ""practice relationships"" in the meantime? But here is my problem with that: I really don't want to father children before my career has stabilized. I don't see how I can completely eliminate the chance of fatherhood in a sexual relationship. Condoms are only 98% effective and even worse in practice. I don't see how I can have a relationship with a women without having PIV sex. First, that is a huge part of what makes relationships appealing in the first place. Second, it is an innate biological drive and if my partner wanted to have sex, I don't know if I could resist her 365 days a year. We all have moments of weak self-control. 
I would also feel paranoid about keeping my sperm to myself. I am not saying that it is likely to get spermjacked, I know it isn't, but the fact is that a woman can do that and sue me for child support. And I do not want to pay child support while building a startup.

284,"Hi and this is a common story, I know. But my best friend (and ex girlfriend) has been ghosting me for 3 months (and we havent said anything at all for 1,5 months). We are internet friends and have been so for 4 years. She lives in Norway and I live in the Netherlands. We dated for 10 months and during that time spawn I’ve visited her twice. We broke up because of the distance and because it didn’t seem to work out when we were together. But we promised to stay friends. That was last summer. Since then she’s come to visit me, I’ve come to visit her during the winter (which was the best visit so far. We were also the most communicative there). But I started noticing she got more and more occupied with instagram. She’s in this editing community for a horse game (yes. I know). It’s a game for literal 8 year olds but she’s super obsessed. Right after I got back from visiting her in winter, I heard one of my beloved horses died (literally on the airport) and I was out of it for a while. I noticed she stopped speaking to me a week or two later, but she would be on instagram all. The. Time. Posting every single day, talking to people. At one point I asked her and she even said “I just vent to instagram now” and things like “I can’g focus on two apps at once” (we speak via messenger). We had a fight but made up shortly after. Then about another week or two later she stopped talking to me completely. I’d ask her what she was up to and how she was doing. She would say either nothing or say “bad. I’m studying”. I confronted her about instagram. Then she sent me a very long message about how she’s got exams that she can’t fail and doesnt want to be distracted by me. From then on she’s been full on ghosting me. I haven’t said much to her. She wouldn’t reply back so I don’t bother. She’s gained over 10k followers and still posts edits every single day.

I don’t know what to do. She’s done this before but I’ve always blamed myself for being too possessive or too obsessed. But she seems to always take the victim role. Even when I asked her casually why she was on instagram but said she couldnt speak to me, she would say things like “Because I feel like shit and I want to die”. I know it sounds ridiculous and I might be making it sound like she acts like an 8 year old herself, but it’s never been like this. Not this far. I know I shouldn’t message her or anything. But it seems so unfair. She posts edits every single day and lives in this RP-world with her own imaginary life. How?

I also since a week or two found out I still have her one password to all of her accounts. Her real instagram, as well as her editing one, her password to the horse game, facebook, e-mail. Of course I haven’t done anything, I wouldn’t. I logged in to check, then logged out. But it seems so unfair I can log on to her account and delete everything she’s made up to tease me, but I can’t.

I know this post is super fucking long. But I don’t know how to deal with the situation. I keep stalking her instagram. Luckily she cant see because I use an account she doesnt know. But for me, this is torture. Its 4+ years of friendship and 10 months of dating. And idk how to handle it.",21Apr2019,1

However, we have a limited experience of life outside our country and if you have tips what place would fit us better, please do share! Just look around - maybe you are already living in our dream town/campus?
Our preferences are: 
nice warm climate without drastic temperature changes (if it never gets lower than -15 Celsius and only sometimes tops above 25 C, it's perfect);
polite drivers (got enough of dodging cars on pedestrian crossing);
ability to use bike as a main transportation (without risking life too much);
places to jog (other sports infrastructure - climbing gym would be awesome);
sane legislation (which means I would not get to jail for a repost or like or jogging without chaperone (or jogging at all?!));
last but not the least - relatively affordable and available alcohol and cigarettes (well, we ARE Russians and like to party);

289,"So art has been one of my favorite things to do for as long as I can remember. Pretty much every day I will do some kind of drawing, weather it’s just a simple pencil sketch on the back of a textbook or a fullbody watercolour on A3 paper. Around 2 and a half years ago, I started taking art seriously and created an art account on Instagram. I’d average around 20-40 likes per post and had around 500 followers (though most of them were not interested in my work). In December of last year I decided to take down this account and start afresh with a new name, new art style and new account. It is now April and the account has gained 84 followers and averages the same amount of likes as the old account, though more of the people who like them follow me. I have also ‘advertised’ this account on another account I share, which has helped a little (mostly story reposts and only with related topics to the shared account). I’m overall quite happy with the work I produce, and am starting to work on an upload schedule. But one thing that has annoyed me the whole time I’ve run both accounts is close to no one cares. I have seen multiple accounts of artists who are the same age, same skill level and same demographic who can get hundreds of likes per post and rack up thousands of followers. I understand people may like these accounts styles over mine, and of course I’m happy for those who find success with what they enjoy, but it is hard not to get jealous of the people who are doing better statistically, especially when some pieces I spend hours on just flop completely. Of course I am trying to improve all the time and looking back at my stuff from only 6 months ago there is an obvious improvement, but as I said, no one cares.

Another option would be to invest 4 years for a degree which I might not have interest in but to only do it because I want to feel safe and assured that I wouldn't struggle to get a job. I have been unemployed for quite sometime and I honestly do not like to use the fact that I had a mental breakdown or something. I'm picking myself up and exercising everyday to function at some form or level that I never used to be ( depressed). I have about a $1000.00 in savings and would really like to change my life, I'm tired of waiting and not doing anything positive with my life and it's really taking a toll on me. I know what I want but I just don't know where to begin or what doors will open for me to begin. Am I asking the wrong questions?

298,"I think I’m pregnant. I’m young and my boyfriend and I have had scares in the last. But this time around we were safer than normal and I didn’t think we’d have a problem. In the past we’ve been stupid and had unprotected sex and he’s finished inside me and nothing ever happened. But we used condoms a majority of the time and if we didn’t it wasn’t around my ovulation time frame. I use a period tracker app, and it’s very accurate and predicts my period for every month and I log when I have sex on it. And my period is 3 days late. Last month it was a day or two later than normal. I’ve been really stressed out so I’m hoping that’s what the lateness is. I also thought I was showing signs of pms so I’m not sure what’s going on. My breasts are sore, and I’m showing all the signs of getting it and it would be way too early for pregnancy symptoms to come up. About a week or two after I got my period last month, I started having dark blood and figured it was just my body cleaning itself out, as it went on for a few days and didn’t seem like spotting.

 For all my life, I have lived at home and didn't cultivate any hobbies or went out to just enjoy. Yes, people like me exist. When I was a kid, most of my day was spent in school and after coming back, I just switched on the TV or did my homework. 

My parents worked till late and weren't able to spend time with me. I didn't really require any human company because I just needed my favorite TV shows to get me through life. Same happened in college. I went to a university that was very near my home so I didn't experience the dorm life and treated college like school basically. I didn't make any friends. I was friendly to people but didn't make any friends.

 And now, I just got a job that's about 800 miles away from home and with people that I have never seen before and this feels really overwhelming. I feel incredibly lonely and I don't know how to cope and I don't know how to make friends because I didn't make any when I was a kid either.

I wouldn’t be posting at all if I didn’t feel so desperate for help
I really hurt someone close to me a couple days ago. They just started new antidepressants and it has been affecting them negatively. They have been struggling with their depression for years, and they’ve made so much progress, but they’ve been having a really hard time these past few days. 
I offered my advice, as someone who has been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember, but they didn’t take it well. They always said that I gave my advice in a way that was too harsh, but I tried really hard this time to be kind when I said it. Even though I tried really hard to say everything in a nice way, they still took it really hard, and they haven’t spoken to me in two days.
They really are my closest friend and I feel so lost. I did something like this to another incredibly close friend last year, and her and I never made up, and I am terrified that this will happen again with my friend now.
Is there something wrong with me? I care so so much, but whenever I try to help I just make things worse. But I can’t stand to see my friends go through things like this, so I always want to help.

308,"I found out a few weeks ago that out my best friend has been cheating on his girlfriend of a year, with his ex who he has two children with. He’d had a few drinks and brought it up in front of a few of us at a party. He said it wasn’t just a hook up, it’s been going on for about 6 months. He lives with his current girlfriend but they’re planning on actually buying a house soon. He says he still loves her and has no plan on telling her. I haven’t actually met his girlfriend- they live a few states away but he comes over here to catch up with football buddies and see his dad. His ex lives much closer to him hence why they have been doing this.

Should someone anonymously tell the girl?! He said it in front of a few people at this party, so he wouldn’t pin it on me instantly. Or is it none of my business? She seems so in love with him and buying a house is such a big step.

What should I do?! I want to do this anonymously if anything, as much as he’s doing a bad thing, he was there for me since we we’re in elementary school and I don’t want it coming back to me. He knows I’m against cheating and nobody at the party encouraged it. As far as we can see he’s only doing it with the ex.

Around a year and a half ago i met this amazing girl. Pretty face, beautiful voice, small but sexy body, and such a cute potato. For secrecy let's call her Meg. It was my first relationship so I was always awkward around her but nonetheless I cared for her and she cared for me, I can truly say that I loved her. Everything was fine and everyday with her felt amazing. I can still remember her big and extremely fulfilling hugs that she gives me whenever im down or when she's just bored. Fast forward to around 5 months later. Everything was fine, even better than before actually but one day she said to me we had to break up. I didn't understand it at first why she would say something like that, I was shocked. I asked her why and she said that her parents really dont agree with her being in a relationship. I don't really know why and I even regret that decision even today but.. I said okay. My reason was that I need to respect their decision. I didnt even fight for her. I was fucking mad at myself and sad at the same time for the decision I could not take back. Losing her was one of the saddest day of my entire life even though I know deep inside that it was my fault. A month passed and I met this girl. Gorgeous face, more beautiful than Meg to be quite honest, nice voice, and fun and cheerful personality. Let's call her Sophie. I don't really know why but I got attached to her. Maybe it was because i was feeling lonely due to losing Meg but I clinged to her and liked her. I finally gained courage to confess to her but she didn't respond. She didn't turn me down and she also didn't say yes. 2 months passed and everything seemed fine with her. We became even closer as if we we're best friends and we're hanging around all the time. Around 2 weeks ago she said that she liked me too. I was happy, ecstatic even, I wasn't able to contain my happiness and hugged her on the spot. A week passed and maybe it's my loneliness fading but I came to like Meg again. I just keep on remembering her for some reason. All the times I've spent with her, her laugh, smile, hugs, everything. I feel like I love her once again. I really want to go back to her and I have the courage to ask her myself. I feel so shitty because of everything I did and said to Sophie seems like a lie but it wasn't. I still love her but I just love Meg more. I don't want to break her heart and leave her since im the only person she trusts aside from her family but at the same time I feel lonely in our relationship. What do i do?",21Apr2019,3
314,"Got accepted into my Top Physician assistant program- not really happy about it. Questioning career choice now 

Background- I am 24 years old with a bachelors in Biology. Graduated in 2017, and recently got an acceptance to my top PA school which begins this July.

When I received my acceptance I wasn’t happy or sad about it, just coming to the realization that I will be in school for 2.5 years and after that will be working full time. I feel like I’m signing away my youth and feel that I have yet to explore other fields of interests that I have. 

I have been working towards this for a long time, but mainly chose to major in biology for Finacial security. I got into my top choice but not sure why I’m questioning it all now, now that I got accepted. 

I was always one to never conform to anything ( hence why I chose PA lateral mobility). I feel like I never got to explore other fields of interests such as business in the sports and entertainment industry, or law, or even acting. I find myself questioning it all now.

I paid my seat deposit just to secure my seat but I’m just unsure about the whole thing. I’m not one for school and yet here I am signing up for more. I do it because I have to, not because I want to. Everyone who I ask always tell me the stress of PA school. 

Why am I questioning it all now?

324,"So I've been offered a new job with better pay, better hours and MUCH less work. Sounds ideal, right? 

Right now I'm working at a company as an assistant manager (2 years in this company). It's a lot of work, it's stressful, the pay is low and fixed, the company has no future, but the people there are amazing. They're like my family, and as someone who hasn't got a wife/children/girlfriend, and who's friends scattered after 30 (i'm a 36yo M btw), these people at work turned out to be just what I needed to keep me sane and feeling good. And I'm afraid to let that go... after years of psychological hell in my life, I'm finally starting to feel good (long story).

On the other hand, the job I'm taking has less stress and better pay, but it's basically me working alone and have a lot less work. Now I've worked alone for 15 years (self employed) and it drove me crazy over time. On the other hand, I've never worked in a company like that, so I'm guessing it may be different, but I just don't know...

I understand this sound like an ideal job for many, and I don't want to miss this opportunity out of fear, but as someone who thrives on working with people, I have no idea how this job will impact me psychologically.

So the other night I was at a bar with some of my friends and we happened to bump into a friend of one of the guys who was with us. Things started out really friendly and I decided I really liked her (platonically,of course) and everything was going well.
However a few hours and a lot of drinks later, we shared a peck on the lips (although I’m straight,I do this for fun sometimes.) However,this quickly escalated as she started making out with me and trying to rub my clit and at the time,I don’t understand why and I hate myself for this,but I really wasn’t thinking much of it as it was happening. All I did was move away a couple of times.
However,when I left I started crying and the next morning,I just felt really dirty. I feel had I not drank so much,I would have readily told her to back off. I don’t have any problem telling guys who are being inappropriate with me to get lost,but I just don’t know why I didn’t do the same with her.
Now I’m left feeling angry with myself and with her,and I don’t know how to cope with this. I feel like I have been molested. I really need some help. Should I let her know I really don’t think what she did was okay?

I sort of see my ex in her, who dumped me for another guy. The difference is that my crush was insanely intense for my ex. I’m talking 200 heart beats per second for days at a time.

327,"My husband and I are recovering opiate addicts and we go to the methadone clinic everyday. We are in counseling every two weeks.  We haven't touched a pill in two years thanks to this program. 

He is currently in jail and they want 900.00 to get him out. He wouldn't mind doing the time and getting it out of the way. But they won't give him his methadone and he is withdrawing and sick as hell. He has been vomiting and in physical agony all day and they haven't done anything to help him as of yet. 

We lost everything to pills a couple years ago and we are slowly climbing out from rock bottom. We are currently homeless and living in our truck. He had the girlfriend of someone he is in jail with call me today because she is looking for a truck like ours and would give me the 900.00 I need to get him out. The problem is, everything we own is in it. I have no where to put everything if I did sell it. We would have no where to live and no way to get to the clinic or anywhere else, if I do this. I am so torn.He has been vomiting all day and his muscles are locking up. He is having horrible flu like symptoms on top of feeling like he is crawling out of his skin.This same thing happened the last time he was in there. Luckily, he got out before he lost his place in the program the last time. 

They give methadone to people who are forced to go to the clinic by the courts if they end up in jail while being in the program we are in. But people like myself and my husband, who chose to get help on our own, are forced to suffer through horrible withdraws if we end up in jail. If he doesn't get out in the next few days he will lose his place in the methadone program. Which causes many people to relapse when they do get out because the withdraws from methadone can last for up to  a month or more. Which has caused some people to overdose, and some have died because of this. If people were really worried about ending the opioid epidemic, they wouldn't do this to them. It's one thing to take away someone's freedom, but this is just torture. 

I have been trying everything I can think of to come up with this money, but short of selling the only thing we have left which is our truck and our home at the moment, I am out of options. I don't want us to get separated in our recovery, we have helped each other to stay strong since we quit the pills. What should I do? I know my husband and if he wasn't suffering so much he would never sell our truck. Besides it being everything we have left at this time, he loves it so much. It is literally his favorite vehicle ever. 

Any advice or positive thoughts are welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I haven't been able to sleep much or eat much since he has been gone. And if nothing else, I feel like writing down my thoughts has been cathartic. 

I have tried posting in legal advice after numerous people recommended doing so, but after editing down to two paragraphs, being told I am just looking for money, being told they don't need my life story, that I haven't asked a legal question,  and taking out and putting in every thing that they told me to do, they still won't post it. It has been so humiliating trying to post in legal advice. I have been made to feel like a druggie that is only looking for money. I am out of ideas, and since I can't get legal advice on this, I am reaching out for any advice at all. Thanks so much.",21Apr2019,1

Now it's one thing we kissed with tongue and I can only imagine how bad that is having read a lot of articles now about herpes. But since we're both virgins and wanted to experiment, one thing led to another and for the first time I performed oral sex on her.

331,"So let me start off this story saying I used to be the type of guy r/niceguys makes fun of (to a mild extent). As I got older I started realizing that I should just be direct and stop being a pussy to get girls, and it worked really well. As soon as I hit college something just clicked. I started having a lot of meaningless sex and became the opposite side of the nice guy spectrum from where I was before (it also helped I got slightly more attractive but not by an insane amount). 

It was really fun at the beginning but as time went on I wanted a relationship more. It is also worth noting that although I became more douchey I am still a weird guy. I have the type of personality where some people like me a lot, and some people don’t. What I have noticed however, is that I grow on people a lot the more they know me. 

What typically happened in these hookups is that the girls would begin to develop feelings for me and I had zero interest in them. I was pretty good about not leading people on so I would typically end it when I got bored. Throughout this whole personality progression I started to realize that I can’t think of any girl that I like. I still wanted a relationship but I just wasn’t having the romantic feelings towards any girls the same way I was when I was younger. I also have a lot of female friends that I’m close with. Back in the day I used to like all of them but now I have no romantic interest in any of them. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I still have had crushes on people once I went through this personality change, but much less often. I have never been interested in the girl I was hooking up with. I realized I’m very much into the chase. Once I get what I want, I get over it very quickly. The girls I end up liking are always girls that I develop friendships with so I actually get to know their personality. I’m not that picky about looks but I’m very picky about personality. 

So I recently graduated college and moved to a big city. I downloaded the dating apps and have had a ton of success landing dates. The issue is that it takes a lot of time for me to develop feelings for someone and have to know them for awhile. It’s really hard for me to actually like a girl based on going on dates with them where everyone is putting up a front. I have tried seeing girls multiple times even if I’m iffy on them but I never end up developing feelings. Obviously it would make sense to ask a friend out but as I mentioned, I moved to a new city and it’s hard to make a lot of new friends. 

What can I do to improve my ability to develop feelings?",21Apr2019,1

335,"There are 3 of us in my current apartment: my friend, myself, and the girlfriend who allowed this man into our home. This man basically abandoned his wife and 2 (I've also been told 4) children to live with his now college sophomore girlfriend. Earlier in the year we allowed him to stay for 2 WEEKS (ONLY TWO) as a favor to the girlfriend because he was having ""family problems"", but these problems equated to not wanting to deal with his family. He's had multiple run ins with the police, has been arrested for who knows how many crimes, and he's been hiding in my apartment off and on over the course of the past 3 months. I managed to get him taken off of the property before spring break (at that point he had stayed for over 4 weeks), but he snuck back in after the break. 

Yes I contacted my landlord, but he made it clear that as long as we're alive to pay rent he isn't going to do anything about it. Even though it directly violates the girlfriend's contract, even though he assaulted multiple college students right in front of the apartment (this is how we found out he was back in our town and apartment) , EVEN THOUGH HE HAS FULL AUTHORITY TO KICK HIM OUT, even though my roommate friend and I no longer feel safe in the apartment.

I also contacted the girlfriend's father, who  conveniently is the Deputy sheriff of their home county. He too hates this man and wants him out of the apartment (he didn't know he was hiding in our apartment until I directly contacted him). He had a full plan articulated to take care of the situation, and was going to come to the apartment with the mother to address it in person, but my landlord backed out of doing his part of the plan which ruined everything.

I don't know what to do anymore. No one who can do anything about it fucking cares, my landlord actually told me to wait until something bad happens to me or my roommate to get it situated. Is assaulting college students in front of our house not enough???

Internet mom and dad, I don't know what to do. I'm supposed to be working on my college final and preparing for post college life, but this situation has made me so anxious that I can't focus on my work at all. Im going to ask my air force recruiter if I can get the military to do something about it, but I also know the chances of that happening is slim. I just want this situation handled so I have my house back

338,"I posted this to r/relationshipadvice. I am copying and pasting because I am desperate for ANY advice. I am 23f, and he is 23m. Sorry for mobile formatting

Original post:

I broke up with my ex a few months ago. It was a serious relationship. We got back together (my mistake) for about a week, and then he ended it. 

I made the mistake of getting a dog with him a long time ago, which he has agreed to hold onto him for my summer internship. His family admitted they want to keep him. This shared puppy custody ties me to him. 

The biggest issue: he has become very depressed. He is not taking the breakup well. He quit his job and moved home to prepare for medical school in the fall. He has been so depressed in the past that he's felt suicidal and even attempted before I met him. He is in an emotionally abusive gaslighting cycle that his mother creates that he refuses to realize is false information. The fact that he is not emotionally moving on from our breakup is not helping. I feel obligated to emotionally supporting him to prevent his own self harm or worse, but I feel like I am living a lie. I have no romantic feelings for him anymore, nor have I for a long time, and he knows this. I have started seeing a fantastic guy recently, but I have to keep this private. But I am so stressed that if I move on, I'll not only never see my dog again but also cause harm to him.",21Apr2019,0

It´s a pretty big deal about who asks you etc. So a guy wrote me a letter and asked me to be with him. I have known him for a long time and have a crush on him. I dunno if he feels the same. He gives me such mixed signals. He often stares at me in class and when I look back at him he doesn\`t break eye contact for a good minute. He also often rests his hands on my shoulders and recently when we did some pair work he held his leg so it was touching mine all of the time, i dont think it was an accident. But the thing is he has a girlfriend and he told me that one of the reasons he was inviting me was because he doesnt want his gf to be jealous and she wouldnt be when he went with me. that sounds kind of weird to me but ok. Like i want to go with him but it would be unfair for his gf cause i naturally flirt with people I like and i cant help it. Also i feel like it would be so uncomfortable for me at the party cause i would have to be cautious near him all the time. but when i decline his offer i might end up alone you know and he really is a sweet person.

340,"Hey all, sorry if this is wrong subreddit - I'm new to this thing and I needed to vent and maybe get some helpful advice.

I'm 31 years old, and although I have a beautiful daughter, my dream car, and a great home I feel empty and lost inside.

I enjoy video games and watching TV but beyond that I don't know what or who I am, I don't even know where or how to figure it out. I tried getting into a relationship, but that went poorly quick and a big part of that is that 'I'm boring'. And it's fair.

I grew up playing computers but with work I'm on a computer 6-12 hours a day and so I don't enjoy that anymore. I don't mind camping and hiking and exploring but it's not ever something I'd ever wake up and want to do on a whim.

I have a white collar job but my personality is more of a blue collar type, which means I have a hard time making friends at work and then when I hang out w my actual friends I feel left out or they will 'kid me' about not having a physical job.

Have been divorced twice (both ended in /her/ getting bored and cheating on me) has caused me to have confidence and trust issues. I've gone to gym and lost 65 lbs yet I still feel like I'm an ugly overweight guy (which I'm told is not true) -

I am a person that likes to vent and talk to people and get their opinions, but that has backfired more than it hasn't.

I'm the type of person that enjoys helping out people financially, physically, or whatever....and I usually get burned for it in the process. The people who use me don't see they are using me but everyone else likes to tell me that and then it messes with my emotions and then I become a dick and not my real self.

345,"On Tuesday this week my parents called me frantically to say that while they were on a two week vacation, my sibling had moved out. 

Everything from her room was gone, as was her bicycle, a substantial amount of cash (~4k) as well as some items from my childhood room (old prom dresses, etc.) but no furniture. Originally I’d dismissed this as my sibling had been saying they’ve wanted to move out on their own and perhaps they just didn’t do it in the most productive way (being on the spectrum, communication is sometimes not their strong suit). I suggested to my parents that they were probably fine and in an extended stay hotel or an Airbnb.

On Wednesday I learn that my sibling went to the police after my parents had called them multiple times (worried sick) and had asked the police to issue a warning before they filed for an order of protection. My parents, while difficult, are not physically threatening so this struck me as strange behavior as well as something that my sibling wouldn’t have thought of on their own. Two key data points came out of this: the county where my sibling is (my parents live in a city the size of LA, so my sibling could have been like finding a needle in a haystack) and that my sibling went to the police station with two roommates. 

On Thursday, my parents (who live in a gated community) were able to get a visitor log for everyone who came into the neighborhood for my sibling. We used that to ID the potential roommates my sibling is referring to, both of whom are at least 20 years older than my sibling and we realized they may work together. 

We are in a position where: my sibling won’t talk to anyone but me over text (I was able to call once), but we believe that these roommates are monitoring everything my sibling does (they were in the background the one time I got them on the phone, we are suspicious that not all of the texts I receive are from my sibling due to inconsistencies in language usage).

TL;DR , while my high functioning autistic sibling believes they have moved out and achieved independence, they have actually moved in with two people that are manipulating them and are using my sibling for money and access to more money (my parents). They are grifting my sibling and I don’t know how to get them out safely. 

What is the best way to extract information from them or to signal to them that they may be getting grifted, if communications are monitored?

With the holiday weekend we are struggling to get lawyers on the phone, but are not sure whether to charge all three of them with theft from the house in order to separate them; or if we need to file for guardianship since my sibling is autistic though it will take time. We also don’t want to irreparably damage them in the process.

350,"Hey sweet people of reddit! 
I (20F) have overwhelmingly more guy friends than girls. Since I can remember, it’s always been like this (except for around two years during puberty times.. ugh). I’m generally more into “boyish” things, like gaming, martial arts, (computer) science and drinking. “Typically” girly things don’t interest me too much. 

The thing is, that I’m having a terribly hard time to get along with other ladies, I never really know what to talk about and when I’m meeting my girl friends I’m always kind of nervous and hanging out with them hardly feels really easy going. 

Now, I’m kinda afraid, that I’m doing this, because I’m “abusing” potential interest in me by guys. Most of my guy friends are strictly platonic friends (I don’t make any advanced/flirt with them as far as I’m concerned, I’m just scared I might be doing it unconsciously). But fact is, I have a few guy friends of whom I know, they are interested in dating me. 
I don’t want to lead anyone on and in order to gain friendship from that. But if that’s what I’m doing, I have to realize that so I can work on it.

Lately, I’ve realized I wish for more “female” energy (or whatever you want to call it) around me. But it feels like I have unlearned how to properly sail the “friendship”. 
I gotta admit, I’m pretty introverted, so the most pleasant meet up for me are mainly gaming together or have discussions and exchanging knowledge and opinions (I’m terrible at joking and having small talk, or worse…. Talking about drama.). Excuse my soft sexism here, in my experience most girls I know are not too much into that. 

Btw, I’m pretty sure I’m straight, I had some small experiences with ladies and it was pretty… exhausting. Living out sexuality is not a big part of my life, I’d even rather consider myself as asexual. 

Is there anyone who goes through something similar? Does anybody have advice on how friendship with girls really works? This sounds incredibly stupid..

I just really wish for deep friendships, not based on some one-sided attraction… :/",21Apr2019,3
351,"Well, I have a friend that I had a few dates with and he always makes sure that I'm alright and constantly keeps asking me ""Are you okay?"" and I really appreciate that and had said that to him.

I tried to talk with him about a couple of this stuff and he felt guilty for not realizing that he does that, despite not being his fault at all, after all most of this things are out of habit. 

So, my question is: How do I make sure that he knows that I'm leaning how to deal with thoses things and that I'm trying my best to get to know him enough for him to feel as safe with me the same way I do when I'm by his side?",21Apr2019,1
352,"So, I've really been trying to become a better person, and I'm making some progress, but something that still troubles me even after a year of working on it is that I very easily become upset, and emotional, and in doing that I blow things way of of proportions when I could've just calmed down, stopped for a second, and talked things out calmly and discussed them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a very, very emotional person, in both good and bad ways. When I'm happy, I'm this bubbly, excited ball of love that gets so carried away and carefree, and I just want to shower the people around me in my joy, affection and everything, but I also have this ugly side of me where I'm so quick to become upset the moment something seems wrong, and start accusing people that they might not want to be around me, or that I start thinking they're mad or upset at me, and it'll eat away at me, and I blow something tiny or stupid out of proportions and start saying so much dumb shit over it, staying so firm to my heated, stupid belief that they might not want me around, or that they would rather be somewhere else even when they tell me otherwise, to my face, as I'm being an idiot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just, take everything in such a bad way, and search for the negative in everything. A friend could just say something like 'Aw I'm doing this thing rn otherwise I would hang out with you!"" to someone while hanging out with me, and I'll immediately think it as 'oh they clearly just said they'd rather be with them but they're stuck with me', and it'll get at me, and it'll grow until things go bad. **IT'S SO DUMB**, so painfully dumb of me that it hurts to even type this out and admit it to everyone reading this that I'm that dumb, but in the moment, it just, I can't stop myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I have problems, such as that I worry too much, and I have problems trusting, and stopping to take a deep breath and calming down to think logically. It's getting to the point where it weighs on and hurts the people I love so dearly, enough for them to sometimes feel it necessary to take a break from me (which I understand, and I can't even blame them for it, I'm such a pain in the ass to be around at times that I'm surprised they still persist to stick around after all this time, and insist that they love me when I'm such an awful person), and I'm so desperate for it to stop, but I still find myself messing up on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just, so afraid of being hurt that I have such problems trusting people, trusting that they want to be around me, that they actually \*\*want\*\* to be with me, that they love me, that I'm always paranoid and looking for reasons people could be lying or something to me. And the moment I see something, I close up, I shut myself in, I assume the worst to protect myself when all I'm doing is creating a problem that never had to exist, I'm my own worst enemy. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is really just, very rambly, but I just don't know how to properly write this down in a more clear way.

&amp;#x200B;

 I just, why do I keep messing up? What's wrong with me?

355,"I've known this guy for about 3 years now, not very well, since he's always been an aloof senior in my uni's drama club... 

He's a pretty chill guy, we've had some interesting text conversations in the past. We stopped texting when I was in a relationship (he just felt awkward about texting girls who were in a relationship idk why). Our conversations were never sexual. 

Flash forward to a few months after graduation. I live in a different country now, and neither of us will be in the same city again in the foreseeable future. 

Contacted him again after months...and the nature of the conversation changed. He makes everything about sex. All the damn time. It's tiresome. I've mentioned this to him, and he said it makes things interesting. 

So far, 
- comments about my breasts - he said I need to exercise more because my tits are sagging (after I sent him a vacation selfie)
- expressed interest in wanting to have sex with me (""do you think if we met, we'd fuck?"" I said no because I've legit never considered him as someone I'd like to have sex with. He was a little disappointed.)
- a LOT of sex memes (can be pretty entertaining ngl)
- he answered ""thinking about how your tits would look like bouncing"" when I asked ""what's up?"". I said ""good?"" and he said he'd need proof. 
- constantly encouraging me to go out and have sex with guys on tinder (which I'm not interested in because I'm still not over my ex and I don't think meaningless sex would add value to my life)
- told him about a fucked up incident where a guy filmed a girl showering in her university dorm and he said ""so where's the video?"" Only 75% sure he's kidding. 
- lots of conversation about porn and sex
- questions about my sexual experiences and preferences 
- told him I was getting my hair dyed and he asked ""upstairs or downstairs?""
- told him I watched ""Rough Night"" and he said ""I'll show you a rough night""

The thing is, I'm pretty chill with this type of conversation. Just...well, the sheer volume of it. He said he'd stop if I was uncomfortable with it. He's a lot more comfortable discussing sex than lots of other people I know, hasn't made any legitimate advances or forced me into anything. There's been no sexting, just... inappropriate comments.

One thing lead to another and I ended up asking her out (to my suprise she was already with someone) and it became a joke between us for awhile but it passed in a few weeks as they had broken up.

I showed my dad the car and he said it’s a bit too sporty but he will see what he can do. 

I have to wait until May, next month, to see if I can actually get it or not. One thing that my dad does is he asks you what you what, you tell him that and he gets you the opposite and tells you why you shouldn’t get what you originally wanted. I don’t want to be disappointed and heartbroken because I LOVE this car. It’s all I ever wanted in a car other than a Bentley. He will probably tell me he has the money for it but won’t buy it and will probably buy me a shitty Hyundai or a Toyota. I might sound snobby but the car was just 5,000BD (our currency). I remember he did the same thing but with university. I wanted to be an artist, graphic designer, he told me he will take me to any university I want and when I got a scholarship into any major I want, he told me to pick another major and I did I picked psychology. In the end I’m going to a shitty university and the reason I’m not outside of my country studying neither art or psychology is because I’m a girl and art and psychology have a “fixed routine” and will not get me anywhere. 

I want this car. If I do not get it I will literally raise hell above earth. I will cry for days because I’ve fallen in love with this car. I sound like a snobby bitch or a money hungry girl but I never get whatever I want nor do I have freedom to be whatever I want, I at least deserve SOMETHING.

The problem is getting over her or finding anyone that can live up to her, the most painful thing is i know we are near enough soulmates but fate just never gave me a chance to be with her. I can kind of start to forget her but the problem is when i see her around town i get thrown straight back to stage one again, my heart literally drops every time i see her, its like being in the presence of an angel and i've never felt this way about anyone else before and i doubt i ever will. i'm kind of concerned that i am actually becoming obsessed with her and that i will never be able to move on. I wish i could develop amnesia or something just so  i don't have to suffer anymore.",21Apr2019,0
367,"I don't know if I'm looking for advice exactly haha,  it's just that I feel like I'm a very introvert person to the point of concerning people around me. This trait in the title is often commented on by friends/family. I find social situations draining. I have no problem engaging in one on one conversation, but if it's more than that I like to just sit quietly outside the conversation, or disconnect entirely from the situation. Like i just went driving with my mom and brother, sat in the back and listened to music in one ear and looked out the window the entire ride. My mom commented on this, that I wasn't being present.. And then another time I had a couple of friends over, we got shit faced drunk and had really interesting conversation, I had something to say to some of it but for the remainder of the night I just sat and listened and was really engaged in the conversation my two buddies were having, and they also commented on me being distant and quiet.

So.. am I normal? Like I have a lot of introspective thoughts and I value alone time/one on one time, but I just can't deal with this. I don't know if it's something about me I need to change or if others need to accept that's how I am. I feel fine, but clearly others are concerned haha",21Apr2019,1

370,"So I work 7-4, and I'd like your advice on being active after work. Basically, when I'm at work all I can think about is how much I'd rather be doing other things. Playing some vidya, going for a bike ride, hitting the gym, whatever. Then, I leave work and get home and all those things seem like too much and I just want to sit and watch something on the Boob Toob. No activity, no self-improvement, just mindless staring at the TV for 5 or 6 hours until I fall asleep.

It's not that I'm exhausted or anything, I get a solid 8 hours of sleep most nights. It's just as soon as I walk in the door and the pants come off all motivation to do anything active goes out the door.

This is not ideal. I want to go to the gym or do other exercise, I want to maintain my gaming hobby, I don't want to be a vegetable after work every evening. 

Can y'all share some insight on this issue? Do I need to change my habits? Do I need to wear different pants? I'd appreciate any advice you can offer.",21Apr2019,1
371,"TD;LR: My severely night owl SO (sleeps 8-9am to 4-5pm) consistently won’t get up earlier on days I need him to. (Rough estimate probably once every 2-3 months I need him up earlier.) If he does, he’s mad at me all day. I’ve always been nice about it, reminded him of it, and expressed the importance of it to me. I don’t know how to better communicate this. I know it’s how he’s wired and can’t help it, but everyone has to go against their sleep schedule sometimes.

By severely night owl, I mean usual sleep time is around 8-9am to 4-5pm. Whenever I’ve googled this, get night owls talking about how they sleep until noon. Noon would be great! Still have plenty of daylight after noon.

We’ve been together almost 8 years now, so I’ve accepted most days he’ll be sleeping all day. Just how he’s wired. His mom and sister are the same. He works late evenings, so it’s usually fine.

But sometimes there’s shit to do we have to do during daylight! I would rough estimate there’s one day every 2-3 months I need him up earlier. I always remind him fairly consistently “hey, remember we have that thing. Please try to go to bed earlier.” But more often than not, he doesn’t, won’t get up, and I do the thing alone.

For example, today. I promised weeks ago we’d help my grandparents with yard work they need to do. A lot of it will be moving heavy stuff around. My SO is most able-bodied one around, with the rest of us being old and/or small. He’s a giant among hobbits here, really; what would take 3 of us he could do alone without breaking a sweat.

He got home from seeing friends at 4am, accidentally woke me up. He said he was going to eat a little something and go to bed. 4am is not bad at all, so I was pretty happy things were going to work out. Fell back asleep, woke up at 7, and yeah. He was still up. 

I was visibly disappointed, said “I have to try to get you up at noon, you know.” He was defensive and stated he’d just stay up then. I went downstairs for coffee, just came to check on him at 8:30 now, and he’s fast asleep.

Hopefully I will be able to get him up, sometimes I succeed- but when I do he’s in a pissy mood the rest of day. Won’t even look at me. I hate dealing with that, but in today’s case, other option is to try to move all this heavy shit by myself and probably failing at it, disappointing my family &amp; embarrassing myself.

I know you can’t help your natural circadian rhythms. Him getting up at noon is as unpleasant for him as it would be for me to stay up all night. But the thing is- I *have* before, when I’ve needed to. Worked night shift for 3 years, have stayed up in ER with my mom *so many* times. Sometimes you don’t get to sleep when you want. 

I don’t know. I’m tired of this dance. I’m tired of having plans for weeks then going alone &amp; defending his absence the whole time. Or dealing with his pissy mood the whole time.

I don’t know what to do or say. I’ve always been nice about it, always reminded him, always told him it was important to me. I don’t know how to communicate it any better.",21Apr2019,1
372,"I was recently promoted to a supervisor position and I superviser 6 employees. There is a lot of personal talking going on during work hours.

374,"I'm 26 and have been depressed for a good 7/8 years now. Decided to do something about it when I was 22 and it was difficult to admit to myself I needed help &amp; actually ask for it, but I did, and started on anti depressants and therapy. I was in medical school at the time and was lucky because I had access to help &amp; it was only a matter of reaching out.

Didn't tell my family until about a year ago. Managed to scrape through med school somehow but now have to appear in a licensing exam (USMLE) which I have registered for, and it's time sensitive because if I want to apply for residency this year I need to be done with 3 exams by August. I already spent a year after getting done with medical school etc doing nothing *but* 'focusing' on this exam and spending time at home (uni was a different city), and I don't much fancy prolonging this limbo-ish state of being.

My mental state has been pretty bad over the last year and now that I am actually at the tail end of this exam situation I've found myself getting progressively worse. I am on meds but not going to therapy because 'not wasting time' has been a priority. I can't really afford it right now either. 

These days I just sleep or hide under Netflix binges all day and am just letting the time go by without an iota of guilt - it's self sabotage and I know it and yet I haven't been able to do anything to stop it. Been crying myself to sleep every night + self harm has made a reappearance and my mental state is just consistently shit &amp; at this point I just somehow want it to stop because I'm tired of having to constantly deal with this, I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm not actively suicidal but feeling worthless and hopeless and generally just done. It's all I've known for so long and now I just feel like I can't be bothered anymore.

I don't know how to gather strength to just get this over with. The thing is; I've spent so much time on this and am nearly done with prep etc (I've also been pretty much isolated for a very long time - basically no social life, just interact with family) and I don't know how I'm going to forgive myself if I fuck this up at this point . I just need to somehow get through that final stretch but can't seem to be assed. I don't know what to do.",21Apr2019,1
375,"Backstory: A friend of mine sent me a dick pic and I decided to draw a line on where my boundaries were. He and I have always been pretty open about sexual conversations, past relationships, and emotional states of being. I decided that I didn’t want that kind of relationship with him. I’ve never suggested or given any reason for him to think we would have anything other than a platonic friendship. So I called him out and told him that made me feel uncomfortable. He called me an uptight American. So our conversation got pretty crazy.....where I basically called him out for something he had confided in me that was pretty disturbing. Which to this day, I have felt deep shame for not saying anything to him after he had told me. 

The disturbing story summed up: He had sex with his then gf (I don’t know who she is) after she had taken sleeping pills. He said at first he thought she was fake sleeping, but then he realized she wasn’t and still proceeded to do things to her. He ended that story saying “it wasn’t rape because we were together...”

I didn’t know how to respond to that at the time so I told him “that’s pretty fucked up, did you tell her?” He said that she had asked him that morning if they did stuff and he had just smiled and winked at her.  I just stared at him and didn’t say anything. I should have. I think I was a little scared because I was staying at his house in a foreign country. 

After that story my views of him changed, but I still stayed friends with him. I don’t think that the gravity of what he did actually hit me until he tried to blame me for feeling uncomfortable after he sent me a pic of his dick. 

After trying to hold him accountable for making me feel super uncomfortable, and him turning it around on me, I decided to call him out. To finally say something about what he had done and that it was wrong. When I finally told him that what he did to her was rape he tried to say that it was just a story. And I quote, “like movies are stories, I just told you a story.”

Me trying to hold him accountable was over messenger, maybe the distance gave me more courage to speak up. IDK. I’m just relieved He’s not a friend anymore.

Am I horrible for waiting to call him out on that?",21Apr2019,1
376,"Two and a half years ago I met J on an online app and he left to Asia two weeks after our first date for a trip that was a part of his business school’s assignment. However, he returned a month later confessing that he slept with a stewardess and contracted genital herpes. He justified sleeping with another woman by saying that I told him to have fun so he did. I should’ve left on the spot but he was depressed and talked about ending his life so I stayed and listened to him. I thought I could relate cause my mom had become disabled from a stroke and I believed a medical condition shouldn’t define a person. His regular cocaine use should’ve been another red flag. Either way, we continued this relationship and used condoms during sex and started having unprotected sex when he stopped having symptoms.

However, in one of my routine STD screening, I found out that I contracted genital herpes from him I felt incredibly angry, upset, and resentful at myself. I couldn’t tell anyone but J and eventually found solace. Then last august 2018, he left to San Francisco to work for a large social media firm and we became distant. Nonetheless I made the effort to fly out every month to see him. 

But two nights ago, he accidentally left me a voicemail having a conversation with a woman with an accent (I’m assuming it’s his female colleague who is a tech lead at his firm) and he was lying to her. He told her he stays away from \[insert race\] girls and his last relationship was two years ago. That he was only flirting with other women at a party cause she ditched him and he really wants to do \[insert sexual act\] with her. I was shocked to hear him lie so easily. And I’m scared that he may deceive this woman and others and spread his STD. I now realize he has a proclivity for lying to women to appear like a victim needing our sympathy and blaming us when he gets caught. 

I’m mainly concerned because J has a history of hooking up with his colleague/subordinates and J currently manages teams of contractors. Also the lies I heard him tell this woman who may be his colleague makes me feel very uneasy. Most likely he has not disclosed his STD to the women he has been secretly dating.

I don’t know if I should walk away from this hot mess and continue living my celibate life. Or if I should take legal action for him knowingly infecting me and forcing him to disclose his genital herpes to the new women in his life. However, he had already disclosed to me that he has STD so I don’t believe I can take any legal action. And a large part of me wants to pretend J ever existed in my life and believe that those women are not my problem. But I know if I am that female colleague, or any other woman, I would want to know the truth and protect myself.",21Apr2019,2

I'm on less than minimum wage, which I understand - I'm getting trained up in something.

But I have no interest in it, I have no intention of being an electrician at all, I just took a shot in the dark thinking it's better than nothing.

I'm actively looking for work, I'm applying to anything under the sun, I'm also looking at joining law enforcement, cabin crew, going back to train as a barber or hair stylist.. anything that seems like it would genuinely interest me.

  
I took the apprenticeship because it was at least a step forward in whatever direction, but I hate it.  
Worse than that I'm bad at it and the guys know it.

At the same time I managed to get into my first true realationship. I really fucking loved that girl, but at the time I had so many women I honestly considered cheating. But i didn't have the balls so instead my plan was to break up with her and get with another girl.

Looking back i feel kinda bad because we really loved each other and because of my big ego self I left her like nothing and never talked to her again. She kept texting me months after we broke up telling me how much she loved me and missed me.

Im tired of constantly thinking about 2016.

Some months after our breakup, she started dating one of my childhood best friends. What makes me angry is that he used to be so nervous and fidgety around girls, but I taught him how to talk to girls, and then he did that to me. He fucking got with my EX knowing how I felt about her. 

That was what really fucked me up. I started getting back into my old habits and as of now, I've gained 30lbs since then. I haven't had true passionate sex like I used to with my ex. I don't eat fulfilling foods anymore, just shit junk food and smoke weed dabs like a train.

Now not all things are bad, I have a job I enjoy, im getting back into church and spending more time with my family. I've started to travel the U.S. and Mexico and I have a little side business.

But im still not happy.

I'm a male in his early 20's If that helps.

It's just I was SOOO much fucking happier back then.  It was true joy, i didn't need to be stoned 24/7 to enjoy everyday things.

I keep constantly thinking about the past, ""shoulda done this, shoulda done that, god you're so dumb why'd you do that""

Thorought the day I'll get really vivid ""daydreams"" or flashbacks to the 2016 days. I Will be so immersed in it and so happy,but then ill snap out of it and realize it was in the past and the reason I am where I am is because of ME, because of MY life choices.

Pretty much anything makes me cry and it sucks.

(The people auditioning me were more than nice and we all laughed it off) 

Another day, my mom was arguing with my aunt and they were raising their voices and that made me tear up too. What they were fighting about didn't concern me at all, I felt neutral to it but there tears still came.  

I've had multiple things like this recently, particularly with yelling, that sets me over the edge and I don't know why it's happening, especially since it's rarely  because I'm genuinely upset.

It worries me though because he has a tendency to experience his emotions more physically, like with stomach aches and gut problems. I'm worried he is pushing everything down and it's going to make him sick. 

I know it might also be that it doesn't really feel real until you're slapped in the face with it at the funeral.

395,"My friend, we’ll call him Tim is 21, he’s been in our group of friends for 5 years now and has recently been acting completely irrational. Tim recently started seeing this girl from his college, well call her Ashley, we were all super excited for Tim and Ashley until Tim came home on Friday and revealed that they were already on a break. They only met 3 weeks ago. Tim came back home and immediately started telling us everything. Ashley wanted a break from Tim because she told him he was smothering her.  And smothering her he was. Tim proceeds to show us arm length messages he sent to Ashley. The contents of the messages made little sense and were near impossible to follow, but mainly reiterated how badly he needed her back. Ashley would only reply with one or two sentences telling Tim to calm down and leave her alone. These weren’t the only arm length messages sent. He also sent messages to Ashley’s sister, and her sisters boyfriend. They all told him the same thing to leave her alone. These messages were from Wednesday. Tim tells us since she wasn’t responding he went to her apartment on Thursday after being explicitly told not to, she told him to leave. Fast forward back to when we see him Friday, after catching us up on all that he then shows us messages he sent to his ex. They broke up 3 years ago and she wants nothing to do with him. She never responded to him, but he’s convinced shell take him back or just have sex with him. We tell him she absolutely would not. Tim will not listen to a word we say, hell just loudly interrupt and move to the next thing he thinks is relevant. So he tells us that his school counselor told him Thursday that Tim has an anxiety disorder. Tim now justifies any excuse he has had made throughout his entire life, including this recent blunder, on his newly diagnosed anxiety disorder. We all think this is much more than anxiety and try to help but he wont listen. Tim exclaims that weed will solve all of his problems. He smokes weed on average 5 times a day so that definitely is not his cure.  Friday night we all get ready to go to the bars, were pregaming as usual but Tim is drinking to excess and this is when the really troubling details come. Tim reveals to us all the girls he’s hit up, after his and Ashleys break, in hopes of finding a rebound. Many of these girls are highschoolers under 18. Some of whom he has sent dick pics to. Tim tells us that he has sent at least 10 dick pics to some of these girls. We are all in shock, and tell him he can not do that and that it is not right. He tries justifying it all by telling us how they all asked for it. We do not buy into any of it and are extremely uncomfortable with the thought. Tim then tells us about the one time him and Ashley had sex. For the most part he described it as consensual except that she told him to stop because it was hurting her, he told us that he kept going because he hadn’t finished yet. We were all very uncomfortable and tell him to just stop talking because we don’t know how to process all this. He does not listen and for the rest of the night drunkenly and loudly argues with us. Tells us how he’s listening and that he’s taking our advice all the while loudly interrupting, rambling and disregarding everything we say.  We left him at the house and went to the bars without him. At the bar we see Ashley’s sisters boyfriend explain to him that Tim’s off the rails and he wholeheartedly agrees. When we comeback he’s outside talking to our friend Mark on the phone. Mark relays to us that in the conversation Tim said that he’s thought about killing himself many times. Saturday we all go home but drew starts posting random things all over social media. Mostly pictures of him at work, but he also posted a collage of Ashley captioned “hopefully not preggers”. Along with a collage of all of his friends highlighting his friendships. We told him to take both down but he only took down the one of all his friends. He then showed up to where we were hanging out and acted pretty normal. Until he randomly calls his mom urgently telling her to come pick him up. We hear her on the line crying. We have no idea what he told her and Tim immediately leaves. 
All in all we have no idea whats wrong with him but we know he needs help. This isn’t the first time he’s acted strange, he did so in the summer as well, we told his parents and they dismissed everything we told them. We just aren’t sure what the next move we should make is. 

Tl;dr: Friend Tim has been sending troubling messages, including nudes to many girls, some younger than 18. As a way to get back at a girl he was seeing for only 3 weeks. Tim has also mentioned the thought of killing himself. When anyone tries to help he will dismiss us, ramble on about unrelated topics, loudly interrupt, blame others and not accept the fact that he is being completely irrational and unhelpable.",21Apr2019,2

400,"Hi guys. I know this isn't a typical post here, maybe it is, idk. But maybe I can get some help. 

Let's get this out of the way, I weight 275 pounds. Now let me clarify, I don't look even close to this weight, most people assume I'm around 200 and honestly I wish I was. 

For the past two years I have been trying to drop weight and I always rebound and get heavier, I even managed to drop to 230 two summers ago but I bounced right back and weighed 260 befote the year was done. 

And now I am here, It's not that I'm depressed or anything but sometimes I get so angry and disappointed in myself that I just want to scream, I just shake and cry while looking in the mirror. 

It's not my lack of excercise. It's my failure at dieting. I played football earlier this year and had a great time, I even joined a rowing team in March, might I add rowing is 5 days a week for 2 hours. It's intense, and I feel fit, but I cant drop weight. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. I wish I could just give up and not care, but I cant. I want to change so badly but its so hard. 

Addictive genes run in my family, my great-grandfather, grandfather, and father, all have had problems with addiction. And as petty and as wrong as I may be, I feel like i genuinely have a problem with food, I eat food when Im not hungry, I eat food when I am hungry. I eat to eat, not for any other reason. When Im about to eat food I can't even thing straight, the part of my brain that says ""Stop, You're going to regret it"" just goes quiet. I'm driving myself crazy.

Someone help please. Anything helps.",21Apr2019,2

403,"Got accepted into my Top Physician assistant program- not really happy about it. Questioning career choice now 

Background- I am 24 years old with a bachelors in Biology. Graduated in 2017, and recently got an acceptance to my top PA school which begins this July.

When I received my acceptance I wasn’t happy or sad about it, just coming to the realization that I will be in school for 2.5 years and after that will be working full time. I feel like I’m signing away my youth and feel that I have yet to explore other fields of interests that I have. 

I have been working towards this for a long time, but mainly chose to major in biology for Finacial security. I got into my top choice but not sure why I’m questioning it all now, now that I got accepted. 

I was always one to never conform to anything ( hence why I chose PA lateral mobility). I feel like I never got to explore other fields of interests such as business in the sports and entertainment industry, or law, or even acting. I find myself questioning it all now.

I paid my seat deposit just to secure my seat but I’m just unsure about the whole thing. I’m not one for school and yet here I am signing up for more. I do it because I have to, not because I want to. Everyone who I ask always tell me the stress of PA school. 

Why am I questioning it all now? 
Any advice would help.

404," Girlfriend (18F) (now my ex) is struggling with her sexuality and is very confused, she said she was never sexually attracted to men (me (20M) included) but loves me for who I am, but she doesn't know if she is gay/bi or whatever.

She loves me for who I am and she said she would still love me the same if my personality was in a woman's body. She said she never wanted to have sex with a guy but when she would try with a woman. I'm okay with not having sex, and is definitely not a deal breaker for me. She feels the same and says if she's feeling frisky she can satisfy herself. She is really having a hard time understanding what is she is and isn't attracted to.

I'm really trying to help her come to some kind of conclusion. She's my best friend and we both agreed to break up in order for her to find herself. If it turns out she's not into woman, she said she will come back to me (not to use it as false hope though) and as selfish as it sounds I really hope that that's what happens. But, whatever happens, I will still be supportive of her and not think of her any less or different. We're both important to each other no matter what.

Could it be possible she is just heteroromantic and homosexual? How does she figure it out? I know some will say to not put a label and just do what you feel but it will just help to get some kind of understanding. Will it only help for her to explore sexually with both male and female and maybe then she would have an answer?

Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you",21Apr2019,1
406,"I went to the park early this morning and came across a seemingly dead baby possum at the parking lot. But I noticed it was shivering. I shrugged and went played basketball. After an hour, I came back to it now standing. I shrugged it off again and ran for another two hours. At the end of that, the possum was just wobbling in place while birds bothered it. Since I was afraid it might die before being picked off by a bird or a dog, I put him in a box with a towel and took him home. I have him in that box with a container filled with water and small pieces of a strawberry. The possum is big enough to have its eyes open, but I doubt it could've survived long enough on its own.

408,"I'm sorry for the long read, but all of this is for context. I am a class president on my first year of college. I actually like being a leader and public servant, by my classmates make me reconsider.

During the whole year, I would make announcements in front of class, to which only half would be listening.

I tried to be the best president, even to the point where a friend of mine told me I'm being too nice. I'd pay for handouts occasionally and for missing cash when we'd have collections. I'd inform my classmates of what we need and when we need them, deadlines, etc.

In my country, it's already summer vacation. My friends and I had been planning a swimming for ourselves since December. We invited our adviser along. I didn't go, but my friends pushed through with it, and we had video calls to make me feel included.

My classmates were also planning a class outing, since around February. When they saw my friends' swimming pictures, they got angry. The one who was planning the class outing, let's call her Karen, was the most vocal one. She went onto our class group chat and said this in our language: ""If you guys want to push through with separate outings, that's okay. Let's not do our class outing anymore""

I. Was. Angry. So was our adviser.

This was the first time i retaliated. I gave them a piece of my mind, telling them that I am disappointed with them. That OUR outing was OURS and was not representative of the whole class.

Some other classmates talked, too. Complaining that they only wanted ""unity"" for the last time (our class was divided into subgroups of friends that rarely interact) and indirectly blaming us for being the cause of such unity being out of reach.

Our adviser spoke, too. And everyone fell silent eventually.

As the president, it is my task to have all professors and other school staff sign our clearances to make sure all our requirements are met. My friend Jan accompanies me, even if she wasn't a class officer. My teacher told me that I should give back the clearances to my classmates so he'd sign them one by one, talking to them individually. I set a time and date, and informed everyone.

Jan, however, was out of town on that day. She had the clearances with her. Our set time was 10 to 12, but because of traffic she was unable to arrive on time.

My classmates, of course, were angry. They complained. My adviser let them go home.
They complained in our group chat, telling us that they ""should've been informed that Jan would be late"" and that they ""also had stuff to do.""

I also have stuff to do. I'm a working student, but for their clearances I have to be in school whenever I need to, since our teachers aren't at school everyday. I am in school at least 3 days a week, even on a Saturday.

Recently, I found through a friend that my male classmates were talking about me behind my back, calling me ""selfish"" and ""only caring about himself""
This made me want to cry.
I've spent all this time trying to be my best self since I had bad experience in high school, but this is the gratitude I receive.

I now hate my classmates, even the ones that did nothing wrong.
Whenever I remember these situations, I get extremely angry and end up being unproductive due to having a heavy heart and lack of focus.

What should I do to forgive my classmates and forget everything? I want my next year to be good and untainted of past events.

421,"I’ve been given the opportunity of a life-time and have weighed my pros and cons, but I would still love some outsider input. Idk if it’s just because I’m emotionally attached to the company I’m with right now, but I feel like I’m overlooking something.


I’ve been with Company A for about 8 years now. It’s a private company. 

Pros:
- Family-like relationships with colleagues 
- Amazing work environment. We stream videos, movies, and music all day long. 
- Laid-back boss
- Ability to express creativity in work
- Flexible around my school schedule 
- Super dog friendly. I can bring my puppers whenever I want. 
- Boss rarely says no when requesting time-off 
- Yearly bonus about $1k

Cons:
- Company is small, so work will pile up if you’re gone too long 
- Hours can vary depending on volume of work (I usually work 8am-7:30pm daily, however I have pulled all-nighters a handful of times)
- No 401k or investment opportunities 
- No official health insurance benefits (although my boss agreed to pay for half of my monthly premium)
- No more opportunities for a higher position 
- Pay raises are sporadic and not always yearly. I don’t feel properly compensated for my abilities. 



Company B is a massive corporate company. They are offering about $5k more than what I’m currently earning in addition to quarterly bonuses. 

Pros:
- Vision, dental, and medical health insurance 
- 401k and will match up to 6%
- Hours are 9am-6pm
- Quarterly bonus up to $1000 (based off productivity and punctuality)
- 2-5% salary increase yearly
- Plenty opportunity to move up within organization 

Cons:
- Might conflict with school schedule 
- Bureaucratic


Though it might seem obvious, I’m still torn on the decision. I’m so emotionally invested with Company A because the people are amazing, and I truly consider them my second family. Also the flexibility around my sometimes full-pack college schedule is invaluable; I’m going to reach out to a counselor this week to see if my remaining classes are available online/evenings.

However, I just hate working for a living. I've worked jobs in accounting, marketing, and even physical labor jobs, but I can't motivate myself. I love graphic design and I have a side hustle that nets me a little extra cash per month. I've tried applying for design jobs but have gotten nowhere due to the over-saturated market. No matter what job I do, I get burned out in 3 or 4 months. I cannot monetize my passion projects so those are a no go. I currently teach English in China and this is perhaps the most satisfying job I've ever done. My students really like me and I enjoy helping them and spending time designing interesting lesson plans. But I can't live in China forever and I dread returning home to Canada. Teaching English in Canada is basically a dead end job which requires a certification cost of $7k (TESOL) but yields a part time job at only $25 per hour. I basically feel like Peter Gibbons from the movie Office Space.

I feel that at the root of my problem lies my belief that most work today is actually quite meaningless. Most people work jobs that produce nothing and facilitate meaningless (and also at times parasitic) industries like banking and finance. Retail is also meaningless. They say work is supposed to build character but I fail to see how enduring mind numbing drudgery and demeaning job application processes is supposed to make one a more moral person.

Now every single Saturday she pounds on my door. I usually just dont answer. So she'll just stand outside my door and knock again and again...and stand there and try to listen for me. I can see her shadow under the door. Yesturday she literally just stood outside my door for 5 solid minutes without knocking just trying to listen for movement, but I was already watching a movie with headphones on so it was completely silent.

When I don't answer she goes outside and walks around the building. But like, a foot away from the windows.

436,"For some context, when I was younger, my family was very well off financially, but due to some bad moves by my father and his father, they lost most of their wealth and accumulated some hefty debt, resulting in us moving from our old house, which was used a collateral for a loan, into a much smaller and run down home. Now, while not optimal, this would have been fine, as my sister and I are still attending the private school we have gone to since we were young children (albeit with some moderate financial aid), and, looking at the big picture, we are still a solidly middle-class family. I don't want to sound like a stuck up ex-rich kid, because to be honest, when I look at my classmates at school, we were never anywhere near as wealthy as them, and in the end it doesn't matter as long as we're happy.

However, lately I've noticed that when I wake up in the morning, my mother is sometimes sleeping on the couch, and earlier today, I finally asked her why she was always downstairs. She broke down in tears, telling my that she couldn't stand being in the same room as my father, as he was always drunk. She said that she told him she was going to leave him, and that she couldn't take it anymore. Now, looking back, I realized that I have seen my dad come home drunk before, but I always thought he was just in a weird mood. Added with the fact that more and more often lately, my mom would tell me my dad was feeling sick when he wouldn't leave his room in the mornings on weekends, when really he was just hungover. On top of all of this, she revealed that just a few days ago, he had driven drunk to the store, and that she thought he was going to kill someone.

I honestly never thought that my dad could ever be so stupid. He would always point out natural selection in action when he saw someone doing something stupid on the news, and told us that Darwin was right. I just don't know what to do. My father isn't trying to help himself, and I don't know how to confront him about it, as my mother has only told me. I don't want him to feel like he's being cornered by his family, I just want him to get better. My whole family is feeling the effects of his drinking, whether it's when he gets in a shitty mood and brings the whole family down, or the fact that it's affecting his work. My father travels frequently for work, which only adds to his stress, and although he's trying to recover his business, my mom has told me in the past that it seems like she is the only one supporting our family - because of our new financial situation, my mother got a job again, and it's one that has her working 6 or 7 days a week, sometimes late at night.

Anyways, sorry for the length, but I honestly don't know what to do at this point. My mom says she still loves him, but she can't stay with him any longer because of the drinking.

So we have had this wooden table for about 3 months and just the other day I noticed a nickel sized pile of light brown powder on the table. I thought it was just some type of protein powder or something from my wife but the next day I saw it again in the exact same spot. So now I'm a little concerned.

Well this morning I saw the pile in the same spot again. It's an old school piece of furniture and looks beat up and rustic. It has a number of small holes on the top. This pile was right by one of the holes. I've looked up ways to figure out if its termites and apparently you can hear them if you press your ear to the wood? I cant hear anything so I'm not sure if its that. 

Does this sound like termites? Has anyone else had this happen to them? I'm fairly certain it's not from the ceiling. I moved the table about 5 inches over and tomorrow I will see if the pile is still in the same spot.

441,"TL;DR   my friend continues to be very nice to me by saying hello with a smile even when I don't see him at first despite the fact that I told him I liked him after not knowing him more than a month. I wonder why he's still being so nice and is it him being malicious or am I overreacting to all of this. 

I met B on a overseas trip about a month ago. We became friends pretty quickly bc we went to the same school and were the closest in age (everyone else was in their 50s or a middle schooler basically). We joked around a lot, talked about our knowledge of art, and overall had a great time. I realized I really liked him on day two. He had such an amazing grin that just made me feel so happy? He's also very social, funny, respectful, mature, has great boundaries, and is very caring. Anyways, he kinda tried to set me up with his wlw friend on day 1, so I knew he probably didn't like me back. 

Fast forward to the end. We get back from the trip and I expect to never see this guy again. Our schedules are completely different and we never ran across each other on campus before. Surprise! He's everywhere. He pops up next to my fifth period sometimes to talk to his friends, I see him in the halls, whatever. He always said ""Hi, [my name]!"" with his cute grin. I would stutter out a response. I won't even see him but he'll still try to grab my attention. 

I couldn't handle it anymore. He took up so much of my emotions and thoughts that I decided to curb the crush via telling him how I felt. I did just that. I made it clear that I expected nothing from him, I knew how he felt, and that I'd like to still be friends. He texted back something along the lines of ""I like you. I'm not in the place for a relationship, but maybe when things settle down. You're cool and I'm happy to have met you."". I was surprised, but assumed he was lying. 

He still hung around outside my fifth period. He still said hi to me when it was unnecessary. He still smiled at me. He would say hi to me even when he was talking with his friends. He actively would TRY to get my attention when I didn't see him. I'm so shocked. I had assumed he would cut me off or just be very short with me. I don't understand why he would continue being such a dear? The point for me was a couple days ago when we crossed paths after school and he said ""hey, have a nice weekend!"".

448,"Growing up, you’re bound to change your career paths, dreams, lifestyle, whatever things that can be changed about yourself at least once in your life. I’ve always debated whether life is a short span goldfish, or life is a long roller coaster ride.

Age four to ten; I wanted to be a children’s doctor. The thought of helping kids was something my innocent, young self would wish for. 

Age eleven to fourteen; I changed my mind, and I wanted to be a photographer, I thought I had a photography gift, I took lots of pictures, and they were all decent looking, thus making me inspired to be a photographer.

Age fourteen to fifteen; I wanted to be a psychologist. The study of the mind soon became interesting to me, and being a freshman at the timeI heard there was such thing called ap psychology, and I was excited and thought, “finally! A subject I can tolerate!”

That is until sophomore came in, I took ap psychology and it made me feel, ironically, miserable. I hated psychology and thought that I would never want to be in that field. And I also failed my ap exam not to mention.

But I somehow want to be in the science/ medical field, so I developed an interest with plastic surgery. I studied the way people would incision women’s breasts, how they’d open up a nose to fix the hump, how they inject substances onto people’s faces. All that without cringing.

So fifteen-sixteen year old me wanted to be a plastic surgeon... that is until I’ve been shamed by my family, but not directly though.

My nuclear family were supportive of my choice, and that’s what should matter. But when you’re dealing with your religious distant relatives, they’re bound to be critical. I take criticism really well, but hearing the “BUT PLASTIC SURGERY IS HARAM, YOU CAN’T ENDORSE ON CHANGING OTHER PEOPLE’S APPEAR, WHICH GOD HAS BLESSED THEM WITH,” on repeat becomes overbearing. And not to mention, you have to have high grades to become a surgeon, let alone a plastic surgeon. I’m not a bad student, I actually have good grades, and a somewhat above average gpa, but I don’t have a surgeon level intelligence.

Now as an eighteen year old junior, about to touch senior, have been struggling with my hopes and dreams. The thought of not achieving anything is becoming overpowering in my mind, that it had affected me mentally. I’ve started to feel less worthy, I’ve started to feel like I’m letting my parents and myself down. At one point, I had the desire to harm myself, but thankfully I dodged the bullet and didn’t do it.
But I’m still struggling on which way I’m going, and I’m afraid of not achieving anything in the future.

So I'm just looking on some insight of how to respectfully approach women at bars or house parties, if let's say her and I make eye contact ( and I find her attractive) or if I notice her looking at me 

I use to binge drink and do drugs all the time. And that replaced my desire to seek women, I've had a few flings here and there, but I have never had a relationship.  

With the alcohol and drug abuse my confidence was terrible,  I suffered heavily from "" nice guy syndrome "" in the sense that I always tired to prove to them I was a good choice ( although I had major substance issues) and basically just threw myself at them, which I realize now is not good, and came off very needy.

Since I've been sober (3 months) I have been going insanely hard at the gym embracing a very healthy lifestyle, first time in my life I actually believe I am attractive.  The problem is my social skills are lacking when it comes to approaching women. 

I've heard its important to make my intentions clear ? Like genuinely compliment something they are wearing or something, ask if they would want to go out sometime. I have been trying just talking to them about something random like the band or dj thats playing, but the conversation dies off, and it's kinda hard to transition to asking a number from that, I feel like that doesn't really get my intentions across hey ?

Then I got betrayed by a group I was working with since 13 and in the same instance became more financially successful with my online business. 

The Live Fast Die Young period was incredibly liberating as I met so many characters with substance, not John and Jane Doe’s, and was fueled by “if I don’t do it now, I could die tomorrow and have never experienced it” alongside an interest in exploration. Unfortunately I thought traveling and exploring would help me get a taste of that and it didn’t. I also thought by going to college and doing the party rounds, I’d get a taste of it again, but I didn’t. I got a Diet Pepsi instead of a Coke Original.

459,"Two things in all scare me in life: going so low that everything I've said or promised in the past isn't cared about by myself to one day to kill myself, and earworms. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure where I heard about these, but I'm not talking about music or things being metaphorically stuck in your head. I mean an actual worm (or small insect) that goes into your ear and your brain, probably to eat it or lay eggs... etc. I know that this has been a thing since a very young age, perhaps 7 or 8 years in, but I've always been aware of the smaller bugs that come into my room to take care of my mattress and remove any that do find their way into my sheets. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, recently I checked Google/YouTube for real-life earworms with only one real result, and it was satire. Everything else was the music kind. 

Are earworms not real? 

&amp;#x200B;

A follow up question if I can **(perhaps the more preferred focus of this thread, if I could only have the answer to one)**: 

\-This is the video that came back for ear worms, but I quickly realized it was satire, checked, and it's buzzfeed. It's playing as I type this and an interesting thing came up, which leads to the follow up: 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3qz5egzjbE&amp;t=204s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3qz5egzjbE&amp;t=204s)  (timestamped video) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A dream I often have (again from a young age) revolves around myself, a dark room, and the high-pitched noise you can hear in the video. A voice shouts ""NO"" and I keep doing what I was doing, sometimes laughing, before I instantly forget about what that was, and I'm in a dark room on my back with this noise over everything. I can't scream, no noise comes out when I try, yet it makes this noise worse. 

It gets so bad that something starts throwing me around the room as  I try to control the noise/pain, but in some dreams I've been able to stop screaming or holding my head in some way to have the noise stop, the throwing around (it's like a whirlwind, sometimes a person or being) skipped, and so far I've been able to levitate within the room or go into a lucid dream (""where I can remain and do whatever I want, knowing its a dream, but waking up when I acknowledge that it's a dream fully""). 

Worth noting that I have seizures/dizzy spells often; in one instance I started dancing, in another I started laughing and tried to throw myself down the stairs before saying ""no"", like in the dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would anyone have an answer to this? I had therapy as a child/teenager and there's nothing wrong with me besides a small bit of autism. Perhaps all of my fears have gone into this, and  my body/mind doesn't know how to cope as I don't have any bar the above mentioned, such as being murdered (and I've been in a couple of situations, about three) etc. 

Maybe someone knowledgeable in the different stages of sleep? I've found that in the periods of my life where REM sleep has been focused on, such as 8 (also tested with 15, 30) minutes of it with less than 30 seconds of open-eyed activity repeated three times before going into a full sleep, or while laying on my back with eyes closed not allowing myself to consciously fall to a sleep, has seen less of this interesting dream. If I could know how this is triggered,  I would enjoy inducing it often to explore a little bit, as it isn't a particularly bad dream that I would wish to avoid.

468,"Hello Reddit, this is my first post after lurking for a while and I just really need to get some perspective on this. 

As the title says, 5 years ago I was raped by a guy in college. He had been my best friend since the first day of college orientation. We had a really strong friend group all 4 years of college and there was definitely some chemistry between us, but we never acted on it since he had been with his girlfriend for several years.

During the last week of university, when all of our exams were done and us seniors were just waiting to graduate, I had a bit too much to drink at a party. I was there with the rest of my friends who had also been drinking. Since we had all been friends since Day 1, they didn’t bat an eye when handing me off to him so he could “take care of me.”

At several points in the night I blacked out which has never happened before. He raped me in his shared apartment with his roommate just next door. 

When I woke up in the morning, my clothes were spread across the room so I tried to pick up everything as quickly as possible and ran out of there. Once I got home and processed what happened I called campus police and eventually got a rape kit done and the police involved. 

After weeks of waiting, the results came back and they found his DNA all over me- even in places I had no idea he had touched. 

A grand jury indicted him on almost a dozen counts of misdemeanor and felony assault charges. 

My attorney advised against going to trial even though the DNA was there (because most of these cases don’t end up going to trial). He said that there was a chance he could walk away with nothing and that we should take a plea deal instead. So, that’s what I did. 

During this time, my friend group kind of split up between everyone who believed him versus me. I was never very close to his girlfriend as she went to college a few states away, so I of course never told her about what happened.

Yesterday I was scrolling though Instagram when I saw some old friends at his wedding...to the girl he was with at the time he raped me. I have feelings that I can’t find the right words for. This girl might have no idea what actually happened that night and what the DNA tests showed at the end.  This is so disgusting to me and I’m really wishing I could go back and make sure I took him to trial. 

I’ve been considering reaching out to local newspapers or even the wife directly. I’m sure there would be repercussions to that but right now I don’t know that I care. My laptop still has all the files saved about my testimony and some of the documents are public record in our town.

469,"So, my cousin hit me up last minute to babysit her kids and their cousins (6 of them from 6:30pm to 1am) because they were going out for her hubby’’s bday. Anyways throughout the night I asked the kids if they were hungry and went to grab food. As I was pulling out because their van blocked me in I scratched the paint off the bumper of their van. I told her and apologised as soon as it happened. 

Her husband’s a bit of a hot head. He started scolding his kids when he got in because of the “mess” that was made, so I just left right after, didn’t say a word to him and just showed my cousin where the van was scratched as I walked out.  I wasn’t sure how to read her reaction but she told me “ 😐You don’t know how to drive.  Get home safe.”

Anyway, I still feel bothered and tense, like I shouldn’t have accepted all the money for babysitting. What was/is the right thing to do? Should I have done something else?",21Apr2019,1

It's still hard to process that it was me who did it.  I don't have any assumptions that we can ever be friends again or if she'll ever talk to me again, but I at least feel like I should try, at least just to apologize. I've seen her a couple of times since, once at school in which she was acting strangely, and once at another party a couple nights ago in which she was acting very meanly. I sent her a long text apology yesterday, which admitted all fault and expressed a good amount of sincere sorrow/shame/regret. She hasn't responded, so I've decided to wait a few days and give her time and space, and then maybe I'll text her again if she doesn't ever respond. Is there anything else I should be doing?

475,"     In December 2017, after i graduated high school, i went to the doctor for sudden weight gain and he saw a lump in my neck and recommended I get it checked. I reluctantly saw a ear, nose, and throat specialist who, after a few tests, told me i had palpilary carcinoma (thyroid cancer). My immediate family lives out of state so i went to my home state to get treated. I had my entire thyroid removed and 10 lymph nodes with it. 7 of those lymph nodes came back as cancerous, so the next step was treatment to kill any remaining thyroid tissue. I was given 30 milicuries (excuse my spelling) of radioactive iodine. 
     So the scan me after treatment and say im all clear. Yay, right? Well i thought so, but i returned home and the same doctor found it again and said it i hadnt had a high enough dose of radioactive iodine... it was still in my lymph nodes. So in January of 2019 i had another surgery to remove 20 lymph nodes in my home town again... it was in 5 of those 20. This time, they didnt put me through any treatment. 
     So here it is, April of 2019 and they think i might have it... STILL. i am currently waiting on results from my 4th biopsy (i had 2 biopsies before my 2nd surgery) and im getting frustrated because i cant seem to get a doctor to scan my chest area. This is an extremely slow growing cancer but they told me it was very advanced when it was dignosed 2 years ago and i want the reassurance that it hasn't gone near my lungs or bones. I know ill hear to get a new doctor, but im on my 4th doctor right now and i like the one i have. Im just getting irritated. Im 20 years old and shouldnt have to be worrying about if i have cancer somewhere no one is looking. To make things better, im a pilot, so every time i get a diagnosis, the FAA doesnt allow me to fly! So i have to put everything on hold until its cleared up. Now i cant fly for a year, since it was ""metastic cancer"" so im just angry. 
     Am I the crazy one here? I feel like this isnt that much to ask of them, really. One scan to put my mind at ease shouldnt be that difficult. Has anyone been through a similar situation and maybe have some advice? Id really appreciate it.",21Apr2019,6

479,"My (21F) team is moving offices in our building at the end of this month. There's two men who will be taking our old office, I'm going to call them Jim and Bob. Jim's in his late 30s and Bob's in his 50s. I see them around a lot. 

2 weeks ago, I accidentally spilled some water in the coffee area, Bob comes in and I apologize to him because I was in his way trying to clean up. He tells me ""Next time you need help filling up your water bottle, call me, I'll help you fill it up"". I thought that was weird but I shrugged it off. He made a few more comments about helping me out or even poking fun at me about the incident over the next few weeks.

Recently, they came into our office to measure tables when Jim starts talking to me about what I do. I told him I was doing an internship and he says ""Oh I didn't realize you were so young, I'm terrible at guessing ages"" when Bob comes along and asks Jim, ""Does she come with the office?"" and Jim replies saying ""You wouldn't get any work done if she did"" and they both start laughing. Then Jim tells me ""Look, Bob's blushing"". 

They had this conversation in front of all 4 of my coworkers who were cringing the whole time. It was incredibly awkward for me and I've never experienced this before. Bob is like my dad's age. I'm not sure how to feel about this, my coworkers almost told my manager but I stopped them mid-way because I need to think about it. I'll be here until the end of August and I don't want to do anything I regret (whether that's taking action or not taking action).

How bad is this? Is it worth telling my manager? I'm very surprised at how nonchalant this conversation was for them but maybe I'm overreacting.",21Apr2019,2
480,"I’ll keep this as short as possible. I’m basically going through a really stressful period in my life and I’m really looking to use this opportunity to increase my resilience to stress, but I don’t know how. In brief, this is what’s happening at the moment.

- Fractured relationship with my ex wife and children. They are all unwell today with a nasty sickness bug and I cannot go over there to help because I take medication every night for my mental health. If I catch the sick bug, I won’t be able to hold down any meds, meaning I will be unwell for 2 weeks plus whilst my body adjusts to having medication back in my system. 

- Ongoing mental health issues. I have bipolar and a personality disorder that are constant thorns in my side. Currently stable on meds but still symptomatic. Low resilience to stress, impulsivity, suicidal thoughts are my main problems.

- 8000 word dissertation due for my nursing degree in 3 weeks. I’ve done 1/4 of it but now I have writers block and limited time. University are offering support but my tutor is away until Tuesday and has limited time to spend with me due to his own workload.

- I work 2 days a week on a psychiatric intensive care unit as a support worker. When I qualify, I will be a registered nurse on the unit. It’s a very frantic environment that I love, but isn’t helpful at times. I need the money I earn from this job to support my daughter financially. There’s also a girl I like at work who I don’t think feels the same way. Trivial, but still hard.

- My ex wife has custody of her nephew, who I consider to be my child. My sister in law, his mother, is currently going for full legal custody of him through the courts, which is putting my ex through hell. She has made it clear she does not want my support of any contact with me as she is still ‘processing the divorce’ and feels ‘totally heartbroken by it all’. I don’t feel the same, I’m over it, but I’m in the unfortunate position of not being able to support her emotionally during this time. Her family is once again fractured by this and it’s a very difficult situation. 

It is all very difficult, and I have kinda bared my soul to you all here.

In Spetemper of the same year, she started hanging out with a guy she and my dad knew for a decade or so. I first thought he just wanted to check in on her, since they haven't talked since his divorce. Then she started leaving earlier for work and wouldn't tell me why, but just left. I asked her if they were dating, to which she blew it off quickly, but in the car ride home, she asked me how long she should wait before she started dating again. I told her a year, just to make sure she's moved on.

4 days later, on the day of my 17th birthday party, she tells me that they were dating. I. Was. Pissed.

Its been almost 6 months since then, and it's gotten worse. She's been staying the night at his house on weekends, ditching our grandma on me and my 6 year old sister,  just to ease her conscious, I guess. The days leading up to Christmas she either spent with him or dragged us with them to do something, even spending MOST of Christmas day with him and his family.

It gets worse, I was close to my grandpa, and when he died in January, she spent that week sleeping at his house INSTEAD OF staying with HER BIOLOIGICAL CHILDREN who lost their dad NOT EVEN A YEAR AGO! 

And she listens to every word he says as if it were the commandments of God himself. He told her that her dad's truck can pull the tractor we have, and she agrees with him and wants to sell my dad's truck. (I did a VIN search of her truck, and showed her where he was wrong, and she yelled at me.)

Ever since i started using the computer at my house i realized smart people don't need a degree to make a living or get an education in the time we live in. School has always been easy for me so of course i stopped trying eventually, and in high school i did just enough work to get a C or D in each.  
Since I didn't try in class, so it was no surprise to my teachers that i didn't waste my time doing any prep for the SAT when i finally decided to take it at the end of senior year. They were surprised when the scores came back and i had a 1500 though, and probably disappointed as well. I was getting pressured to figure out what i wanted to do by the time i graduated and since i ended up getting into the first college i picked off my test score i enrolled.....and i absolutely hate it. Dorm life is great, partying is great, the community is great, but i still feel like school is an absolute waste of my time. I'm failing because i hardly show up to class or do the homework. Many classes are either straight out of a book or a PowerPoint presentation, and i could learn the material faster on my own online.  
I'm *much* more interested in developing my own ideas (tech, programs, products) and business.

i had her on my the whole time, i liked her a lot. in the beginning of march, i sent her a text asking if she still wanted to meet and she answered that of course! that she’s excited. i was happy. two weeks before my trip, we video chatted and we talked about having sex and that we were still attracted to each other. 

during the trip, i finally met her. we talked and laughed. i picked her up from her bus stop at 3am but didn’t do anything. we went to a national park the next day and i kissed her there. during there, she got her period. we went back to the hotel, we rested, we cuddled, i ran my fingers over her body. 

i asked to kiss her and she said i didn’t have to ask.

that day ended chill, we cuddled a bit. 

the next day is where i fucked up. two times throughout the day, (morning and afternoon), i implied i wanted to have sex (even tho i knew she was on her period). idk why i did that. ive beaten myself up for it. 

then she got more distant as the day went on. the next three days, going back to her hometown, she was super distant and felt like she didn’t want me there. i felt really bad.

the last day before i left, i apologized and told her i’m sorry if i made her feel uncomfortable at all. she said that it was her fault too because we talked about doing something and we didn’t. 

and when we said bye, it was an okay bye but i can’t help feel we left on bad terms. not the same care or warmth as before how we used to talk.

it’s been two weeks since i’ve been back from my trip and i feel really bad about it. i feel like i’ve lost a friend? that i made a girl uncomfortable. that kills me as well. double the huge guilt. 

it’s not like me to make people feel uncomfortable. and i didn’t wanna leave her on those kinds of terms. i didn’t wanna just have sex with her. i care about her. but now i feels like we are just two strangers. and that i’m just no one to her. that we won’t go back to how we used to talk and chill.

We are living in Germany so it's questionable if going to court would work. Also we are not living in a flat so theoretically we could build another terrace somewhere else in the garden but let's be honest it's not really an option.
We do have a partition wall but it doesn't help at all.

Please let me know if you guys have serious suggestions. The tip I should do something annoying in revenge doesn't help me and likely they're not gonna die to cancer soon.",21Apr2019,1
512,"The company I work for hired me for a dispatching position and has recently changed my entire job from dispatching to coming into work and jumping in a bucket of tickets which now require me to make calls effectively no longer what I was hired to do. 

I’m sure there might be something in my contract when I was hired and I’m working on getting copies of those documents, but is there anything I can do? I originally applied because it was an office job that had me maybe making 3 phone calls a month to now making around 80 a day, which is what I wanted to get away from. And I also feel robbed of gaining more experience as a dispatcher so suddenly. 

Any advice?",21Apr2019,1
513,"Please bare with me here. I know this may seem like a situation where you think, “go to the police, not Reddit” but I wouldn’t want to make a big deal out of something if I’m overreacting and I just don’t know what to do. I’ve NEVER had any creepy encounters with guys, every guy who’s ever asked me out has been polite and accepting when I’ve declined, so I don’t have any experience with this whatsoever. 

So about 8 months ago I got my first big job. Everyone in the office was friendly right from the start, taking an interest in getting to know me better etc. so I didn’t think anything of this man hanging around my work area a lot. At first. He’s 30 something, a little bit of an odd guy but seemed nice enough. After a couple months of working here there’d be flowers on my desk when I’d come to work. I kept trying to find out who it was to politely tell them that I have a boyfriend, but that the gesture was sweet. Went on for a couple weeks (with flowers literally every day) until I found out it was him so I told him I was in a relationship but that we could be friends. His immediate reply was “you’re just telling me that aren’t you? I know your type” and I was thrown off and confused by his rudeness. After this he took an over-interest in my relationship by asking me a bunch of questions about it. When he asked me “does he satisfy you in bed” I firmly told him that was an inappropriately topic and I’d appreciate it if we could stick to work related conversations. He ignored this and asked me if I’d ever cheat on my boyfriend, and I said absolutely not. Then he replied “I bet you would if I was more attractive because that’s what women do” which made me just walk away from him. After this he ignored me for a while but now when I go to places after work like Target he’ll randomly be at these places too. I’ll literally see him across the store and he’ll wave and come over and talk to me the whole time I’m in there. Which might be a coincidence but after recent events I’m not so sure. So a few weeks ago I was sitting on my front porch with the porch light off (because of bugs) and I saw his vehicle drive by my house. I had absolutely no idea how he even knew where I lived. I knew for a fact that was his car because it’s a very distinct green color and an older vehicle that hardly anyone drives anymore. At this point I felt strange about it out so I call my boyfriend and tell him the situation for the first time and asked him he thought it was weird. He basically tells me off and says I’m just looking for attention, which was very hurtful to me because I’ve never complained to him about this sort of thing, and made me think I’m being stupid. 
But THEN yesterday he shows up at my house in the middle of the day saying that there’s documents he needs to show me from work. I asked him how he knew where I lived because I’m very freaked out at this point, and he said our boss told him to work on this with me so he thought it would be fine if he got my address from my file? Why would he not see my number and text me about it instead?? So I told him that I’m absolutely not comfortable with anyone coming to my house without asking me first and made up a lie about him catching me right when I was leaving and he could ask me about it next week. I left and he followed me out of my neighborhood, onto the highway until I got off on a random exit. I’m not being dramatic am I? Do I go to my boss? I’m having a lot of anxiety over this and it makes me want to not even go to work.",21Apr2019,26

My SO is 25M and 5'11. He weighs about 250, want to get down to around 200 at least. He gains most if his weight because he works nightshift and can't cook. His family struggles with weight, so it's something hereditary.

 Almost everything I have now doesnt fit me, I usually wear the same clothes throughout the week. Most of my weight is in 3 areas, my boobs, my thighs, and my stomach. I'm also starting to develop a bit of a double shin in certain angles. I'm not ugly just fat, people call it the happy relationship weight gain, which is good cause i do love my SO and they love me, but we're both over weight.

So I just need help with developing ideas to get into better habits for him and I. We dont live together, but I don't mind making prepped meals for him to eat through the week. He struggles with exercise and dieting because of his job and his laziness, I struggle with it because of financial reasons and laziness.

517,"Hi reddit! Sorry for the long post. 

On Tuesday the 9th of April I (18F) had a tumor removed from my jaw. Backstory to this is I went to have Xrays to see how serious removing my top wisdom teeth would be, my surgeon saw an abnormality in my bottom right jaw, took more xrays and found a tumor. My wisdom teeth were simple and didn't cause any swelling because they already slotted in, they just caused overcrowding and skewed my teeth so we got them removed.

On the 9th we found out it was much bigger than we thought. It had eroded the top section and parts of the outside section of my jaw bone, getting into the soft tissues of my cheek and gum and had attached to one of my molars. The tumor was removed in one go, and we think all of it was removed. It was apparently 5.5cm(2.17 in) long by 2.5cm (0.99 in) wide/High. There was some nerve damage but I can still move my bottom right part of my lip normally and feel the bottom right side of my face, it's just less sensitive.

I still haven't received my results and I'm kind of nervous. It'll be two weeks next week Tuesday. They said it would take roughly 7-10 days to get my results. Unfortunately with Easter weekend in my country there have been 3 public holidays since my surgery, and weekends aren't considered working days even in our hospitals as far as I'm aware. So it's  only been 8 working days to my understanding.

I don't really know what to expect. My grandmother and aunt have both had cancer (mom's side). I was also experiencing problems with jaw aches and swollen glands near my right jaw for the past year or two, I don't really remember how long ago issues started and I attributed the pain to migraine related facial pain and swollen glands to allergies. Now that it's at least been removed I'm relieved, but I'm also more scared. My home environment isn't the best and has been bad for my mental health. My parents have also just been pushing me off if I ask what if it is the worst, what's the procedure, can I still maintain my lifestyle etc.

My boyfriend (19M) and his family have been great to me in this process. His dad has had all 3 types of skin cancer so they know the stress that comes with biopsies and the wait associated with it and the roller-coaster of the disease. I spend most of this weekend with them, didn't ask about this but they've been understanding, make sure I'm able to eat what they cook and got me tiny easter eggs so I could eat them hassle free. 

Any advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation? Or advice on what happens if it is the worst?

I'm making progress in many areas of my life, enjoying the proccess of everything I do and don't have too many regrets (though I'm still quite young).

So I find myself turning friends' requests (to go out) down beacuse I just feel like being alone and I don't mind that AT ALL.

Anyone that can relate? Anyone that regrets turning the requests to go hang out down in the past and now having no friends and changing their mind about being okay with being alone?

521,"Throwaway account because the situation is kinda awkward and my some of my friends know my reddit account.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this friend that i have, lets name him John. John and I have been friends for almost 2 years now. Up till recently, we have never had any major arguments or issues. However, things started to change. He now thinks i'm gay and is trying to avoid me. 

I personally am a guy that is somewhat touchy but not in a gay way, I would often try to rest my arm on your shoulder when chatting or fiddle with your body fat when there is nothing to do. John used to take my shit quite well and hit me back playfully when annoyed. This usually ends up with us playfully brawling or trying to hit each other in the butt as many times as we can. But then one time I take shit too far and try to actively aim for his dick and his butt instead of the usual body fat. After that one time taking it too far, I would just go for the butt a lot more than usual. At the start, he still took my butt hits quite well but then the situation deteriorated. He started avoiding touchy times with me. I would try to go for the normal body fat squeeze and he would just push my hand away. I would try to rest my arm on his shoulder when chatting and he would just shrug my arm off. I asked him whats wrong and he just said that he thinks i'm gay and doesn't want me to touch him. He however, is still fine with getting touchy with others, just not me. So the issue is him thinking that i'm gay for him and not something else. I tried explaining and proving to him that i'm not gay but no, he just wouldn't listen. Now, I cant go for any bro hugs or any friendly gestures that involves touching. That would only further worsen the situation. Whenever we walk together and our hands accidentally touch, he would think that i did it intentionally and tell me off. Other than that, our relationship is still quite normal but he just thinks i'm gay and would avoid contact with me unless necessary. However, it is starting to hurt our relationship as good friends so i need to clear this misunderstanding fast.

Another factor that acted as a catalyst to this situation might be because I refuse to get a girlfriend. John and I are both 16 and he is the polar opposite of me in terms of scoring with girls. He would slip into some girls dms and hope for a relationship while i never do that. I think that that type of relationship will never last long and want to mature more before looking for a serious relationship. Besides, i'm not really that hot and is somewhat shy. So i'm pretty sure i cant get a girl even if I tried. Still, I would listen to John and his girl problems and would give advice. He would agree with me and some times my advice even helps him out. Despite that, i think he only looks at the negative side, which is me not getting a girlfriend and somehow assuming that i'm not into girls?

Lastly, no, i really am not gay. I ran that idea through my small brain and concluded that i'm not gay. Tits and asses are too good to give up. And no, i cant leave John because we literally take the same classes and play the same games together. We see each other 6+ hours a day on a daily basis. I just need a way to convince him that i'm in fact, not gay.",21Apr2019,0
522,"Hi.

I tried posting on relationship_advice but got one response that gave no advice at all. So I figured it can't hurt to try here too. I'm honestly terrified as posting to the internet scares the living daylights outta me, but I'm absolutely desperate for advice so... Here goes. 

I read the rules but I'm sorry if I miss anything. Let me know if I mess up.

English is my first language but I'm on mobile and also currently on narcotics from surgery and have been bawling so, my spelling and Grammer is going to suck. I'm sorry in advance.

Some revelent info:
I'm in college. I'm 23. 5th year. I have two majors (hence 5 years) and am graduating SUMMA in May. I worked and still do work my ASS off for my grades.

My mother had always been crazy about my grades. An A is acceptable. A-, end of the world. B, time to be disowned.

This semester has been horrible. Not because of the school, but because for the past 8 months I had been mysteriously and DANGEROUSLY sick.

I mean, going to the hospital every other weekend and getting ADMITTED with massive infections with an unknown cause kinda sick.

On the 3rd of April I almost went into spetic shock and DIED.

This Wednesday (17th) I was rushed to the er and given emergency surgery to remove my appendix and explore around inside my stomach to try and figure out wtf else is going on.

Other genetic disorders that cause lots of PAIN were found. One that's relievent in this post being Endometriosis.

I have, as one can imagine, been having trouble with keeping my grades 'perfect' because of this sickness. I currently have two ABs and two As for my classes even with everything.

However, this surgery is putting me behind. It's the end of the semester and thus everything is coming due. I have 3 essays due next week, a project coming up, and a poster and other smaller project for another class. The 3 essays are my largest concern at the moment.

My teachers are generally understanding, and coming in with stitches holding together your stomach is generally a good way to get instant sympathy and extensions. So I'm not worried about getting the time I need. They know I will do it and I will do it to the best standards that I can.

My mother though , does not seem to understand this.

Currently I am in a SHIT TON of pain. My period started and I'm 3 days out of surgery. I have Endometriosis. You can imagine that the pain of that with the pain of surgery healing is some next level bullshit. I only have 7 pain pills (thanks opiod epidemic for making me doomed to pain in like 2 days xP) left and they only last me 4 hrs at best before the pain comes back.

Yesterday it was so bad I actually passed out in my bathroom until my dad checked on me. I literally thought I was going to die. That's how painful it was.

Mentally I am exhausted. I've been sick for 8 months and haven't been sleeping more then 4hrs every night because of said sickness.

Now with this pain ontop of it AND anxiety about running out of painkillers and being stuck in this pain forever us making this ever worse and making focusing on school work next to impossible. I'm also still sore af even on narcotics.

My mother keeps BADGERING ME about schoolwork. Asking if I've done it. Asking if I'm falling behind.

I told her I'm probably going to not go to classes on Monday because I'm not even allowed to lift my fucking backpack! She lost her shit.

She's convinced that if I miss classes without a Dr's excuse for that Monday I'm going to fail all my finals and my teachers will expell me and a bunch of other such bullshit.

She's stressing me to do my work as if I'm NOT sick and literally 2 days outta surgery while also on my PERIOD FROM HELL and barely existing by using painkillers.

This is just making me absolutely crumble. I can't stop crying and am convinced I'm going to DESTROY my GPA and future, all because I got fucking sick and wasn't able to be a God dam mechine like I'm supposed too and do all my work while sick, held together by staples, and hopped up on opiods.

Forgot to say: I am ALREADY WORKING WITH TEACHERS TO GET EXTENSIONS! And they KNOW about me being sick. I notified them when it started getting very bad after the first month of the semester. I'm  working with the dean of students to make sure I cna graduate, I don't know what else I could even do to make things better or something? Like I think I'm literally doing everything I possibly can to make sure this doesn't change anything and I graduate on time, with my summa status, and without dying because I pushed myself too hard? 

So I guess in the end I have 2 questions.

1) Am I insane? Am I really this lazy fuck who should just suck it up and deal with it? Because I really feel like it.

And 2) if I'm not insane, HOW on earth do I fell my OBSESSED with grades and mtabsoloute perfection mother to FUCK OFF without her loosing her shit? (she has Borderline personality disorder... It's... A chore at the best of times.)

I'm really exhausted and don't have the energy to keep fighting and being so stressed all the time....

Sorry if this seems I dunno... I just... Don't know what to do anymore.... I'm so tired.

Thanks in advance to anyone who says anything. I really appreciate ant advice I could get by now.... 

TL:DR: I've been sick 8 months. Just had hopefully life saving surgery. Mother is pushing me hard to continue to do work as if I'm 100% healthy. It's breaking me and making me believe I'm actually a lazy fuck. Question is, am I? And how do I get her borderline personality disorder ass off me without her loosing her shit and making me wish I'd never brought it up?",21Apr2019,1

now anyways, i'll start

so, we've had a total of 3 dogs, of whom, 2 we gave away/donated due to many different reasons, most of the dogs wouldnt last a month but a few weeks

by the third one, Cotton, he was special

we actually kept him for a good 2-3 months, he was a very cute poodle, very social and fun, but recently, he got away, and never came back, and we got the news that someone is keeping him and doesnt want to give it back.

(i know that this is sort of a jerk move, but we also heard that this was a place with many kids who would enjoy his company more than I and my mom do)

now anyways, my mom misses him the most, and claims she never really wants any pet again, but I do, I want a pet for emotional support, to take care of him and to have a friend, and there is kne pet I always saw ""cute"" videos about, and they are; cats.

I've never had one and back and forth I always saw pics of my friends with theirs, snuggled with them and cuddling, and my mom believes they are dirty animals who will pee the whole house (since her friend has one and she doesnt give him a sandbox ofc he will)

We talked a lot in the beginning then she just slowly got distant from me. I ended up not sending her messages because she would just leave me on read on Snapchat and I figured that it was kind of a hint that she was as into me as she thought. So I eventually just got rid of  her on Snapchat because I felt like I was anticipating a snap from her that would never come. Then like 2 weeks after I unadded her she sent me a message angry that I got rid of her on Snapchat. I was pretty honest and told her that it felt like it was going now where and she gave me some crap about how she knew that we were both busy (both work and go to school full time) but that didn’t mean nothing was going to happen. Anyways I ended up caving and adding her and then the same thing happened. But she got me hooked I felt like I was obsessing over getting messages from her and like last time they would never come. So I deleted her again and then ended up adding her back ( cause I couldn’t stop thinking about her). Eventually we finally we on a date and it felt like it went awesome! I made her laugh so much the whole time. I felt like I was invincible. Then she ended up ghosting me after we talked a little after that date. Then tonight she responded to one of my stories and started talking to me. I thought nothing of it I felt like I finally had gotten her off my mind and I wasn’t going to bother with her. When I was at a party I ended up posting a picture of me and my friend driving home. And within minutes she sent me a message telling me how my friend was hot and asking for his number.

534,"I (23F) had an ex (31M) we dated for about 2 months before he got overly obsessive with me. Broke up January of 2018.

To start from the beginning, we met at work and he was charming, a gentleman, would go out of his way to do things for me. And slowly I did start to fall for him. When we officially began dating, he became possessive. Would beat up guys at work who would talk to me, would go confront his boss if the boss came and asked me about something and would get angry at me if I needed something from his boss. He turned my friends from work away from me because he didn't like how they acted supposedly and lied about how one particular guy was stalking me home (even tho he lived an hour away in the other direction). And I was iffy about it but at the time I was still believing there is a gentleman in him like when we were initially dating.

He began to cry when I had to be away from him like if I had to go home to attend to my pup who he didn't let in his house. He started to make me feel guilty when I would leave. He told me bs stories about how I was the love of his life and I was everything he needed. He would buy me expensive things whenever I wanted and gave me his CC. Bragged about how his family are multimillionaires in the UAE and said how shit all my jewellery are because they weren't all 24K gold. And slowly he became abusive. He would get angry sometimes and hit me in the car while I was driving and then when I get angry he would cry and say that he was just pretending and go to sleep and wake up talking to me like nothing ever happened.

Then he asked me to marry him because he said in Islam, there is no dating phase in relationships and he was already sinning. I said it's a bit too soon (was only 1.5 months at this point). He then manipulated me to believe that I knew exactly what his intentions are, which was that he would provide everything and I wouldn't have to lift a finger. Anyways, so something in me said to not do it and so I didn't. And he got upset.

A couple weeks later we had argument after argument, I didn't reply to him straight away after his texts so he would give me a tonne of missed calls. Interrogate me as to why I wasn't replying to him, with him knowing I am at work. Accusing me of cheating on him when I wasn't but still made me feel bad. And then he would say stuff like ""if you weren't cheating on me then prove it, just marry me down at city hall."" It went really toxic and he started calling me names like dickhead, asshole, bitch because I wouldn't marry him at that moment. After a while it occurred to me that if I had married him, he would have a citizenship after struggling to get one for over 12 years. I ended it over the phone one day after a massive argument about how possessive he was and told him not to talk to me. He messaged me on other social media networks and I blocked him. If he tried to rock up at my house again I would have filed for a restraining order against him but he didn't. However, I was still terrified of him.

tl;dr

Anyways, just today I saw that my ex married someone after being with her for 6 months. I was stalking his Facebook on my friends account and I'm pretty sure he was just trying to get a citizenship out of her and knowing how abusive and shit he is, I almost want to warn her about him or just give her a heads up. He was really good at playing games but IDK. Should I be interfering or should I just leave them be?",21Apr2019,1

537,"I'm a 35 year old gay male, lived away from my family and my home town since I was 19. I've lived in 8 cities in 4 countries and have a successful career. I am from northern England but currently live in Berlin.

I have several health issues which I don't discuss with my employer etc or people in the real world and schedule appointments around work bipolar being one of them. I used to be so outgoing and had lots of friends but bipolar combined with repeatedly moving cities and countries has meant it has slowly isolated me more and more. 

I've thought about moving back I actually tried last year but couldn't get a job my career is very specific and doesn't exist in my home town and my cv doesn't translate to the local job market. I left out of frustration to live abroad again when I couldn't stop my parents enabling my brother and I couldn't get him in drug treatment so didn't want to be around to witness it.

Since then he died of a heart attack age 36 at christmas he had 3 kids and a wife. 

I feel like I want to move back and be close to my family since my brother died  and I think having people around me will be good for me. But it'll mean I'll lose my career and nobody in my hometown will probably hire me as they'll wonder why I want to work there and think I'll leave. I do own a house I rent out in the Netherlands but that only brings in 600 a month after my morgage so not something I could live off and would have to live with my parents.

538,"This is serious. I had a really messed up childhood and my parents aren’t good people. I’m seeing a therapist and a lot of repressed memories are coming back to me. I “blanked” out most of my early memories from 12 years old and back, now that I’m able to talk to someone it has been coming back to me and it’s weird? My therapist thinks my parents are psychotic and are hiding something terrible from me and I should stay away from them. I think I’m just telling her too many things? I feel like I messed up. I don’t want anything bad to happen to my family. 

Tell me if this is completely terrible. When I was younger (before 9) my parents use to lock me in a room (my brothers use to stay at their moms house besides one day a week) so I was usually alone. It was their bedroom that had a TV and some soda and a snack and I would be in their all day long. I would watch whatever TV and movie shows I wanted. From morning til dinner. Then I’d come out take a shower and go to my room. But I’d be really hyper and not sleep. Some days I’d go outside for hours instead of being in that room but usually my days consisted of being in their bedroom, with no explanation. It didn’t seem weird to me I never asked why I was in their i just did it. Now I feel like wtf why did I just do it what was going on. I know they did drugs a lot during that time period but I never really had issues while I was in their room. I think they did it to protect me? I went to school during my childhood this was just days during the summer I am referring to and the weekends. After school I would go to an after school program and then go home, eat dinner, shower, watch a TV show and go to bed. I don’t think this is that odd.",21Apr2019,0
539,"As the title says really. 

I try to be a good friend and good person in general. I don’t like to see others struggling and when someone asks for help, I do my best to help them out, not by telling them what to do necessarily, but by helping them to solve the problem themselves. 

However, for a few weeks now, I’ve been having a bit of a problem myself and the few people I’ve reached out to about it have offered absolutely nothing. And I don’t mean they haven’t said anything helpful, I mean they didn’t say anything. At. All... 

I’m not expecting a miracle or some perfect solution to just land in my lap, but I thought the whole idea of having friends is to be able to talk to them when you need to and they offer at least some words of support or encouragement?

I have literally nobody to talk to about this problem. Before it gets suggested, I won’t see a therapist because it’s not that kind of problem...

545," This is actually the reason I joined reddit, I feel so brought down by my own parents and often feel they did a very bad job at raising me and my brother. My father works abroad and I only get to see him for a few months per year, and when he is present he tries to fix everything only to leave when things start to get better. Moreover, he is the only ""real"" breadwinner of the family, and by family I also mean extended family. His family of 4, his sister's family of 5, his parents, and his aunt all live off of his income combined with the money they are able to bring in. We all live in the same building and it's easy to compare our homes since its the same space furnished differently. My family lives in a mostly unfurnished place with cracked tiles, broken hinges and door handles, cheap handed down sofas, lots of bugs and ants... The other families live in fully furnished and functional homes and would fix anything that would break as soon as possible. I'm envious that my cousins get to have both parents present, a nice and clean home, and a full time maid while I live in a dump with one parent.

&amp;#x200B;

 My mother is where the sh\*\* show starts. She always does the bare minimum when it comes to preparing food, doing the laundry, getting the groceries... and she always reminds us of how tough her life is and how hard the things we ask of her are (i.e. basic human necessities) and she thinks we are ungrateful. She is **very** vocal about how she wishes her life had turned out differently and how she dislikes taking care of us. Me and my brother are very unproblematic and behaved and have never given her a reason to think we were bad children. Whenever one of us gets sick she gets angry and starts rambling about how we added another worry to her long list of problems. She can turn any minor mishap into a dramatic situation and keep bringing it up for weeks as if it were the end of the world. She is a part-time teacher and always comes home tired and drained. Many (including my father) have urged her to quit since she has more than she can handle on her plate, but she insists that money is tight and that she has to keep the job. She is very anxious when it comes to her or our health. She has hypertension and has woken me up countless times in the middle of the night to take her to the pharmacy where she would be told to relax and given something to calm her down. She is also in premenopause. She is also very paranoid when it comes to my fathers family who live in the same building as us and feels as if they want to harm her when in reality they don't really care. I try to empathize, but her constant nagging and dramatizing every single event in her life make it really difficult to deal with her.

&amp;#x200B;

 Neither has ever really paid close attention to me or my brother. Never helped us with studying or when we had problems with our friends... It's like they fed, clothed, and sent us to school and avoided guiding us or taking interest in our personal lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm 19 and my brother is 15, I feel like as soon as I get my degree and find a job, I'm going to bail and leave town. I really resent my parents and will never be over the emotional neglect and stress they have put me through.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't want to sound ungrateful. I truly appreciate everything that I have and consider myself lucky for all the things that were provided to me by my parents and I truly love and cherish every single member of my family.

546,"Hey reddit, it's ya boi, /u/SirCasm_3 . I've got quite the tale for you, so sit back for this one. 

TL;DR to begin with: my roommate is acting *very* strangely and writing cryptic messages on flashcards detailing what seems to be a frighteningly toxic relationship. 

Ok, background info: I'm 21, he's 20, we're about to finish a year of college as roommates. We both play cello, and that's where most of our connections come from. I originally met him back in 2011 at a summer music camp, where we became somewhat good friends. We lived about 20 minutes away from each other during the school year. I'd see him from time to time over the next few years, at camp, at an orchestra training thing for kids, etc. 2 years-ish ago he decided on the college I'm currently attending, and we've been obviously spending more time together since then. 

Other info that's probably important: he's weird. Like, *really* weird. He has a crippling stutter to the point where it can take him 15-20 seconds to say a single word, which I'm guessing (I'm no psychologist) has led to a bunch of other issues, social ineptitude the foremost amongst them. I'm far from perfect in that regard, also have crippling social anxiety, but not to the same degree as him. As roommates we've settled into a ritual of sorts where I'm always the one who goes to sleep first, and as I'm lying in bed either reading or trying to sleep, he's incoherently mumbling/whispering to himself, somehow without a stutter, and I've always thought that I'm gonna get stabbed in my sleep or something. 

We had some issues last term where he would spend a considerable amount of time masturbating in the same room as me... at 4AM, every night, and he wasn't subtle about it, though every time I'd turn over or briefly wake up he'd stop. There were some nights where I'd wake up to the sounds of him waxing the dolphin and not be able to get back to sleep until 7, which then started to kill my performance in classes and grades the following day(s). This has kinda gone down in frequency lately, but every once in a while I'll wake up to the same shit. Maybe I'm just getting better at sleeping through it, I don't know. 

Now we're about caught up and can get into the recent events. Last night, I came back from dinner around 11, and he was super jumpy when I came in- he started frantically throwing some things into his desk and turning his laptop away from me. I thought ""ok, probably just caught him fapping accidentally"" and I gave him some space to adjust by immediately heading out again for a minute or so before settling back at my desk with a beer. That's when I noticed him writing on cards while frantically covering it up from me. I originally thought he was doing homework or something, but what homework (on a saturday night, no less) is important enough to care that deeply about preventing your roommate from seeing?

This went on for an hour or so before I decided to go to sleep, and headed to bed. As he always does, he left for a few minutes to brush his teeth in the bathroom down the hall. I was getting *really* concerned at this point, so I did something that probably crossed a few boundaries, and got up to read what was on the cards, and well... it's pretty fucking terrifying. I only had a few minutes then, didn't want to get caught snooping, but I got an opportunity today to go back over what I saw and take some pictures. Disclaimer: my hands were shaking really badly while reading what's on the cards, so some pictures are super blurry, but here's a dump of everything:

https://imgur.com/a/MXecZGp

Some of these cards are in quotes, so maybe not necessarily his words- maybe he's quoting this other person- but lots of it is really fucking scary. Highlights include:

- “If you don’t pay attention to me you are a selfish and hateful human being”, 

- “your other activities can wait because I am more important”, 

- “under your parents I am the most important person to you even though we have only talked through facebook- say yes or you will be a bad friend!” 

- ""you are a terrible friend because you are friends with other people"" (seriously, what the fuck), 

- and then multiple, *intense* confessions of love for this person, or vice versa. 

Whatever's happening, it seems incredibly toxic, possessive, and dangerous. One card in particular seems to refer to me, which freaks me out even more: ""He just sits in his room and rages, but I can no longer handle it"". I think this has something to do with my recent behavior over the weekends- I've just turned 21 and I'm taking advantage of that fact by getting drunk from time to time, hence the ""raging"" thing- but I don't exactly have friends to get drunk with, so I'm just watching netflix in my room and taking advantage of my lowered standards to do some drunk swiping on tinder. The reason for typing all this, though, is that I want to help out this guy. Despite the fact that he's really weird, despite that I know I don't wanna room with him next year, shit, he's still my friend, and i don't want him to kill himself or anything. And these cards are seeming more and more like suicide notes.

So, reddit, the question is: what the fuck do I do now?? As soon as I finish typing this, I'm planning to call campus safety about it so that someone professional talks to him ASAP- can't wait until tomorrow when the counseling hours open. I've also talked to my sister about this and she recommended that I ask my dad about what to do, which I will. I'll also go in to counseling tomorrow to see if there's anything I can/should do. But I don't want to confront him directly since I have no idea if that would make the situation better or worse. Any ideas?",21Apr2019,5

550,"~20 years of experience, so post is quite long. TL;DR @end.

I have always been the emotionally stable, capable of letting-go person, in all my relationships, untill 3years back. That was when I had a meltdown, and since then I have been a nervous, anxious, depressed mess. Reasons for the meltdown:

- Most of my childhood memories are my very OCD-struck mom locking herself in the room after having told she will hang herself/swallowing sleeping pills or leaving the house in the middle of the night and my dad/elder sister trying to stop her/break the door/going out to search for her. Dad poured his money and energy into trying to make her better and get her the best help that was possible at that time in that place. But lack of awareness about mental health was most often the reason why my mom hasnt fully healed yet. Sis tried to shield me from all the loud fights and quarrels. Obviously this had a still-lasting effect on her, since she was a preteen when it started (stemmed from post partum depression after I was born)

- cut to 20years later, sister and her fiance (F) were sort of pressurised into getting married by my parents against their wishes (F just moved back home, was setting up his business) after continuous emotional blackmail, very very harsh and rude behaviour from both parents and sister towards each other. I have always been the agony aunt for both, and I will never stop feeling like there is probably something I haven't yet tried to make it amicable between them.

- out of 11 years of my relationship with my partner (P), lovely human being, 8 years have been long distance. Sometimes in the same country, sometimes different. We waited, and waited some more and now we are almost 30, and we have never had sex. We sext and have phone sex sometimes, but P being in another timezone exactly 12hrs behind and pursuing their PhD means we see each other once a year or less, make out for 1hour or less per year, have almost nothing in common to talk about, and exchange maybe 4-5 texts a day max. I still love P. Which is why I don't have any excuse for:

- making out with my college friend. It was pure lust, no feelings, did it maybe for 6-7months continuously, but the extent was the occasional blow job. Felt pathetic everytime, college friend developed feelings for me that they got very possessive about, almost to the level of a maniac when I wanted to stop having realised that I am not helping them calm down by making out, but fuelling the fire. After LOT of tears and quarrels and denials, they haven't moved on completely, but is now at a point of getting married next year.

- have had IBS since childhood, multiplied with all this stress, started hating my body because nothing fit. Wasn't rich enough to buy new clothes every 2months. Started a new job out of college where I was good at my work, but human interactions were extremely difficult due to anxiety. Stress-ate so much that I gained over 65 pounds in 2yrs. I am now obese and prediabetic.

I finally brokedown one day, and that day onwards, I have almost no tolerance of stress. Minor things freak me out. Somedays are so bad I can't get out of bed. Since I live away from family, I hid it from them by acting over phone, continuing to listen to their complaints about each other and crying myself to sleep as to why its impossible to have just a normal boring family. Guilt about making out with friend crops up now and then, I will tell P, but I know it will hurt them, and their feelings are more important than me feeling absolved. I act happy most times, because they are too far away from me and my daily life to understand my issues, let alone know how to solve them. But it just makes P miserable when they can't help me. So most times I don't tell them. 

And I am starting to think I dwell in misery. Can't explain it.

TL;DR (why didn't you read though?): Extreme fights between parents and sister, health condition, sexual frustration, guilt of making out with friend behind partners back drove me into depression and crippling anxiety, I am now obese, prediabetic and have no one to be vulnerable in front of.",21Apr2019,1

Not just this, but he always had little issues with himself, his self esteem. It has become unbearable to him now. All those inferiority complex feelings have amplified and he has stopped enjoying life at all. When I tell him that I love him, he says that he doesn't deserve to be loved. He doesn't deserve a good family or me, he doesn't deserve good education, his health is declining, etc. He can't make a good conversation anymore for more than 2 minutes and has distanced himself from all his friends and family.

Back in highschool, when I was 14, and a freshman, I had a group of about 15-20 friends. We were great guys always hanging out and would always flirt with girls blah blah blah. We made a group chat with each other and as always with young teenage boys it was a lot of sexual shit on there about girls. Well one time this kid sent a picture of his girl naked in the group chat and we were all like ohhh shit! And we flipped out because we never saw boobs before. So fast forward a few months, my friend had his phone on the couch, and my other friend and I decided to fuck around with his phone and take selfies of our balls. 

It turns out there were nudes on there, of his girlfriend. He came back from the bathroom and saw that we looked at them because we didn’t clear the page because we were 14 and completely stupid. He got so pissed that he kicked us out rightfully so. He was absolutely correct and I was a stupid kid and I didn’t really understand how messed up that was. Seriously I’m so sorry for it. I ended up leaving that friend group and making new friends because he told everyone that my friend and I were creeps and all that. So I just found new friends and moved on. I tried apologizing but he never accepted the apology.

However, in the last 7 years that this has happened, he has spread so many rumors about me that aren’t true and he said that I told people I fucked his girlfriend when I never did that. He threatened to kill me and beat me up for the last 5 years until I blocked his number. So just the other day, about 3 days ago to be exact, he texts me from a random number. I didn’t know it was him but when I realized I told him to just leave me alone. He then said that he hopes I don’t see him because he still thinks about me and wants to beat me to a pulp. He literally said this 7 years after it happened after I repeatedly apologized and didn’t want anything to do with him. He doesn’t even have that girlfriend anymore and I don’t even talk to anyone from my hometown. I don’t k ow what to do he said he wants to find me.",21Apr2019,1
560,"I have an AA in psychology and transferred to a state school in my first semester I kept getting asked what did I want to do with my degree and I didn't know how to answer that. the first semester was a bit brutal as I kept going despite hating the commute to campus and not liking my classes.

 in my second (current) semester, I switched my major to broadcasting and electronic communications thinking that maybe this would be a better fit for me seeing as how I've always been interested in writing for tv. I've noticed so far that the professors in this department are super hard or super relaxed with things. a lot of the time they fall off their own schedule and rush things towards the end or don't give out directions to what they want. 

I'm 5k in debt because I had to take out a loan as I was originally planning on living on campus before things worked out and I ended up moving 2 hrs away from campus.

I just looked at classes that I would need to take next semester but none of them interest me at all. I'm starting to realize that my department is dated and a lot of the information we are being given doesn't work in our current state of the entertainment industry. when I switched my major I imagined that classes would focus more on things like Youtube (i.e how to develop a series) because on day 1 all of my profs said this major is about learning how to tell stories. instead, we have classes that teach us how to write ads for radio taught by bad professors who expect perfection even though we are rookies.

562,"   So my credit is anywhere from 0 to bad. Both my parents credit is nothing to brag about, so Idk if they're the people I should seek advice from. If you don't wanna know WHY I owe, you can skip the back story. My question is at the bottom.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Backstory: About 5 years ago, I had Comcast for my internet provider. After a while, I couldn't afford internet, so I stopped paying. Fee months later after I got out of a financial hole, I wanted to have internet again. Called Comcast up, get an automated voice recording. It ask for my last name and last 4 digits of phone number to confirm it's me. Everything sounds about right, so I say yes. Last I checked, I owed Comcast about $100, so I'm SHOCKED when the voice tells me I owe $500 to activate my account. Reluctantly pay it off in 2 payments, wait for internet guy to come install modem, never showed up. Call Comcast again, this time I ask to speak to a human. Human tells me I still owe $100. Now I'm furious, because where TF did the $500 go? Not to my account apparently. Apparently I paid some OTHER guys who shared my last name and the last 4 digits of my number. They gave me 1 of my payments of $250 back. But when I told them about the other half, they didn't believe me. 8 months of jumping through hoops just to get my money back. After I finally get it, they send my a huge bill to cover the ""late fee"". But I told them I wasn't paying a dime until I get my money back. So I told them keep the money and cancel my service. Now I owe them $140 to this day. 

----‐--------------------------------------------------------------

The $140 is only hurting me, so I want to finally get that bad mark off my score and finally be able to get a credit card to establish more credit. My question is how do I go about it. Do I call Comcast to pay it off? Do I call the Credit Bureau to change my score? Both?  And how long before I start to see an improvement on my score?",21Apr2019,0

I don’t even know where to start but basically I’m feeling quite sad. Also, I’m sorry if this should’ve been posted on a different subreddit, I didn’t really know where to post this 

Yesterday me and my girlfriend decided to go on a break and since then I’ve pretty much been constantly crying, I haven’t eaten and I feel like I can’t leave my bed. She’s still my best friend, we still talk and no one else knows about this so it’s not like I’m never going to see her ever again but maybe this is almost worse because she’s so close to me and every time I text her or see her I think about that I can’t kiss her or fall asleep with her next to me anymore. I love her so much. (Also just to clarify, for reasons that are too complicated to explain, I will still have to see her every day). 

She is also the only person that I’m actually close to or feel comfortable talking to about my problems so i don’t have any friends to talk to about this. 

On top of that, I’ve got depression and this whole situation is making it a lot worse. I want to cut myself so badly but I know that she would be disappointed and I feel like the only good thing in my life has been taken away from me so i don’t really want to live anymore (I’m not actually going to kill myself but I just don’t want to live anymore)

All i want is for her to hug me and tell me that it’s going to be okay. Usually I’d always talk to her when I feel like hurting myself but I don’t want to do that now because I’m afraid that it would come off as me emotionally manipulating her by saying that I’m suicidal so that she’ll take me back.

Since I moved here, I have been seeing my girlfriend about 4 days out of the week. I've been here for 3 weeks so far.

But.. when she's NOT around.. I feel so.. depressingly alone.

I grew up in NYC and all my friends and family are there. I never moved anywhere else before.

Now that I'm in a whole different city, I have no friends or family here so when she's busy with other things... I just get really sad and depressed.

I have a ton of hobbies at home and I have been slowly adding that to my schedule here and it helps a little. I took the advice of going to meetups and i've been to 6-7 but honestly..... I haven't had good experiences.... meetup people have been a little... strange. I need other avenues of meeting people.

570,"As a quick background, this group of friends were my second family, we told each other everything. I grew up with these people and have known them since the start of high school. We all fitted together so perfectly and treated each other like a second family and we spent every day together. We always looked out for each other, they were my best friends.

Long story short, by the end of high school we started experimenting with alcohol and weed just as a laugh, but overtime it started to become more accustomed to us and we treated it as a norm. As we expanded our social circle, we started getting into harder drugs. I eventually realized that this was not a path that i wanted to go down. I was getting sick of the life we had led ourselves into, every weekend was either a come down from the night before or a high.

I was holding onto the idea that what we were doing was just temporary, as that's what we told ourselves, that we were just experimenting and we would eventually give it up to focus on the future of our lives, but one day, one my mates from the group got arrested for carrying drugs. This was when i really woke up and realized how bad it had gotten, but it seemed that none of my other mates did. We continued our drug usage like nothing ever happened and luckily enough, our friend got past the charges, and served his time at a probation center.

I knew that i needed to get off this path, i was becoming an addict and my mental health was extremely suffering, getting worse by the day. I lost my girlfriend, I was failing at school and my personality massively dulled down, my family didn't recognize the person i had become. So, a few months later, i decided to block all contact without any explanation and deleted all of my social media. They called my family and asked about me, if i was okay etc. They found any way to message me to see if i was okay, even reaching out to my ex to call my phone and contact my parents. I ignored the messages, until three months later they managed to get past my attempts at blocking them and i wrote them a message back saying that they should stop contacting me because i was never coming back.

I'm now 20 years old, and this happened about three years ago (last contact was 2 years 8 months ago to be exact) and I still think about them often, sometimes every day. I miss them, some days more than others. I spent the last two years getting into university with my eyes now set on a career and have improved my mental health and i'm a lot more lively than i was, I quit smoking and only started drinking alcohol again since joining University. I haven't made many new friends, in fact, i spent the first year completely alone. I reactivated my social media accounts a few months ago, and immediately searched their names. The group are still together, and it seems from speculation that each persons drug usage has dropped in intensity. Some of them still smoke weed and drink. (there were 6 of us in total)

I have been debating whether or not to message them and see how they are doing, but i feel that i may be completely out of place to do that due to how long i have left it and i imagine they still hold a bad grudge against me for leaving like i did. I am not the same person i was three years ago, and I believe that if i saw them in person they may not recognize the person I've become. I don't know what to do, so i ask for some non biased opinions and would be grateful for a response.

I do completely regret the way I handled the break up. These people were my brothers and I left like they were nothing to me and I believe that's the impression that i left them with. I didn't give them the chance to ask questions and i didn't give them an explanation. I just all of a sudden left them. I regret the way that i handled it, I regret making it clear that i'd never be coming back, I regret handling it in the worst possible way. I didn't know what else to do, i was 17 and at the lowest point of my life.

Do i contact them, or do i work on leaving it behind?

Thank you.",21Apr2019,14
572,"A little backstory,

My father and I have an abusive history. Most of my friends think he’s an asshole and a terrible parent. Now that I have moved out (19f) our relationship has become less toxic.

For years our biggest issue was trust. Due to the abuse and other issues, I have severe depression and would self harm. I would tell the school and not my father because he would get angry at me and that is not what I needed at the time. I understand now his anger was out of concern, but I was a suicidal kid who needed support and he wasn’t there. 

My father has done many fucked up things but most recently he took a family trip to my favorite place (Disney) without me. Mind you, I was in college but I still would have appreciated being asked instead of just being notified not to come home because they were leaving.

After talking with friends, I decided to tell him that his decision upset me and made me feel left out. He responded in a negitive way saying how I don’t think about his feelings and that it wasn’t a big deal. (Yet he doesn’t understand that I’m scared to talk to him when he brushes off my feelings like this?)

Back to now,
I am in college. My father is paying for it minus my scholarships. I did not ask him to pay in fact asked him not to. I do work two jobs but do not have the money to afford college. I also do not have enough money to get my own apartment.

I told my father I wanted to get an apartment rather than dorm because it will save him thousands. (My father’s house is also three hours away so I cannot commute.) He agreed so I have been sending him apartments. I asked him today if he expects me to buy my own furniture. He said yes- which is fine. I do not have the money for it but I will work it out. I’m scared he will ask for me to pay for the apartment which will be terrible for me in these ways:
1. I would be in a dangerous city homeless as I cannot afford an apartment
2. I assumed because we talked about it and he has paid for my dorming that me moving would be a win for him because he’ll be saving money. (Note: if I stayed in the dorms he would still pay for it so if he refuses to pay a lesser amount I don’t understand why.)
3. I applied for dorms as a backup but I am at the end of the waiting list so I most likely will not get housing.

I am so grateful he’s paying for me, but I’m nervous to have this conversation in case it turns badly like the Disney conversation and I will be homeless. How do I discuss asking my father to pay rent with him? (Also sidenote: he has been making fun of me for being upset with Disney and I don’t want to be made fun of for this as well.) i",21Apr2019,1
573,"I went on this date with a total douchebag (I'm going to call him D) like back in December, and apparently, it was like two weeks after he broke up with his girlfriend, who was a really sweet person. I felt kinda bad about it, but I thought it was probably okay. I didn't talk to my friends about it much because I knew they didn't really like him, so I talked to my other friend (I'm gonna call her K) who isn't in my friend group, but we're friends still, and she's friends with the guy. But, my friend (Z) was dating a good friend of D and found out that we were going out, so she texted me about it, and I was like, yeah, whatever. Like a week after I went on the date, K told me that D didn't want to go out with me anymore, which in my opinion is kind of a weak way to ghost someone, but I wasn't that invested so it wasn't that bad. After that, I was hanging out with Z and she was like, D is not good enough for you, he's a stoner and a terrible person and you deserve better. Then, she told me that someone in one of my classes has a crush on me. In that context, I was really suspicious of that cus it's so vague and she could just be saying that, so I asked her who it was, and all she told me was that she couldn't tell me because she didn't want to betray their trust. I stopped trying to get her to tell me, because I wanted to respect that she didn't want to break a promise, but I'm still thinking about it even though it has been a few months. She might have even forgotten about it by now, but I really want to know if someone likes me because it would be nice to be in the know about things that involve me.

574,"  
I need to tell me how to handle this Sichuation as a friend . And if he is dangerous .  
I will start from beginning and i will try to be short .  
There is this guy , lets name him BOB , Bob was hanging out with 2 girls Samantha and Julia , and after spenting a lot of time with Samantha they started something like a relationship with her but didnt end well , with BOB wont accept no its over as answer . He was trying to find her in person but she was avoiding him the best she could . Until Samantha got a new boyfriend and Bob was forced to stop.( he was in love with her according to him ) .

Few days later Bob start spenting time with Julia ( which she had a boyfriend Roger ) following the exact steps that brought Samantha close to him, first being with her almost all time he could , asking about her problems and listening to her , ""caring about her"" asking her all the time to go out , partying and drinking until morning. Roger start noticing the way BOB was looking Julia with a wierd look (Julia always thought BOB as a friend) and saw that something wasnt going well .

Today BOB wont leave Julia in peace and always try to find a way to meet with her . They cant just ignore him because they got similar friends . He is clearly in some sort of love with her but he wont express his feeling and he always find a way to mess up with her (like senting friend request to her friends from her hometown, he will pick up items from friends that belong to her in order to give her in person ,etc .  
Some info about Bob , he is smart, with a mathematics degrees , he was hitting and abusing his previous girlfriend , he is a sweet talker and he got bad relationship with his parents , never saw him smile and if he laugh it sound like a fake laughter .  
Sorry for bad english .Please tell me what you think of Bob .",21Apr2019,0
575,"I'm going to try and sum this up the best I can, while still making things clear but I might have a hard time so please forgive me. 

A few months ago, I met someone who I deeply regret ever messaging back. I had first spoke to him on social media and thought he seemed pretty normal, but soon enough realized there were a lot of things I didnt know. We can call him Brian. 

Brian and I became friends and started playing games together, spent nights talking and texting throughout the day. Eventually he had offered to buy me something for my birthday, which I appreciated but the item he wanted to get me was expensive and I didn't really feel comfortable accepting it. He pushed and pushed so I finally accepted and that started everything. He then constantly wanted to buy me stuff, and when we would get into fights would offer to pay for my time so that I would respond. I saw these as red flags and when I tried breaking the friendship off, he would make numerous fake accounts, texting app numbers, emails to contact me through etc. I felt so trapped and scared I didn't really know what to do. For the next few months he would go on to harass and stalk everything I did any chance he got. He went as far as to blackmail me with photos I sent as jokes. They weren't nudes, just pictures of me making ugly faces on Snapchat because I like to be silly with my friends lol. This damaged me pretty bad because now every time I get any sort of message, I have a little bit of paranoia and a weird feeling that it's him. I had gone to the police and gave them his information but since it was online they didn't do much and just told me to be careful.

 I ended up changing my number, deleting all social media and making new accounts for the ones he could reach. It's been a couple weeks now and he's calmed down with messaging me. He has one account that he can still contact. I can't change that sadly because since he has messaged it, it'll just show my new username with the same account. 

Every holiday he messages my account saying something like ""I wish you didn't hate me"" or ""I miss you"". I don't know if I should block him because I feel scared that he'll feel like he's losing control and start harrasing me again, or if I should just keep ignoring and eventually he'll stop? What do you think I should do?

576,"Some history about myself - like many students, I didn't know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life after high school. At 17-18, I spent my first year at uni majoring in Kinesiology only because my older brother was doing it too. By the end of that year, I had done poorly in many of my classes and finally decided that Nursing was a financially safer and therefore better career choice - so I transferred to Nursing school. However, money couldn't keep me interested enough as I discovered first-hand 2 years later that I hated and was disgusted with almost everything about the hospital setting - being close to the diseased, dealing with blood, dealing with smells, wiping ass, handling all sorts of fluids both bodily and medicinal, etc. It was to be expected I know, and I thought I would be okay with it. But instead, practicum had turned me into a germophobe. On top of that, coursework and tests were burning me out, and I found myself constantly doodling in my notes. Later I found myself failing classes again. My mind would just reject all the info that was brought to me. I was done, and I had lost all interest with Nursing. So I dropped out with a 60-90k debt (sigh) iirc and went to art school for its Entertainment Design program. I loved drawing - specifically characters and character designing. I've been drawing lots since elementary, and I think I'm pretty good at it now. At first, I didn't want to do anything with that skill because I ignorantly feared that it wouldn't have brought me any financial stability. After doing some research, I couldn't have been more wrong. Though, competition out there was fierce I heard. I lasted a year in art school and dropped out again - only because classes were getting ridiculously expensive. I decided that maybe it would be better for me to learn at home or take a break from school altogether. Instead, it turned into 2-3 year period of depression. In that time, I worked at USPS for several months, worked as a CPR instructor for half a year with my dad, and would sometimes help my mom at her small dental clinic. I was mostly alone with my parents or supervisors, and it was dreadful. Recently, I've picked myself back up, made a list of career paths I was interested in, and narrowed it down to 5 choices (order of them doesn't mean anything):

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*1) Entertainment Design\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

PROS: I get to do what I'm good at. I get to connect with other artists. I have no problem with the learning curve there. Here's one of my drawings just so you can better judge if it's good for me: [https://imgur.com/m9VsDl1](https://imgur.com/m9VsDl1)

&amp;#x200B;

CONS: Really expensive. Still have Nursing debt to worry about. Probably have to draw endlessly and a lot of crunch-time I hear. I fear that I might hate the very hobby I enjoy. Also very competitive in all areas. I tend to compare myself to other artists negatively.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2) Dental Lab Technician\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

PROS: Usually a short and easy program to get a certificate with. I'm okay with sculpting or molding teeth. I hear things are going digital now which sounds great too. My older brother, who's finishing up Dental school now, wants me to join him as his ""head dental lab technician"" (for lack of a better term - ultimately overseeing/teaching other lab technicians when his business spreads) in his journey in becoming a successful Dentist/entrepreneur and promises to pay off all of my school debt.

&amp;#x200B;

CONS: Pay is not very good in general (30-40k a year). I don't know if my brother will pay me more than that at first, and I don't know if I should even worry about that. It's a huge risk too, but I guess that just depends on how much I believe in my brother. I may have to work with him out of state for a while and therefore away from my current girlfriend, which will suck for me. I understand that sacrifices must be made though.

&amp;#x200B;

\- About working with my mom at her dental clinic:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of currently learning how to bill, file claims, etc. at my mom's dental office - and I guess I could work there. The only problem is that her business isn't very successful and she's always complaining about not getting enough money.  She's been at it for almost a decade. Her desk is always messy, she's always on her phone, she never wants to learn or use any business tactics herself, she refuses to be familiar with computers, she always gives ridiculous discounts for her patients just so they can stay, etc. She exploited my availability because I was depressed and wasn't doing much after art school by forcing me to work for her because nobody else would (except for 2 others who seldom come to work - older women that I just can't enjoy socializing with - which is another problem because I was alone for very long), also because she doesn't have to pay me as much, and if I say no, she'll manipulate me by guilt tripping the hell out of me.. All that just made me not want to be at her office most times. It's cruel, but that's how I feel. Anyway, I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*3) CPR Instructor/Business\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

PROS: My dad also owns his own business in CPR training. He's not as pushy as my mom, and I've had experience in teaching CPR, which can actually be pretty fun and chill. I could try to take lead and expand his business. My older brother is very confident that I could make tons of money that way, which makes me feel pretty good about it. He gave me a layout of everything I should do to improve the business.

&amp;#x200B;

CONS: My dad kind of doesn't know what he's doing (and neither do I) so his business is just sitting there, waiting for people to come and nothing else. Me having to take the lead on it is pretty intimidating. I have to ally myself with hospitals etc. and my sales/persuasion skills are absolute ass. I may just be taking on something that's too great for me to bear, and I have no current partners in mind (one that understands computers, social media, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*4) Freelance Artist and/or Story/Comic Author\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

PROS: I'm pretty good at what I do, and I think I can improve. I've had an idea for a story in my head for over a decade now, and I still think about it everyday. I've already drawn out multiple characters and environments for that story, and I really want to publish it as a comic, and share it one day.

&amp;#x200B;

CONS: Probably the riskiest choice. Probably unsustainable in my current situation. I think tt'll be a very long time before I can publish anything. I'll need a decent following and have to work on some sort of exposure to be able to freelance or have others hear of my work. Ever after that, I'll probably have a 0.0000001% chance of getting any sort of fame.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*5) Graphic Communication\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

PROS: I've done things like logos before, and it can be fun and relaxing. It's available as a program in the school that I currently got accepted as a transfer to. I get to connect with students again and revitalize my social life.

&amp;#x200B;

CONS: I wanted to go back to school for the hell of it. I got accepted to this one uni by transferring credits made up of the science classes from my first school and Nursing school. I chose Nutritional Science, but ended up not wanting to go that route anymore because I learned of its inability to be transferred to a graduate school. Basically, I couldn't be a Registered Dietitian that way - which is what I really wanted. I ended up requesting for a change in majors but unfortunately it was only possible through post-enrollment, which means that I have to waste time taking useless classes (maybe) before I can make the switch to Graphic Communication. This also means that I'll be starting all over in uni because my transferred science classes probably won't count for anything, and I couldn't transfer any of my GEs because they weren't requested in my application for Nutritional Science.

588,"Okay. This is already gonna sound like I’m lazy. 
But everyone can make their minds however they want. 

I work a 50 hour job in salary, I get paid relatively well (only get paid for 40 hours) 
We’re about 4 supervisors overseeing an average of 35 agents per shift. 

It is a very large operation and we’re almost always understaff, our company does not pay well to the hourly agents and it doesn’t seem like change is coming. Due to this, we’re constantly hiring and training people. 

But frankly, we’re all burned out, discouraged and a little mistreated. 

The culture in my company is: if only 2/4 people do a good job and are reliable, they’ll give you the bulk of the work and hold them accountable to a higher standard. So, other supervisors know this and purposely don’t do a good job. 

I’ve prepared my resume and I’ve started looking for other jobs. But I have bills, I have school (university bills to pay) and credit card debt. I don’t have a bachelors yet, and I’m getting older and older (I’m 25 lol) 

I don’t have much time off, and I’m always getting nasty emails from my management because of different reasons, when in reality, we’re short, and we have to do the agents work besides our work. This has been explained but they don’t know the operation either. And we’re all stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

I’m to the point of tears when I’m getting ready to come to work. 

—- 

I’m thinking, would it be too bad to be a cam girl? Or do stuff like that in the internet? I know this is a wild thought due to desperation, but it’s hard to maintain this job and my sanity. 
it’s hard to find another job that will pay me well with the education I have. 

I yearn to be able to travel, to pay for school, I want to enjoy life. I recognize this job is bringing me down in a way that I’ve never experienced before (I’ve been having several suicidal thoughts). 

I know it seems I’m considering an easy way out instead of finding good honest (Christian-approved work. Lol). 

But I’m desperate. 

TL;DR 
I hate my job and it’s depressing me, and I’m considering being a slut to pay bills. (I’m being honest here, and I’m not trying to insult anyone, please don’t be offended).",21Apr2019,7
589,"Hey. So I'm currently in second year (almost the end) at uni, studying a course that I don't really like. I only like one of my modules, but I'm not very good at it, which sucks.

590,"I was going to attempt to keep this as short as possible, but I'm finding it extremely difficult to keep any of my thoughts concise, so bear with me.

About five years ago, I attempted suicide.  I had an issue with amphetamines that spiraled into job loss, relationship deterioration,  etc.  I ended up going to rehab, and I was clean and put on an SSRI (Prozac).  Since I've moved back to where I am currently about four years ago, I've prided myself on the fact that, while I didn't do everything correctly, I at least made a point to take care of my interpersonal relationships, bills, and to take responsibility for any mistakes I'd made and make amends for them in whatever way possible, regardless of if forgiveness was offered.  

I frequently dissociate, and within the past six months, my current psychiatrist and I found that SSRI's weren't working quite as well as expected.  There were also the side-effects that were pretty detrimental to my overall well-being, such as becoming too drowsy to work properly without some sort of stimulant, usually just a buttload of caffeine, and then more minor ones, such as difficulty maintaining an erection/being able to climax.  

So, we've been experimenting with changes in medication.  I do still occasionally dabble with SOME recreational drugs, and I drink every so often as well.  Nothing to the point of even bi-weekly use of ANY substance, except on special occasions (and that only includes drinking).  

What's getting to me now is that my dissociation is becoming stronger.  I've had to deal with my father becoming suicidal, getting hooked on painkillers, stealing my money, and leaving me to pick up the pieces of the monumental wreckage in his wake.  Luckily, I've had some help financially from the fantastic people in r/borrow, but it seems that the further I progress, the more obstacles keep coming up.  I now have to pay for more work on my car, I have felt less and less care from the person I consider to be my closest friend (even though that's not her fault - she has been going through a lot of similar stuff herself, and it's not fair to put my needs on her), and I just feel stuck in this cycle of indeterminate direction.  

I just... I hate feeling like I've done everything I possibly can, and still ending up feeling shattered and dealing with the hopelessness that plagued me just as much when I was making all of the mistakes that I did.  The end never seems in sight.  Nothing is enough.  

I don't want to die, but I'm becoming increasingly more apathetic to the thought of an accident wiping me out.  I almost died driving home a few weeks ago when my tire exploded, and... I felt nothing.  I just want to get on my feet and away from this toxicity that my father has plagued me with.  I want to move on.  I want to feel secure.  

Thanks for listening.",21Apr2019,1

I made sure I transferred all data from my old phone to new phone, and I was successful with it. After transferring all data, I've deleted everything I had on my old phone (images, WhatsApp, and of course reddit).
After handing my old phone to my mom she noticed that WhatsApp was deleted. She was very suspicious about it, thinking that I had inappropriate stuff. 
I didn't have inappropriate stuff, but out of the 70,000 text messages I had on WhatsApp there was sexual humor I had with my friends, hardcore cursing, and simply private conversations. 
Fast-forwarding a couple minutes, I made sure that there is nothing that belonged to me on my old phone. 
Fast-forwarding 1 day (today), my mom left the house, leaving my old phone behind. I had a feeling inside of me saying to check on my old phone. 
I enter mom's room and found my old phone layed down on her pillow. I open my old phone, first thing I see a chat with me and my friend scrolled all the way up.

We live in a small town so the school has the stupid small town mentality where everyone is too afraid to go against the grain and put themselves in a position to get bullied. Since this other girl is a lot more popular than us we are being ostracized because the girl is super innocent looking and people probably don't believe that she could ever say something like that.

I don't really care that random people dislike me for telling the truth. I do dislike that my best friends mom now thinks that I shouldn't hang out with her anymore because she heard that I made the whole thing up and am just trying to spread rumors about my best friend 🙄.

I sent a (strongly worded) email to the counselor who was the one who reinforced this idea that I'm making up lies and now I need to deal with the consequences at school tomorrow.

So a few weeks ago we started to hang out with eachother a lot. And since then I keep liking her more and more. She once said to a friend of hers that we would never become a couple and we just would stay friends forever. And the other day i asked what her type was and she told me: He has to be my bestfriend (me) and he must be able to make me laugh all the time (kinda also me) and she just kinda started to describe me. And that night we just layed on a bench. She laid on my chest with her head and i just thought: “maybe I just have to do it. Kiss her.

This morning, our neighbors who live across the hall confronted us and told us that the dogs barked for the entire 3 hours we were gone and kept them awake as they go to bed at 9pm. We apologized profusely and promised it would never happen again, but they were still quite cold and upset with us. We are in our early 20’s, they’re a couple in their late 60’s.

The guests wont be returning ever again, and our dog does not bark much, so we’ve never had this issue before.

601,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point but I tend to go off a bit so TL;DR at the bottom.

Over the past few months I have not been able to feel relaxed, fulfilled or satisfied with my life in anyway. No matter what I do I feel it's not right, like I'm longing for something really hard but don't even know what it is myself. 

My life has sort of went down hill before these feelings emerged. Without going into extreme details. Broke up with first love couple months back, transferred from really bad school to a much more academic one last year where I knew a LOT less people, lost interest in studying despite becoming top of my class (because of the school transition I basically went from being the smartest among idiots to being the idiot among smart people, was a really stressful year for me but I eventually exceeded teacher expectation and managed to turn things around). My girlfriend at the time was extremely over protective and said it would trigger her anxiety if I were to do so much as to say hi to ANY female students, so out of care for her I had to avoid a lot of social interactions leading to me becoming categorized as the quite guy even though I'm really the complete opposite. Everyone knew who I was but didn't really talk to me. 

Fast forward to June last year, last quarter of academic year, only just started to pick my grades up in class after fighting with a huge amount of self doubt regarding my intelligence, school sees potential and gives me opportunity to resit the year and have a more successful university application, so I do it. 

New year new people, doing very well overall, November 2018 comes and out of seemingly nowhere gf breaks up with me in the worst way and over the most obscure reasons, don't take it well for months. I know it's the stereotypical thing to say but genuinely couldn't and still can't feel relieved / happy unless I'm drunk. Began to drink too often alone at night etc. Gets to the point were I realise I won't get anywhere this way so I seek professional help, book appointment with therapist after seeing a doctor and getting a recommendation but decide I'd just be wasting their and my own time since there's people out there who genuinely need to see one. Turn 18 in January, ex tries to reach out a few times, basically avoid her. Now I've got big exams coming up that influence my uni application, I've sort of neglected them and won't score as high as I should but if I really want to then I can easily turn that around with the in class tests. Additionally the 3 main people who I did manage to make friends with and hang out all the time are finished with school since they didn't have to resit, so I'm alone at school with no real friends. Simultaneously while all of this has been happening the dad + step mum and little brother are moving to Dubai after may, needless to say I'll see them a lot less. 

So I feel like everyone is moving forward but I'm in more or less the exact same position as last year. I've wanted to go to university since I was very young, but studying has become so mundane because of my attitude these last few months. Alternatively I've been considering going into banking to just climb a career ladder or real estate to start a career, but I have huge fear that if I do that I'll regret not becoming what I could have. 

I'm just stuck, that's the best way to describe it. I'm left with no friends anymore, no girlfriend, all family apart from mother is abroad, teachers have noticed a dip in my performance since I returned to school in January, so I'm underachieving again and just don't know what to do anymore. The whole situation pisses me off so much because I don't want my teachers to see me as some failure from a dumb school that is wasting the schools money by resitting the year, I also don't want to disappoint my father and brother. When I try to relax by doing something like watching Netflix or playing games I feel like I'm wasting time since I'm not doing anything to move forward or improve myself and start to become disappointed, however when I study or go swimming I feel exhausted and overworked mentally, and so the cycle continues. Any advice from anyone would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys.

TL;DR

Currently, I'm an 18 year old student and will be applying to university later this year to do medicine. I went through first real break up in November, didn't handle the whole thing well, performance at school has begun to dip again despite doing well, close friends moving away, father + step mum and younger brother moving to Dubai. Don't know whether to keep going with my dream of becoming a doctor, and if so then how to become invested in studying again, or just finishing school and climbing a career ladder in banking or real estate, family is opposed to the latter option.",21Apr2019,1

Today we had planned to meet up this evening (I’d be going to his house for the night) he told me to come over and asked me if he could watch the end of the fortnite tournament while I was here, he told me it ended at 9 o’clock, I arrived at 8:40 and I sat patiently and quietly and said nothing we didn’t even speak he was so infatuated with the tournament. at 9 o’clock he told me there was one more game which could be up to 20 minutes long, I told him I really didn’t want to watch it, and asked if he would switch it off to which he said “it’s the last game I’ve been watching this for 3 hours and want to know the outcome” which is understandable I guess but time had passed and I had been here 40 minutes and barely spoken a word to,  he could tell I was really not enjoying it but never turned it off, he didn’t offer to turn it off he then stared to say I was acting like a bitch for asking him to turn it off because I got fed up of sitting there doing nothing! (I was on work all day and just wanted some company)

We ended up having a fight where he told me I was wrong, in fairness I was being annoying and persistent and naggy towards the end because I was so bored but I tried my best to just let him watch it ! 

Am I wrong for asking him to turn it off? I guess it does mean a lot to him but I think there should have been a compromise, I just wish I didn’t have to ask for him to turn it off and I wish he would have just done it because he could see I was bored.  Was I being a bitch??",21Apr2019,1

The first class we discussed filter and moved into the topic of our local carnival (large festive adult event that includes alcohol, minimal clothing, costumes, and explicit dancing) he asked if any of us was going and then proceeded to say that if he sees any if us he’ll “steal a whine” (whine=dance/ grinding) everyone laughed it off but after class a few people said they felt uncomfortable with such a statement. 

Mr. H in the next class discussed where we worked and such. I told him where I worked a few months ago since I’m now a full time student, he also worked there.
Note: my mother also works there. 
He then went on to say that I look a lot like my mom (he didn’t know we were related) I told him that she’s actually my mom. He then says that they flirt all the time and said I’d get used to it.

The suspension lasts until mid-July but I wont be driving until August most likely. I've been absolutely depressed for the past ten days and I feel like my freedom has been taken away. I can't walk anywhere from my house and I'm basically trapped. All my future plans like driving to cape cod with friends, late night kareoke and seeing my boyfriend who lives an hour away have been put on hold. Does anyone have a similar experience or advice for how to cope with this?",21Apr2019,0

611,"I’m looking for advice on what others would do in my situation. I’m very torn about what to do here, and I’ve written more pros/cons about it than I care to imagine. I’ve done the coin toss. I’ve done it all. 

I have to choose by April 28th what I am going to do. 


I can’t decide what to do with my life and need advice. I’m currently on Academic Leave from my job in the Canadian Arctic. I am completing my master’s degree. I have to decide between 

A) Taking my job back, and moving there mid June. I will be back in my university town in August and September for my defence and my graduation. To move, it would cost approximately $10,000 as I would need to buy a vehicle for the Arctic, and would need to pay someone to help move me back. I would have to sell all furniture and plants (I’m a plant addict), and pretty much start from ground zero. However, I have a good job with good benefits. I like the North, and the job. I have a couple friends, but most have moved away. They also pay a portion of my student loan. This seems like a reasonable decision, the rationale one. It is the one that will give me financial security. The crux? I lose my partner whom I’m very happy with. I love him dearly. I’ve also made quite a life for myself, with plans to camp, backpack and live life fully this summer.  My partner can’t leave his job, he is in the military. 

Option B) I give up my job, stay with my partner and begin looking for jobs in my university town. I would get to stay here where I planned for summer, with a good social circle and a partner I love (although we’d try long distance). The issue here is that I have about $18,000 in savings, and $25,000 in student debt. The job market in this town is iffy and pay is quite low in comparison to the rest of the country. At present, my partner cannot afford to help me if I don’t find a job, and I’ll be blowing through these savings. Job insecurity scares me. HOWEVER, I have a boyfriend I love dearly, I have a great apartment, I love this town and have a support network. The Arctic can be isolating, lonely and hard to endure. 

This is a heart versus brain decision that will change my life.... and I’ll always wonder about the other side (even though I try to live with no regrets). I have until the 28th to determine what to do and seriously have NO idea what to do. I keep flopping.",21Apr2019,1

Currently  I have no work experience and considering how important experience is I'm seeking it out. I got offered an internship in Germany for 6 months starting August, however that would mean I would miss the first semester and thus be a semester behind. I also would most probably lose the dorm related part of my scholarship (it's money and dorm) due to being in another country. And the housing situation in Turin is a dire one. Rarely any good rooms/apartments exist especially for students looking during December/January as all of them are gone during the beginning of the academic year.

I'm scared, and idk if abandoning the scholarship dorm room and losing a semester would be worth the internship, however everyone tells me that experience is more important than the degree when finding a job.

618,"I'm almost always coming into work at 8:02 AM consistently when I need to get to work at 8:00 AM and there's a grace period of about 5 minutes so I'm never technically late but I'm always close. In almost all my jobs I always start off being really early every day and I gradually just realize what I can get away with until I settle into routine but for whatever reason I can hit 8:02 AM every single day and find it almost impossible to just cut 2 more minutes out to be on time. Maybe it's psychological, does anyone else get this? I've tried setting my clocks forward but it doesn't work because my mind just calculates how far ahead they really are. Am I just chronically late all the time? I do hate my job but even when I liked it I still never made it on time. 

I won't bore you with the details but I take a dump every morning before work. If I didn't poop before work I'd probably only need 15 minutes to get ready and be early every day, but I don't like having anything in my bowels throughout the day and I damn sure don't want to take workpoops. The problem with this is if I wake up hours early in an effort to be early to work, I'll just end up needing to poop twice before work instead of once, or I'll just end up taking extra time on the toilet and waking up early will be pointless. I often also find if I'm ahead of schedule I'll get into something that wastes time out of boredom and it's worse than if I woke up late and rushed. 

I think maybe I just hate being early and sitting around waiting to work and want to max out my time at home as much as possible, but it's just weird to me how I can be so consistent just as long as it's late.",21Apr2019,1
619,"Hey guys....first of I am very new to reddit so if this is not the right subreddit to post this I am sorry

This is about my roommate (23? F) an her dog (F)

Me and my boyfriend got the offer from her to live with her and her boyfriend in their flat. As we are all students this was the perfect opportunity because it was cheap. Also we were friends so it was perfect.

In the beginning she said that her dog sometimes is over in the flat and at other times her mother is looking over it. Now.....I am not a person who likes dogs very much. I really only like them if they are well behaved (in my eyes). I told her that immediately (she also knew before that I am not a dog fan). Also my boyfriend is kinda afraid of dogs if they growl.....ohterwise he likes them.
So I told her ""I dont like the dog barking at every human that comes in, I dont like growling or anything agressive, I dont like the dog being at the table while eating......it can be under the table but no begging or laying the head on the table""
She said ""No she (the dog) is very kind, and is always in her room""
When I said again ""Is it next to the table while eating?"" she said ""No! I hate that too""
So I thoungt......okey.....Im not a dog fan but this seems to work for me and my BF.
So we said yes. 

Shortly after she told me that she had a big fight with her mom and the dog will now always be in the flat. Well no big deal. If it behaves like she said than thats okey.

Then in the following weeks she kept telling stories about how the dog barks and wakes her up when the dog wants to play. I thought.....okeeyyyy......why did it suddenly turn to barking so much when she said it wouldnt?

Forward to now where we live in the flat.
In the beginning the dog was all around the flat not in its room. I thougt....well it likes to walk around, thats okey. But no......it growls at us (me and BF) everytime we walk through the flat and sometimes even shows its teeth. My BF was afraid.
It also barks at EVERYTHING that walks by the flat......human or cat. If it hears it it barks.
So I confronted her and told her the dog growls and its frightening.
She said sorry and the dog was now more often in its room.

The next problem was.....while eating dinner she would always let the dog sit at the table. And she pets it while eating. It looses a lot of hair.....and guess where the hair landed......In our food.

So I said ""You know I dont like that and I think its disgusting to have dog hair in my food."" So she moved back half a meter and kept continuing to pet the dog and it even jumped halfway on her lap. So I just stood up and went into my room to eat my meal. From that time on we kept eating seperatly.

In the meantime she had some problems (psychological). And you could always tell if she was upset by the dogs behaviour.....it gets more agressive.....
The dog barks agressively at us an also growls and shows its teeth while they keep petting it (encouraging this behaviour).
The dog once even stood in my BFs way when he wanted to leave and growled. So he had to wait until the dog lost interest in teasing him.
It tried that with me too but I just sent it away with a snap of my finger and a ""No"". That seemed to confuse it greatly and it started being afraid of me...

To clarify....I would never hit her dog or scream at it. I will just stand my ground and send it away.

Forward to a week ago when I and my BF came home. We opened the door with the key. I saw the dog sitting next to the owner. As it saw me it made 2 huge jumps toward me barking agressively! I was scared and screamed ""HEY"" at it wich scared it so much that it turned around in an instant and ran away. This is when my roommate ""kinda"" snapped.....she semi-screamed at me ""You cant scare my dog!! Its so afraid of you!""
I got really pissed at this moment and said that the dog annoyes me greatly and scared me almost to death! I then just went in my room to be alone. My BF came after me and was also in shock.

I feel so stupid that I agreed to live there.......I was not a big dog fan but my family has 3 dogs and I can live with them just fine.....But this dog....i dont know....

I talked to her afterwards and said that I am shivering because of the dog.....and she just said ""But you know it lives here! Why would you get scared and scream at it?"" ..... I just kept repeating myself saying ""I was scared"" but she wouldnt have any of it...

How can I get through this situation? Has somebody had a similar experience?
I just start to resent her so much and it makes me sad because we were friends. But I dont want to be treated like a second class citizen. I tried talking but she wont have it and will always shift the blame on us/me.

What can I do? (Moving out right now would be really mean because she probalby couldnt find a roommate and it would be to much to pay for her and her BF alone)

TL;DR My roommates dog is nothing like she promised and is agressive towards me and my BF. Moving out right now would harm her greatly financially and I dont want to do that. Talking isnt working...What can I do?",21Apr2019,1

621,"First of all, I am aware that I suffer from a serious case of imposter syndrome and I am aware and working on it. 

I was informally adopted by a friends family when my family disowned me (cool homophobes) and thus was at the family Seder last night. At said Seder I got talking to a family member about politics and he is an employee of the federal government. If you're family with Seder you can guess we're both a couple of wine glasses in, but I am really passionate about both medical access and rural politics (I grew up real rural even if I live in the city now). 

He blew me out of the water when he said he's been talking to folks for the past couple months on these topics, but I am the first person with both unique ideas and a direct application of turning the rural-conservative vote to a rural-liberal one and that he both wants to engage in further dialogue and that I should contact the various Dem candidates to offer consultancy. He was very clear that my ideas are practical, doable, and can make a pie-in-the-sky concept feel grounded.

626,"Maybe the question itself seems kind of strange and simple but the background details are the hard ones here.

Since the divorce of my parents when i was 9 i had to gone through many things (beeing bullied, cancer on my friends site (whos got bullied too), loosing my best friends who started bullying me, my family which will be explained later). Now i moved out with realy good luck. met new friends who i can actualy sheer a tear with and talk about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i´ve realized how much my mental illnes was killing me in the time i was living by my mother.

Whenever i had a very good mood and my sister or my mother came in my room my mood changed extremly.

There is always such terms like ""leave me alone"" and ""i need time for myself"" but i couldn't realize how much the whole thing drove me crazy until i hit my sister completly unconcious once she only came in my room with only my fist. (no major injures beside that).

&amp;#x200B;

My todays friends now are standing by my side whenever i got an sociopathic attack and are trying to calm me down. (i can laugh for like 3 hours straight for no reason or cry in the middle of the university class).

Today my father called me after 4 months just to make an one and a half minute call with a voice which sounded the complete difference of happiness. My mother didn't even called me.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to apologize to them for my habits back then, would go to a therapist for a evidence, just to stay contact with them.

But since i hit my sister back then everytime i couldnt talk about my problems in any form with my father since he always started to cry infront of me (which is the last thing you wanna see) and whenever i tried to talk to my mother about it my sister came in and told me every little thing i did wrong and which could have caused the divorce.

630,"I don’t even know where to start, there’s so much to this and how it came to us not being friends any longer.

I guess we start from the begging, 

I met two girls on an online game, we instantly became very close because we shared many similar views on fashion, books, music, memes, makeup, etc., we always joked that we were sisters separated at birth.

Just to make it clear, I won’t use their real names, so to lessen possible confusion, from here on out I’ll refer to the ex-friend as Sam and the friend I still speak to as Rue.

So, fast forward around 7-8 months into our friendship, we were playing the game I met them on and in the heat of the moment, I jokingly referred to Rue as “bitch”, we often did this, just when Sam wasn’t around, so I always assumed that she just didn’t know that it was playful because Rue was always okay with this and I had clarified it beforehand with her because I did not want to call someone a name, amidst just friendly banter, that they weren’t comfortable with. 
This all ended up with Sam completely shutting off from the voice chat we were on, she became one worded and was not being friendly to me, specifically. I brushed it off, deciding that I’d talk to her after we were done playing because I did not want to take away from our girls time, as we didn’t have much of it and I already sacrificed my sleep to hang out with them on university and work nights as I live on the opposite side of the world to them.
After we stopped playing the game, I came to find out that she had blocked me, everywhere, I was confused and tried to message her and ask what had happened, because the only place she hadn’t blocked me on had been discord due to our call. She gave me no answer for 4 days. Then she left me a very long message explaining how I offended her and called her a bitch, when at no point I had, even Rue agreed that I hadn’t and was just as confused. But when I tried to argue this with her, she gave me the cold shoulder again before I finally bit the bullet, took the blame and apologised to her, because I just wanted things to be normal again. 

(To clarify as to why I didn’t immediately take this as a red flag: I do not have many friends because I’m very socially awkward, anxious and was bullied for a prolonged time through both primary and middle school so I am very lenient with the things people throw at me, though, I’m even more anxious about making friends after some of the things she put me through.)


Everything was okay for another few months until I met my boyfriend the year after the first fight. I was very excited about it because he had been nothing but great (he still is) and seeing that they shared a lot about their SO’s and were familiar with what had happened in my previous relationship I thought it’d be okay to share some of my excitement with them. I talked about him only on a few occasions and sometimes let them know I wouldn’t be able to play the game with them because me and him had agreed to spend time together those nights. 3 months in to my relationship with him, Sam came through again, leaving me another message where she explained how much of a “hoe” I was for seeing someone and how I didn’t give her or Rue the time of the day and how she was disgusted with me and couldn’t comprehend where SHE went wrong. Mind you, we still actively played the game together nearly every night and my boyfriend always respected that and was always okay with this because he knew I thought of them as sisters. I was trying very hard to prioritise all three of them, always, because they were my important people. 
I tried to explain that to her but she was having none of it, giving me even more shit for how I’d abandon them mid game when I clearly had explained and communicated that it was 4am for me and I should get some rest because it was a university or work night for me. 
After a very long conversation and the entire thing, we decided to put it to rest and make up, she still didn’t believe she was in the wrong, at any point during that conversation and put me down severely.
I did not want me boyfriend to think any less of them, so I only shared snippets of what had happened and he sided with me, obviously there’s bias to this, but he usually calls me out when I’m in the wrong on things due to my social awkwardness and prior agreement to do so. 

Fast forward a few months later or random and ridiculous fights that she’d throw my way and try to pit me against Rue, because Rue had become more withdrawn from the group due to family reasons, I kind of had my final straw broken. 

She tried to tell me a lot of different things about Rue and how she was not a very pleasant person. She’d often mock her situation with her boyfriend and belittle her by calling her small brained and things of similar nature. At this point, I did not know how to better handle it, so I did it the easiest way and started ignoring her messages after she’d start talking about Rue or anyone else in that fashion. 
She was furious, beyond furious with me at this point. Eventually, after a little while she cut me off completely and I was sort of relieved. Rue knew about the things she said because I had made sure to let her know that our bestfriend was very two faced. Surprisingly, Rue never cut her off and they still talk. 

Recently, Rue messaged me asking if she could start a group chat with someone and wow, if my stomach didn’t fall on the floor. She added Sam into a group chat with us and privately explained that Sam wanted to make up with me. 

I didn’t know what to say and because I was out of country, on a trip, that Rue knew about, I asked to be given some more time because I was busy. 

While I was actively trying to post pone it and figure out what to do, Sam went out of her way to make a post which goes to the lines of, “I knew you never cared, you should just stop pretending and keep me blocked.” - I never blocked her, nor did I pretend. I genuinely loved her so much as a friend and still, internally somewhere, do because for a few years she and Rue kept me from killing myself when I was going recovering from what my ex had done to me. 

I don’t know if I should try to still talk to her and see whether she has changed at all or if she’s still the same and has a very toxic outlook on everything. 

I know this is massively just dumb drama but these two girls were very important to me and I still, always hope that both of them are doing okay in life, regardless of what took place. 

I just don’t want to be burned again by toxicity and hurtful behaviours.",21Apr2019,1

Of course I cried he cried the whole ordeal. I tried contacting him to just talk about what happened but he would constantly say he didn’t want to talk. I should’ve respected that but I messed up. I heard he was going on a date with someone (turns out he wasn’t you will see) so I stopped him in the hallway and asked him what was going on and I kinda freaked out on him :( I shouldn’t have cause it turns out he was just hanging out with his lesbian friend.

He never said how he felt about the letter, but when I asked him he said he just needs time. So i have been giving him time and space I barely even look at him.

So I was upset and texted him (&lt;- bad idea) and I was just confused trying to get out of him why this even happened. He was being so rude, he also said he wasn’t attracted to me anymore based off of the way I reacted. I only reacted those ways because he refused to talk to me.

However, he returned a month later confessing that he slept with a stewardess and contracted genital herpes. He justified sleeping with another woman by saying that I told him to have fun so he did. I should’ve left on the spot but he was depressed and talked about ending his life so I stayed and listened to him. I thought I could relate cause my mom had become disabled from a stroke and I believed a medical condition shouldn’t define a person. His regular cocaine use should’ve been another red flag. Either way, we continued this relationship and used condoms during sex and started having unprotected sex when he stopped having symptoms.

However, in one of my routine STD screening, I found out that I contracted genital herpes from him I felt incredibly angry, upset, and resentful at myself. I couldn’t tell anyone but J and eventually found solace. Then last august 2018, he left to San Francisco to work for a large social media firm and we became distant. Nonetheless I made the effort to fly out every month to see him.

But two nights ago, he accidentally left me a voicemail having a conversation with a woman with an accent (I’m assuming it’s his female colleague who is a tech lead at his firm) and he was lying to her. He told her he stays away from \[insert race\] girls and his last relationship ended two years ago. That he was only flirting with other women at a party cause she ditched him and he really wants to do \[insert sexual act\] with her. I was shocked to hear him lie so easily. And I’m scared that he may deceive this woman and others and spread his STD. I now realize he has a proclivity for lying to women to appear like a victim needing sympathy and blaming us when he gets caught.

I’m mainly concerned because J has a history of hooking up with his colleague/subordinates and J currently manages teams of contractors. Also the lies I heard him tell this woman who may be his colleague makes me feel very uneasy. Most likely he has not disclosed his STD to the women he has been secretly dating. Also, a few months ago, he confessed to me that he has been flirting with other women at bars/happy hours every week but it's not a big deal cause he's not having sex with them.

I don’t know if I should walk away from this hot mess and continue living my celibate life. Or if I should take legal action for him knowingly infecting me and forcing him to disclose his genital herpes to the new women in his life. However, he had already disclosed to me that he has STD so I don’t believe I can take any legal action. And a large part of me wants to pretend J never existed in my life and believe that those women are not my problem. But I know if I am that female colleague, or any other woman, I would want to know the truth and protect myself.",21Apr2019,2
636,"I've been thinking lately about leaving my husband. It's not because I don't love him, in fact, he's one of my best friends. We also have a son together.

The fact is, his entire family hates me. We've been married three years and all they do is bitch about me and emotionally torment me.

On top of that, he's really emotionally abusive and controlling. We have to keep separate bank accounts, and he has a second separate bank account that he lied to me about at one point.

I get told all the time that I'm lazy and that my bipolar disorder isn't an excuse for being tired all the time (I'm currently trying to get my medicine regime set up.)

Beyond that, we both work. He works 50-60 hours a week and I work 30. I am the primary caregiver for our son. I'm also in college full time, and since I work first shift and he works second, I'm in charge of all housework.

He's also got an anger problem, in which he doesn't share things that are bothering him and acts petty for days, and then he'll snap and scream in my face and tell me I'm a stupid bitch and to shut my fucking mouth.

At this point, I'm 25 years old. I feel stuck. But I also don't have any credit and nothing is in my name because we worked on his credit first, and when it was time to work on mine we suddenly didn't have the funds to do that.

I am the one that does all the budgeting, shopping, appearances, etc.

He's also very attached to his abusive mother, who thinks it's okay to treat whomever she wants however she wants, which is documented in other posts of mine.

We got married after three months because I accidentally got pregnant. He was truthfully a rebound and this wasn't supposed to happen.

We tried to do the right thing and it just isn't working for either of us.

My son is the greatest thing to ever happen in my life, and I don't want him growing up with parents who resent each other.

I'm lost for what to do. We've tried couples counseling and then he basically quit going and I started doing individual counseling.

He doesn't want to change and wants me to change everything and be a perfect trophy wife. He knew I had mental health issues going into our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working in advertising in NYC for 10 years. The money is great and I do my best but I do not feel fulfilled or satisfied with the work. Sometimes, I work 90+ hour weeks. I've learned that time is a valuable asset to life and I do not have much time to myself anymore due to work. I want a family or even a dog at some point but if I continue to walk down this road, I do not see that happening.

&amp;#x200B;

SO, I've thought about going back to school. I am thinking about taking prerequisites to get a masters in health science, specifically nutrition. The money won't be as glamorous as advertising, and satisfaction is not guaranteed but the work seems to line up with my values of helping others, and hours also seem much better than advertising...so there's that.

&amp;#x200B;

The big question is...

&amp;#x200B;

Do I continue living my current fast-paced life of NYC advertising hoping that it will fulfill me one day (or you know, maybe I can really convince myself that this is great haha)...

&amp;#x200B;

OR!

  
Do I take a chance and follow a new path I am interested in? The only price I'd have to pay is I would have to move back home at age 29 after living a lavish life, which isn't that great, but it isn't the worst thing in the world. I'd have to suck it up for a few years while I study. 29 is not that old.. right guys??

643,"First of all, I want to say that im not a native english speaker, so maybe I will make some mistakes.

I go to a very difficult highschool (its considered to be one of the best highschools in my country) but because of that, the students are exposed to a very stricted schedule and we, of course, need to study a lot.
The thing is that because of that schedule, we cannot do normal teenager stuff, such as hanging out with your friends, playing games or even do sports. We were aware of that. We needed to pass a big exam in order to get in this highschool, so we were aware that we will need to study a lot and give up on some activities.
Even tho we knew about that, our schedule is a time-consuming monster, and for a lot of students, this hit them so hard. In every class, out of 30 to 40 students, *at least* 10 will have depression, anxiety or had suicide thoughts related to school. Students are putted under so much pressure that they developed depression, and its a bigger problem, because most of them dont show any signs. Even the most smiling and happy person will have suicidal thoughts, and no one would ever notice.
Its a horrible cycle where students cannot leave the school, because if they change to another highschool 'it will mean that all the sacrifice that they have done in the past years would have mean nothing' (words from a friend with depression in my school). 

What can I do? I talk daily with a lot of friend that I know are suffering from mental illness, but now I've realised this is affecting so much people and I want to help them.
I think schools superiors dont know about this either, but i cant go and tell them. I think the person itself with the problem need to speak for itself, but no one is saying a word, and they need help!

644,"So, over the past year I got really into a musical group that is really out of my usual style. Anyways, I found out that there was a local fan club and that they organized events (parties, meet ups, dance contests, etc.) soI decided it would be kinda cool to join. I went to one event and it wasn't so bad. I went to another one and... it was flat out terrible. They charged us a pretty hefty price ticket (considering most of the fans are teen girls) and all they had has a a white sheet taped against a window with a projector showing the band's music videos with a bunch of chairs piled on each other. The food consisted of hot dogs, jello and cut up fruits (I found out some fans - which were 13 year old girls - DONATED some of the snacks). The club leaders were just working a merch booth. When people got upset and tried to leave, the leaders got mad and called the girls fake fans which made them really sad. Now, I'm a 21 year old woman, so I felt like I had to stand up for these little girls and I asked them what they did with all of the money and that they needed to come clean with the club finances. I got hate from the club leaders and some of the girls for not being a real fan and being negative. This has been par for the course in all the events they've been doing. Yesterday, they had a ""concert simulation"" where they rented out one of our city's biggest venues to run a simulation concert of the band to show that poeple in my country are willing to go see them, but so far I haven't seen them promote the results on social media to get anyone's attention. They told the kids they'd be selling the tickets at 1 pm, but it started to rain pretty badly and showed up to the venue at 4.

With feeling better came the want to buy accessories like rings and earrings. Buy dresses (which I have not wore any since I was a child), buy more shoes, like actually care about matching, buying bracelets. I felt that I have bought too much, and feel that I’m spending my money. I think I have spent like over 1000+ on just accessories. I have satisfaction from buying accessories and clothes and I feel good wearing them. 

My boyfriend doesn’t like me wearing earrings or rings. He met me when I was really depressed and didn’t care about my looks or what I ate. He is not okay with me spending so much money on gym stuff, clothes, make up.

The lack of motivation is making me procrastinate alot, to the point that i barely studied to a recent test that i had, this is how bad it is. I don't know if becoming a researcher is something that i will like in the future, and i don't plan relying on trying to work in another country(what if i fail to do so?)

Heck, i can't even join the military, in my country the military don't accept people that use glasses, and joining the military means giving up on my dream on leaving the country. College is full time so get a job is a no, i barely have time to study now, i don't even want to think about it with a job.

651,"Hi all, i need advice regarding my new job. Im sorry for the long post, but let me share first some backstory on this.
I recently quit my previous job as a software engineer in a really big company. Even though I was doing really well there (concerning my skills and professional growth), the hours were insane, including weekends, there was extreme stress and a psycho boss. Ok that meant that i would be fast promoted, but eventually i decided to start living a bit and not getting sick due to all the stress. I was constantly tired, stressed out and angry to my circle. 

I started searching for a new job, even though even the search of it was extremely tiring. Imaging starting work at 10 in the morning, deal with all the crazy shit there until 10-11 in the night, returning home to do the assignment for a new job, then sleep  because you have a job interview on 8.30 in the morning before work, because god forbid i took one day off, that would be a disaster. Not so good.

I found a new job in a smaller company (mind you that this is my second job) where I was told that the environment would not be toxic, the hours would be logical, the pay ofc better etc. I was thrilled until i saw what was the cost. The new team is not at all organized, the product is boring, there are no challenges whatsoever, the client is always unhappy cause the team is constantly unprepared. Now i am the kind of person that wants to grow professionally, but due to my seniority i have no authority there in order to propose some changes that i know for a fact would be beneficial. Additionally, i get no proper training there, noone actually knows what the hell they are doing. All the meetings are held between a pm, the supervisor and some senior guy who decides for absolutely everything, leaving the rest of the team to do the work that he is not willing to do. He does not share the work, he constantly takes all the ""interesting"" parts for his own and most importantly does not share the knowledge, which leaves the rest of us absolutely dependent on him. I have gotten from being a good and valuable team member, to a person that does not know or care for her job, as noone actually pays attention to anything there. In the beginning I was trying to organise some things, but it seems that noone is interested in what i have to say, so i quit that.

I'm a 19 year old girl and I've never had a crush before, I never even met anyone I've been attracted to. I've always been slow to develop and I've always lacked behind in social development in comparison to my peers. 

It's probably partially because I'm kind of a hermit and pretty introverted, but I met some really awesome people at my new job and I'd really like to be friends with them. 

And to achieve that goal I've just kind of taken a leap into the deep end (I don't really know what normal social boundaries are since the only friends I have, I've known since I was 4).

Nonetheless I've tried to make some advancement. And I've been texting one of the people I really like pretty much everyday for two-ish weeks consistently. But I don't know if he wants to be friends with me too? Because we haven't been texting as much lately. Am I texting him too much?

And to make matters worse I have this annoying thing where because I'm a desperate virgin that has never experienced love I'll fixate on a guy (or girl but guy in this case) and kind of get crush-like  feelings that usually dissipate in less than a week. But they haven't gone away yet.  :(

Basically if he doesn't text as much as me I'll wonder if he wants to be friends with me too or if I'm just pushing this friendship on him? And I'll get all these insecure thoughts and I'll overthink everything and I HATE IT! I don't want to feel like this, I just want more friends. 

And then there's also the matter where my sister has told me before that I'm pretty shitty at picking up social cues, so usually if someone is interested in me it catches me completely of guard (These are usually online friends, there have never been people IRL who are romantically interested in me).

But I'm pretty sure this guy is not romantically interested in me (like almost 100% sure). I think he has a girlfriend (not entirely sure) but that's enough for me to feel like a dick for this micro-crush. Anyway I want him to be interested in friendship with me, because I'm low-key high-key desperate for friends.

How should I go about becoming friends? And how can I banish these ungodly feelings?

660,"Hi, I’m Andrea, 25 years old, from Milan, Italy. 
I have to face a very important decision to make in the coming weeks. 
I’m currently working as a production assistant (PA) in an advertising production company, however my dream is to become a Director of Photography (DoP). I’ve talked to many in the business and they’ve all told me the same: “You’re wasting your time, you have to change work. It’s been fine for the first time, to learn the industry and live the set life, but after 2 years It’s enough.”
To become a DoP I’d have to work for several months for free in a rental, a service from which we rent the material we use on set, and from there, when I get the chance, I’ll start working as a video assist (VTR), the lowest role in the camera department. The point of this is that you learn the material, working in the rental, and you understand every and each part of it. When you know it well, and you get to know the right people, you can start to go on sets to work as a VTR, and finally get paid. From here you literally have to escalate the hierarchy, exactly like military. 
The problems are multiple. Currently I have a very decent salary and I’m in the process to buy a house with my future to be wife. 
I’m really full till my head of this work, I can’t do it no more. I’m starting to hate everything I do because of this. I really like my colleagues and I love staying with them, but I’m depressed and demoralized every time I think about the life awaits me ahead if I pursue this path. But how can I drop everything and go work for free? If I go to the rental I could have to work maybe even an year for free before I can become a VTR and start getting paid. How can I do this thinking about the mortgage I’ll have to pay in a few months? 
One solution could be to work as a freelance PA while working in the rental, however for the first months I’d have to work everyday in the rental, so no free time.

(I just started college and my brother is doing that plus working two jobs) She’s a puppy and tears everything in the house apart, pees and poops everywhere, and always has to have someone paying attention to her or she barks. 

I am a clean freak and it takes me around an hour to clean everything when I get home because I cat get anything done if there’s a mess. I have a lot of work to do so I don’t have time to train her or know how to. We are not even allowed to have a dog in this apartment complex and dogs are expensive to take care of.
It’s just a mess.

I love dogs and I know this is not a good home for her.  

Every time I try to explain this to my dad he just makes up an excuse to keep her and still makes me take care of her.

What can I do to find a better home for this dog?",21Apr2019,1
662,"Hello all, 

I’m a Male (22) and my grandmother lives in the apartment of my house, and has my whole life, and I love her with all my heart. 
She is getting older and older, and my grandfather has passed, and she is also visibly lonely.  I know I’m not expected to be with her or talk to her 24/7, but I’m feeling lately that I need to be around for her more, and hang out with her as she wont be around forever, and I want her to be happy.

663,"My friend texted me a few weeks ago asking to go on a drive. Me and him have been best friends since like Junior year in high school, so we’re really close and I trust him a lot. We worked together in mall security for about a year which is when this all happened. Well, apparently about a year ago I went on a date with a girl. On that date we made out for a while, but nothing beyond that as far as physicality goes. For some reason though the girl started crying rape on me to literally everyone I know, but I guess this is a pretty common occurrence with this girl. Basically no one believed her because of her throwing false allegations several times in the past. I thought it all had blown over within a week or two. At work I noticed no one really wanted to talk to me and was avoiding me a lot, especially the women. Superiors started treating me differently and I started feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome at work, so I left for better horizons. I figured maybe I had told a joke that offended people or maybe I really was annoying people more than being friendly. 

My friend on the drive basically told me he was jealous of my date with this girl and so told everyone that I had sexually assaulted her, just like she’d told him. So basically the entire mall thought this security guard was just this rapist on the loose who hadn’t been reported to the police. My friend says he feels horrible and apologized profusely, but it sounded like he was under the impression I was fully aware of the situation. I had no idea what was going on and now feel completely embarrassed. I’ve been shopping at that mall and said hi to people several times since I quit working there and now that I’m realizing what was going on from their side, I not only feel embarrassed, but completely horrible for how uncomfortable I made so many people. Especially the women in that workplace. Everything makes a lot more sense as far as the sudden isolation goes, but I don’t know what to do at this point. 

My friend was very upfront and I could genuinely tell felt bad, but at the same time I also know he didn’t go back to every person he told and say, “never mind that didn’t happened. I lied about it out of jealousy.” Because who does that, right? I just feel incredibly betrayed and confused and don’t know what to do.",21Apr2019,1

For   some context, up until I was about 8 or 9 my brother and I used to   share a room and my parents would share a room. But when I was about 9   and my brother about 13, he moved out into the spare room. Then, a year   or so later my Mum (I think due to menopause) began to have trouble   sleeping and it would disturb my Dad and my Dad's snoring would disturb   her. So, my Dad moved into the spare bed in my room that used to be my   brother's when I was about 10.

At that   age I didn't mind it, I quite like having someone else in the room.  But  in the past few years it's started to get really annoying how he  can  just demand entry to MY room at any time. We all know that  teenagers  need privacy! I've tried speaking to my Mum and she says that  she  wouldn't be able to sleep and would be shattered before work. My  Dad  just gets annoyed at my mum when I broach the subject. Honestly,  it's  fucking ridiculous having to share a room with my Dad at my age.  He  doesn't even knock before he walks in!

We share a few classes and she flirts a lot, last summer we got together at a party but nothing really came of it. I recently admitted my feelings for her and she didn’t really react but hinted heavily that it wasn’t unrequited love.

675,"I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar 1. I experienced my first manic episode and it lasted about 10 days. It ended a week ago. 

My neighbor in the dorms, who also happens to be one of my best friends, takes care of me a lot when I go through my lows and shitty experiences. She's helped me through my relationship, family problems, and sexual abuse from the past. I love her a lot and would do anything for her. 

She has a friend from high school. She was interested in him romantically. He and I were very similar personality-wise, and we both really enjoy pussy. I'm gay. I began talking to him one night after getting his contact from my friend. I talked her up to help him become interested. He explained that he's going through some trouble and isn't looking for a relationship right now. I shared that with my friend and she understood.

He's also a Jehovah's Witness, which we thought was strange because of their beliefs and disfellowship rules, etc. He's got a bit of baggage, which I thought she wouldn't be able to handle.

Well, when I was manic, I spent an entire night (no sleeping) sexting him. We masturbated together and sent nude photos, etc. I've never done that before. I'm not the person to take nudes or sext individuals, especially males. Usually the penis makes me feel sick, but for some reason, I really wanted his.

After the mania ended, I felt the need to tell my friend about 4 days after I regained sanity because I felt really bad. I thought being honest was best. She just laughed at me and said she was upset with him for provoking a manic lesbian.

She just texted me and says she thought more about it and realized she cannot trust me. She doesn't want to be friends anymore and will not speak to me when she gets back tonight. I really would be at a loss if we quit talking over something I couldn't control in the moment. I don't now how to explain how the mania controlled me.

We live in a large 1 bedroom apartment complex where I have room to walk her and she has room to roam. 
I’ve had her for two weeks now and I’m in living hell. Shes scratched the tile flooring enough to ruin it, the door has been scraped. She also jumped onto the counter and ate a whole pound of raw beef that was far from her reach (unless she climbed up COMPLETELY on the counter). She’s destroyed my floor by peeing and pooping on the tile (both in front of us and in secret) no amount of verbal discipline is working. The commands I’m told she knows do not work as well. I have taken her out more frequently but honestly this isn’t a good solution because I have to take my 2 year old out with me as well (DH works 5 days a week) and we walk with him in a stroller. I got a pull training harness in hopes she would learn to walk better and make it easier but it’s just a hassle to take her out to walk with the baby. ( I can’t leave either alone, obviously).

681,"I'm in Bali. Staying in a guesthouse. Super cheap. It's like $300 US a month. The owner also does the housekeeping before going to her other job.

I'm missing my external hard drive. I sincerely think she took it and I don't know how I should approach it.

I don't think she took it because she has a use for it. I think she broke it by accident and threw it away without telling me to make me think I lost it.

It's an AirBnB. I've been staying here 3 months. No other complaints. Would like to continue staying here. It has a laptop friendly workplace (a desk and a chair) that I've had my laptop, mouse, external hard-drive all set up on since I arrived here. About 2 days ago, I came back to realize the desk had been moved on the other side of the wardrobe. I asked her if I could move it several days earlier because the wardrobe was interfering with the connection to the router. I was going to do it but she did it herself while cleaning my room.

So she moved the desk two days ago. Today, I noticed my hard drive missing. It's been connected in the same spot since I arrived. The way it was positioned, unless she was aware/very careful, there is a high chance it would have fallen while moving the desk. If so, it likely would have broken on the tile floor.

I think that's what happened and she threw it away without telling me.

It's a 4TB hdd worth about $100. It had about 4000 pictures and 200 videos on it. Media I needed since one of my income sources is social media/travel blogging. Some of my pictures were backed up. Most weren't. I've therefore lost the ability to create most of the posts I've had coming up, and therefore have lost income too.

I think she's hiding it because she realizes it would be a big burden to me and here in Bali the locals to really have the money for a set back like this.

I hope everyone is doing well. I (22m) have a friend (20f) who I am planning on ending a friendship with this coming Saturday.

The reason is that, I have been trying to heal from my last relationship, and I've recently felt really attracted to her. 

It's not really fair for me to want something more when we've been friends for months all through when my relationship ended. On top of that, I honestly  don't really want a relationship with her, it's a mostly physical attraction.

This sounds awful, but she has some issues with regards to her Father and men in her life, where she's never had a boyfriend despite being incredibly beautiful because she is traumatized from her Father beating her Mother.

I know she's never really had someone that she can be open with. She had been buying me presents recently and wanting to come to my martial arts classes and spend all this extra time together one on one. That stuff kind of seems to be like ""relationship stuff"" that I have never done with girls I'm merely friends with.

I called her today and set the meeting for Saturday. I plan to just kindly explain that I don't think I can offer her the kind of friendship she might be looking for, because I've noticed recently that I'm attracted to her. 

Is there anything else you guys would add to make this smoother? She's an incredibly kind and respectful person to me normally, but I know it will probably be emotional and hard to take this so there could be a little bit of am extra outburst.

690,"Hello r/Advice,  


I'm usually a lurker on my main account, but I'm at work just mulling over all of my life choices, and I feel like I'm at the end of my rope in life at age 27. I just need someone to point me in some kind of direction away from my self destructive habits and give me some hope in regards to my life situation. I really appreciate the time, and I promise to pay the kindness forward from responses.  


My main issue always derives from focus. I was diagnosed with ADHD at elementary school age, but I hadn't received any counseling or medication for it through my teenage and adulthood years. I can now feel its impact like a sledgehammer in my late twenties. I can't focus on anything outside of information that requires fast processing. I can't focus long enough to not get frustrated with jobs, schooling, and even slower hobbies. I've enrolled in college countless times, began gym routines for months, and found success in various career fields only to constantly give-up on all of it. I am as frustrated with myself as I would be as someone reading this. I just can't stay with any one thing long enough to call it a path. I'll always find an excuse to let it go with the slightest bit of friction in progress or repetition, and it's legitimately ruining my life. I try to make the lives of those around me better, but I feel like an utter siphon on society and as though I'd be better-off gone.  


With that being said, the same issue has had a nasty effect on my financial stability. I'm always behind on bills, citing poor spending habits and no stable income throughout my life. I've developed horrible habits around constantly eating-out and rewarding myself by shopping to battle my ongoing, self-created depression. Thanks to a tragic event, I do own my own small home, and I owe only half of what my car is worth with a small car payment, but I still can't break my ridiculous cycles to build up a nest-egg. I know full-and-well this is LUDICROUS at my age. I just don't know what to do about my brain.  


I am a U.S. military vet with an honorable discharge, so I've tried to use the VA's counselling services, but I am never happy with their diagnosis and results. I feel as though the majority of this is focus related, but I know it's only getting more severe with age. In my late teens, I was so ambitious and in-shape, ready to take on the world, and now I feel as though I'm better off not in it -- as if I took my shot and missed. I would give anything for a decade reset button knowing what I know now, but I just can't live this way. I want a sense of purpose in career and living, and beyond a surprisingly strong relationship and a few close friends, I just can't get my life together. 30 is rearing it's ugly head, and it seems like I wasn't ready for 18.  


\*\*\*For a personal, purposed solution to the majority of my life issues, I've been thinking about selling my house to pay off my car and minute credit card/educational debt so I can finish my degree through my G.I. Bill debt-free. I hate this area and I'm tired of retail/sales jobs. I also really want to become a park ranger. I have a place to stay lined-up, and I could use the remainder of the house money to put down towards somewhere I really want to be where I can find a position in that career field. The major fear I have is ruining all of these plans with my aforementioned issues.  


Any insight or advice is completely welcome. If you need any more questions answered, I'm an open book.  


TL;DR - I can't focus on anything and my life keeps worsening because of it. I can't focus on bettering my life, keeping a career path, and finishing any level of education in college. If anyone has overcome something similar, please reach out and give me some advice, I would sincerely appreciate it.",21Apr2019,1

Since she hasn't I think she might need a mental health facility because she isn't making any sense and thinks all of this is normal.  I'm afraid she isn't ""mentally unstable"" enough for some of the facilities i've looked into but will still try.  I talked with her last year that she needs to get any job (retail or fast food) but she still only applies to high paying ones she used to have.  These forms of reasoning make me question her mental state. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please provide any advice with possible resources in the Dallas area or Nationwide. Also any advice on how to handle her, I'm afraid of helping and her wanting more and more, she has a history of being dependent. I don't make enough to live on my own but could help her some. I've tried helping her for the past 5 years and i'm almost at my wits end...",21Apr2019,1

Normally I would go hangout with friends and all that but I honestly don’t have any and I’m not just saying that... I want to get out of the house and do things so it distracts me from him but idk what to do.  I know I’m grieving and it’ll take time for me to get over him but he’s handling it so well himself .... he doesn’t seem to be struggling at all that I’m gone because he has his own friends to see and talk to but I don’t. I’m also now trying to plan out my future with him no longer in it and it’s so hard for me because I planned everything around him and now I don’t know how to be independent.

699,"I feel like my friend is getting abusive, but I can't be sure and I just want help

Just to be sure she doesn't yell at me, I'll nickname that best friend Ya

&amp;#x200B;

I met Ya three years ago, on a stream I made myself.

She told me about a social media we both had, so I followed her, and it all started

&amp;#x200B;

The beginning was normal, at that time I was a ""quirky gal xDxDxD"" 

I would spam her a lot, ""act drunk"", and force her to go into do not disturb mode, which would make her miss calls from her friends

Thankfully, I quickly changed, and our friendship was normal again

&amp;#x200B;

Until last year, things were pretty normal. Our friendship was okay, she was having problems with her other friends and I tried to help

I can't quite remember how it started, but she got jealous of anything, and I mean anything 

And, at first, it was scaring me 

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I made her really jealous was on christmas

I hope I'll forget this one day cause this shit made me scared of losing people for nothing, but here's how it went

&amp;#x200B;

We spent Christmas at my grandma's, and when we got home I bragged to her about my presents, yknow, like a normal kid would've 

She cried 

She cried because of one thing I had

&amp;#x200B;

And it wasn't real crying it was edgy crying like ""I'll just go to bed and wipe my tears now, good night""

&amp;#x200B;

From there it just spiraled down hill, but really slowly, so much that I didn't realize a lot of it 

&amp;#x200B;

And we kept fighting all the time, she kept getting away from me as if she hated me, and come back to apologize acting like I was the one not talking to her 

After all those fights, I lost interest

I just didn't care anymore

Not only for her, but also for any other relationships 

I didn't feel human anymore

&amp;#x200B;

She'd get sad/mad at me for nothing, run away crying then make me beg for her to come back 

&amp;#x200B;

In January, I made the mistake of getting a boyfriend

Mind this, I've been a single lady for almost all my life now, and the only other boy that ever loved me was only here for my body, so I was so happy 

Of course, Ya didn't like it 

&amp;#x200B;

The girl who wouldn't understand why her telling me about all her other friends hurt me was getting jealous over a boyfriend

She was jealous of him and me, and I can understand why, but she was so fucking horrible about it 

I was scared of telling her how I was overcoming my shyness and horrible self esteem thanks to him cause I knew she'd just get jealous as fuck instead of being just happy for me, or telling me to stop talking about him

&amp;#x200B;

Even after she stopped being jealous, we'd fight at least once a week, always over stupid things

One day it would be about leaving a fandom over a joke I made

Then it would be about me ""liking"" her husbando for the same joke 

&amp;#x200B;

And, last week, I thought it was finally over 

She had been trash talking my bf all day long, and when I snapped at her she said ""It's getting late, I'm not gonna do drama right now, sorry"" 

The next day, I didn't say anything

I didn't beg, like I already started to do before, 

Only now it was real

I wanted this to end

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, she apologized, and I just told her everything

I told her I couldn't take it anymore, that I couldn't keep up with her never listening to me, trash talking my boyfriend and then acting like a victim to life's horror

She cried

She cried, and acted as if our friendship was over

She told me to send her apologies to my boyfriend, and that if there was any OCs I gave her and that I wanted back I could have them 

&amp;#x200B;

I just politely said ""Huh, so our friendship is over?"" before calmly listing the OCs that would be mine again

And asking for a book I gave her long ago

I ended it by notifying her I wouldn't be around from 7:10 to 8:10pm 

&amp;#x200B;

7pm 

My phone rings

It's her

I think it's a miss click or something and wait a  second, but it doesn't stop 

So I answer, and I'm hit by a wall of frantic sobs and Ya pathetically telling me she didn't want me to leave

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to what she made me go through, I had no empathy left, and I was so hurt I was ready to laugh at her face and tell her to fuck off 

But then, after, again, being scared doing this would make me lose other friends and possibly my boyfriend, I told her it was okay, and that we wouldn't end our friendship there 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel disappointed in myself, and I feel like I should maybe end this friendship before it hurts me even more 

It already hurt my feelings, I know it's gonna hurt my couple because my boyfriend thinks he's the reason for the drama spike those days

I just don't know what to do anymore

700,"Hello, as you might see in the title I'm currently 16, and employed. I make about $400 a month with my job and I LOVE working. 

I have never really had money, I come from a poor family (now with more money and more stability thanks to my mom's new job) so I've always learned to never spend my money on anything fun, only necessities. 

Now that I have my own money, I really want to go out. There are many things that I enjoy, bowling, music, art, so I really want to go buy things for myself, or for experiences. For example a sakura festival (Japanese tradition), or go to a nice restaurant with my boyfriend. I love having experiences like that but they cost money. I HAVE the money to do it, but in a way I feel guilty because I feel like I should be just saving up and saving up. 

Would it be okay for me to enjoy the money I'm currently making? As in, go to expensive dates (never had the chance to do that before), go buy myself nice clothes, makeup, or art supplies, go to fun places.

I would also like to add, I don't really see a middle ground (I know there is) in which I save half of my paycheck. I know I could do this, but it becomes very hard for me and end up feeling even more guilty if I spend $1 of my ""non-touchable"" money. So I don't want to force myself to have a limit (even though secretly I will still have it, like minimum save $100 a month) but I don't know if that's enough to save and if I can just enjoy myself with the remaining $300. 

At the same time I don't know if $300 for fun is too much. Like I do like presents for friends (those are expensive as fuck) or like I want a prom dress, and I want to go to prom, and I want to do a million things but I'm not sure if I should be spending my money on it. Specially $300 dollars that I know other people would kill for. I feel extremely fortunate and guilty that I have the choice to enjoy myself.

TLDR: I (16f) am making money, I want to save up but I also really want to enjoy myself and have fun with the money I work hard for. Not sure what to do.",21Apr2019,1

The reason I want to reach out now is because even though I have no desire to rekindle old feelings, I would like to actually sit down and talk to this person who had such an impact on my life.

I am moving back because I can't afford living by my own. My parents are open to welcome me. But I'm an adult and I want to treat them fairly.

We have this great idea of calculating how much I will exactly add to their bills. But I'm not professionals like them, they also have busy lives/jobs... I'm moving and don't have a lot of friends. Can someone help me on what, or how to do this?

My father advised that I count each appliance I bring, down to the teeth, so it's all fair. Problem is, how do I even start?

- For water, I buy my own bottles ($6.99 a month) and rarely drink their water supplies. Sometimes I just get a bit of coffee from them but that is it

- I also limit my showers to only 5 minutes (I've learned to save by living alone)

- I have 4 LED lights in my room which are 6W=40W, they are two bulbs that I use 4-8 hours (I'm starting to study) and a lamp half lamp stand which is two 6W-40W bulbs ([G25 like this](https://www.amazon.com/Sunco-Lighting-Dimmable-Omnidirectional-Efficient/dp/B01N8SRZPG/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=round+led+bulb&amp;qid=1555888708&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1))

708,"I'm almost finished my first year in college studying physics and I still have the same question circling in my head that I did when I chose this college course; Science, or Art? I am a very talented artist since a young age and I have made some (if i do say so myself) really great artwork. I also am quite brainy and have had a huge interest in science since I was young too. I seriously considered studying Art at third level but trying to balance the pros and cons of studying art or science created a fork in the road for me. In the end I chose to study physics because although I can work on my art outside college, studying science myself without any guidance or structure would be near impossible. But even the thought of now missing out on being able to spill all my imagination out at college if I had studied art is making question if I have made the right choice. However I feel as though I would be asking myself the same question but directing towards missing out on challenging my brain and studying physics if I had chose to study art.

714,"I (25m) broke up with my ex(23f) after deciding I needed to leave our toxic relationship after 3 1/2 years. For about 3 weeks she wanted me to take her back but I refused, one day we were arguing and things got physical and by that I mean she beat my ass. It’s hard to admit because I’m a 6’3 black guy and she’s 5’9 white woman.

Throughout our relationship whenever we’d get into heated shouting matches she would either start hitting me if not cut herself or put holes in our dry wall. I put up with for years but I eventually had enough and ended our relationship. So this last physical altercation she left scratches and bruising, I told her to leave me alone and to stay out of my life.

Next day her dad calls me threatening me with physical violence and the police saying that she told him I beat her. I immediately went to the police told them in detail of what happened and was granted a restraining order against her. 

Later I felt bad so I dropped the charges and restraining order so as to not make her life harder for her (she has theft charges that make it difficult for her to find jobs so I didn’t want to make it worse). I thought it was over with but I began hearing from people that she has been telling them I beat her and that she has also posted on Snapchat that I beat her and showed bruises. 

She blocked me on all social media and changed her number so the only way I could contact her was email. I asked her about what I’ve been hearing and she said that she was not telling people that. And that her bruises were because of some women who fought her at a bar. 

I believed her and left it alone but it started to get out of hand so I reached out to her asking if it would be okay for me to post a screenshot of our emails where it will show her staying the rumors are not true, she never responded.
About week later with no response I got tired of waiting and posted the screen shots any way. After posting them one of her friends messaged me and told me it was my ex who was saying these things and was making it out to like that I have been physically abusive to her. 

Her father also texted me demanding that I take my post down because people were harassing her and that he would hold me responsible for anything that happens to her(keep in my mind post said nothing negative about her, it was just to stop the rumors).

It’s been almost 4 months and more people have come to tell me that she has been telling them that I beat her, I have no physical like text messages or anything to prove she is saying this just people telling me that she told them. 

I don’t know what to do anymore we live in the south and a rumor like that can get you killed if not seriously harmed. It won’t put me in prison because I have the evidence that it’s not true but I’m still afraid for my safety and well being.

He video called yesterday and showed him the wrapped gifts he had for him, how excited he was to see him. He's supposed to be here at 5pm. Last night he texted around 11:30pm-12.00am to say he was in the next state over and was about 11 hours away. I was asleep and didn't respond. Two things could have happened, he could have parked and slept through the night, got a hotel, or drove through the night. I'm thinking he stopped but don't know.

I texted him this morning, have called him, no answer. He hasn't contacted me all day. This is unusual...at first I was thinking he was just driving and didn't hear the phone but the car has bluetooth, the music would have shut off and played the ringer through the speaker. I realize it's still early-ish and it's not late enough to really start worrying but it got me thinking about what to do if he doesn't show up. It's unlikely he decided not to come and then lied and said he was in another state. Again, it's strange hasn't responded all day. My son keeps trying to call him. 

Let's say he doesn't show up. What do I do? There are so many hospitals along the highway spanning two states, do I just call all of them? He only has two family members that are spread out and wouldn't know anything. But should I contact them after a while and ask if any hospitals called them? But I don't want to freak them out for no reason either. And I don't have their phone numbers, it would be a fb message. Do I call the police? How long do I wait before it's reasonable to do so? Will they be understanding about me being worried about a grown man in his 40's? 

Or if something did happen like an accident and he's not ""missing"" (which would obviously be the more likely scenario)is the best thing for me to do is just wait until someone inevitably contacts me? My stomach feels sick just thinking about it....
